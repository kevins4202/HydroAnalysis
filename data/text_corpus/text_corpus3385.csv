radical chlorine monoxide radical dichloride radical superoxide radical water treatment 1 introduction in recent decades tremendous attention has been directed towards the development and application of advanced oxidation processes aops for degradation of trace organic contaminants during waste water treatment and reuse lee et al 2020 miklos et al 2018b o shea and dionysiou 2012 von gunten 2018 such aops comprise a wide variety of approaches including uv irradiation hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 uv free available chlorine uv fac with fac comprising predominantly hypochlorous acid hocl and its conjugate base hypochlorite ocl uv monochloramine uv nh2cl uv ozone uv o3 o3 h2o2 o3 h2o2 photo fenton and photo fenton like processes radiolysis sonolysis various semiconductor photocatalysis processes and an array of persulfate based processes lee et al 2020 li et al 2020 miklos et al 2018b o shea and dionysiou 2012 von gunten 2018 in all of these approaches hydroxyl radical ho is a key and often the key oxidant responsible for contaminant oxidation with ho reacting non selectively and having high second order rate constants for reactions with most organic and many inorganic contaminants while many of the aops noted can yield highly effective contaminant degradation they often require specialized capital and energy intensive infrastructure for example arrays of low or medium pressure hg vapor lamps for uv driven processes or in the case of o3 driven processes high capacity o3 generators often accompanied by extensive equipment for liquid or gas phase o2 handling and or purification and post treatment o3 destruction miklos et al 2018b oturan and aaron 2014 rakness 2005 stefan 2017 many such aops are also subject to various physical chemical constraints on process efficiency for example hydrodynamics and spatial heterogeneity in light intensity in the case of uv driven processes hydrodynamics and mass transfer limitations on gas phase o3 dissolution into solution for o3 driven processes mass transfer limitations on contaminant transport to interfacial reactive sites for heterogeneous photocatalysis processes and low ph requirements in the case of many photo fenton and photo fenton like approaches oturan and aaron 2014 rakness 2005 stefan 2017 for a process to improve upon the suite of available aop options desirable attributes would include the potential to operate with minimal additional infrastructure low cost and energy consumption homogeneous reaction chemistry or at least minimal mass transfer limitations and high efficiency at circumneutral ph one approach that could satisfy many of these criteria involves generation of ho from the homogeneous aqueous phase reaction of superoxide radical o2 with hypochlorous acid hocl eq 1 candeias et al 1993 long and bielski 1980 1 hocl o2 cl ho o2 k 1 7 5 106 m 1s 1 long and bielski 1980 as indicated by eq 1 the reaction occurs specifically between hocl and o2 while the reactions of ho2 with hocl and ocl and of o2 with ocl are negligible in comparison to eq 1 long and bielski 1980 the apparent kinetics for the reaction of ho2 o2 comprising the sum of o2 and its conjugate acid hydroperoxyl ho2 with fac hereafter referred to as the o2 fac reaction for convenience therefore depend strongly on ph this ph dependence can be described by eq 2 2 k app o 2 fac k 1 α o 2 α hocl k 1 k a ho 2 h k a ho 2 h h k a hocl where k app o 2 fac represents the ph dependent apparent second order rate constant for the o2 fac reaction at 25 c and k a ho 2 10 4 8 bielski et al 1985 and k a hocl 10 7 5 morris 1966 represent the acid base dissociation constants for the equilibria ho2 h o2 and hocl h ocl respectively as shown in fig 1 the theoretical k app o 2 fac increases from 2 4 m 1s 1 at ph 14 to a maximum of 6 9 106 m 1s 1 at ph 6 2 with rate constants in excess of 106 m 1s 1 from ph 6 8 long and bielski 1980 in addition to ho the o2 fac reaction may lead to the formation of various reactive chlorine species rcs including chlorine monoxide radical clo hydroxidochlorate radical hocl chlorine radical cl and dichloride radical cl2 eqs 3 9 3 hocl ho clo h2o k 3 1 2 109 m 1s 1 bulman

kläning and wolff 1985 k 9r 1 1 105 s 1 jayson et al 1973 such rcs can also contribute substantially to degradation of organic contaminants especially those containing electron rich functional groups fang et al 2014 kong et al 2018 lei et al 2019 sun et al 2016 while the o2 fac reaction has long been recognized as a potential source of ho in biological systems candeias et al 1993 long and bielski 1980 and has recently been identified as an important driver of radical pathways in the oxidation of phenols and hydroquinones by fac rodríguez and von gunten 2020 and in a newly reported approach to photocatalytic fac activation cheng et al 2020 it has otherwise received relatively little attention as a possible basis for an aop this is perhaps mainly due to the instability of o2 and ho2 under circumneutral ph conditions on account of their rapid disproportionation to h2o2 and its conjugate base hydroperoxide ho2 in aqueous solution eqs 10 12 10 ho2 ho2 h2o2 o2 k 10 8 3 105 m 1s 1 bielski

depend strongly on ph where this ph dependence can be described by eq 13 13 k app ho 2 o 2 dp k 10 α ho 2 2 k 11 α ho 2 α o 2 k 10 h h k a ho 2 2 k 11 h h k a ho 2 k a ho 2 h k a ho 2 with k app ho 2 o 2 dp representing the ph dependent apparent second order rate constant for the overall disproportionation reaction as shown in fig 1 eqs 10 11 lead to extremely rapid decay of ho2 o2 at circumneutral ph bielski et al 1985 however as apparent from eqs 12 13 stability of ho2 o2 increases significantly with increasing ph fig 1 so that aqueous o2 stock solutions with lifetimes of several minutes or longer can be prepared at ph 12 and then dosed to fac containing waters at lower ph opening the door to their use in harnessing eq 1 for contaminant oxidation the low value of k app o 2 fac at ph 12 fig 1 affords the added possibility of premixing alkaline o2 fac solutions that can then be activated by dosing to lower ph waters effectively providing stock solutions of ho and rcs numerous options for o2 preparation have been reported including electrochemical enzymatic sonolytic radiolytic and photochemical methods as well as dissolution of o2 salts typically potassium superoxide ko2 hayyan et al 2016 although many of these require specialized equipment and or organic solvents or additives that would hinder use of the resulting stock solutions in an aop certain photochemical approaches and ko2 dissolution can yield high μm to mm o2 concentrations in fully aqueous solution at ph 11 heller and croot 2011 holroyd and bielski 1978 with the use of o2 stocks at such concentrations the o2 fac reaction could provide a convenient and widely accessible ho source especially considering the already widespread use of fac in waste water treatment leong et al 2008 usepa 1999 the present work examines o2 fac reaction chemistry and highlights the potential for its application in waste water treatment by i developing experimental procedures enabling manipulation of the o2 fac reaction via controlled blending of aqueous o2 and fac stock solutions ii quantifying molar yields of ho and cumulative in situ exposures 0 t radical d t for ho and rcs from the o2 fac reaction iii evaluating approaches for optimizing organic contaminant degradation via the o2 fac reaction under various conditions and in various water matrixes including natural waters and iv quantifying

suppliers were typically of 98 purity and were used without further purification see table s1 for a list of chemicals with suppliers and purities details on preparation of general reagent stocks are provided in text s1 aqueous o2 stocks were prepared by a dissolution of ko2 solids b uv irradiation of alkaline h2o2 ho2 or c o3 treatment of alkaline h2o2 ho2 text s2 o2 stocks applied in o2 fac treatment experiments were generally prepared by dissolving ko2 in 1m naoh unless otherwise indicated and were stable for several minutes with increasing stability at lower ho2 o2 consistent with eqs 10 12 for details see text s2 tables s3 s4 fig s4 ko2 derived o2 stocks in 1m naoh were typically prepared to contain ho2 o2 stock 1000 μm at the time of dosing to receiving solutions due to ho2 o2 disproportionation eqs 10 11 such stocks inevitably also contained h2o2 ho2 typically at concentrations of h2o2 ho2 stock 3500 μm the stocks were dosed to receiving solutions at dilution factors ranging from 1 50 to 1 5 stock volume added final receiving solution volume yielding in situ ho2 o2 20 200 μm and h2o2 ho2 70 700 μm in the o2 fac treated receiving solutions ko2 derived o2 stocks in 0 05m naoh were typically prepared to contain ho2 o2 stock 2000 μm and h2o2 ho2 stock 6000 μm and dosed to receiving solutions at dilution factors from 1 40 to 1 10 yielding in situ ho2 o2 50 200 μm and h2o2 ho2 150 600 μm in the o2 fac treated receiving solutions uv derived o2 stocks in a 0 05 m naoh were typically prepared to contain ho2 o2 stock 900 μm and h2o2 ho2 stock 11 mm at the time of dosing to receiving solutions while those in b 0 0316m naoh were prepared to contain ho2 o2 stock 500 μm and h2o2 ho2 stock 5 mm figs s5 and s6 show respective profiles for o2 generation during uv irradiation of h2o2 ho2 and o2 decay following removal of irradiated h2o2 ho2 solutions from the uv light source the stocks were dosed to receiving solutions at dilution factors ranging from a 1 36 to 1 9 or b 1 20 to 1 5 respectively yielding in situ ho2 o2 25 100 and h2o2 ho2 0 25 1 2 mm in the o2 fac treated final solutions o2 stocks generated by o3 treatment of alkaline h2o2 ho2 were not used for o2 fac treatment due to the relatively low ho2 o2 stock levels resulting from this approach fig s7 2 2 o2 fac treatment procedures o2 fac treatment experiments were undertaken by either i dosing various volumes of alkaline o2 stocks to 5mm or 50mm phosphate or borate buffered solutions ph 7 10 containing fac and radical probes or in some cases tert butanol t buoh hereafter referred to as postmix treatment or ii premixing alkaline o2 with alkaline fac and then dosing various volumes of premixed alkaline o2 fac stocks to 5mm or 50mm ph 7 phosphate buffered solutions or natural waters containing radical probes or other additives e g h2o2 suwannee river natural organic matter srnom or bromide hereafter referred to as premix treatment o2 stocks for postmix dosing and o2 fac stocks for premix dosing were generally prepared in 0 1m or 1m naoh to stabilize o2 and fac text s2 in accord with the slow kinetics of o2 disproportionation and the o2 fac reaction at ph 13 fig 1 o2 and premixed o2 fac stocks were utilized as soon as possible after preparation typically within 0 5 5 minutes to minimize reactant losses before dosing to receiving solutions o2 or o2 fac stocks were dosed into receiving solutions simultaneously with a stoichiometric amount of h2so4 to neutralize oh and ensure the desired in situ ph typically 7 with selected experiments at 8 9 and 10 in receiving solutions all o2 o2 fac and h2so4 additions were conducted under rapid mixing with receiving solutions agitated using ptfe coated magnetic stir bars all initial concentrations of t buoh radical probes ho2 o2 h2o2 ho2 fac or other solution constituents reported herein were the initial values in solution after dosing all reactants accounting for dilution due to blending reactants many experiments were conducted using a single dose of o2 or premixed o2 fac stocks henceforth referred to as single dose or single dosing experiments in a number of experiments a given receiving solution was repeatedly dosed with o2 or premixed o2 fac stocks at fixed concentrations and stoichiometric ratios with samples collected for analyses of probe compounds and other analytes after each dosing step henceforth referred to as multiple dose or multiple dosing experiments following addition of o2 or premixed o2 fac stocks to receiving solutions the treated receiving solutions were allowed to sit for at least 10 minutes to ensure completion of reactions details of methods used in certain cases to remove residual h2o2 ho2 or fac from reaction solutions after or between o2 and o2 fac dosing in addition to procedures for dbp formation experiments are provided in text s3 2 3 analytical methods full details of methods used for measurements of ph ho2 o2 h2o2 ho2 oxyhalides trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas and for identification and quantification of ho and rcs during o2 fac treatment are provided in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization and application of o2 fac treatment 3 1 1 confirmation of radical formation from the o2 fac reaction i probe compound degradation ph 7 50mm phosphate buffer solutions containing 1 μm nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmb and or para chlorobenzoic acid pcba were subjected to single dose postmix o2 fac treatment with increasing ho2 o2 0 20 50 100 200 μm and fac 0 10 25 50 100 μm at a fixed 2 1 molar ho2 o2 0 fac 0 ratio nb reacts rapidly only with ho of the radicals relevant to the o2 fac reaction buxton et al 1988 nowell and hoigné 1992 watts and linden 2007 while ba reacts rapidly with ho and cl buxton et al 1988 mártire et al 2001 and dmb reacts rapidly with ho cl clo and likely also cl2 alfassi et al 1988 alfassi et al 1989 o neill et al 1975 ho exposures were measured based on nb degradation during treatment and rcs exposures estimated based on degradation of ba and dmb according to procedures described in text s5 pcba which reacts rapidly with ho neta and dorfman 1968 and presumably also cl considering its structural similarity to ba though no rate constant appears to be available for this reaction was used as a non specific radical probe in some preliminary experiments as shown in fig 2 increasing probe losses were observed when jointly increasing ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 in contrast none of the probes were degraded in solutions treated separately with ho2 o2 or fac confirming that probe degradation was not due to direct reactions with ho2 o2 or fac direct reactions with h2o2 ho2 could also be ruled out on the basis of the treatments with ho2 o2 in the absence of fac as o2 stocks also contained h2o2 ho2 at levels yielding h2o2 ho2 0 70 700 μm in the receiving solutions fig 2 furthermore no probe losses were observed in the presence of fac dosed with h2o2 ho2 0 250 μm fig 2 confirming probe degradation during o2 fac treatment was not due to singlet oxygen 1o2 generated from reaction of fac with h2o2 ho2 eq s13 finally no probe losses were observed during postmix o2 fac treatment in the presence of 50mm t buoh which was sufficient to yield 93 scavenging of ho and as a consequence block the formation of rcs since in this system rcs are secondary radicals generated from ho via eqs 3 9 which would have been precluded due to scavenging of ho by t buoh fig 2 text s7 thus probe degradation during o2 fac treatment could be attributed to ho and or rcs degradation of the ho selective probe nb during o2 fac treatment in conjunction with the lack of nb or other probe degradation during o2 fac treatment in the presence of t buoh point to ho as a key driver of probe degradation under the conditions evaluated consistent with eq 1 however trends in nb ba and dmb degradation indicate that rcs also play an important role as discussed in section 3 1 2 ii and texts s5 and s8 consistent with eqs 3 9 ii hydroxyterephthalate htpa formation from terephthalate tpa tpa is known to yield htpa upon reaction with ho page et al 2010 text s4 when dosed with increasing ho2 o2 0 during single dose postmix treatment solutions containing tpa 0 10 μm and fac 0 50 μm at ph 7 yielded increasing htpa levels fig s8 in contrast htpa formation was not observed in such solutions without ho2 o2 addition fig s8 or in fac free controls treated with ho2 o2 0 25 μm also including h2o2 ho2 0 200 μm data not shown these observations further highlight the role of ho as a key oxidant during o2 fac treatment iii formaldehyde generation from t buoh the reaction of t buoh with ho to yield formaldehyde can be used as a means of quantifying ho yields in various oxidation processes flyunt et al 2003 schuchmann and von sonntag 1979 when dosed with increasing ho2 o2 0 during single dose postmix treatment solutions containing t buoh 0 50 mm and fac 0 50 100 or 250 μm at ph 7 yielded increasing formaldehyde levels at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 below 1 with formaldehyde levels plateauing as ho2 o2 0 fac 0 exceeded 1 fig s9 this likely reflects increasing conversion of fac 0 to ho at sub stoichiometric ho2 o2 0 with full conversion of fac 0 and maximum ho yield reached at stoichiometric or higher concentrations of ho2 o2 0 i e at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 1 note that contributions of rcs to formaldehyde formation can be neglected as ho is the precursor of the rcs and its scavenging by t buoh would have precluded rcs formation via eqs 3 9 in these experiments t buoh 0 50 mm would have been sufficient to scavenge 90 of ho except at the highest ho2 o2 0 applied at which f ho the fraction of total generated ho scavenged by t buoh would have been equal to 0 88 fig s9 text s7 based on a reported molar yield of 25 for formaldehyde formation from reaction of ho with t buoh flyunt et al 2003 schuchmann and von sonntag 1979 and an apparent plateau value of 0 2 mol formaldehyde formed mol fac consumed in fig s9 an estimated yield of 0 8 mol ho formed mol fac consumed was obtained for the o2 fac reaction under the conditions applied here this is lower than the theoretical yield of 1 mol ho mol fac eq 1 and may represent an underestimate due to a uncertainties in formaldehyde yield from t buoh in the presence of oxidants other than ho flyunt et al 2003 and or b inhibition of formaldehyde formation by reaction of excess ho2 o2 with the primary peroxyl radical formed in reaction of ho with t buoh schuchmann and von sonntag 1979 3 1 2 effects of o2 fac treatment conditions on radical exposures and probe degradation i effects of ph little variation in pcba degradation was observed during o2 fac treatment at ph 7 8 9 and 10 fig s10 the small apparent decrease in pcba degradation at ph 7 may have been attributable to a a higher ratio of k app ho 2 o 2 dp relative to k app o 2 fac leading to increased loss of ho2 o2 via disproportionation eqs 10 11 and or b a shift in speciation from hocl to ocl pk a 7 5 morris 1966 leading to increased scavenging of ho by the latter eqs 3 4 although subsequent discussion focuses on o2 fac treatment at ph 7 these findings indicate comparable effectiveness could be achievable at other ph values ii effects of ho2 o2 0 fac 0 and absolute values of ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 due to a the dependence of ho yield on ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 and b the rapid reactions of ho with fac and ho2 o2 eqs 3 4 and 14 15 respectively 14 ho ho2 h2o o2 k 14 7 1 109 m 1s 1 sehested et al 1968 15 ho o2 oh o2 k 15 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 sehested et al 1968 both relative and absolute concentrations of h o 2 o 2 0 and fac 0 may influence probe degradation and radical exposures 0 t radical dt during o2 fac treatment nb ba dmb and pcba degradation were in turn evaluated over a range of h o 2 o 2 0 and fac 0 at h o 2 o 2 0 fac 0 ranging from 0 2 7 5 in order to evaluate resulting variations in 0 t radical d t and identify optimal o2 fac treatment conditions as shown in figs 3 and s11 in single dose postmix experiments the extents of nb ba dmb and pcba degradation expressed here as change in probe compound concentration normalized to initial probe compound concentration or δ probe probe 0 where probe nb ba dmb or pcba increased with increasing ho2 o2 0 fac 0 up to maxima at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 2 beyond which δ probe probe 0 decreased with increasing ho2 o2 0 fac 0 furthermore when holding ho2 o2 0 fac 0 fixed at 2 δ probe probe 0 generally increased as ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 were increased in tandem up to 200 and 100 μm respectively beyond which further increases in ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 appeared to yield diminishing improvement fig 3 and s11 the observed maximal levels of δ probe probe 0 for single dosing of h o 2 o 2 0 200 μ m and fac 0 100 μ m translated to calculated exposures of 2 3 10 10 m s for both 0 t h o d t and 0 t cl o cl 2 d t and 10 11 m s for 0 t c l d t though with wider ranges apparent for clo cl2 and cl due in part to greater uncertainties in the small changes in probe concentrations from which these latter exposures were determined furthermore it is important to note that the values of 0 t radical d t determined here do not account for uncertainties associated with the rate constants used in their determination see text s5 for rate constants as the lack of reported error bounds for most of the associated rate constants precludes quantification of such uncertainties they are thus most appropriately interpreted as estimates rather than exact values of 0 t radical d t similar to ho yields ho exposures and δ probe probe 0 increased with increasing ho2 o2 0 fac 0 up to a maximum however maximal ho exposures and δ probe probe 0 were observed at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 2 rather than at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 1 as in the case ho yields this likely reflects a combination of increasing fac conversion to ho via eq 1 as ho2 o2 0 is increased coupled with consumption of ho2 o2 by ho eqs 14 15 without the presence of 50mm t buoh to block eqs 14 15 as in the yield measurements they would divert available ho2 o2 away from eq 1 in turn raising the ho2 o2 0 fac 0 ratio required for full conversion of fac by ho2 o2 the observed decrease in ho exposures and δ probe probe 0 at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 2 likely reflects increasing scavenging of ho by excess ho2 o2 via eqs 14 15 as ho2 o2 0 fac 0 is further increased beyond the optimum ratio the observed trends in clo cl2 and cl exposures vs ho2 o2 0 fac 0 fig 3 can be similarly explained as each rcs ultimately originates from ho via eqs 3 9 based on these findings a ratio of ho2 o2 0 fac 0 2 was selected for use in most subsequent experiments in addition to the ho and rcs exposure optimum at h o 2 o 2 0 fac 0 2 and the general increase in ho exposure with increasing ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 at fixed h o 2 o 2 0 fac 0 2 it is noteworthy that clo cl2 exposures and their relative contributions to degradation of the clo cl2 reactive probe dmb generally increased with increasing fac 0 up to an apparent maximum at fac 0 75 μm figs 3 and s12 this is likely attributable to increasing formation of clo and or cl2 via eqs 3 9 with increasing fac 0 and associated background cl 0 in fac stocks up to 75 μm beyond which disproportionation of clo and or cl2 eqs 16 17 may predominate 16 cl o cl o h 2 o cl o 2 oc l 2 h k 16 2 5 109 m 1s 1 kläning and wolff 1985 17 cl2 cl2 cl2 2cl k 17 3 5 109 m 1s 1 yu 2004 the increasing importance of clo cl2 relative to ho at higher fac 0 and potential formation of clo2 a regulated dbp via eq 16 suggest that there may be benefit to implementing o2 fac treatment at lower fac 0 if possible as discussed in section 3 1 2 iv iii postmix versus premix dosing of o2 and fac all results discussed to this point were obtained by adding alkaline o2 stocks to buffered receiving solutions containing probes and fac postmix dosing as noted in section 2 2 it is also possible to prepare relatively stable t 1 2 o2 fac 60 s premixed o2 and fac stocks at ph 13 this can simplify o2 fac treatment by enabling addition of premixed o2 fac to receiving solutions as a single stock with rapid conversion of the stock to ho and rcs at the lower ph of the receiving solution premix dosing this has the added benefit of preventing heterogeneities in ho2 o2 0 fac 0 that may result from non ideal mixing of separate o2 and fac solutions during postmix dosing a comparison of results for postmix and premix dosing at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 200 μm 100 μm is shown in fig 4 see the two groups of measurements designated by red 1 100 μm labels as apparent from the figure postmix and premix dosing yielded similar radical exposures and levels of δ probe probe 0 confirming the utility of the premix dosing approach iv single dose versus multiple dose o2 fac treatment as noted in section 3 1 2 ii increased radical exposures and contaminant degradation may be achievable by implementing o2 fac treatment at lower fac 0 and ho2 o2 0 due to consequent decreases in ho scavenging by fac eqs 3 4 and ho2 o2 eqs 14 15 this may also lead to decreased ho scavenging by h2o2 ho2 eqs s6 s9 associated with o2 stocks one means of undertaking such an approach is to dose o2 and fac repeatedly or continuously at lower concentrations multiple dosing rather than once at higher concentrations single dosing to investigate this δ probe probe 0 levels and radical exposures were measured when applying o2 and fac via several multiple dose postmix treatment approaches a twice at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 100 μm 50 μm henceforth designated as 2 50 μm with the 50 μm referring to applied fac 0 b four times at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 50 μm 25 μm i e 4 25 μm and c ten times at h o 2 o 2 0 fac 0 20 μm 10 μm i e 10 10 μm receiving solutions were treated with catalase after each o2 dosing step to completely remove h2o2 ho2 derived from o2 stocks and fac was then added into the receiving solutions for the subsequent step without h2o2 ho2 quenching beforehand fac added to the receiving solutions would have first been consumed via the direct reaction with h2o2 ho2 eq s13 the removal of residual h2o2 ho2 between o2 dosing steps was thus necessary to enable the use of postmix o2 dosing which requires the presence of fac in receiving solutions prior to o2 addition measurements obtained from these multiple dose postmix treatments were then compared to measurements obtained when applying o2 and fac via single dose postmix treatment at h o 2 o 2 0 fac 0 200 μm 100 μm i e 1 100 μm in all four cases the total cumulative levels of ho2 o2 0 tot and fac 0 tot applied summed to 200 μm and 100 μm respectively as shown in fig 4 increased 0 t h o d t and δ probe probe 0 were observed when applying lower ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 in multiple doses to achieve the same cumulative ho2 o2 0 tot and fac 0 tot levels as in a single dose in general higher 0 t h o and δ probe probe 0 were observed at lower h o 2 o 2 0 and fac 0 with 0 t h o d t and δ probe probe 0 for the single and multiple dosing approaches ranked in the order 10 10 μm 4 25 μm 2 50 μm 1 100 μm figs 4 and s13 the effects of multiple dosing on 0 t cl o cl 2 and 0 t c l d t were less clear due to higher uncertainties associated with these values fig 4 it is important to note that the use of catalase as a h2o2 ho2 quenching agent is not likely to be practical for water wastewater treatment as a more practical alternative the removal of h2o2 ho2 can also be achieved simply by reaction with excess fac eq s13 to investigate this further multiple dose postmix experiments were undertaken in which fac was added to receiving solutions between o2 dosing steps at concentrations sufficient to consume all h2o2 ho2 while also leaving a desired level of fac residual for subsequent reactions with o2 analogous results were obtained when applying 4 25 μm multiple dose postmix treatment with h2o2 ho2 quenched by fac instead of catalase after each dosing step though 0 t h o d t and δ probe probe 0 levels were somewhat lower than when using catalase for h2o2 ho2 quenching fig 4 this may reflect the presence of higher levels of background ho scavengers e g cl eqs 5 9 originating from fac stocks due to use of elevated fac concentrations to quench h2o2 ho2 see section 3 2 below for discussion of maximal expected cl concentrations following quenching of h2o2 ho2 with fac experiments using pcba as a probe and fac to quench h2o2 ho2 yielded similar results fig s14 additional experiments were undertaken to investigate the use of premixed o2 fac stocks in multiple dosing approaches as observed for postmix treatment 4 25 μm multiple dose premix treatment yielded increased 0 t h o d t and δ probe probe 0 compared to 1 100 μm single dose premix treatment when h2o2 ho2 was quenched with catalase after each dosing step fig 4 however lower 0 t h o d t and δ probe probe 0 were observed when h2o2 ho2 was not quenched after each dosing step fig 4 likely due to ho scavenging by h2o2 ho2 as discussed in more detail below v effects of h2o2 ho2 0 due to ho2 o2 disproportionation eqs 10 11 h2o2 ho2 was always present in o2 stocks as h2o2 ho2 can scavenge ho eqs s6 s9 and rcs eqs 18 19 it may in turn lower ho and rcs exposures during o2 fac treatment 18 cl h2o2 ho2 cl h k 18 2 109 m 1s 1 yu 2004 19 cl2 h2o2 ho2 2cl h k 19 105 106 m 1s 1 yu 2004 to investigate this probe degradation was examined during premix dosing of ho2 o2 0 fac 0 200 μm 100 μm to phosphate buffer pre amended with varying h2o2 ho2 0 measured ho and clo cl2 exposures

findings suggest that a minimizing h2o2 ho2 formation within o2 stocks which could also lead to improved stability of o2 text s2 and or b undertaking o2 fac treatment at lower total ho2 o2 0 as discussed in section 3 1 2 iv may enable further increases in ho and rcs exposures and contaminant degradation vi effects of dissolved organic matter dom and application to natural waters to investigate the influence of dom on ho and rcs exposures probe degradation was examined by premix dosing of o2 fac to a phosphate buffer amended with varying concentrations of srnom and b two natural water samples collected from a local reservoir and lake washington see table s2 for key water quality parameters as shown in fig 5 radical exposures and δ probe probe 0 were greater at higher ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 but inhibited by increasing doc concentrations this is consistent with the anticipated scavenging of ho cl clo and cl2 by dom brigante et al 2014 fang et al 2014 lei et al 2019 rosario ortiz et al 2008 westerhoff et al 2007 wu et al 2017 contributions of phosphate species to scavenging were negligible text s9 nevertheless these findings demonstrate that relatively high ho and rcs exposures and contaminant degradation can still be achieved over doc concentration ranges representative of drinking waters and potable reuse 3 1 3 disinfection byproduct formation i oxyhalides clo2 clo3 clo4 and bro3 were monitored in solutions containing 200 μgbr l during single and multiple dose postmix and premix o2 fac treatment as shown in fig 6 only clo2 and clo3 were formed in treated samples at concentrations above limits of quantification and at no more than 25 μg l far below the maximum contaminant levels mcls and health reference levels hrls for clo2 and clo3 note that concentrations in fig 6a have been corrected for background levels in fac stocks usepa 2016a 2020 relatively little difference was observed whether using postmix or premix treatment mass balances on concentrations of cl formed in these samples confirmed that nearly all 99 6 of the fac applied during o2 fac treatment under these conditions reacts to cl and that only traces of fac are consumed via oxidation to higher oxidation states this is further supported by the absence of detectable clo2 in o2 fac treated solutions which would be expected if substantial proportions of fac were oxidized to clo2 or higher states alfassi et al 1988 ii thms and haas formation of thms and haas was monitored in solutions containing 2 mgc l of srnom and 200 μgbr l during a single and multiple dose premix o2 fac treatment and b following post chlorination of the o2 fac treated samples to ct fac 400 mgcl2 l min all o2 fac treated samples were separated into two sub volumes one for direct thm haa analyses and the other for thm haa analyses after post chlorination results from these experiments in addition to those from control samples subjected to chlorination alone for comparison are shown in fig 6 single and multiple dose o2 fac treatment led to limited direct formation of tthm or haa5 no more than 5 15 μg l in either case following post chlorination of o2 fac treated samples concentrations reached 60 70 μg l for tthms and 25 35 μg l for haa5 compared to 52 7 μg l for tthms and 24 2 μg l for haa5 in control samples subjected to chlorination alone fig 6 notably thm haa levels generated during multiple dose o2 fac treatment were higher than observed during single dose treatment with increasing levels formed during each dosing step in the multiple dose experiments this is consistent with the higher overall ho and rcs exposures observed during multiple versus single dose treatment figs 4 and s13 and may be due in part to direct dom halogenation by rcs as discussed in prior work on fac based aops bulman and remucal 2020 young et al 2018 in contrast higher tthm levels following post chlorination were observed in samples initially subjected to single dose o2 fac treatment this latter observation may reflect a net increase of fac reactive thm precursor moieties in dom e g via ho and or rcs driven hydroxylation of aromatic moieties when subjected to the ho and rcs exposures prevailing during single dose treatment whereas the higher ho and rcs exposures prevailing during multiple dose treatment may have led to more extensive dom processing and a net decrease in fac reactive precursor moieties e g via ho and or rcs driven degradation of aromatic and aliphatic moieties to more highly oxidized products as reported for various aops ike et al 2019a ike et al 2019b although neither tthm nor haa5 levels exceeded usepa mcls usepa 2020 these findings indicate the potential for increased thm haa formation in o2 fac treatment particularly following post chlorination and should be investigated further as part of continued research into potential applications of this approach for advanced oxidation 3 2 practical implications this work highlights the potential for applying the o2 fac reaction eq 1 as the basis for a novel non photochemical approach to advanced oxidation with the capability to rapidly generate high ho and rcs levels for organic contaminant degradation at circumneutral ph and under homogenous conditions the ho and rcs exposures achieved during o2 fac treatment up to 5 10 10 m s for ho 10 9 m s for clo cl2 and 10 11 m s for cl are comparable to those observed in several of the aops most commonly applied in waste water treatment and reuse including uv h2o2 10 11 10 9 m s for ho miklos et al 2018a rosario ortiz et al 2010 rosenfeldt and linden 2007 rosenfeldt et al 2006 o3 h2o2 10 11 10 9 m s for ho acero and von gunten 2001 bourgin et al 2017 lee et al 2017 rosenfeldt et al 2006 and uv fac 10 11 10 9 10 8 10 6 10 12 10 10 and 10 13 10 11 m s for ho clo cl2 and cl respectively bulman et al 2019 chuang et al 2017 kong et al 2018 by preparing and standardizing aqueous o2 stocks under conditions of enhanced ho2 o2 stability ph 12 they can be easily handled and dosed to receiving solutions already containing fac this provides the option of utilizing o2 fac treatment as a means of generating a nearly instantaneous pulse or multiple pulses of ho and rcs in a post oxidation process following pre exposure to fac for disinfection or pre oxidation in much the same way that o3 h2o2 can be used to convert residual o3 to ho following a prior period of o3 exposure for disinfection or pre oxidation alternatively pre mixing of alkaline o2 and fac provides a unique option in which a combined o2 fac stock can be added directly to a water at circumneutral ph to generate a pulse of ho and rcs for advanced oxidation with the pre mixed o2 fac stock effectively serving as a ready made ho and rcs stock the use of such a pre mixing approach also presents the opportunity to apply o2 fac treatment without subjecting a water to pre chlorination with potential benefits for minimizing halogenated organic dbp formation and may enable application to waters containing high levels of matrix constituents that would normally prevent maintenance of an fac residual e g nh4 nh3 measurements of oxyhalide thm and haa formation show that direct production of regulated dbps is likely to be minimal during o2 fac treatment although o2 fac treatment does appear to lead to increased thm and haa formation during post chlorination as might be the case if o2 fac treatment is applied for pre oxidation of water that is then subjected to fac treatment for disinfection or distribution system residual maintenance this appears to be a trait shared by nearly all aops ike et al 2019a ike et al 2019b and may be manageable by minimizing post treatment fac exposures or by limiting treatment applications to waters containing low doc concentrations future investigations will be needed to evaluate potential impacts of o2 fac treatment on unregulated dbps in particular certain classes of nitrogenous and carbonaceous dbps now increasingly recognized for their potential health risks prasse et al 2018 richardson and plewa 2020 a potential barrier to implementation of o2 fac treatment derives from the high ph needed for o2 stock solutions and the consequent levels of acid necessary to neutralize the oh derived from the stock solutions upon dosing to receiving waters under the exploratory conditions used in many of the experiments described to this point the use of high h2so4 concentrations for naoh neutralization would lead to levels of residual so4 2 in substantial excess of the usepa secondary non enforceable drinking water mcl of 250 mg l as so4 2 in treated waters potentially leading to negative aesthetic and or gastrointestinal effects usepa 2003a b or to enhanced risks of corrosion in materials in contact with treated waters usepa 2016b yang et al 2014 this issue can potentially be addressed by 1 preparing o2 stocks in less alkaline naoh solutions to decrease the h2so4 concentration needed for neutralization and or 2 increasing the concentrations of o2 in the stocks to enable the use of smaller stock volumes and higher dilution factors also resulting in decreased h2so4 requirements a series of additional experiments was therefore undertaken in which o2 stocks were prepared from ko2 or uv irradiation of h2o2 ho2 under conditions selected to achieve elevated ho2 o2 concentrations at lower ph and used to degrade nb ba and dmb via single and multiple dose postmix o2 fac treatment with h2o2 quenched by fac in multiple dose experiments in so doing it was found that for ko2 derived o2 stocks the o2 yield and stability could be significantly improved by adding ko2 solids slowly to naoh solutions under rapid mixing rather than by addition of naoh to ko2 solids as was the case for most of the stocks prepared in this work see text s2 ko2 derived stocks were in turn prepared from 20 mm ko2 in 0 05m naoh ph 12 7 yielding concentrations of ho2 o2 stock 2000 μm and h2o2 ho2 stock 6000 μm uv derived o2 stocks were prepared by irradiation of 20 mm h2o2 ho2 0 in 0 05m naoh ph 12 7 yielding ho2 o2 stock 900 μm and h2o2 ho2 stock 11 mm or irradiation of 10 mm h2o2 ho2 0 in 0 0316m naoh ph 12 5 yielding ho2 o2 stock 500 μm and h2o2 ho2 stock 5000 μm text s2 fig s5 the ko2 derived stocks were dosed to receiving solutions at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 2 with dilution factors ranging from 1 40 to 1 10 whereas the uv derived stocks were dosed to receiving solutions at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 1 due to their lower ho2 o2 stock concentrations with dilution factors ranging from 1 36 to 1 5 as shown in fig 7 these experiments yielded levels of probe degradation comparable to those obtained using o2 stocks prepared from ko2 at higher ph fig 4 with only moderately diminished effectiveness for the uv derived stocks dosed at the lower ho2 o2 0 fac 0 ratio at the same time use of the ko2 stocks required only 2 5 mm of h2so4 to neutralize oh resulting in residual so4 2 concentrations of 240 mg l below the secondary mcl and use of the uv derived stocks required only 2 8 3 2 mm of h2so4 to neutralize oh resulting in residual so4 2 concentrations of 260 300 mg l respectively just above the secondary mcl continued optimization of o2 stock preparation and handling at lower ph values will be needed to enable further decreases in residual h2so4 dosing requirements and consequent residual so4 2 concentrations residual h2o2 ho2 levels in receiving solutions did not exceed 600 μm or 1200 μm when using either ko2 derived or uv derived stocks respectively at these h2o2 ho2 levels the use of excess fac to quench h2o2 ho2 in either single or multiple dosing approaches would be expected to contribute no more than 50 mg l of total residual cl to treated waters assuming equimolar cl and fac in fac stocks and 100 conversion of fac to cl upon reaction with ho2 o2 or h2o2 ho2 well below the secondary mcl of 250 mg l as cl the high cost of commercially available ko2 solids likely precludes their use as a means of preparing o2 stocks in large scale treatment applications however uv derived o2 stocks may present a more practical option for implementing o2 fac treatment at scale for example such stocks could be generated on site by using off line lp hg or uv led irradiation of alkaline h2o2 ho2 in a flow through cell for continuous infusion into process waters with this in mind a preliminary estimate of the electrical and chemical costs for implementing such an approach was performed using data from the bench scale experiments undertaken here with uv derived o2 stocks with 90 degradation of ba in phosphate buffer during single dose postmix treatment selected as a reference condition with costs determined in units of per m3 of treated water per order of magnitude ba degradation or m 3 order 1 see text s11 for details the resulting calculations yield a cost estimate of 1 0 1 1 m 3 order 1 for o2 fac treatment including costs for uv lamp output h2o2 naoh h2so4 and fac table s6 by comparison the costs for o3 h2o2 including costs for o3 generation and h2o2 and uv h2o2 including costs for uv lamp output and h2o2 to yield 90 degradation of the very similar pcba in various natural waters were estimated as 0 0043 0 008 m 3 order 1 and 0 075 0 192 m 3 order 1 respectively based on previously reported findings katsoyiannis et al 2011 table s6 it should be noted that these estimates do not account for variations in capital costs the 5 fold higher cost estimate for o2 fac treatment primarily reflects costs of naoh 50 of the total and to a lesser extent h2o2 and fac 31 of the total combined followed by h2so4 6 of the total the costs for uv lamp output 13 of the total are similar to those for uv h2o2 tables s5 and s6 as indicated in section 3 1 2 iv v and text s2 further improvements in o2 fac treatment performance and cost can likely be realized through continued refinement of approaches for o2 stock preparation to improve ho2 o2 yield and stability at lower ph values for example if o2 stock solution ph could be lowered by one unit from 12 7 to 11 7 while still maintaining equivalent o2 concentrations naoh and h2so4 requirements could in turn be lowered by 10 fold with a corresponding reduction of 0 57 m 3 order 1 or 50 60 in overall costs alternatively improvements in o2 stock solution stabilities and or yields from uv irradiation of alkaline h2o2 ho2 solutions at ph 12 7 e g through the use of higher intensity lamps or more efficient lamp geometries could allow the accumulation of higher o2 concentrations in stocks this could in turn enable decreases in the required volumes of o2 stock solutions to implement o2 fac treatment at a given ho2 o2 0 fac 0 ratio which would lead to lower naoh h2o2 ho2 and h2so4 requirements for example a 2 fold increase in peak o2 concentrations achievable in stocks could lead to a commensurate 2 fold decrease in o2 stock volume requirements in turn cutting naoh h2o2 ho2 and h2so4 requirements in half and lowering the associated costs by 0 28 m 3 order 1 0 085 m 3 order 1 and 0 035 m 3 order 1 respectively for a decrease of 35 45 in overall costs it is also worthwhile to note that even if m 3 order 1 costs for o2 fac treatment remain higher than for more conventional aops its simplicity rapid operational time scales and as a consequence its low required reactor volume and footprint potential for on site o2 generation and widespread accessibility of fac also including potential for on site generation and other reagents could make this process uniquely advantageous for certain applications in particular smaller scale decentralized and or point of use waste water treatment as the first investigation of which the authors are aware to explore the possibility of directly applying o2 fac treatment for advanced oxidation this work is principally intended to elucidate process chemistry and to provide a foundation from which to explore future applications more definitive assessments of costs and implementation strategies will require studies dedicated to these aims and conducted at pilot and or full scale future research on these topics is therefore highly encouraged and will be needed to more fully evaluate the potential of the o2 fac process for applications in waste water treatment and reuse 4 conclusions this work shows that moderately stable aqueous o2 stocks t 1 2 minutes prepared by several approaches at ph 12 can be either i directly added to aqueous fac at circumneutral ph or ii premixed with alkaline fac and added to aqueous solutions at circumneutral ph to effectively degrade various organic probe compounds nb ba dmb and pcba via in situ generated ho and rcs including clo cl and or cl2 o2 fac treatment results in the production of 0 8 mol ho mol fac consumed and can generate ho and rcs exposures reaching 5 10 10 and 10 9 m s respectively at ph 7 on par with many of the aops currently in use in waste water treatment including uv h2o2 o3 h2o2 and uv fac o2 fac treatment can be applied effectively in natural waters and srnom amended phosphate buffer containing up to 5 mgc l of doc though efficiency decreases with increasing doc due to scavenging of ho and rcs by dom direct formation of halogen containing dbps including chlorite chlorate bromate perchlorate thms and haas during o2 fac treatment is minimal though thm and haa formation was found to be moderately enhanced during post chlorination of o2 fac treated solutions the findings reported here provide a foundation for further examining potential applications of o2 fac treatment additional work is needed to more fully evaluate opportunities for optimizing various aspects of this process in particular

of advanced oxidation processes aops for degradation of trace organic contaminants during waste water treatment and reuse lee et al 2020 miklos et al 2018b o shea and dionysiou 2012 von gunten 2018 such aops comprise a wide variety of approaches including uv irradiation hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 uv free available chlorine uv fac with fac comprising predominantly hypochlorous acid hocl and its

processes and an array of persulfate based processes lee et al 2020 li et al 2020 miklos et al 2018b o shea and dionysiou 2012 von gunten 2018 in all of these approaches hydroxyl radical ho is a key and often the key oxidant responsible for contaminant oxidation with ho reacting non selectively and having high second order rate constants for reactions with most organic and many inorganic contaminants while many of the aops noted can yield highly effective contaminant degradation they often require specialized capital and energy intensive infrastructure for example arrays of low or medium pressure hg vapor lamps for uv driven processes or in the case of o3 driven processes high capacity o3 generators often accompanied by extensive equipment for liquid or gas phase o2 handling and or purification and post treatment o3 destruction miklos et al 2018b oturan and aaron 2014 rakness 2005 stefan 2017 many such aops are also subject to various physical chemical constraints on process efficiency for example hydrodynamics and spatial heterogeneity in light intensity in the case of uv driven processes hydrodynamics and mass transfer limitations on gas phase o3 dissolution into solution for o3 driven processes mass transfer limitations on contaminant transport to interfacial reactive sites for heterogeneous photocatalysis processes and low ph requirements in the case of many photo fenton and photo fenton like approaches oturan and aaron 2014 rakness 2005 stefan 2017 for a process to improve upon the suite of available aop options desirable attributes would include the potential to operate with minimal additional infrastructure low cost and energy consumption homogeneous reaction chemistry or at least minimal mass transfer limitations and high efficiency at circumneutral ph one approach that could satisfy many of these criteria involves generation of ho from the homogeneous aqueous phase reaction of superoxide radical o2 with hypochlorous acid hocl eq 1 candeias et al 1993 long and bielski 1980 1 hocl o2 cl ho o2 k 1 7 5 106 m 1s 1 long and bielski 1980 as indicated by eq 1 the reaction occurs specifically between hocl and o2 while the reactions of ho2 with hocl and ocl and of o2 with ocl are negligible in comparison to eq 1 long and bielski 1980 the apparent kinetics for the reaction of ho2 o2 comprising the sum of o2 and its conjugate acid

10 7 5 morris 1966 represent the acid base dissociation constants for the equilibria ho2 h o2 and hocl h ocl respectively as shown in fig 1 the theoretical k app o 2 fac increases from 2 4 m 1s 1 at

fang et al 2014 kong et al 2018 lei et al 2019 sun et al 2016 while the o2 fac reaction has long been recognized as a potential source of ho in biological systems candeias et al 1993 long and bielski 1980 and has recently been identified as an important driver of radical pathways in the oxidation of phenols and hydroquinones by fac rodríguez and von gunten 2020 and in a newly reported approach to photocatalytic fac activation cheng et al 2020 it has otherwise received relatively little attention as a possible basis for an aop this is perhaps mainly due to the instability of o2 and ho2 under circumneutral ph conditions on account of their rapid disproportionation to h2o2 and its conjugate base hydroperoxide ho2 in aqueous solution eqs 10 12 10 ho2 ho2 h2o2 o2 k 10 8 3 105 m 1s 1 bielski

o 2 dp representing the ph dependent apparent second order rate constant for the overall disproportionation reaction as shown in fig 1 eqs 10 11 lead to extremely rapid decay of ho2 o2 at circumneutral ph bielski et al 1985 however as apparent from eqs 12 13 stability of ho2 o2 increases significantly with increasing ph fig 1 so that aqueous o2 stock solutions with lifetimes of several minutes or longer can be prepared at ph 12 and then dosed to fac containing waters at lower ph opening the door to their use in harnessing eq 1 for contaminant oxidation the low value of k app o 2 fac at ph 12 fig 1 affords the added possibility of premixing alkaline o2 fac solutions that can then be activated by dosing to lower ph waters effectively providing stock solutions of ho and rcs numerous options for o2 preparation have been reported including electrochemical enzymatic sonolytic radiolytic and photochemical methods as well as dissolution of o2 salts typically potassium superoxide ko2 hayyan et al 2016 although many of these require specialized equipment and or organic solvents or additives that would hinder use of the resulting stock solutions in an aop certain photochemical approaches and ko2 dissolution can yield high μm to mm o2 concentrations in fully aqueous solution at ph 11 heller and croot 2011 holroyd and bielski 1978 with the use of o2 stocks at such concentrations the o2 fac reaction could provide a convenient and widely accessible ho source especially considering the already widespread use of fac in waste water treatment leong et al 2008 usepa

and h2o2 ho2 150 600 μm in the o2 fac treated receiving solutions uv derived o2 stocks in a 0 05 m naoh were typically prepared to contain ho2 o2 stock 900 μm and h2o2 ho2 stock 11 mm at the time of dosing to receiving solutions while those in b 0 0316m naoh were prepared to contain ho2 o2 stock 500 μm and h2o2 ho2 stock 5 mm figs s5 and s6 show respective profiles for o2 generation during uv irradiation of h2o2 ho2 and o2 decay following removal of irradiated h2o2 ho2 solutions from the uv light source the stocks were dosed to receiving solutions at dilution factors ranging from a 1 36 to

for o2 fac treatment due to the relatively low ho2 o2 stock levels resulting from this approach fig s7 2 2 o2 fac treatment procedures o2 fac treatment experiments were undertaken by either i dosing various volumes of alkaline o2 stocks to 5mm or 50mm phosphate or borate buffered solutions ph 7 10 containing fac and radical probes or in some cases tert butanol t buoh hereafter referred to as postmix treatment or ii premixing alkaline o2 with alkaline fac and then dosing various volumes of premixed alkaline o2 fac stocks to 5mm or 50mm ph 7 phosphate buffered solutions or natural waters containing radical probes or other additives e g h2o2 suwannee river natural organic matter srnom or bromide hereafter referred to as premix treatment o2 stocks for postmix dosing and o2 fac stocks for premix dosing were generally prepared in 0 1m or 1m naoh to stabilize o2 and fac text s2 in accord with the slow kinetics of o2 disproportionation and the o2 fac reaction at ph 13 fig 1 o2 and premixed o2 fac stocks were utilized as soon as possible after preparation typically within 0 5 5 minutes to minimize reactant losses before dosing to receiving solutions o2 or o2 fac stocks were dosed into receiving solutions simultaneously with a stoichiometric amount of h2so4 to neutralize oh and ensure the desired in situ ph typically 7 with selected experiments at 8 9 and 10 in receiving solutions all o2 o2 fac and h2so4 additions were conducted under rapid mixing with receiving solutions agitated using ptfe coated magnetic stir bars all initial concentrations of t buoh radical probes ho2 o2 h2o2 ho2 fac or other solution constituents reported herein were the initial values in solution after dosing all reactants accounting for dilution due to blending reactants many experiments were conducted using a single dose of o2 or premixed o2 fac stocks henceforth referred to as single dose or single dosing experiments in a number of experiments a given receiving solution was repeatedly dosed with o2 or premixed o2 fac stocks at fixed concentrations and stoichiometric ratios with samples collected for analyses of probe compounds and other analytes after each dosing step henceforth referred to as multiple dose or multiple dosing experiments following addition of o2 or premixed o2 fac stocks to receiving solutions the treated receiving solutions were allowed to sit for at least 10 minutes to ensure completion of reactions details of methods used in certain cases to remove residual h2o2 ho2 or fac from reaction solutions after or between o2 and o2 fac dosing in addition to procedures for dbp formation experiments are provided in text s3 2 3 analytical methods full details of methods used for measurements of ph ho2 o2 h2o2 ho2 oxyhalides trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas and for identification and quantification of ho and rcs during o2 fac treatment are provided in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization and application of o2 fac treatment 3 1 1 confirmation of radical formation from the o2 fac reaction i probe compound degradation ph 7 50mm phosphate buffer solutions containing 1 μm nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmb and or para chlorobenzoic acid pcba were subjected to single dose postmix o2 fac treatment with increasing ho2 o2 0 20 50 100 200 μm and fac 0 10 25 50 100 μm at a fixed 2 1 molar ho2 o2 0 fac 0 ratio nb reacts rapidly only with ho of the radicals relevant to the o2 fac reaction buxton et al 1988 nowell and hoigné 1992 watts and linden 2007 while ba reacts rapidly with ho and cl buxton et al 1988 mártire et al 2001 and dmb reacts rapidly with ho cl clo and likely also cl2 alfassi et al 1988 alfassi et al 1989 o neill et al 1975 ho exposures were measured based on nb degradation during treatment and rcs exposures estimated based on degradation of ba and dmb according to procedures described in text s5 pcba which reacts rapidly with ho neta and dorfman 1968 and presumably also cl considering its structural similarity to ba though no rate constant appears to be available for this reaction was used as a non specific radical probe in some preliminary experiments as shown in fig 2 increasing probe losses were observed when jointly increasing ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 in contrast none of the probes were degraded in solutions treated separately with ho2 o2 or fac confirming that probe degradation was not due to direct reactions with ho2 o2 or fac direct reactions with h2o2 ho2 could also be ruled out on the basis of the treatments with ho2 o2 in the absence of fac as o2 stocks also contained h2o2 ho2 at levels yielding h2o2 ho2 0 70 700 μm in the receiving solutions fig 2 furthermore no probe losses were observed in the presence of fac dosed with h2o2 ho2 0 250 μm fig 2 confirming probe degradation during o2 fac treatment was not due to singlet oxygen 1o2 generated from reaction of fac with h2o2 ho2 eq s13 finally no probe losses were observed during postmix o2 fac treatment in the presence of 50mm t buoh which was sufficient to yield 93 scavenging of ho and as a consequence block the formation of rcs since in this system rcs are secondary radicals generated from ho via eqs 3 9 which would have been precluded due to scavenging of ho by t buoh fig 2 text s7 thus probe degradation during o2 fac treatment could be attributed to ho and or rcs degradation of the ho selective probe nb during o2 fac treatment in conjunction with the lack of nb or other probe degradation during o2 fac treatment in the presence of t buoh point to ho as a key driver of probe degradation under the conditions evaluated consistent with eq 1 however trends in nb ba and dmb degradation indicate that rcs also play an important role as discussed in section 3 1 2 ii and texts s5 and s8 consistent with eqs 3 9 ii hydroxyterephthalate htpa formation from terephthalate tpa tpa is known to yield htpa upon reaction with ho page et al 2010 text s4 when dosed with increasing ho2 o2 0 during single dose postmix treatment solutions containing tpa 0 10 μm and fac 0 50 μm at ph 7 yielded increasing htpa levels fig s8 in contrast htpa formation was not observed in such solutions without ho2 o2 addition fig s8 or in fac free controls treated with ho2 o2 0 25 μm also including h2o2 ho2 0 200 μm data not shown these observations further highlight the role of ho as a key oxidant during o2 fac treatment iii formaldehyde generation from t buoh the reaction of t buoh with ho to yield formaldehyde can be used as a means of quantifying ho yields in various oxidation processes flyunt et al 2003 schuchmann and von sonntag 1979 when dosed with increasing ho2 o2 0 during single dose postmix treatment solutions containing t buoh 0 50 mm and fac 0 50 100 or 250 μm at ph 7 yielded increasing formaldehyde levels at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 below 1 with formaldehyde levels plateauing as ho2 o2 0 fac 0 exceeded 1 fig s9 this likely reflects increasing conversion of fac 0 to ho at sub stoichiometric ho2 o2 0 with full conversion of fac 0 and maximum ho yield reached at stoichiometric or higher concentrations of ho2 o2 0 i e at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 1 note that contributions of rcs to formaldehyde formation can be neglected as ho is the precursor of the rcs and its scavenging by t buoh would have precluded rcs formation via eqs 3 9 in these experiments t buoh 0 50 mm would have been sufficient to scavenge 90 of ho except at the highest ho2 o2 0 applied at which f ho the fraction of total generated ho scavenged by t buoh would have been equal to 0 88 fig s9 text s7 based on a reported molar yield of 25 for formaldehyde formation from reaction of ho with t buoh flyunt et al 2003 schuchmann and von sonntag 1979 and an apparent plateau value of 0 2 mol formaldehyde formed mol fac consumed in fig s9 an estimated yield of 0 8 mol ho formed mol fac consumed was obtained for the o2 fac reaction under the conditions applied here this is lower than the theoretical yield of 1 mol ho mol fac eq 1 and may represent an underestimate due to a uncertainties in formaldehyde yield from t buoh in the presence of oxidants other than ho flyunt et al 2003 and or b inhibition of formaldehyde formation by reaction of excess ho2 o2 with the primary peroxyl radical formed in reaction of ho with t buoh schuchmann and von sonntag 1979 3 1 2 effects of o2 fac treatment conditions on radical exposures and probe degradation i effects of ph little variation in pcba degradation was observed during o2 fac treatment at ph 7 8 9 and 10 fig s10 the small apparent decrease in pcba degradation at ph 7 may have been attributable to a a higher ratio of k app ho 2 o 2 dp relative to k app o 2 fac leading to increased loss of ho2 o2 via disproportionation eqs 10 11 and or b a shift in speciation from hocl to ocl pk a 7 5 morris 1966 leading to increased scavenging of ho by the latter eqs 3 4 although subsequent discussion focuses on o2 fac treatment at ph 7 these findings indicate comparable effectiveness could be achievable at other ph values ii effects of ho2 o2 0 fac 0 and absolute values of ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 due to a the dependence of ho yield on ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 and b the rapid reactions of ho with fac and ho2 o2 eqs 3 4 and 14 15 respectively 14 ho ho2 h2o o2 k 14 7 1 109 m 1s 1 sehested et al 1968 15 ho o2 oh o2 k 15 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 sehested et al 1968 both relative and absolute concentrations of h o 2 o 2 0 and fac 0 may influence probe degradation and radical exposures 0 t radical dt during o2 fac treatment nb ba dmb and pcba degradation were in turn evaluated over a range of h o 2 o 2 0 and fac 0 at h o 2 o 2 0 fac 0 ranging from 0 2 7 5 in order to evaluate resulting variations in 0 t radical d t and identify optimal o2 fac treatment conditions as shown in figs 3 and s11 in single dose postmix experiments the extents of nb ba dmb and pcba degradation expressed here as change in probe compound concentration normalized to initial probe compound concentration or δ probe probe 0 where probe nb ba dmb or pcba increased with increasing ho2 o2 0 fac 0 up to maxima at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 2 beyond which δ probe probe 0 decreased with increasing ho2 o2 0 fac 0 furthermore when holding ho2 o2 0 fac 0 fixed at 2 δ probe probe 0 generally increased as ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 were increased in tandem up to 200 and 100 μm respectively beyond which further increases in ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 appeared to yield diminishing improvement fig 3 and s11 the observed maximal levels of δ probe probe 0 for single dosing of h o 2 o 2 0 200 μ m and fac 0 100 μ m translated to calculated exposures of 2 3 10 10 m s for both 0 t h o d t and 0 t cl o cl 2 d t and 10 11 m s for 0 t c l d t though with wider ranges apparent for clo cl2 and cl due in part to greater uncertainties in the small changes in probe concentrations from which these latter exposures were determined furthermore it is important to note that the values of 0 t radical d t determined here do not account for uncertainties associated with the rate constants used in their determination see text s5 for rate constants as the lack of reported error bounds for most of the associated rate constants precludes quantification of such uncertainties they are thus most appropriately interpreted as estimates rather than exact values of 0 t radical d t similar to ho yields ho exposures and δ probe probe 0 increased with increasing ho2 o2 0 fac 0 up to a maximum however maximal ho exposures and δ probe probe 0 were observed at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 2 rather than at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 1 as in the case ho yields this likely reflects a combination of increasing fac conversion to ho via eq 1 as ho2 o2 0 is increased coupled with consumption of ho2 o2 by ho eqs 14 15 without the presence of 50mm t buoh to block eqs 14 15 as in the yield measurements they would divert available ho2 o2 away from eq 1 in turn raising the ho2 o2 0 fac 0 ratio required for full conversion of fac by ho2 o2 the observed decrease in ho exposures and δ probe probe 0 at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 2 likely reflects increasing scavenging of ho by excess ho2 o2 via eqs 14 15 as ho2 o2 0 fac 0 is further increased beyond the optimum ratio the observed trends in clo cl2 and cl exposures vs ho2 o2 0 fac 0 fig 3 can be similarly explained as each rcs ultimately originates from ho via eqs 3 9 based on these findings a ratio of ho2 o2 0 fac 0 2 was selected for use in most subsequent experiments in addition to the ho and rcs exposure optimum at h o 2 o 2 0 fac 0 2 and the general increase in ho exposure with increasing ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 at fixed h o 2 o 2 0 fac 0 2 it is noteworthy that clo cl2 exposures and their relative contributions to degradation of the clo cl2 reactive probe dmb generally increased with increasing fac 0 up to an apparent maximum at fac 0 75 μm figs 3 and s12 this is likely attributable to increasing formation of clo and or cl2 via eqs 3 9 with increasing fac 0 and associated background cl 0 in fac stocks up to 75 μm beyond which disproportionation of clo and or cl2 eqs 16 17 may predominate 16 cl o cl o h 2 o cl o 2 oc l 2 h k 16 2 5 109 m 1s 1 kläning and wolff 1985 17 cl2 cl2 cl2 2cl k 17 3 5 109 m 1s 1 yu 2004 the increasing importance of clo cl2 relative to ho at higher fac 0 and potential formation of clo2 a regulated dbp via eq 16 suggest that there may be benefit to implementing o2 fac treatment at lower fac 0 if possible as discussed in section 3 1 2 iv iii postmix versus premix dosing of o2 and fac all results discussed to this point were obtained by adding alkaline o2 stocks to buffered receiving solutions containing probes and fac postmix dosing as noted in section 2 2 it is also possible to prepare relatively stable t 1 2 o2 fac 60 s premixed o2 and fac stocks at ph 13 this can simplify o2 fac treatment by enabling addition of premixed o2 fac to receiving solutions as a single stock with rapid conversion of the stock to ho and rcs at the lower ph of the receiving solution premix dosing this has the added benefit of preventing heterogeneities in ho2 o2 0 fac 0 that may result from non ideal mixing of separate o2 and fac solutions during postmix dosing a comparison of results for postmix and premix dosing at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 200 μm 100 μm is shown in fig 4 see the two groups of measurements designated by red 1 100 μm labels as apparent from the figure postmix and premix dosing yielded similar radical exposures and levels of δ probe probe 0 confirming the utility of the premix dosing approach iv single dose versus multiple dose o2 fac treatment as noted in section 3 1 2 ii increased radical exposures and contaminant degradation may be achievable by implementing o2 fac treatment at lower fac 0 and ho2 o2 0 due to consequent decreases in ho scavenging by fac eqs 3 4 and ho2 o2 eqs 14 15 this may also lead to decreased ho scavenging by h2o2 ho2 eqs s6 s9 associated with o2 stocks one means of undertaking such an approach is to dose o2 and fac repeatedly or continuously at lower concentrations multiple dosing rather than once at higher concentrations single dosing to investigate this δ probe probe 0 levels and radical exposures were measured when applying o2 and fac via several multiple dose postmix treatment approaches a twice at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 100 μm 50 μm henceforth designated as 2 50 μm with the 50 μm referring to applied fac 0 b four times at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 50 μm 25 μm i e 4 25 μm and c ten times at h o 2 o 2 0 fac 0 20 μm 10 μm i e 10 10 μm receiving solutions were treated with catalase after each o2 dosing step to completely remove h2o2 ho2 derived from o2 stocks and fac was then added into the receiving solutions for the subsequent step without h2o2 ho2 quenching beforehand fac added to the receiving solutions would have first been consumed via the direct reaction with h2o2 ho2 eq s13 the removal of residual h2o2 ho2 between o2 dosing steps was thus necessary to enable the use of postmix o2 dosing which requires the presence of fac in receiving solutions prior to o2 addition measurements obtained from these multiple dose postmix treatments were then compared to measurements obtained when applying o2 and fac via single dose postmix treatment at h o 2 o 2 0 fac 0 200 μm 100 μm i e 1 100 μm in all four cases the total cumulative levels of ho2 o2 0 tot and fac 0 tot applied summed to 200 μm and 100 μm respectively as shown in fig 4 increased 0 t h o d t and δ probe probe 0 were observed when applying lower ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 in multiple doses to achieve the same cumulative ho2 o2 0 tot and fac 0 tot levels as in a single dose in general higher 0 t h o and δ probe probe 0 were observed at lower h o 2 o 2 0 and fac 0 with 0 t h o d t and δ probe probe 0 for the single and multiple dosing approaches ranked in the order 10 10 μm 4 25 μm 2 50 μm 1 100 μm figs 4 and s13 the effects of multiple dosing on 0 t cl o cl 2 and 0 t c l d t were less clear due to higher uncertainties associated with these values fig 4 it is important to note that the use of catalase as a h2o2 ho2 quenching agent is not likely to be practical for water wastewater treatment as a more practical alternative the removal of h2o2 ho2 can also be achieved simply by reaction with excess fac eq s13 to investigate this further multiple dose postmix experiments were undertaken in which fac was added to receiving solutions between o2 dosing steps at concentrations sufficient to consume all h2o2 ho2 while also leaving a desired level of fac residual for subsequent reactions with o2 analogous results were obtained when applying 4 25 μm multiple dose postmix treatment with h2o2 ho2 quenched by fac instead of catalase after each dosing step though 0 t h o d t and δ probe probe 0 levels were somewhat lower than when using catalase for h2o2 ho2 quenching fig 4 this may reflect the presence of higher levels of background ho scavengers e g cl eqs 5 9 originating from fac stocks due to use of elevated fac concentrations to quench h2o2 ho2 see section 3 2 below for discussion of maximal expected cl concentrations following quenching of h2o2 ho2 with fac experiments using pcba as a probe and fac to quench h2o2 ho2 yielded similar results fig s14 additional experiments were undertaken to investigate the use of premixed o2 fac stocks in multiple dosing approaches as observed for postmix treatment 4 25 μm multiple dose premix treatment yielded increased 0 t h o d t and δ probe probe 0 compared to 1 100 μm single dose premix treatment when h2o2 ho2 was quenched with catalase after each dosing step fig 4 however lower 0 t h o d t and δ probe probe 0 were observed when h2o2 ho2 was not quenched after each dosing step fig 4 likely due to ho scavenging by h2o2 ho2 as discussed in more detail below v effects of h2o2 ho2 0 due to ho2 o2 disproportionation eqs 10 11 h2o2 ho2 was always present in o2 stocks as h2o2 ho2 can scavenge ho eqs s6 s9 and rcs eqs 18 19 it may in turn lower ho and rcs exposures during o2 fac treatment 18 cl h2o2 ho2 cl h k 18 2 109 m 1s 1 yu 2004 19 cl2 h2o2 ho2 2cl h k 19 105 106 m 1s 1 yu 2004 to investigate this probe degradation was examined during premix dosing of ho2 o2 0 fac 0 200 μm 100 μm to phosphate buffer pre amended with varying h2o2 ho2 0 measured ho and clo cl2 exposures were then examined versus total in situ concentrations h2o2 ho2 0 tot comprising the sum of pre amended h2o2 ho2 0 plus h2o2 ho2 0 derived from the o2 fac stock cl exposures were not included in this comparison due to their large uncertainties as shown in fig s15 ho and clo cl2 exposures decreased linearly with increasing h2o2 ho2 0 tot with a nearly constant ratio of 0 t h o d t 0 t cl o cl 2 d t

ho2 the ho and clo cl2 exposures would be 10 20 higher than at the lowest h2o2 ho2 0 tot investigated i e h2o2 ho2 0 tot 700 μm which represents h2o2 ho2 originating solely from the o2 fac stock these findings suggest that a minimizing h2o2 ho2 formation within o2 stocks which could also lead to improved stability of o2 text s2 and or b undertaking o2 fac treatment at lower total ho2 o2 0 as discussed in section 3 1 2 iv may enable further increases in ho and rcs exposures and contaminant degradation vi effects of dissolved organic matter dom and application to natural waters to investigate the influence of dom on ho and rcs exposures probe degradation was examined by premix dosing of o2 fac to a phosphate buffer amended with varying concentrations of srnom and b two natural water samples collected from a local reservoir and lake washington see table s2 for key water quality parameters as shown in fig 5 radical exposures and δ probe probe 0 were greater at higher ho2 o2 0 and fac 0 but inhibited by increasing doc concentrations this is consistent with the anticipated scavenging of ho cl clo and cl2 by dom brigante et al 2014 fang et al 2014 lei et al 2019 rosario ortiz et al 2008 westerhoff et al 2007 wu et al 2017 contributions of phosphate species to scavenging were negligible text s9 nevertheless these findings demonstrate that relatively high ho and rcs exposures and contaminant degradation can still be achieved over doc concentration ranges representative of drinking waters and potable reuse 3 1 3 disinfection byproduct formation i oxyhalides clo2 clo3 clo4 and bro3 were monitored in solutions containing 200 μgbr l during single and multiple dose postmix and premix o2 fac treatment as shown in fig 6 only clo2 and clo3 were formed in treated samples at concentrations above limits of quantification and at no more than 25 μg l far below the maximum contaminant levels mcls and health reference levels hrls for clo2 and clo3 note that concentrations in fig 6a have been corrected for background levels in fac stocks usepa 2016a 2020 relatively little difference was observed whether using postmix or premix treatment mass balances on concentrations of cl formed in these samples confirmed that nearly all 99 6 of the fac applied during o2 fac treatment under these conditions reacts to cl and that only traces of fac are consumed via oxidation to higher oxidation states this is further supported by the absence of detectable clo2 in o2 fac treated solutions which would be expected if substantial proportions of fac were oxidized to clo2 or higher states alfassi et al 1988 ii thms and haas formation of thms and haas was monitored in solutions containing 2 mgc l of srnom and 200 μgbr l during a single and multiple dose premix o2 fac treatment and b following post chlorination of the o2 fac treated samples to ct fac 400 mgcl2 l min all o2 fac treated samples were separated into two sub volumes one for direct thm haa analyses and the other for thm haa analyses after post chlorination results from these experiments in addition to those from control samples subjected to chlorination alone for comparison are shown in fig 6 single and multiple dose o2 fac treatment led to limited direct formation of tthm or haa5 no more than 5 15 μg l in either case following post chlorination of o2 fac treated samples concentrations reached 60 70 μg l for tthms and 25 35 μg l for haa5 compared to 52 7 μg l for tthms and 24 2 μg l for haa5 in control samples subjected to chlorination alone fig 6 notably thm haa levels generated during multiple dose o2 fac treatment were higher than observed during single dose treatment with increasing levels formed during each dosing step in the multiple dose experiments this is consistent with the higher overall ho and rcs exposures observed during multiple versus single dose treatment figs 4 and s13 and may be due in part to direct dom halogenation by rcs as discussed in prior work on fac based aops bulman and remucal 2020 young et al 2018 in contrast higher tthm levels following post chlorination were observed in samples initially subjected to single dose o2 fac treatment this latter observation may reflect a net increase of fac reactive thm precursor moieties in dom e g via ho and or rcs driven hydroxylation of aromatic moieties when subjected to the ho and rcs exposures prevailing during single dose treatment whereas the higher ho and rcs exposures prevailing during multiple dose treatment may have led to more extensive dom processing and a net decrease in fac reactive precursor moieties e g via ho and or rcs driven degradation of aromatic and aliphatic moieties to more highly oxidized products as reported for various aops ike et al 2019a ike et al 2019b although neither tthm nor haa5 levels exceeded usepa mcls usepa 2020 these findings indicate the potential for increased thm haa formation in o2 fac treatment particularly following post chlorination and should be investigated further as part of continued research into potential applications of this approach for advanced oxidation 3 2 practical implications this work highlights the potential for applying the o2 fac reaction eq 1 as the basis for a novel non photochemical approach to advanced oxidation with the capability to rapidly generate high ho and rcs levels for organic contaminant degradation at circumneutral ph and under homogenous conditions the ho and rcs exposures achieved during o2 fac treatment up to 5 10 10 m s for ho 10 9 m s for clo cl2 and 10 11 m s for cl are comparable to those observed in several of the aops most commonly applied in waste water treatment and reuse including uv h2o2 10 11 10 9 m s for ho miklos et al 2018a rosario ortiz et al 2010

10 10 and 10 13 10 11 m s for ho clo cl2 and cl respectively bulman et al 2019 chuang et al 2017 kong et al 2018 by preparing and standardizing aqueous o2 stocks under conditions of enhanced ho2 o2 stability ph 12 they can be easily handled and dosed to receiving solutions already containing fac this provides the option of utilizing o2 fac treatment as a means of generating a nearly instantaneous pulse or multiple pulses of ho and rcs in a post oxidation process following pre exposure to fac for disinfection or pre oxidation in much the same way that o3 h2o2 can be used to convert residual o3 to ho following a prior period of o3 exposure for disinfection or pre oxidation alternatively pre mixing of alkaline o2 and fac provides a unique option in which a combined o2 fac stock can be added directly to a water at circumneutral ph to generate a pulse of ho and rcs for advanced oxidation with the pre mixed o2 fac stock effectively serving as a ready made ho and rcs stock the use of such a pre mixing approach also presents the opportunity to apply o2 fac treatment without subjecting a water to pre chlorination with potential benefits for minimizing halogenated organic dbp formation and may enable application to waters containing high levels of matrix constituents that would normally prevent maintenance of an fac residual e g nh4 nh3 measurements of oxyhalide thm and haa formation show that direct production of regulated dbps is likely to be minimal during o2 fac treatment although o2 fac treatment does appear to lead to increased thm and haa formation during post chlorination as might be the case if o2 fac treatment is applied for pre oxidation of water that is then subjected to fac treatment for disinfection or distribution system residual maintenance this appears to be a trait shared by nearly all aops ike et al 2019a ike et al 2019b and may be manageable by minimizing post treatment fac exposures or by limiting treatment applications to waters containing low doc concentrations future investigations will be needed to evaluate potential impacts of o2 fac treatment on unregulated dbps in particular certain classes of nitrogenous and carbonaceous dbps now increasingly recognized for their potential health risks prasse et al 2018 richardson and plewa 2020 a potential barrier to implementation of o2 fac treatment derives from the high ph needed for o2 stock solutions and the consequent levels of acid necessary to neutralize the oh derived from the stock solutions upon dosing to receiving waters under the exploratory conditions used in many of the experiments described to this point the use of high h2so4 concentrations for naoh neutralization would lead to levels of residual so4 2 in substantial excess of the usepa secondary non enforceable drinking water mcl of 250 mg l as so4 2 in treated waters potentially leading to negative aesthetic and or gastrointestinal effects usepa 2003a b or to enhanced risks of corrosion in materials in contact with treated waters usepa 2016b yang et al 2014 this issue can potentially be addressed by 1 preparing o2 stocks in less alkaline naoh solutions to decrease the h2so4 concentration needed for neutralization and or 2 increasing the concentrations of o2 in the stocks to enable the use of smaller stock volumes and higher dilution factors also resulting in decreased h2so4 requirements a series of additional experiments was therefore undertaken in which o2 stocks were prepared from ko2 or uv irradiation of h2o2 ho2 under conditions selected to achieve elevated ho2 o2 concentrations at lower ph and used to degrade nb ba and dmb via single and multiple dose postmix o2 fac treatment with h2o2 quenched by fac in multiple dose experiments in so doing it was found that for ko2 derived o2 stocks the o2 yield and stability could be significantly improved by adding ko2 solids slowly to naoh solutions under rapid mixing rather than by addition of naoh to ko2 solids as was the case for most of the stocks prepared in this work see text s2 ko2 derived stocks were in turn prepared from 20 mm ko2 in 0 05m naoh ph 12 7 yielding concentrations of ho2 o2 stock 2000 μm and h2o2 ho2 stock 6000 μm uv derived o2 stocks were prepared by irradiation of 20 mm h2o2 ho2 0 in 0 05m naoh ph 12 7 yielding ho2 o2 stock 900 μm and h2o2 ho2 stock 11 mm or irradiation of 10 mm h2o2 ho2 0 in 0 0316m naoh ph 12 5 yielding ho2 o2 stock 500 μm and h2o2 ho2 stock 5000 μm text s2 fig s5 the ko2 derived stocks were dosed to receiving solutions at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 2 with dilution factors ranging from 1 40 to 1 10 whereas the uv derived stocks were dosed to receiving solutions at ho2 o2 0 fac 0 1 due to their lower ho2 o2 stock concentrations with dilution factors ranging from 1 36 to 1 5 as shown in fig 7 these experiments yielded levels of probe degradation comparable to those obtained using o2 stocks prepared from ko2 at higher ph fig 4 with only moderately diminished effectiveness for the uv derived stocks dosed at the lower ho2 o2 0 fac 0 ratio at the same time use of the ko2 stocks required only 2 5 mm of h2so4 to neutralize oh resulting in residual so4 2 concentrations of 240 mg l below the secondary mcl and use of the uv derived stocks required only 2 8 3 2 mm of h2so4 to neutralize oh resulting in residual so4 2 concentrations of 260 300 mg l respectively just above the secondary mcl continued optimization of o2 stock preparation and handling at lower ph values will be needed to enable further decreases in residual h2so4 dosing requirements and consequent residual so4 2 concentrations residual h2o2 ho2 levels in receiving solutions did not exceed 600 μm or 1200 μm when using either ko2 derived or uv derived stocks respectively at these h2o2 ho2 levels the use of excess fac to quench h2o2 ho2 in either single or multiple dosing approaches would be expected to contribute no more than 50 mg l of total residual cl to treated waters assuming equimolar cl and fac in fac stocks and 100 conversion of fac to cl upon reaction with ho2 o2 or h2o2 ho2 well below the secondary mcl of 250 mg l as cl the high cost of commercially available ko2 solids likely precludes their use as a means of preparing o2 stocks in large scale treatment applications however uv derived o2 stocks may present a more practical option for implementing o2 fac treatment at scale for example such stocks could be generated on site by using off line lp hg or uv led irradiation of alkaline h2o2 ho2 in a flow through cell for continuous infusion into process waters with this in mind a preliminary estimate of the electrical and chemical costs for implementing such an approach was performed using data from the bench scale experiments undertaken here with uv derived o2 stocks with 90 degradation of ba in phosphate buffer during single dose postmix treatment selected as a reference condition with costs determined in units of per m3 of treated water per order of magnitude ba degradation or m 3 order 1 see text s11 for details the resulting calculations yield a cost estimate of 1 0 1 1 m 3 order 1 for o2 fac treatment including costs for uv lamp output h2o2 naoh h2so4 and fac table s6 by comparison the costs for o3 h2o2 including costs for o3 generation and h2o2 and uv h2o2 including costs for uv lamp output and h2o2 to yield 90 degradation of the very similar pcba in various natural waters were estimated as 0 0043 0 008 m 3 order 1 and 0 075 0 192 m 3 order 1 respectively based on previously reported findings katsoyiannis et al 2011 table s6 it should be noted that these estimates do not account for variations in capital costs the 5 fold higher cost estimate for o2 fac treatment primarily reflects costs of naoh 50 of the total and to a lesser extent h2o2 and fac 31 of the total combined followed by h2so4 6 of the total the costs for uv lamp output 13 of the total are similar to those for uv h2o2 tables s5 and s6 as indicated in section 3 1 2 iv v and text s2 further improvements in o2 fac treatment performance and cost can likely be realized through continued refinement of approaches for o2 stock preparation to improve ho2 o2 yield and stability at lower ph values for example if o2 stock solution ph could be lowered by one unit from 12 7 to 11 7 while still maintaining equivalent o2 concentrations naoh and h2so4 requirements could in turn be lowered by 10 fold with a corresponding reduction of 0 57 m 3 order 1 or 50 60 in overall costs alternatively improvements in o2 stock solution stabilities and or yields from uv irradiation of alkaline h2o2 ho2 solutions at ph 12 7 e g through the use of higher intensity lamps or more efficient lamp geometries could allow the accumulation of higher o2 concentrations in stocks this could in turn enable decreases in the required volumes of o2 stock solutions to implement o2 fac treatment at a given ho2 o2 0 fac 0 ratio which would lead to lower naoh h2o2 ho2 and h2so4 requirements for example a 2 fold increase in peak o2 concentrations achievable in stocks could lead to a commensurate 2 fold decrease in o2 stock volume requirements in turn cutting naoh h2o2 ho2 and h2so4 requirements in half and lowering the associated costs by 0 28 m 3 order 1 0 085 m 3 order 1 and 0 035 m 3 order 1 respectively for a decrease of 35 45 in overall costs it is also worthwhile to note that even if m 3 order 1 costs for o2 fac treatment remain higher than for more conventional aops its simplicity rapid operational time scales and as a consequence its low required reactor volume and footprint potential for on site o2 generation and widespread accessibility of fac also including potential for on site generation and other reagents could make this process uniquely advantageous for certain applications in particular smaller scale decentralized and or point of use waste water treatment as the first investigation of which the authors are aware to explore the possibility of directly applying o2 fac treatment for advanced oxidation this work is principally intended to elucidate process chemistry and to provide a foundation from which to explore future applications more definitive assessments of costs and implementation strategies will require studies dedicated to these aims and conducted at pilot and or full scale future research on these topics is therefore highly encouraged and will be needed to more fully evaluate the potential of the o2 fac process for applications in waste water treatment and reuse 4 conclusions this work shows that moderately stable aqueous o2 stocks t 1 2 minutes prepared by several approaches at ph 12 can be either i directly added to aqueous fac at circumneutral ph or ii premixed with alkaline fac and added to aqueous solutions at circumneutral ph to effectively degrade various organic probe compounds nb ba dmb and pcba via in situ generated ho and rcs including clo cl and or cl2 o2 fac treatment results in the production of 0 8 mol ho mol fac consumed and can generate ho and rcs exposures reaching 5 10 10 and 10 9 m s respectively at ph 7 on par with many of the aops currently in use in waste water treatment including uv h2o2 o3 h2o2 and uv fac o2 fac treatment can be applied effectively in natural waters and srnom amended phosphate buffer containing up to 5 mgc l of doc though efficiency decreases with increasing doc due to scavenging of ho and rcs by dom direct formation of halogen containing dbps including chlorite chlorate bromate perchlorate thms and haas during o2 fac treatment is minimal though thm and haa formation was found to be moderately enhanced during post chlorination of o2 fac treated solutions the findings reported here provide a foundation for further examining potential applications of o2 fac treatment additional work is needed to more fully evaluate opportunities for optimizing various aspects of this process in particular

16926,aquaculture ponds are important anthropogenic sources of nitrous oxide n2o direct n2o emissions arising from feed application to ponds have been widely investigated but indirect emissions from n2o production from residual feeds in pond water are much less understood and characterized to refine the ipcc emission factor in this study we determined the concentrations and spatiotemporal variations of dissolved n2o and no3 n in situ in three aquaculture ponds at the min river estuary in southeastern china during the culture period over two years and calculated the indirect n2o emission factor ef5 for aquaculture ponds using the n2o n no3 n mass ratio methodology our results indicated that the ef5 values in the ponds over the culture period ranged between 0 0007 and 0 0543 with a clear seasonal pattern which closely followed that of the doc no3 n ratio we also observed significant spatial variations in ef5 among the three ponds which could be attributed to the difference in feed conversion rate in addition we assessed the ef5 values from aquaculture ponds in five regions of the chinese coastline across the latitudinal gradient from the tropical to the temperate zones the average ef5 value from aquaculture ponds across the five coastal regions was 0 0093 0 0024 which was approximately 3 7 times of the ipcc default value for rivers and estuaries 0 0025 moreover the ef5 values demonstrated considerable spatial variations across these coastal regions with a coefficient of variation of 59 which were largely related to the difference in water salinity our findings filled a key knowledge gap about the indirect n2o emission factor from aquaculture ponds and provided field evidence for the refinement of ef5 value currently adopted by ipcc in the national greenhouse gas inventory keywords nitrous oxide n2o indirect emission ef5 ipcc spatiotemporal variation aquaculture pond 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is one of the major potent greenhouse gases ghgs with a mean atmospheric concentration of 331 1 0 1 ppbv at present which is approximately 23 higher than the pre industrial before 1750 level world meteorological organization 2019 not only does n2o have a greater global warming potential than other ghgs e g carbon dioxide and methane hama aziz et al 2017 qin et al 2019 it also acts as the single most dominant destroyer of stratospheric ozone ravishankara et al 2009 shaaban et al 2018 turner et al 2015 yang et al 2018a there has been a steady increase in atmospheric n2o at an annual rate of 0 7 0 8 ppbv over the past three decades davidson 2009 saikawa et al 2014 xiao et al 2019a with agriculture by far being the largest source 80 of anthropogenic n2o cooper et al 2017 davidson 2009 quantifying the potential source strength of and the effects of human activities on n2o emissions from various agricultural systems have become one of the top priorities for predicting future n2o emission and its effects on climate change total n2o emissions from agriculture can be divided into direct and indirect sources cooper et al 2017 de klein et al 2006 hama aziz et al 2017 agricultural n2o input into the atmosphere from fertilized soil is regarded as direct emission while n2o production in aquatic ecosystems e g ditches streams rivers lakes and ponds induced by leaching and runoff of reactive nitrogen n from agricultural areas is treated as indirect emission fu et al 2018 mosier et al 1998 xiao et al 2019b while direct sources of n2o from agricultural soils have been widely investigated indirect n2o emissions from surface waters have to date received little attention outram and hiscock 2012 qin et al 2019 there has been increasing evidence that indirect n2o emissions derived from different water bodies within agricultural catchments are appreciable and should not be ignored in producing the national scale ghg inventory for reporting to the united nations qin et al 2019 turner et al 2015 xiao et al 2019b yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the indirect n2o emissions from a water body can be calculated by multiplying the nitrogen fertilizer input or relevant anthropogenic n loading with a predetermined emission factor for leached n ef5 which has been developed by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fu et al 2018 hu et al 2016 hama aziz et al 2017 the current default ef5 for rivers groundwater and estuaries are all set to be 0 0025 kg n2o n kg n input de klein et al 2006 but some studies have suggested that this default value is highly uncertain due to the large variability in environmental conditions beaulieu et al 2011 cooper et al 2017 fu et al 2018 therefore using the default ipcc emission factor for predicting indirect n2o emissions from all aquatic ecosystems may introduce considerable biases a greater number of direct in situ measurements should be conducted for a more accurate determination of ef5 hama aziz et al 2017 he et al 2017 outram and hiscock 2012 tian et al 2017 xiao et al 2019a previous efforts have been made on the direct measurements of ef5 in inland freshwaters including rivers qin et al 2019 outram and 2012 yu et al 2013 streams fu et al 2018 hama aziz et al 2017 turner et al 2015 drainage ditches tian et al 2017 2018 lakes xiao et al 2019a 2019b and reservoirs liu et al 2017 xiao et al 2019b but in situ observation of ef5 in shallow water ponds especially those created for aquaculture purposes has thus far received little attention this knowledge gap may account for large uncertainties in the assessment of regional or global n2o budget downing 2010 estimated that the total number of small shallow ponds 0 001 km2 in the world can be as large as 3 2 billion with the total surface area of around 0 8 million km2 as an indispensable part of global shallow ponds the aquaculture ponds are widely distributed around the world fao 2017 yang et al 2020a with a total surface area of around 1 1 105 km2 verdegem and bosma 2009 in general these aquaculture ponds are semi artificial ecosystems which are maintained through daily supply of feeds containing nitrogen nutrient hu et al 2012 yang et al 2017a however only a small proportion of these feed inputs are being converted into fish biomass with a rather low feed utilization efficiency in the range of 4 0 27 4 chen et al 2016 molnar et al 2013 consequently the majority of the nitrogen nutrients in the residual feeds along with animal excreta and dead phytoplankton are retained in the pond water and the sediment surface yang et al 2017a 2019 the microbial decomposition of these organic rich materials can stimulate n2o production and thereby contribute to a large amount of indirect n2o emission however the magnitude of indirect n2o emission from aquaculture ponds and their contributions to the regional and global n2o budgets remain largely unknown owing to the paucity of field data from these systems furthermore there is currently a lack of default emission factor to estimate the indirect emission of n2o from aquaculture ponds china has the largest area of aquaculture ponds in the world fao 2017 with many of them being widely located in estuaries and bays along the coastal regions approximately 15 600 km2 60 of china s total duan et al 2020 variations in environmental conditions can have marked influences on n2o emissions from aquatic environment previous studies have identified a suite of environmental factors controlling the variability of n2o production and emission in coastal wetlands and estuaries including salinity welti et al 2017 wang et al 2018 xia et al 2019 temperature alongi et al 2005 hou et al 2013 sun et al 2013 and substrate availability kessler et al 2018 li et al 2021 wells et al 2018 with contrasting physicochemical environments along the chinese coastline the indirect n2o emission in the aquaculture ponds could vary markedly across different coastal zones detailed in situ measurements of ef5 from aquaculture ponds over various spatial and temporal scales in china are thus crucial for refining the indirect n2o emission factor used in national ghg accounting and developing more accurate approaches for quantifying the regional and global n2o budgets in this study the concentrations of dissolved n2o and no3 n in the aquaculture ponds were measured across five coastal regions in china for the determination of ef5 value based on the mass ratio of emitted n2o n to no3 n in a unit volume of pond water e g hama aziz et al 2017 ipcc 2006 xiao et al 2019a tian et al 2018 the specific objectives of this study are to 1 quantify the magnitude of ef5 values in the mariculture ponds across five coastal regions of china 2 determine the spatial variations in ef5

in 2018 following the timing of aquaculture management practices during each campaign water sampling was conducted at three to five replicate sampling sites in each pond over the study period a total of 360 water samples were collected from the three shrimp ponds for the analysis of dissolved n2o concentration and other physicochemical parameters the high frequency of sampling enabled a more accurate assessment of the temporal variation in indirect n2o emission factor in ponds furthermore in order to further determine the magnitude spatial variations and main controls of ef5 values from mariculture ponds across various coastal regions in china down the latitudinal gradient we collected surface water samples from the mariculture ponds in bhb jre csb and bbg fig 1a over the aquaculture

them doc no3 n had the largest explanatory power 78 4 88 6 followed by no3 n 4 3 14 2 and w t 2 8 4 0 3 5 ef5 for mariculture ponds in different coastal areas the spatial variations in ef5 from mariculture ponds across the five coastal areas in china are shown in fig 7 the ef5 values from the mariculture ponds in bhb mre jre csb and bbg varied over the ranges of 0 0003 0 0018 0 0008 0 0543 0 0006 0 0989 0 0001 0 0462 and 0 0001 0 0210 respectively fig 7 with means of 0 0008 0 0001 0 0136 0 0007 0 0116 0 0007 0 0135 0 0011 and 0 0071 0 0010 respectively overall the average ef5 varied significantly among the five coastal areas in the following descending order mre csb jre bbg bhb p 0 0001 4 discussions 4 1 mariculture ponds as hotspots of indirect n2o emission a previous study estimated that the indirect n2o efflux from the mariculture ponds in jre was 33 0 μg m 2 h 1 jin 2018 our results showed that the average n2o efflux in our estuarine mariculture ponds was 57 6 μg m 2 h 1 table 2 which was substantially smaller than those reported in wenwusha reservoir in the nangyangdong river estuary unpublished data rivers estuaries streams e g cooper et al 2017 he et al 2017 xiao et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 ditches drains e g audet et al 2017 xiao et al 2019b and groundwater e g laini et al 2011 on the other hand the n2o effluxes in our mariculture ponds were substantially higher than those of some rivers in uk cooper et al 2017 hama aziz et al 2017 and approximately 5 times higher than the average of 8 7 μg m 2 h 1 observed in the streams in the us corn belt turner et al 2015 mariculture ponds had larger n2o emissions as compared with the freshwater reservoirs lakes and ponds in china as well as most ditches drains and groundwater in the world table 2 the average indirect n2o emission factor of 0 0093 from mariculture ponds in china was almost three times that of the ipcc s default value of 0 0025 and one to three orders of magnitude higher than that observed in most lentic ecosystems reservoirs and lakes rivers estuaries streams ditches drains and groundwater table 2 furthermore the ef5 value in our mariculture ponds was comparable to that in some n enriched lakes in colorado mccrackin and elser 2011 and streams in the us corn belt turner et al 2015 these results indicated that mariculture ponds were hotspots of indirect n2o emission that were often overlooked in the construction of regional and global n2o budgets 4 2 spatial variations in ef5 between mariculture ponds the spatial variation in ef5 in aquaculture ponds remains poorly characterized as the first attempt to investigate the small scale spatial variations in ef5 among aquaculture ponds this study showed strong spatial variations in ef5 among the ponds with the mean value at pond ii being significantly higher than those at ponds i and iii by over 1 3 and 1 4 times respectively fig 5 and table 1 among the environmental variables recorded in this study w t ph and do were relatively constant among the three ponds while the concentrations of no3 n nh4 n and doc showed large spatial differences fig 2 over the two year study period the mean din no3 n nh4 n concentration in pond ii was higher than those in ponds i and iii by 44 and 52 respectively mean doc concentration in the water column in pond ii was also higher than those in ponds i and iii by 27 and 28 respectively the significantly higher concentrations of din and doc observed in pond ii were likely related to the massive shrimp mortality in this pond during the culture period which reduced the efficiency of feed utilization and in turn contributed to the accumulation of carbon and nutrients in the water column yang et al 2020c this was further confirmed by the significantly higher feed conversion rate fcr in pond ii 2 6 than in ponds i 1 4 and iii 1 6 by 85 and 63 respectively table s2 previous studies have found that the microbial processes of n2o production can be promoted by the large supply of carbon and nitrogen substrates subsequently increasing n2o emission to the atmosphere herrman et al 2008 xia et al 2013 xiao et al 2019a 2019b zhao et al 2013 both of these findings highlighted the important role of fcr in governing the difference in the availability of carbon and nitrogen substrates and thus the spatial variation in ef5 among the ponds although n2o production rates were not measured in our study the significant and positive relationship observed between ef5 and doc no3 n p 0 01 figs 6 and s2 confirmed the influence of available carbon and nitrogen substrates on n2o yield and indirect emission 4 3 spatial variations in ef5 for mariculture ponds across coastal regions in this study we observed considerable variations in the ef5 of n2o from mariculture ponds across regions with significantly higher averages in mre jre and csb than in the other two regions by a difference of up to one to two orders of magnitude fig 7 among all the environmental variables investigated in this study salinity had marked spatial variations with a range of 4 2 34 3 salinity controls the mineralization rate of nitrogen through its effect on microbial activity and enzymatic reactions thereby regulating the rates of n2o production consumption and emission into the atmosphere some studies suggested that high salinity can reduce microbial diversity francis et al 2003 li et al 2020 moin et al 2009 mosier and francis 2008 and activity wang et al 2010 especially the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aobs with the consequence of reducing n2o production in the sediment and water column rysgaard et al 1999 wang et al 2018 a negative relationship between salinity and n2o concentrations or flux has been reported in coastal wetlands and aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2015 sun et al 2013 wang et al 2018 welti et al 2017 similarly we found a significant and negative correlation between salinity and dissolved n2o concentrations in this study p 0 01 fig s3a furthermore the ef5 and salinity exhibited opposite spatial patterns across the five regions p 0 01 fig s3b these findings indicated that salinity was likely an important environmental factor governing ef5 dynamics in coastal aquaculture ponds annual average air temperature varied greatly across the five coastal regions in the present study ranging between 13 and 23 c previous studies have demonstrated positive effects of temperature on denitrification rate hou et al 2013 reisinger et al 2016 and n2o emissions herrman et al 2008 tian et al 2017 owing to the enhancement of organic carbon and nitrate availability as well as the activities of denitrifiers under high temperature tatti et al 2015 xia et al 2019 although we did not quantify denitrification rate in this study we did observe larger ef5 from mre jre csb and bbg regions with higher temperature the significant and positive relationship between ef5 and air temperature found in our study p 0 01 r 2 0 79 suggested that temperature was also an important factor influencing the regional variations in ef5 in ponds interestingly although bbg had the highest mean temperature its ef5 was substantially lower than those in mre jre and csb fig 7 which was probably due to the overriding suppression effects of high salinity on n2o production in bbg ponds these findings suggested that higher temperature combined with lower salinity could lead to higher indirect n2o emissions from mariculture ponds in the coastal areas in addition annual average precipitation varied greatly across the five regions with a range of 550 mm 2 100 mm precipitation in bhb was much lower than those in the other four regions a positive relationship between ef5 and precipitation was observed in our study p 0 01 r 2 0 79 which was consistent with the previous findings in the agriculture watersheds outram and hiscock 2012 tian et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 our results revealed that the differences in ef5 from mariculture ponds across regions might also be related to the variations in precipitation precipitation affects indirect n2o emissions mainly through its dilution effect on water salinity which in turn increases denitrification and subsequently n2o production further studies using controlled experiments should be carried out to test the above hypothesis notably the bbg had a high precipitation 16 700 mm but a substantially lower ef5 than in mre and jre this could be attributed mainly to that the lower amount of catchment runoff and river discharge received at bbg leading to a greater water salinity that could inhibit denitrification and n2o production therefore the impacts of hydrologic regimes should also be considered in accounting for the spatial variations in ef5 in mariculture ponds across different coastal regions 4 4 temporal patterns of ef5 and their regulating factors large seasonal variation in ef5 values has been reported in various water bodies e g river ditches lakes and reservoirs in the agricultural watersheds e g cooper et al 2017 hama aziz et al 2017 qin et al 2019 tian et al 2018 xiao et al 2019b which corresponds to the temporal patterns of nitrogen loads arising from agricultural leaching and runoff hama aziz et al 2017 qin et al 2019 tian et al 2017 2018 consistent with the findings of some previous studies conducted in rivers beaulieu et al 2011 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 hu et al 2016 qin et al 2019 xiao et al 2019b streams mulholland et al 2008 lakes xiao et al 2019a and reservoirs xiao et al 2019b the ef5 values from the aquaculture ponds in this study were also negatively correlated with nitrogen loadings p 0 01 figs s2a 2c and table s1 which could be attributed to the reduction in microbial activity with increasing nitrogen inputs as a result of biological saturation li et al 2021 hu et al 2016 mulholland et al 2008 xiao et al 2019a apart from nitrogen availability carbon substrate was another key factor controlling the n2o production processes previous studies have suggested that carbon limitation during denitrification was related to the enhanced n2o production capodici et al 2018 kampschreur et al 2009 in general a high c n ratio may increase the availability of labile carbon sources leading to an enhancement of denitrification rates capodici et al 2018 xiao et al 2019a zhao et al 2013 consequently the significantly correlation between the ef5 and doc no3 n mass ratio has been reported in previous studies e g cooper et al 2017 hu et al 2016 qin et al 2019 xiao et al 2019a 2019b although denitrification rates in the present study were unavailable the significant relationship between ef5 values and water doc no3 n mass ratio p 0 01 figs s2d 2f and table s1 implied that the seasonal variability in ef5 could be partly related to the availability of carbon substrate fig 6 interannual variations in indirect n2o emissions from water bodies in the agricultural watersheds have been reported in previous studies e g griffis et al 2017 hama aziz et al 2017 qin et al 2019 xiao et al 2019a which could be largely governed by temperature griffis et al 2017 xiao et al 2019a a higher water temperature combined with a higher no3 n level in water bodies could stimulate denitrification herrman et al 2008 ma et al 2020 tian et al 2017 ultimately resulting in greater n2o emission griffis et al 2017 tian et al 2018 although the mean ef5 in 2017 was higher than that in 2018 fig 4 no significant difference in water temperature was observed between the two years p 0 05 fig 2a other environmental factors might outweigh temperature in affecting n2o production via nitrification and denitrification in these ponds among the variables investigated in this study no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in 2017 were higher than those in 2018 fig 2e which were consistent with the interannual variations in ef5 hence the difference in nitrogen substrate availability caused by fcr might play a dominant role in governing the interannual variation in ef5from aquaculture ponds in addition water salinity was significantly lower in 2017 than in 2018 p 0 05 fig 2d as a result of greater freshwater dilution caused by intensive rainfall in 2017 this reduction in water salinity could reduce the stress on denitrifying bacteria and thus contribute to the higher indirect n2o emissions observed in 2017 4 5 implications for ef5 from mariculture ponds the ipcc has proposed a default value of indirect n2o emissions factor ef5 of 0 0025 however several studies investigating the indirect n2o emissions from leaching and runoff have suggested an underestimation e g beaulieu et al 2011 yu et al 2013 turner et al 2015 fu et al 2018 or overestimation outram and hiscock 2012 hama aziz et al 2017 of the default ef5 value given that the limited availability of field data remains a major source of uncertainty in the use of ef5 value a greater number of ef5 field measurements in various types of aquatic systems are needed to improve the estimation of indirect n2o emissions in this study we made the attempt to determine the magnitude of ef5 from the mariculture ponds along the chinese coastlines across the latitudinal gradient and found a wide range of ef5 values across different coastal regions 0 0008 0 0136 fig 7 the overall mean ef5 from the mariculture ponds was 0 0093 which was approximately 3 5 times higher than the ipcc default value our results further confirmed that the use of a single ef5 for all water bodies in ghg accounting might be inappropriate beaulieu et al 2011 although the ef5 values have been widely reported in different water bodies e g fu et al 2018 hama aziz et al 2017 liu et al 2017 turner et al 2015 tian et al 2017 xiao et al 2019a 2019b the spatiotemporal variations in ef5 remain poorly investigated qin et al 2019 xiao et al 2019a our results showed remarkable spatial variations in the ef5 from coastal aquaculture ponds fig 7 the coefficient of variation cv of ef5 across the five study regions was 59 which implied a large uncertainty of estimated ef5 based on measurements in a single region meanwhile we also observed large temporal variations in ef5 values across the mariculture ponds with the cv ranging between 71 and 104 fig 4 suggesting that a single default ef5 value might not be able to represent the changes in indirect n2o emissions during the aquaculture period thus it is very important to measure from as many sites as practicable across different seasons in order to reduce the uncertainty of ef5 estimation and improve our understanding of n2o dynamics in aquatic ecosystems our field observation confirmed the large spatial variation in ef5 among different coastal regions and among aquaculture ponds in the same region at the larger spatial scale among regions high salinity constrained ef5 while at the smaller spatial scale among ponds in the same region the low turnover rate of bait increased ef5 our results indicated the importance of controlling salinity and improving the fcr in aquaculture ponds for mitigating n2o emissions 4 6 study limitations and recommendations for future research as in most studies there are several limitations in the current study the indirect n2o emission factors in aquatic systems could be obtained by two different approaches n2o n no3 n mass ratio method and ipcc 2006 method similar to many studies e g turner et al 2015 xiao et al 2019a zhang et al 2020 this research calculated ef5 in mariculture ponds using the n2o n no3 n mass ratio method however in inland freshwater environments the ef5 values calculated using the ipcc 2006 method were shown to be lower than those determined by the n2o n no3 n mass ratio method hama aziz et al 2017 qin et al 2019 future research should compare the use of both methods for a more accurate estimation of ef5 from mariculture ponds moreover the fcr in mariculture ponds could vary greatly among different aquaculture types which could affect the ef5 values in this study only one specific cultured species litopenaeus vannamei was considered which could lead to some uncertainties when the data are scaled up from local to regional levels to obtain a more precise picture of the national and global ef5 from mariculture ponds more in situ direct measurements covering different aquaculture types are needed furthermore this study examined the ef5 value and environmental factors in the field by water sampling and analysis however it is also important to assess the contribution of individual mechanistic processes e g n2o production and consumption and the abundance and activity of various microorganisms e g nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in relation to n2o emissions lastly our field sampling campaigns across the five coastal regions were conducted in multiple years the interannual variability in some environment variables e g precipitation and temperature may introduce additional uncertainties to our results in future work a series of advanced strategies should be adopted to simultaneously measure ef5 in aquaculture ponds across different coastal regions 5 conclusions while n2o is one of the major ghgs and ozone depleting substances the indirect n2o emission factor ef5 in aquatic environment remains poorly understood the present study made the first attempt to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in ef5 and their potential controls in the coastal aquaculture ponds in china in five different regions our results demonstrated considerable spatial and temporal variations in the ef5 values from aquaculture ponds the temporal variation in ef5 was strongly controlled by the doc no3 n mass ratio the feed conversion rate played an important role in governing the small scale spatial variations in ef5 among the aquaculture ponds salinity was the main factor influencing ef5 among different coastal regions overall the mean ef5 in aquaculture ponds across different coastal regions was 0 0093 0 0024 which was substantially higher than the ipcc default value 0 0025 our results provided a solid scientific basis for refining the existing indirect n2o emission factors which could help to improve the standardization of ghg accounting methods and reduce the uncertainties in estimating n2o emissions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16926,aquaculture ponds are important anthropogenic sources of nitrous oxide n2o direct n2o emissions arising from feed application to ponds have been widely investigated but indirect emissions from n2o production from residual feeds in pond water are much less understood and characterized to refine the ipcc emission factor in this study we determined the concentrations and spatiotemporal variations of dissolved n2o and no3 n in situ in three aquaculture ponds at the min river estuary in southeastern china during the culture period over two years and calculated the indirect n2o emission factor ef5 for aquaculture ponds using the n2o n no3 n mass ratio methodology our results indicated that the ef5 values in the ponds over the culture period ranged between 0 0007 and 0 0543 with a clear seasonal pattern which closely followed that of the doc no3 n ratio we also observed significant spatial variations in ef5 among the three ponds which could be attributed to the difference in feed conversion rate in addition we assessed the ef5 values from aquaculture ponds in five regions of the chinese coastline across the latitudinal gradient from the tropical to the temperate zones the average ef5 value from aquaculture ponds across the five coastal regions was 0 0093 0 0024 which was approximately 3 7 times of the ipcc default value for rivers and estuaries 0 0025 moreover the ef5 values demonstrated considerable spatial variations across these coastal regions with a coefficient of variation of 59 which were largely related to the difference in water salinity our findings filled a key knowledge gap about the indirect n2o emission factor from aquaculture ponds and provided field evidence for the refinement of ef5 value currently adopted by ipcc in the national greenhouse gas inventory keywords nitrous oxide n2o indirect emission ef5 ipcc spatiotemporal variation aquaculture pond 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is one of the major potent greenhouse gases ghgs with a mean atmospheric concentration of 331 1 0 1 ppbv at present which is approximately 23 higher than the pre industrial before 1750 level world meteorological organization

stratospheric ozone ravishankara et al 2009 shaaban et al 2018 turner et al 2015 yang et al 2018a there has been a steady increase in atmospheric n2o at an annual rate of 0 7 0 8 ppbv over the past three decades davidson 2009 saikawa et al 2014 xiao et al 2019a with agriculture by far being the largest source 80 of anthropogenic n2o cooper et al 2017 davidson 2009 quantifying the potential source strength of and the effects of human activities on n2o emissions from various agricultural systems have become one of the top priorities for predicting future n2o emission and its effects on climate change total n2o emissions from agriculture can be divided into direct and indirect sources cooper et al 2017 de klein et al 2006 hama aziz et al 2017 agricultural n2o input into the atmosphere from fertilized soil is regarded as direct emission while n2o production in aquatic ecosystems e g ditches streams rivers lakes and ponds induced by leaching and runoff of reactive nitrogen n from agricultural areas is treated as indirect emission fu et al 2018 mosier et al 1998 xiao et al 2019b while direct sources of n2o from agricultural soils have been widely investigated indirect n2o emissions from surface waters have to date received little attention outram and hiscock 2012 qin et al 2019 there has been increasing evidence that indirect n2o emissions derived from different water bodies within agricultural catchments are appreciable and should not be ignored in producing the national scale ghg inventory for reporting to the united nations qin et al 2019 turner et al 2015 xiao et al 2019b yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the indirect n2o emissions from a water body can be calculated by multiplying the nitrogen fertilizer input or relevant anthropogenic n loading with a predetermined emission factor for leached n ef5 which has been developed by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fu et al 2018 hu et al 2016 hama aziz et al 2017 the current default ef5 for rivers groundwater and estuaries are all set to be 0 0025 kg n2o n kg n input de klein et al 2006 but some studies have suggested that this default value is highly uncertain due to the large variability in environmental conditions beaulieu et al 2011 cooper et al 2017 fu et al 2018 therefore using the default ipcc emission factor for predicting indirect n2o emissions from all aquatic ecosystems may introduce considerable biases a greater number of direct in situ measurements should be conducted for a more accurate determination of ef5 hama aziz et al 2017 he et al 2017 outram and hiscock 2012 tian et al 2017 xiao et al 2019a previous efforts have been made on the direct measurements of ef5 in inland freshwaters including rivers qin et al 2019 outram and 2012 yu et al 2013 streams fu et al 2018 hama aziz et al 2017 turner et al 2015 drainage ditches tian et al 2017 2018 lakes xiao et al 2019a 2019b and reservoirs liu et al 2017 xiao et al 2019b but in situ observation of ef5 in shallow water ponds especially those created for aquaculture purposes has thus far received little attention this knowledge gap may account for large uncertainties in the assessment of regional or global n2o budget downing 2010 estimated that the total number of small shallow ponds 0 001 km2 in the world can be as large as 3 2 billion with the total surface area of around 0 8 million km2 as an indispensable part of global shallow ponds the aquaculture ponds are widely distributed around the world fao 2017 yang et al 2020a with a total surface area of around 1 1 105 km2 verdegem and bosma 2009 in general these aquaculture ponds are semi artificial ecosystems which are maintained through daily supply of feeds containing nitrogen nutrient hu et al 2012 yang et al 2017a however only a small proportion of these feed inputs are being converted into fish biomass with a rather low feed utilization efficiency in the range of 4 0 27 4 chen et al 2016 molnar et al 2013 consequently the majority of the nitrogen nutrients in the residual feeds along with animal excreta and dead phytoplankton are retained in the pond water and the sediment surface yang et al 2017a 2019 the microbial decomposition of these organic rich materials can stimulate n2o production and thereby contribute to a large amount of indirect n2o emission however the magnitude of indirect n2o emission from aquaculture ponds and their contributions to the regional and global n2o budgets remain largely unknown owing to the paucity of field data from these systems furthermore there is currently a lack of default emission factor to estimate the indirect emission of n2o from aquaculture ponds china has the largest area of aquaculture ponds in the world fao 2017 with many of them being widely located in estuaries and bays along the coastal regions approximately 15 600 km2 60 of china s total duan et al 2020 variations in environmental conditions can have marked influences on n2o emissions from aquatic environment previous studies have identified a suite of environmental factors controlling the variability of n2o production and emission in coastal wetlands and estuaries including salinity welti et al 2017 wang et al 2018 xia et al 2019 temperature alongi et al 2005 hou et al 2013 sun et al 2013 and substrate availability kessler et al 2018 li et al 2021 wells et al 2018 with contrasting physicochemical environments along the chinese coastline the indirect n2o emission in the aquaculture ponds could vary markedly across different coastal zones detailed in situ measurements of ef5 from aquaculture ponds over various spatial and temporal scales in china are thus crucial for refining the indirect n2o emission factor used in national ghg accounting and developing more accurate approaches for quantifying the regional and global n2o budgets in this study the concentrations of dissolved n2o and no3 n in the aquaculture ponds were measured across five coastal regions in china for the determination of ef5 value based on the mass ratio of emitted n2o n to no3 n in a unit volume of pond water e g hama aziz et al 2017 ipcc 2006 xiao et al 2019a tian et al 2018 the specific objectives of this study are to 1 quantify the magnitude of ef5 values in the mariculture ponds across five coastal regions of china 2 determine the spatial variations in ef5

latitude these five coastal regions well captured the major climatic regimes ranging from tropical to temperate along the chinese coastline over a broad range of temperature and precipitation in addition the aquaculture ponds in these five regions were considered to be representative of the coastal aquaculture systems in china with similar cultured species and management practices the bohai bay bhb is located in the western part of bohai sea in china the area has a temperate oceanic monsoonal climate the multi year annual average temperature and precipitation are 13 7 c and 550 mm

et al 2020 the min river estuary mre and jiulong river estuary jre are both located in the fujian province in southeast china mre has a subtropical monsoonal climate with a multi year annual average temperature of 19 6 c and precipitation of 1 350 mm tong et al 2010 jre is influenced by a subtropical oceanic climate with an annual mean temperature and precipitation of 21 0 c and 1 371 mm respectively wang et al 2013 the tides in the two estuaries are typically semidiurnal with a mean tidal range of approximately 4 0 4 5 m the mean salinities in the aquaculture ponds in mre and jre are 4 2 0 3 and 9 2 0 6 yang et al 2018b respectively the mean water depth is 1 5 0 2 m in the studied ponds in mre and jre yang et al 2018b the changsha bay csb is located in the guangdong province in southeast china this area has a subtropical monsoonal climate with a warm and wet summer the mean annual temperature and precipitation are 21 5 c and 2100 mm respectively aquaculture pond is the most dominant wetland type with an area of 2 060 4 hm2 and accounts for 46 3 of the total area of the dongwo wetland which is the largest subzone of the larger haifeng wetland in csb the mean salinity and water depth in the aquaculture ponds in csb are 7 7 0 3 and 1 4 0 1 m respectively the beibu gulf bbg is located in the guangxi zhuang autonomous region in southwest china zhong et al 2019 it is

variations in ef5 among aquaculture ponds during the aquaculture period we collected water samples from three mariculture ponds at the shanyutan wetland of the mre fig 1b and c with the geographical coordinates of pond i pond ii and pond iii being 26 01 48 n and 119 37 37 e 26 01 44 n and 119 37 48 e and 26 01 41 n and 119 37 52 e respectively fig 1c this wetland was chosen for intensive field sampling since it was easily accessible and was one of the main study sites of our research group over the past decade on ghg emissions from aquaculture ponds operational details of the mariculture pond system has previously been reported yang et al 2017b 2020a 2020b thirty sampling campaigns were conducted at one to two week intervals over two years from june to november 2017 and may to october in 2018 following the timing of aquaculture management practices during each campaign water sampling was conducted at three to five replicate sampling sites in each pond over the study period a total of 360 water samples were collected from the three shrimp ponds for the analysis of dissolved n2o concentration and other physicochemical parameters the high frequency of sampling enabled a more accurate assessment of the temporal variation in indirect n2o emission factor in ponds furthermore in order to further determine the magnitude spatial variations and main controls of ef5 values from mariculture ponds across various coastal regions in china down the latitudinal gradient we collected surface water samples from the mariculture ponds in bhb jre csb and bbg fig 1a over the aquaculture period in 2019 2015 2019 and 2018 respectively for the determination of dissolved n2o and nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentrations water samples from the mariculture ponds in bhb and csb were taken once a month while those in jre and bbg were taken at three different culture phases i e early middle and late of the shrimp grow out cycle during each campaign three to four replicate sites were sampled in each pond 2 3 dissolved n2o concentration analysis bubble free water samples were collected from the ponds at 20 cm depth using a custom made sampler equipped with a rubber cork and transferred into 55 ml pre weighed serum glass bottles that were flushed 2 3 times with pond water thoroughly prior to filling yang et al 2020a approximately 0 2 ml of saturated hgcl2 solution was injected into each sample bottle to inhibit microbial activity zhang et al 2013 water samples were stored in an ice packed cooler during the transport back to the laboratory within 4 6 hr and were analyzed for n2o concentration within 48 h of collection dissolved n2o gas in water were extracted using the headspace equilibration method davidson et al 2015 xiao et al 2019a approximately 25 ml of ultrahigh purity nitrogen n2 gas 99 999 was injected into each serum glass bottle via a syringe to create a 25 ml headspace the bottles were then shaken vigorously for 30 min in an oscillator is rdd3 china to allow the dissolved n2o gas to achieve an equilibrium within the headspace air after waiting for 30 min approximately 8 ml of air sample was drawn from the headspace using a 15 ml gas tight syringes equipped with a three way stopcock and injected into a gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with an electron capture detector for n2o measurements the precision of n2o measurements

dissolved organic carbon doc within 48 h of collection after filtering through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter biotrans nylon membranes no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in the filtrates were measured by using a flow injection analyser skalar analytical san netherlands the detection limit and relative standard deviation rsd for both no3 n and nh4 n were 0 6 μg l 1 and 3 0 in 24 hr respectively the concentration of doc in the filtrates was measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph cpn shimadzu japan with the detection limit and rsd of 0 4 μg l 1 and 1 0 in 24 hr respectively 2 5 calculation of dissolved n2o concentration n2o flux and ef5 the original concentrations of dissolved n2o in the water samples were calculated based on the n2o concentration in the headspace air the volumes of water and headspace in the serum glass bottle as well as the bunsen solubility coefficient for n2o as a function of temperature and salinity brase et al 2017 weiss and price 1980 n2o flux μmol m 2 h 1 across the water atmosphere interface was then calculated based on the estimate of n2o gas transfer velocity using the wind speed at 10 m height and the schmidt coefficient the detailed calculations of n2o flux can be found in cooper et al 2017 the indirect n2o emission factor ef5 from the mariculture ponds was calculated based on the established ipcc methodology de klein et al 2006 which has been widely used in lakes and rivers hama aziz et al 2017 he et al 2017 turner et al 2015 xiao et al 2019a b and is represented by the following equation 1 e f 5 n 2 o n n o 3 n 100 where n

pond ii anova p 0 05 no3 n concentration fig 3 a and other environmental variables showed large seasonal variations unpublished data over the aquaculture period no3 n concentrations showed a decreasing trend in 2017 but an increasing pattern in 2018 fig 3a there were also substantial interannual variations in ph do salinity and nutrient concentrations in this study across the sampling

variations in dissolved n2o concentrations the dissolved n2o concentration in surface water varied across the three ponds fig 3b during the aquaculture period in 2017 dissolved n2o concentration varied over the ranges of 0 33 0 47 0 35 0 95 and 0 32 0 51 µg l 1 in ponds i ii and iii respectively during the aquaculture period in 2018 dissolved n2o concentration also differed greatly among the three ponds over the ranges of 0 22 0 78 0 24 1 10 and 0 21 0 79 µg l 1 in ponds i ii and iii respectively when the monthly n2o concentrations were averaged a strong spatial pattern in dissolved n2o emerged fig s1 with the concentrations increasing in the order pond ii pond i pond iii dissolved n2o concentration also showed distinct temporal variations p 0 01 with lower and higher concentrations in the aquaculture initial and final stages respectively fig 3b across all the sampling ponds the monthly average of n2o concentration in 2017 was 0 43 0 02 µg l 1 which was not significantly

0 0169 0 0029 and 0 0122 0 0020 in ponds i ii and iii respectively overall the mean ef5 in pond ii was significantly higher than that in ponds i and iii in both years p 0 05 fig 5 ef5 values also showed strong seasonal variations over the aquaculture period interestingly the seasonal dynamics of ef5 showed contrasting patterns between the two study years with an increasing trend with time in 2017 but a decreasing trend in 2018 fig 4 across all the sampling ponds the monthly average of ef5 over the aquaculture period was 0 0151 0 0024 in 2017 which was slightly higher than that in 2018 0 0127 0 0014 p 0 05 table 1 3 4 relationships between ef5 and environmental variables the results of spearman correlation analysis showed that the spatiotemporal variations in ef5 across sampling ponds within each sampling year were negatively correlated with w t ph salinity no3 n and nh4 n p 0 05 table s1 and positively correlated with the ratio of doc to no3 n p 0 01 table s1 and fig s2 when data from the two sampling years were combined together significant relationships were also found between ef5 and environmental variables w t salinity no3 n nh4 n and doc no3 n across sampling ponds p 0 01 table s1 and fig s2 the results of rda analysis showed that doc no3 n no3 n and w t made significant contributions to the spatiotemporal variations in ef5 across the sampling ponds p 0 05 fig 6 among them doc no3 n had the largest explanatory power 78 4 88 6 followed by no3 n 4 3 14 2 and w t 2 8 4 0 3 5 ef5 for mariculture ponds in different coastal areas the spatial variations in ef5 from mariculture ponds across the five coastal areas in china are shown in fig 7 the ef5 values from the mariculture ponds in bhb mre jre csb and bbg varied over the ranges of 0 0003 0 0018 0 0008 0 0543 0

significantly among the five coastal areas in the following descending order mre csb jre bbg bhb p 0 0001 4 discussions 4 1 mariculture ponds as hotspots of indirect n2o emission a previous study estimated that the indirect n2o efflux from the mariculture ponds in jre was 33 0 μg m 2 h 1 jin 2018 our results showed that the average n2o efflux in our estuarine mariculture ponds was 57 6 μg m 2 h 1 table 2 which was substantially smaller than those reported in wenwusha reservoir in the nangyangdong river estuary unpublished data rivers estuaries streams e g cooper et al 2017 he et al 2017 xiao et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 ditches drains e g audet et al 2017 xiao et al 2019b and groundwater e g laini et al 2011 on the other hand the n2o effluxes in our mariculture ponds were substantially higher than those of some rivers in uk cooper et al 2017 hama aziz et al 2017 and approximately 5 times higher than the average of 8 7 μg m 2 h 1 observed in the streams in the us corn belt turner et al 2015 mariculture ponds had larger n2o emissions as compared with the freshwater reservoirs lakes and ponds in china as well as most ditches drains and groundwater in the world table 2 the average indirect n2o emission factor of 0 0093 from mariculture ponds in china was almost three times that of the ipcc s default value of 0 0025 and one to three orders of magnitude higher than that observed in most lentic ecosystems reservoirs and lakes rivers estuaries streams ditches drains and groundwater table 2 furthermore the ef5 value in our mariculture ponds was comparable to that in some n enriched lakes in colorado mccrackin and elser 2011 and streams in the us corn belt turner et al 2015 these results indicated that mariculture ponds were hotspots of indirect n2o emission that were often overlooked in the construction of regional and global n2o budgets 4 2 spatial variations in ef5 between mariculture ponds the spatial variation in ef5 in aquaculture ponds remains poorly characterized as the first attempt to investigate the small scale spatial variations in ef5 among aquaculture ponds this study showed strong spatial variations in ef5 among the ponds with the mean value at pond ii being significantly higher than those at ponds i and iii by over 1 3 and 1 4 times respectively fig 5 and table 1 among the environmental variables recorded in this study w t ph and do were relatively constant among the three ponds while the concentrations of no3 n nh4 n and doc showed large spatial differences fig 2 over the two year study period the mean din no3 n nh4 n concentration in pond ii was higher than those in ponds i and iii by 44 and 52 respectively mean doc concentration in the water column in pond ii was also higher than those in ponds i and iii by 27 and 28 respectively the significantly higher concentrations of din and doc observed in pond ii were likely related to the massive shrimp mortality in this pond during the culture period which reduced the efficiency of feed utilization and in turn contributed to the accumulation of carbon and nutrients in the water column yang et al 2020c this was further confirmed by the significantly higher feed conversion rate fcr in pond ii 2 6 than in ponds i 1 4 and iii 1 6 by 85 and 63 respectively table s2 previous studies have found that the microbial processes of n2o production can be promoted by the large supply of carbon and nitrogen substrates subsequently increasing n2o emission to the atmosphere herrman et al 2008 xia et al 2013 xiao et al 2019a 2019b zhao et al 2013 both of these findings highlighted the important role of fcr in governing the difference in the availability of carbon and nitrogen substrates and thus the spatial variation in ef5 among the ponds although n2o production rates were not measured in our study the significant and positive relationship observed between ef5 and doc no3 n p 0 01 figs 6 and s2 confirmed the influence of available carbon and nitrogen substrates on n2o yield and indirect emission 4 3 spatial variations in ef5 for mariculture ponds across coastal regions in this study we observed considerable variations in the ef5 of n2o from mariculture ponds across regions with significantly higher averages in mre jre and csb than in the other two regions by a difference of up to one to two orders of magnitude fig 7 among all the environmental variables investigated in this study salinity had marked spatial variations with a range of 4 2 34 3 salinity controls the mineralization rate of nitrogen through its effect on microbial activity and enzymatic reactions thereby regulating the rates of n2o production consumption and emission into the atmosphere some studies suggested that high salinity can reduce microbial diversity francis et al 2003 li et al 2020 moin et al 2009 mosier and francis 2008 and activity wang et al 2010 especially the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aobs with the consequence of reducing n2o production in the sediment and water column rysgaard et al 1999 wang et al 2018 a negative relationship between salinity and n2o concentrations or flux has been reported in coastal wetlands and aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2015 sun et al 2013 wang et al 2018 welti et al 2017 similarly we found a significant and negative correlation between salinity and dissolved n2o concentrations in this study p 0 01 fig s3a furthermore the ef5 and salinity exhibited opposite spatial patterns across the five regions p 0 01 fig s3b these findings indicated that salinity was likely an important environmental factor governing ef5 dynamics in coastal aquaculture ponds annual average air temperature varied greatly across the five coastal regions in the present study ranging between 13 and 23 c previous studies have demonstrated positive effects of temperature on denitrification rate hou et al 2013 reisinger et al 2016 and n2o emissions herrman et al 2008 tian et al 2017 owing to the enhancement of organic carbon and nitrate availability as well as the activities of denitrifiers under high temperature tatti et al 2015 xia et al 2019 although we did not quantify denitrification rate in this study we did observe larger ef5 from mre jre csb and bbg regions with higher temperature the significant and positive relationship between ef5 and air temperature found in our study p 0 01 r 2 0 79 suggested that temperature was also an important factor influencing the regional variations in ef5 in ponds interestingly although bbg had the highest mean temperature its ef5 was substantially lower than those in mre jre and csb fig 7 which was probably due to the overriding suppression effects of high salinity on n2o production in bbg ponds these findings suggested that higher temperature combined with lower salinity could lead to higher indirect n2o emissions from mariculture ponds in the coastal areas in addition annual average precipitation varied greatly across the five regions with a range of 550 mm 2 100 mm precipitation in bhb was much lower than those in the other four regions a positive relationship between ef5 and precipitation was observed in our study p 0 01 r 2 0 79 which was consistent with the previous findings in the agriculture watersheds outram and hiscock 2012 tian et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 our results revealed that the differences in ef5 from mariculture ponds across regions might also be related to the variations in precipitation precipitation affects indirect n2o emissions mainly through its dilution effect on water salinity which in turn increases denitrification and subsequently n2o production further studies using controlled experiments should be carried out to test the above hypothesis notably the bbg had a high precipitation 16 700 mm but a substantially lower ef5 than in mre and jre this could be attributed mainly to that the lower amount of catchment runoff and river discharge received at bbg leading to a greater water salinity that could inhibit denitrification and n2o production therefore the impacts of hydrologic regimes should also be considered in accounting for the spatial variations in ef5 in mariculture ponds across different coastal regions 4 4 temporal patterns of ef5 and their regulating factors large seasonal variation in ef5 values has been reported in various water bodies e g river ditches lakes and reservoirs in the agricultural watersheds e g cooper et al 2017 hama aziz et al 2017 qin et al 2019 tian et al 2018 xiao et al 2019b which corresponds to the temporal patterns of nitrogen loads arising from agricultural leaching and runoff hama aziz et al 2017 qin et al 2019 tian et al 2017 2018 consistent with the findings of some previous studies conducted in rivers beaulieu et al 2011 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 hu et al 2016 qin et al 2019 xiao et al 2019b streams mulholland et al 2008 lakes xiao et al 2019a and reservoirs xiao et al 2019b the ef5 values from the aquaculture ponds in this study were also negatively correlated with nitrogen loadings p 0 01 figs s2a 2c and table s1 which could be attributed to the reduction in microbial activity with increasing nitrogen inputs as a result of biological saturation li et al 2021 hu et al 2016 mulholland et al 2008 xiao et al 2019a apart from nitrogen availability carbon substrate was another key factor controlling the n2o production processes previous studies have suggested that carbon limitation during denitrification was related to the enhanced n2o production capodici et al 2018 kampschreur et al 2009 in general a high c n ratio may increase the availability of labile carbon sources leading to an enhancement of denitrification rates capodici et al 2018 xiao et al 2019a zhao et al 2013 consequently the significantly correlation between the ef5 and doc no3 n mass ratio has been reported in previous studies e g cooper et al 2017 hu et al 2016 qin et al 2019 xiao et al 2019a 2019b although denitrification rates in the present study were unavailable the significant relationship between ef5 values and water doc no3 n mass ratio p 0 01 figs s2d 2f and table s1 implied that the seasonal variability in ef5 could be partly related to the availability of carbon substrate fig 6 interannual variations in indirect n2o emissions from water bodies in the agricultural watersheds have been reported in previous studies e g griffis et al 2017 hama aziz et al 2017 qin et al 2019 xiao et al 2019a which could be largely governed by temperature griffis et al 2017 xiao et al 2019a a higher water temperature combined with a higher no3 n level in water bodies could stimulate denitrification herrman et al 2008 ma et al 2020 tian et al 2017 ultimately resulting in greater n2o emission griffis et al 2017 tian et al 2018 although the mean ef5 in 2017 was higher than that in 2018 fig 4 no significant difference in water temperature was observed between the two years p 0 05 fig 2a other environmental factors might outweigh temperature in affecting n2o production via nitrification and denitrification in these ponds among the variables investigated in this study no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in 2017 were higher than those in 2018 fig 2e which were consistent with the interannual variations in ef5 hence the difference in nitrogen substrate availability caused by fcr might play a dominant role in governing the interannual variation in ef5from aquaculture ponds in addition water salinity was significantly lower in 2017 than in 2018 p 0 05 fig 2d as a result of greater freshwater dilution caused by intensive rainfall in 2017 this reduction in water salinity could reduce the stress on denitrifying bacteria and thus contribute to the higher indirect n2o emissions observed in 2017 4 5 implications for ef5 from mariculture ponds the ipcc has proposed a default value of indirect n2o emissions factor ef5 of 0 0025 however several studies investigating the indirect n2o emissions from leaching and runoff have suggested an underestimation e g beaulieu et al 2011 yu et al 2013 turner et al 2015 fu et al 2018 or overestimation outram and hiscock 2012 hama aziz et al 2017 of the default ef5 value given that the limited availability of field data remains a major source of uncertainty in the use of ef5 value a greater number of ef5 field measurements in various types of aquatic systems are needed to improve the estimation of indirect n2o emissions in this study we made the attempt to determine the magnitude of ef5 from the mariculture ponds along the chinese coastlines across the latitudinal gradient and found a wide range of ef5 values across different coastal regions 0 0008 0 0136 fig 7 the overall mean ef5 from the mariculture ponds was 0 0093 which was approximately 3 5 times higher than the ipcc default value our results further confirmed that the use of a single ef5 for all water bodies in ghg accounting might be inappropriate beaulieu et al 2011 although the ef5 values have been widely reported in different water bodies e g fu et al 2018 hama aziz et al 2017 liu et al 2017 turner et al 2015 tian et al 2017 xiao et al 2019a 2019b the spatiotemporal variations in ef5 remain poorly investigated qin et al 2019 xiao et al 2019a our results showed remarkable spatial variations in the ef5 from coastal aquaculture ponds fig 7 the coefficient of variation cv of ef5 across the five study regions was 59 which implied a large uncertainty of estimated ef5 based on measurements in a single region meanwhile we also observed large temporal variations in ef5 values across the mariculture ponds with the cv ranging between 71 and 104 fig 4 suggesting that a single default ef5 value might not be able to represent the changes in indirect n2o emissions during the aquaculture period thus it is very important to measure from as many sites as practicable across different seasons in order to reduce the uncertainty of ef5 estimation and improve our understanding of n2o dynamics in aquatic ecosystems our field observation confirmed the large spatial variation in ef5 among different coastal regions and among aquaculture ponds in the same region at the larger spatial scale among regions high salinity constrained ef5 while at the smaller spatial scale among ponds in the same region the low turnover rate of bait increased ef5 our results indicated the importance of controlling salinity and improving the fcr in aquaculture ponds for mitigating n2o emissions 4 6 study limitations and recommendations for future research as in most studies there are several limitations in the current study the indirect n2o emission factors in aquatic systems could be obtained by two different approaches n2o n no3 n mass ratio method and ipcc 2006 method similar to many studies e g turner et al 2015 xiao et al 2019a zhang et al 2020 this research calculated ef5 in mariculture ponds using the n2o n no3 n mass ratio method however in inland freshwater environments the ef5 values calculated using the ipcc 2006 method were shown to be lower than those determined by the n2o n no3 n mass ratio method hama aziz et al 2017 qin et al 2019 future research should compare the use of both methods for a more accurate estimation of ef5 from mariculture ponds moreover the fcr in mariculture ponds could vary greatly among different aquaculture types which could affect the ef5 values in this study only one specific cultured species litopenaeus vannamei was considered which could lead to some uncertainties when the data are scaled up from local to regional levels to obtain a more precise picture of the national and global ef5 from mariculture ponds more in situ direct measurements covering different aquaculture types are needed furthermore this study examined the ef5 value and environmental factors in the field by water sampling and analysis however it is also important to assess the contribution of individual mechanistic processes e g n2o production and consumption and the abundance and activity of various microorganisms e g nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in relation to n2o emissions lastly our field sampling campaigns across the five coastal regions were conducted in multiple years the interannual variability in some environment variables e g precipitation and temperature may introduce additional uncertainties to our results in future work a series of advanced strategies should be adopted to simultaneously measure ef5 in aquaculture ponds across different coastal regions 5 conclusions while n2o is one of the major ghgs and ozone depleting substances the indirect n2o emission factor ef5 in aquatic environment remains poorly understood the present study made the first attempt to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in ef5 and their potential controls in the coastal aquaculture ponds in china in five different regions our results demonstrated considerable spatial and temporal variations in the ef5 values from aquaculture ponds the temporal variation in ef5 was strongly controlled by the doc no3 n mass ratio the feed conversion rate played an important role in governing the small scale spatial variations in ef5 among the aquaculture ponds salinity was the main factor influencing ef5 among different coastal regions overall the mean ef5 in aquaculture ponds across different coastal regions was 0 0093 0 0024 which was substantially higher than the ipcc default value 0 0025 our results provided a solid scientific basis for refining the existing indirect n2o emission factors which could help to improve the standardization of ghg accounting methods and reduce the uncertainties in estimating n2o emissions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16927,wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been shown to coincide with or anticipate confirmed covid 19 case numbers during periods with high test positivity rates however case numbers may be underreported whereas wastewater does not suffer from this limitation here we investigated how the dynamics of new covid 19 infections estimated based on wastewater monitoring or confirmed cases compare to true covid 19 incidence dynamics we focused on the first pandemic wave in switzerland february to april 2020 when test positivity ranged up to 26 sars cov 2 rna loads were determined 2 4 times per week in three swiss wastewater treatment plants lugano lausanne and zurich wastewater and case data were combined with a shedding load distribution and an infection to case confirmation delay distribution respectively to estimate infection incidence dynamics finally the estimates were compared to reference incidence dynamics determined by a validated compartmental model incidence dynamics estimated based on wastewater data were found to better track the timing and shape of the reference infection peak compared to estimates based on confirmed cases in contrast case confirmations provided a better estimate of the subsequent decline in infections under a regime of high test positivity rates wbe thus provides critical information that is complementary to clinical data to monitor the pandemic trajectory graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage new infections compartmental model shedding load distribution sars cov 2 disease dynamics 1 introduction wastewater based epidemiology wbe a form of environmental surveillance of infectious diseases has long been suggested as a sensitive tool to monitor pathogen circulation in a population fernandez cassi et al 2018 hovi et al 2012 sinclair et al 2008 many pathogens both enteric and otherwise are excreted from infected individuals into the sewage system via feces saliva or other bodily fluids sinclair et al 2008 the principle underlying wbe is that the pathogen concentrations or loads in sewage are proportional to the number of infected individuals among the population contributing to the sewage and can thus inform on the presence and trajectory of a disease outbreak for example norovirus concentrations in sewage were found to closely track the dynamics gastroenteritis cases over several years in japan kazama et al 2017 wbe can inform not only on the presence and dynamics of a pathogen but may also capture the emergence of new strains or variants before they become widespread in a population bisseux et al 2020 kazama et al 2017 wbe has received renewed attention during the covid 19 pandemic when it was recognized that sars cov 2 rna is excreted in feces y wu et al 2020 and can be detected in wastewater ahmed et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 and sludge graham et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 several studies have shown that the dynamics of sars cov 2 rna in raw wastewater or sludge coincide with or even anticipate the dynamics of confirmed cases graham et al 2021 medema et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 in addition wbe was able to capture the introduction and spread of sars cov 2 variants of concern jahn et al 2021 and identify mutations that were not captured in clinical samples crits christoph et al 2021 wbe may thus serve as a useful tool to support covid 19 monitoring and wbe data have already been integrated into multiple national or local covid 19 dashboards while wbe will never replace case reporting it can be used to strengthen the understanding of infectious disease dynamics as it holds important benefits over clinical tests specifically wbe captures both symptomatic and asymptomatic virus shedders wbe data are not affected by testing capacity strategy or compliance and wbe allows the monitoring of a large population with few samples the advantages of wbe over clinical testing are particularly important when test capacity is exceeded and hence may be insufficient to accurately capture case numbers according to the who the test positivity rate should remain 5 to confidently track disease dynamics world health organization 2020 under regimes with a positivity rate 5 wbe may thus better reflect true disease dynamics than clinical case numbers in this study we evaluated the use of wastewater monitoring as a tool to track covid 19 dynamics we hypothesized that under high test positivity rates wastewater provides an improved estimate of the dynamics of new infections incidence dynamics compared to confirmed case numbers we focused on the first wave of the covid 19 pandemic in switzerland which lasted from late february to april 2020 the test positivity rate during this period ranged up to 26 figure s1 wastewater was monitored 2 4 times per week in two locations lugano lausanne that were strongly affected and one location zurich that experienced a milder wave we did not directly evaluate sars cov 2 rna loads measured in wastewater against the number of confirmed cases instead we use these metrics to estimate the incidence dynamics over time this allowed us to compare both the wastewater and the case number derived incidence dynamics to reference incidence dynamics determined retrospectively by a compartmental susceptible exposed infected recovered seir model and consistent with seroprevalence studies conducted in the region lemaitre et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental approach we determined the concentration and daily loads of sars cov 2 rna in longitudinal samples of raw wastewater collected from three swiss wastewater treatment plants wwtps in each sample we analyzed two sars cov 2 gene targets n1 and n2 in addition we determined virus recovery by means of an externally added viral surrogate of sars cov 2 finally we monitored the fecal strength in each sample via the analysis of pepper mild mottle virus pmmov a plant virus that occurs in wastewater at high and constant concentrations kitajima et al 2014 symonds et al 2018 2 2 sample collection and storage 24 h composite influent samples were collected 2 4 times per week

study l day 2 9 storage test to determine if storage at 20 c had a detrimental effect on sars cov 2 rna concentrations in wastewater a control experiment was conducted a batch of wastewater influent from lausanne was collected and stored for a month in four different conditions 1 unprocessed wastewater at 4 c 2 unprocessed wastewater at 20 c 3 concentrated wastewater after ultrafiltration at 20 c and 4 zymo treated rna extract at 20 c all tests were conducted in duplicate after one month all samples were fully processed and immediately analyzed for the n1 gene target by rt qpcr as described above 2 10 epidemiological data confirmed case numbers for each wwtp catchment and test positivity rates were kindly provided by the swiss federal office of public health 2 11 incidence estimates reference infection numbers were determined by an seir model described previously lemaitre et al 2020 this model is based on cantonal hospitalization data intensive care unit visits and deaths but not case numbers this is to avoid any influence from changes in test strategies and test capacity over the time period considered the modeled incidence includes both symptomatic and asymptomatic new infections the model was validated against a seroprevalence study conducted in the region and we therefore consider it herein as the reference incidence incidence was additionally estimated based on longitudinal data of sars cov 2 loads in wastewater and based on confirmed cases both these metrics measured at time t reflect an aggregate of infections that occurred over a time span preceding the measurement a deconvolution of these aggregated quantities allows for the reconstruction of daily infections this requires an assumption of the extent by which previous infections influence the aggregated quantities this assumption is expressed by time delay dependent weight ω τ where τ is the time days since infection the measured aggregated quantity a at time t can be approximated by a weighted sum of all infections i that occurred up to time t 3 a t τ 0 ω r l t τ the infections i over a time range of interest can be estimated via non negative least squares regression as fast fluctuations in the number of daily infections seems unreasonable an additional constraint was added to enforce smoothness comparable to the infection numbers of the seir model see supporting information to obtain the wastewater derived incidence the weights of the deconvolution ω τ are given by the shedding load profile slp that describes the average amount of virus shed by a patient τ days after infection the slp can be decomposed into the relative shedding load probability distribution sld and the absolute viral load shed during the course of the disease l eq 4 4 slp τ l sld τ the sld was constructed by combining the gastrointestinal viral load as a function of time after symptom onset with the time between infection and symptoms virus shedding was modelled based on data reviewed by benefield et al 2020 and could be well described by a gamma distribution with a mean of 6 73 days and a standard deviation sd of 6 98 days the time between infection and symptoms was also modeled by a gamma distribution based on linton et al 2020 mean 5 3 days sd 3 2 days the convolution of these two distributions was used as the sld shown in fig 1 a with a mean 11 73 days and an sd 7 68 days if l is known with small uncertainty the absolute number of infections can be estimated however although the different slds have a comparable shape across literature the loads l are highly variable han et al 2020 liu et al 2020 therefore we applied the sld which still yields an estimate that is proportional to that obtained by using the correct but unknown slp for the case number derived incidence ω τ was defined by the distribution combining the delays from infection to symptom onset gamma mean 5 3 days sd 3 2 days and from symptom onset to case confirmation gamma mean 5 5 days sd 3 8 days bi et al 2020 the resulting delay distribution from infection to case confirmation is visualized in fig 1b 2 12 data analysis all statistical analyses were performed in r r core team 2016 the non negative least square regression for the incidence estimations was implemented with the package cvxr fu et al 2020 and delay distributions were computed with the r package distr ruckdeschel and kohl 2014 2 13 data availability data measured rna concentrations flow rates and case numbers are available at http doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4750572 3 results and discussion 3 1 method performance 3 1 1 pcr efficiency and limit of detection pcr efficiencies for all targets ranged from 94 111 table s2 the r2 of the pooled standard curves were 0 95 no amplification signal was measured in the non template and negative extraction controls confirming the absence of contamination during sample processing the lod corresponded to 4 2 gc ml wastewater and 2 6 gc ml wastewater for the sars cov 2 n1 and n2 genes respectively the lods reflect the difficulty of producing accurate calibration curves for sars cov 2 in the low template range based on plasmid standards this limitation which was also reported by others chik et al 2021 gerrity et al 2021 highlights the need for improved qpcr standards and more sensitive rt qpcr assays to minimize variability and false negative results in sars cov 2 rna quantification the lods of the other targets are listed in table s2 3 1 2 pcr inhibition spiking rna extracts with synthetic sars cov 2 rna reference material revealed minimal pcr inhibition on most samples specifically with the exception of three samples from lugano all spiked rna extracts exhibited n1 cq values that fell within or only minimally beyond 1 5 cycles of the median cq of a given wwtp figure s2 3 1 3 reproducibility we compared quantifiable n1 concentrations determined in biological as well as in technical replicate samples figure s3 a good correlation r 0 89 was obtained among biological replicates indicating a high reproducibility of the overall processing pipeline a good reproducibility was also found for technical replicates r 0 78 3 1 4 recovery three enveloped viruses mhv sendai virus and φ6 were evaluated as sars cov 2 surrogates to monitor virus recovery in our sample processing pipeline as a member of the coronaviridae family mhv is the most similar to sars cov 2 in terms of size 120 nm diameter and genome structure single stranded rna sendai virus has a single stranded rna genome but is slightly larger in diameter than sars cov 2 150 nm besides sars cov 2 this virus may also serve as a surrogate for viruses with pandemic potential in the paramyxoviridae family such as measles virus the novel rt qpcr assay developed herein was able to quantify its concentration down to an lod of 4 2 gc ml table s2 finally φ6 is the least similar surrogate to sars cov 2 it has a smaller diameter 85 nm and a different genome structure double stranded rna in seven wastewater samples spiked with all three surrogate viruses mhv and sendai virus exhibited similar recoveries that mostly ranged from 0 1 1 figure s4 this range corresponds well to that reported by other groups using a similar processing pipeline pecson et al 2021 if determined using φ6 recoveries were 10 to 100 fold higher and more constant across samples this confirms previous reports that recoveries depend strongly on the surrogate virus used pecson et al 2021 despite the better recovery of φ6 we decided to utilize mhv or sendai virus as recovery controls in this work due to their higher structural similarity with sars cov 2 the recoveries in the samples from lugano and lausanne were determined using mhv figure s5 recoveries were similar for both sites and mostly fell into the 0 1 1 range with average values of 0 95 and 0 74 for lugano and lausanne respectively in the samples from zurich sendai virus was used as the surrogate compared to lugano and lausanne the recoveries were significantly lower with an average of 0 17 one way anova f 6 82 p 0 002 figure s5 the lower recovery is unlikely to be a result of the use of sendai virus since mhv and sendai virus yielded similar recoveries if assessed in the same sample figure s4 instead the lower recoveries in the zurich samples may reflect the higher solids content in this wwtp enveloped viruses partition to wastewater solids ye et al 2016 and hence a higher solids content leads to a reduced recovery of the surrogate virus from the liquid wastewater fraction 3 1 5 fecal load the daily load of pmmov was used as an indicator of the fecal load entering the wwtp on average the pmmov loads corresponded to 8 9 1015 gc day lugano 3 1 1016 gc day lausanne and 1 8 1016 gc day zurich figure s6 in all but five samples the pmmov load fell within the range of 5 1015 to 5 1016 gc day the narrow range of the measured pmmov loads further confirms the consistency of our virus concentration and extraction process 3 1 6 effect of storage conditions on rna stability as shown in fig 2 different storage procedures exert significantly different effects on sars cov 2 rna stability one way anova f 12 8 p 0 001 storing raw wastewater at 4 c or 20 c for a month resulted in lower concentrations of sars cov 2 rna compared to samples stored as concentrates or rna extracts at 20 c tukey kramer p 0 02 the storage protocol used herein raw wastewater at 20 c had to be implemented before storage tests could be completed and likely led to significant rna decay in future studies wastewater samples should immediately be concentrated or extracted prior to storage 3 2 longitudinal trends sars cov 2 rna loads and confirmed cases concentrations of sars cov 2 n1 and n2 gene targets in longitudinal samples are shown in figure s7 the earliest detection of the n1 gene occurred in wastewater from lugano on february 28 2020 four days after the first covid 19 case was observed in switzerland this confirms earlier reports that wastewater can serve as a sensitive indicator for virus circulation even during periods of low disease prevalence ahmed et al 2021 la rosa et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 n1 and n2 concentrations exhibited similar temporal trends though n1 concentrations were on average 3 fold higher figure s7 higher concentrations of the n1 gene were also reported by others d aoust et al 2021 gerrity et al 2021 though some studies have reported the n2 gene to yield higher results gonzalez et al 2020 medema et al 2020 given the superior quantification by n1 in this work only this gene target was considered for all subsequent analyses we did not normalize n1 concentrations by fecal strength pmmov concentration as suggested elsewhere d aoust et al 2021 wu et al 2020 because pmmov concentrations were similar in all samples and were not correlated with n1 concentrations r 0 02 0 04 figure s8 we also did not correct n1 concentrations for recovery because there was high inter sample variation across the three surrogates tested and it is uncertain which if any externally added surrogate accurately mimics the fate of sars cov 2 during sample processing chik et al 2021 graham et al 2021 recovery values were strictly used for data quality control specifically samples were excluded if two criteria were simultaneously met the recovery of a sample was 3 the median recovery for the site under consideration and the concentrations measured by n1 and n2 differed by more than a factor 5 this led to the exclusion of one biological replicate on three sampling days in lugano march 18 19 and april 5 and both replicates for a single day in lausanne march 28 among the three wwtps studied lausanne had the highest number of confirmed cases in its catchment fig 3 case numbers were similar in the catchments of the lugano and zurich wwtps even though zurich s catchment encompasses approximately 3 6 fold more inhabitants than lugano s and 1 9 fold more than lausanne s consequently the n1 concentrations in the zurich wwtp were expected to be lower compared to lugano and lausanne as confirmed by our measurements figure s7 to enable a direct comparison among wwtps we converted n1 concentrations into units of daily n1 load eq 2 this unit accounts for differences in catchment size via the daily wastewater flow rate and also incorporates daily variability in the wastewater flow of a given wwtp similar to data from other studies gerrity et al 2021 graham et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 there was considerable day to day variability in both the n1 loads and the number of confirmed cases fig 3 the variability in confirmed cases is increased by the fact that switzerland reduces testing and reporting on weekends to facilitate the visualization of pandemic trends in wastewater and case data we therefore calculated weekly averages monday sunday for each data set the corresponding results are shown as solid lines in fig 3 as is evident both data sets feature a prominent peak in late march however the wastewater peak shape is narrow whereas the number of confirmed cases remained high for 2 3 weeks despite the similarity in confirmed case numbers in the catchment measured sars cov 2 rna loads were higher in the lugano wwtp than in zurich wwtp there are a number of potential methodological explanations for this including lower virus recovery in zurich figure s5 reduced precision in quantifying low sars cov 2 rna copy numbers figure s7 and our sample storage protocol which in retrospect was found to be non ideal fig 2 the zurich wwtp is located in the area of lowest disease prevalence and thus had the lowest starting concentrations of sars cov 2 rna among the wwtps sampled further decay during storage of the zurich samples may have lowered the concentrations below the lod in all but the samples taken during the peak of the first wave 3 3 comparison of incidence dynamics from wastewater data case numbers and seir models to assess the ability to track disease dynamics with sars cov 2 loads in wastewater and confirmed cases both data sets were used to estimate disease incidence over time by deconvoluting the signals see materials and methods the resulting trends were compared to the reference incidence determined by an seir model lemaitre et al 2020 while the seir model reports absolute infection numbers this determination is currently not feasible for wastewater or case number derived estimates for wastewater estimating absolute infection numbers would require a better understanding of the magnitude of the shedding load l eq 4 the decay kinetics of sars cov 2 rna in the sewer system and the true recovery of sars cov 2 in our sample processing pipeline these parameters are currently not available but may become better known in the future for case numbers the ratio of confirmed to total cases would have to be known yet this parameter is associated with considerable uncertainty and variability during the first wave of the pandemic we therefore only compared the incidence dynamics but not the absolute incidence per day as shown in fig 4 both wastewater and case number derived incidence exhibited a pronounced peak in mid march in lausanne the wastewater derived incidence exhibited the highest number of infections from march 13 15 which matches the peak of infections determined by the seir model if estimated based on confirmed cases the highest number of new infections occurred from march 9 11 considering the delay distributions from infection to case confirmation fig 1b this time range mainly reflects cases observed from march 17 24 coinciding with swiss wide positivity rates 10 figure s1 the premature timing of the peak may indicate that case numbers were truncated when testing capacity was exceeded and positivity rates were high in lugano wastewater based incidence estimates yielded the highest infection numbers from march 10 12 this time frame partly overlapped with the seir modelled infection peak which occurred from march 12 14 in contrast the incidence peak determined from confirmed cases appeared later march 17 19 and differed in shape compared to the other incidence estimates this is another indication testing capacity during this period was insufficient to capture the full extent of the rise in cases during the height of the first wave in both locations the decline in new infections was better captured by case number than by wastewater based incidence estimates in lausanne the case number based incidence exhibited a slow decay in new infections from mid march to late april similar to the reference incidence dynamics in contrast the decay in the wastewater based incidence was faster in lugano the case number derived incidence was also able to capture the tail end of the wave whereas new infections based on wastewater data rapidly dropped to the baseline finally the wastewater based incidence dynamics in both locations exhibited a second smaller peak in april which was driven by few high load measurements in each location in lausanne this feature also appeared in the corresponding case number derived incidence dynamics and thus reflects a local spike in infections in contrast the origin of the second peak in lugano is not evident it may stem from one or more shedders that are not permanent inhabitants of the lugano wwtp catchment and were therefore not included in the catchment specific case numbers e g commuters or external patients hospitalized within the catchment the april peaks were not apparent in the seir model which may be explained by differences in the type of input data used to determine incidence dynamics whereas wastewater loads and case numbers were catchment specific the seir model was based on data for the entire canton local spikes in case numbers would thus appear attenuated in the reference incidence 4 conclusions our findings demonstrate that both confirmed case numbers and wastewater analysis are useful and independent metrics to estimate covid 19 infection incidence dynamics wastewater outperformed case numbers with respect to the timing and shape of the peak incidence whereas confirmed case numbers were a better indicator for incidence decline in combination the two metrics yielded complementary information on incidence dynamics that correspond well to the reference dynamics determined by compartmental models it is important to consider that all three approaches rely on a number of assumptions all of which are associated with a degree of uncertainty for example the seir model is based exclusively on data pertaining to severe covid 19 cases hospitalizations deaths and may thus miss events among age classes that have a low severity rate but normal virus shedding wastewater derived incidence dynamics suffer from uncertainties in the accuracy of the sld and cases number derived estimates rely on the delay distribution between infection and case confirmation which may vary with time and location while the sources of uncertainties of these assumptions are conceptually understood they remain difficult to quantify due to the lack of reference data it is therefore important and encouraging that despite these uncertainties comparable incidence dynamics were obtained with three independent approaches differences in the incidence dynamics determined by wastewater and confirmed cases may ultimately also be exploited to inform on the duration and degree of clinical undertesting to do so however both incidence estimates need to be further advanced in future work wastewater derived estimates can be enhanced by increasing the wastewater sampling frequency to smooth out measurement outliers developing more sensitive assays to quantify the viral rna at low concentrations better determining sars cov 2 rna recovery from wastewater and establishing a representative shedding load profile case number derived incidence estimates can be improved by taking into account variations in the delay distributions from symptom onset to case confirmation in switzerland the mean delay varied from 3 to 8 days during the first wave huisman et al 2020 yet herein it was held constant at 5 5 days compared to the compartmental model which relies on hospitalization and deaths wbe can determine incidence dynamics with a faster turnaround time rna loads can be measured within 24 hours after sampling compared to clinical tests an additional advantage of wbe is that a much lower number of samples is required to determine incidence dynamics with reasonable accuracy during high positivity rate regimes wbe can thus yield information on the trajectory of a pandemic that is potentially more precise more readily available and more economical than information from clinical data we contend that wbe should be included by epidemiologists and public health agencies as a useful pandemic monitoring tool during periods with high test positivity rates

16927,wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been shown to coincide with or anticipate confirmed covid 19 case numbers during periods with high test positivity rates however case numbers may be underreported whereas wastewater does not suffer from this limitation here we investigated how the dynamics of new covid 19 infections estimated based on wastewater monitoring or confirmed cases compare to true covid 19 incidence dynamics we focused on the first pandemic wave in switzerland february to april 2020 when test positivity ranged up to 26 sars cov 2 rna loads were determined 2 4 times per week in three swiss wastewater treatment plants lugano lausanne and zurich wastewater and case data were combined with a shedding load distribution and an infection to case confirmation delay distribution respectively to estimate infection incidence dynamics finally the estimates were compared to reference incidence dynamics determined by a validated compartmental model incidence dynamics estimated based on wastewater data were found to better track the timing and shape of the reference infection peak compared to estimates based on confirmed cases in contrast case confirmations provided a better estimate of the subsequent decline in infections under a regime of high test positivity rates wbe thus provides critical information that is complementary to clinical data to monitor the pandemic trajectory graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage new infections compartmental model shedding load distribution sars cov 2 disease dynamics 1 introduction wastewater based epidemiology wbe a form of environmental surveillance of infectious diseases has long been suggested as a sensitive tool to monitor pathogen circulation in a population fernandez cassi et al 2018 hovi et al 2012 sinclair et al 2008 many pathogens both enteric and otherwise are excreted from infected individuals into the sewage system via feces saliva or other bodily fluids sinclair et al 2008 the principle underlying wbe is that the pathogen concentrations or loads in sewage are proportional to the number of infected individuals among the population contributing to the sewage and can thus inform on the presence and trajectory of a disease outbreak for example norovirus concentrations in sewage were found to closely track the dynamics gastroenteritis cases over several years in japan kazama et al 2017 wbe can inform not only on the presence and dynamics of a pathogen but may also capture the emergence of new strains or variants before they become widespread in a population bisseux et al 2020 kazama et al 2017 wbe has received renewed attention during the covid 19 pandemic when it was recognized that sars cov 2 rna is excreted in feces y wu et al 2020 and can be detected in wastewater ahmed et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 and sludge graham et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 several studies have shown that the dynamics of sars cov 2 rna in raw wastewater or sludge coincide with or even anticipate the dynamics of confirmed cases graham et al 2021 medema et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 in addition wbe was able to capture the introduction and spread of sars cov 2 variants of concern jahn et al 2021 and identify mutations that were not captured in clinical samples crits christoph et al 2021 wbe may thus serve as a useful tool to support covid 19 monitoring and wbe data have already been integrated into multiple national or local covid 19 dashboards while wbe will never replace case reporting it can be used to strengthen the understanding of infectious disease dynamics as it holds important benefits over clinical tests specifically wbe captures both symptomatic and asymptomatic virus shedders wbe data are not affected by testing capacity strategy or compliance and wbe allows the monitoring of a large population with few samples the advantages of wbe over clinical testing are particularly important when test capacity is exceeded and hence may be insufficient to accurately capture case numbers according to the who the test positivity rate should remain 5 to confidently track disease dynamics world health organization 2020 under regimes with a positivity rate 5 wbe may thus better reflect true disease dynamics than clinical case numbers in this study we evaluated the use of wastewater monitoring as a tool to track covid 19 dynamics we hypothesized that under high test positivity rates wastewater provides an improved estimate of the dynamics of new infections incidence dynamics compared to confirmed case numbers we focused on the first wave of the covid 19 pandemic in switzerland which lasted from late february to april 2020 the test positivity rate during this period ranged up to 26 figure s1 wastewater was monitored 2 4 times per week in two locations lugano lausanne that were strongly affected and one location zurich that experienced a milder wave we did not directly evaluate sars cov 2 rna loads measured in wastewater against the number of confirmed cases instead we use these metrics to estimate the incidence dynamics over time this allowed us to compare both the wastewater and the case number derived incidence dynamics to reference incidence dynamics determined retrospectively by a compartmental susceptible exposed infected recovered seir model and consistent with seroprevalence studies conducted in the region lemaitre et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental approach we determined the concentration and daily loads of sars cov 2 rna in longitudinal samples of raw wastewater collected from three swiss wastewater treatment plants wwtps in each sample we analyzed two sars cov 2 gene targets n1 and n2 in addition we determined virus

study l day 2 9 storage test to determine if storage at 20 c had a detrimental effect on sars cov 2 rna concentrations in wastewater a control experiment was conducted a batch of wastewater influent from lausanne was collected and stored for a month in four different conditions 1 unprocessed wastewater at 4 c 2 unprocessed wastewater at 20 c 3 concentrated wastewater after ultrafiltration at 20 c and 4 zymo treated rna extract at 20 c all tests were conducted in duplicate after one month all samples were fully processed and immediately analyzed for the n1 gene target by rt qpcr as described above 2 10 epidemiological data confirmed case numbers for each wwtp catchment and test positivity rates were kindly provided by the swiss federal office of public health 2 11 incidence estimates reference infection numbers were determined by an seir model described previously lemaitre et al 2020 this model is based on cantonal hospitalization data intensive care unit visits and deaths but not case numbers this is to avoid any influence from changes in test strategies and test capacity over the time period considered the modeled incidence includes both symptomatic and asymptomatic new infections the model was validated against a seroprevalence study conducted in the region and we therefore consider it herein as the reference incidence incidence was additionally estimated based on longitudinal data of sars cov 2 loads in wastewater and based on confirmed cases both these metrics measured at time t reflect an aggregate of infections that occurred over a time span preceding the measurement a deconvolution of these aggregated quantities allows for the reconstruction of daily infections this requires an assumption of the extent by which previous infections influence the aggregated quantities this assumption is expressed by time delay dependent weight ω τ where τ is the time days since infection the measured aggregated quantity a at time t can be approximated by a weighted sum of all infections i that occurred up to time t 3 a t τ 0 ω r l t τ the infections i over a time range of interest can be estimated via non negative least squares regression as fast fluctuations in the number of daily infections seems unreasonable an additional constraint was added to enforce smoothness comparable to the infection numbers of the seir model see supporting information to obtain the wastewater derived incidence the weights of the deconvolution ω τ are given by the shedding load profile slp that describes the average amount of virus shed by a patient τ days after infection the slp can be decomposed into the relative shedding load probability distribution sld and the absolute viral load shed during the course of the disease l eq 4 4 slp τ l sld τ the sld was constructed by combining the gastrointestinal viral load as a function of time after symptom onset with the time between infection and symptoms virus shedding was modelled based on data reviewed by benefield et al 2020 and could be well described by a gamma distribution with a mean of 6 73 days and a standard deviation sd of 6 98 days the time between infection and symptoms was also modeled by a gamma distribution based on linton et al 2020 mean 5 3 days sd 3 2 days the convolution of these two distributions was used as the sld shown in fig 1 a with a mean 11 73 days and an sd 7 68 days if l is known with small uncertainty the absolute number of infections can be estimated however although the different slds have a comparable shape across literature the loads l are highly variable han et al 2020 liu et al 2020 therefore we applied the sld which still yields an estimate that is proportional to that obtained by using the correct but unknown slp for the case number derived incidence ω τ was defined by the distribution combining the delays from infection to symptom onset gamma mean 5 3 days sd 3 2 days and from symptom onset to case confirmation gamma mean 5 5 days sd 3 8 days bi et al 2020 the resulting delay distribution from infection to case confirmation is visualized in fig 1b 2 12 data analysis all statistical analyses were performed in r r core team 2016 the non negative least square regression for the incidence estimations was implemented with the package cvxr fu et al 2020 and delay distributions were computed with the r package distr ruckdeschel and kohl 2014 2 13 data availability data measured rna concentrations flow rates and case numbers are available at http doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4750572 3 results and discussion 3 1 method performance 3 1 1 pcr efficiency and limit of detection pcr efficiencies for all targets ranged from 94 111 table s2 the r2 of the pooled standard curves were 0 95 no amplification signal was measured in the non template and negative extraction controls confirming the absence of contamination during sample processing the lod corresponded to 4 2 gc ml wastewater and 2 6 gc ml wastewater for the sars cov 2 n1 and n2 genes respectively the lods reflect the difficulty of producing accurate calibration curves for sars cov 2 in the low template range based on plasmid standards this limitation which was also reported by others chik et al 2021 gerrity et al 2021 highlights the need for improved qpcr standards and more sensitive rt qpcr assays to minimize variability and false negative results in sars cov 2 rna quantification the lods of the other targets are listed in table s2 3 1 2 pcr inhibition spiking rna extracts with synthetic sars cov 2 rna reference material revealed minimal pcr inhibition on most samples specifically with the exception of three samples from lugano all spiked rna extracts exhibited n1 cq values that fell within or only minimally beyond 1 5 cycles of the median cq of a given wwtp figure s2 3 1 3 reproducibility we compared quantifiable n1 concentrations determined in biological as well as in technical replicate samples figure s3 a good correlation r 0 89 was obtained among biological replicates indicating a high reproducibility of the overall processing pipeline a good reproducibility was also found for technical replicates r 0 78 3 1 4 recovery three enveloped viruses mhv sendai virus and φ6 were evaluated as sars cov 2 surrogates to monitor virus recovery in our sample processing pipeline as a member of the coronaviridae family mhv is the most similar to sars cov 2 in terms of size 120 nm diameter and genome structure single stranded rna sendai virus has a single stranded rna genome but is slightly larger in diameter than sars cov 2 150 nm besides sars cov 2 this virus may also serve as a surrogate for viruses with pandemic potential in the paramyxoviridae family such as measles virus the novel rt qpcr assay developed herein was able to quantify its concentration down to an lod of 4 2 gc ml table s2 finally φ6 is the least similar surrogate to sars cov 2 it has a smaller diameter 85 nm and a different genome structure double stranded rna in seven wastewater samples spiked with all three surrogate viruses mhv and sendai virus exhibited similar recoveries that mostly ranged from 0 1 1 figure s4 this range corresponds well to that reported by other groups using a similar processing pipeline pecson et al 2021 if determined using φ6 recoveries were 10 to 100 fold higher and more constant across samples this confirms previous reports that recoveries depend strongly on the surrogate virus used pecson et al 2021 despite the better recovery of φ6 we decided to utilize mhv or sendai virus as recovery controls in this work due to their higher structural similarity with sars cov 2 the recoveries in the samples from lugano and lausanne were determined using mhv figure s5 recoveries were similar for both sites and mostly fell into the 0 1 1 range with average values of 0 95 and 0 74 for lugano and lausanne respectively in the samples from zurich sendai virus was used as the surrogate compared to lugano and lausanne the recoveries were significantly lower with an average of 0 17 one way anova f 6 82 p 0 002 figure s5 the lower recovery is unlikely to be a result of the use of sendai virus since mhv and sendai virus yielded similar recoveries if assessed in the same sample figure s4 instead the lower recoveries in the zurich samples may reflect the higher solids content in this wwtp enveloped viruses partition to wastewater solids ye et al 2016 and hence a higher solids content leads to a reduced recovery of the surrogate virus from the liquid wastewater fraction 3 1 5 fecal load the daily load of pmmov was used as an indicator of the fecal load entering the wwtp on average the pmmov loads corresponded to 8 9 1015 gc day lugano 3 1 1016 gc day lausanne and 1 8 1016 gc day zurich figure s6 in all but five samples the pmmov load fell within the range of 5 1015 to 5 1016 gc day the narrow range of the measured pmmov loads further confirms the consistency of our virus concentration and extraction process 3 1 6 effect of storage conditions on rna stability as shown in fig 2 different storage procedures exert significantly different effects on sars cov 2 rna stability one way anova f 12 8 p 0 001 storing raw wastewater at 4 c or 20 c for a month resulted in lower concentrations of sars cov 2 rna compared to samples stored as concentrates or rna extracts at 20 c tukey kramer p 0 02 the storage protocol used herein raw wastewater at 20 c had to be implemented before storage tests could be completed and likely led to significant rna decay in future studies wastewater samples should immediately be concentrated or extracted prior to storage 3 2 longitudinal trends sars cov 2 rna loads and confirmed cases concentrations of sars cov 2 n1 and n2 gene targets in longitudinal samples are shown in figure s7 the earliest detection of the n1 gene occurred in wastewater from lugano on february 28 2020 four days after the first covid 19 case was observed in switzerland this confirms earlier reports that wastewater can serve as a sensitive indicator for virus circulation even during periods of low disease prevalence ahmed et al 2021 la rosa et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 n1 and n2 concentrations exhibited similar temporal trends though n1 concentrations were on average 3 fold higher figure s7 higher concentrations of the n1 gene were also reported by others d aoust et al 2021 gerrity et al 2021 though some studies have reported the n2 gene to yield higher results gonzalez et al 2020 medema et al 2020 given the superior quantification by n1 in this work only this gene target was considered for all subsequent analyses we did not normalize n1 concentrations by fecal strength pmmov concentration as suggested elsewhere d aoust et al 2021 wu et al 2020 because pmmov concentrations were similar in all samples and were not correlated with n1 concentrations r 0 02 0 04 figure s8 we also did not correct n1 concentrations for recovery because there was high inter sample variation across the three surrogates tested and it is uncertain which if any externally added surrogate accurately mimics the fate of sars cov 2 during sample processing chik et al 2021 graham et al 2021 recovery values were strictly used for data quality control specifically samples were excluded if two criteria were simultaneously met the recovery of a sample was 3 the median recovery for the site under consideration and the concentrations measured by n1 and n2 differed by more than a factor 5 this led to the exclusion of one biological replicate on three sampling days in lugano march 18 19 and april 5 and both replicates for a single day in lausanne march 28 among the three wwtps studied lausanne had the highest number of confirmed cases in its catchment fig 3 case numbers were similar in the catchments of the lugano and zurich wwtps even though zurich s catchment encompasses approximately 3 6 fold more inhabitants than lugano s and 1 9 fold more than lausanne s consequently the n1 concentrations in the zurich wwtp were expected to be lower compared to lugano and lausanne as confirmed by our measurements figure s7 to enable a direct comparison among wwtps we converted n1 concentrations into units of daily n1 load eq 2 this unit accounts for differences in catchment size via the daily wastewater flow rate and also incorporates daily variability in the wastewater flow of a given wwtp similar to data from other studies gerrity et al 2021 graham et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 there was considerable day to day variability in both the n1 loads and the number of confirmed cases fig 3 the variability in confirmed cases is increased by the fact that switzerland reduces testing and reporting on weekends to facilitate the visualization of pandemic trends in wastewater and case data we therefore calculated weekly averages monday sunday for each data set the corresponding results are shown as solid lines in fig 3 as is evident both data sets feature a prominent peak in late march however the wastewater peak shape is narrow whereas the number of confirmed cases remained high for 2 3 weeks despite the similarity in confirmed case numbers in the catchment measured sars cov 2 rna loads were higher in the lugano wwtp than in zurich wwtp there are a number of potential methodological explanations for this including lower virus recovery in zurich figure s5 reduced precision in quantifying low sars cov 2 rna copy numbers figure s7 and our sample storage protocol which in retrospect was found to be non ideal fig 2 the zurich wwtp is located in the area of lowest disease prevalence and thus had the lowest starting concentrations of sars cov 2 rna among the wwtps sampled further decay during storage of the zurich samples may have lowered the concentrations below the lod in all but the samples taken during the peak of the first wave 3 3 comparison of incidence dynamics from wastewater data case numbers and seir models to assess the ability to track disease dynamics with sars cov 2 loads in wastewater and confirmed cases both data sets were used to estimate disease incidence over time by deconvoluting the signals see materials and methods the resulting trends were compared to the reference incidence determined by an seir model lemaitre et al 2020 while the seir model reports absolute infection numbers this determination is currently not feasible for wastewater or case number derived estimates for wastewater estimating absolute infection numbers would require a better understanding of the magnitude of the shedding load l eq 4 the decay kinetics of sars cov 2 rna in the sewer system and the true recovery of sars cov 2 in our sample processing pipeline these parameters are currently not available but may become better known in the future for case numbers the ratio of confirmed to total cases would have to be known yet this parameter is associated with considerable uncertainty and variability during the first wave of the pandemic we therefore only compared the incidence dynamics but not the absolute incidence per day as shown in fig 4 both wastewater and case number derived incidence exhibited a pronounced peak in mid march in lausanne the wastewater derived incidence exhibited the highest number of infections from march 13 15 which matches the peak of infections determined by the seir model if estimated based on confirmed cases the highest number of new infections occurred from march 9 11 considering the delay distributions from infection to case confirmation fig 1b this time range mainly reflects cases observed from march 17 24 coinciding with swiss wide positivity rates 10 figure s1 the premature timing of the peak may indicate that case numbers were truncated when testing capacity was exceeded and positivity rates were high in lugano wastewater based incidence estimates yielded the highest infection numbers from march 10 12 this time frame partly overlapped with the seir modelled infection peak which occurred from march 12 14 in contrast the incidence peak determined from confirmed cases appeared later march 17 19 and differed in shape compared to the other incidence estimates this is another indication testing capacity during this period was insufficient to capture the full extent of the rise in cases during the height of the first wave in both locations the decline in new infections was better captured by case number than by wastewater based incidence estimates in lausanne the case number based incidence exhibited a slow decay in new infections from mid march to late april similar to the reference incidence dynamics in contrast the decay in the wastewater based incidence was faster in lugano the case number derived incidence was also able to capture the tail end of the wave whereas new infections based on wastewater data rapidly dropped to the baseline finally the wastewater based incidence dynamics in both locations exhibited a second smaller peak in april which was driven by few high load measurements in each location in lausanne this feature also appeared in the corresponding case number derived incidence dynamics and thus reflects a local spike in infections in contrast the origin of the second peak in lugano is not evident it may stem from one or more shedders that are not permanent inhabitants of the lugano wwtp catchment and were therefore not included in the catchment specific case numbers e g commuters or external patients hospitalized within the catchment the april peaks were not apparent in the seir model which may be explained by differences in the type of input data used to determine incidence dynamics whereas wastewater loads and case numbers were catchment specific the seir model was based on data for the entire canton local spikes in case numbers would thus appear attenuated in the reference incidence 4 conclusions our findings demonstrate that both confirmed case numbers and wastewater analysis are useful and independent metrics to estimate covid 19 infection incidence dynamics wastewater outperformed case numbers with respect to the timing and shape of the peak incidence whereas confirmed case numbers were a better indicator for incidence decline in combination the two metrics yielded complementary information on incidence dynamics that correspond well to the reference dynamics determined by compartmental models it is important to consider that all three approaches rely on a number of assumptions all of which are associated with a degree of uncertainty for example the seir model is based exclusively on data pertaining to severe covid 19 cases hospitalizations deaths and may thus miss events among age classes that have a low severity rate but normal virus shedding wastewater derived incidence dynamics suffer from uncertainties in the accuracy of the sld and cases number derived estimates rely on the delay distribution between infection and case confirmation which may vary with time and location while the sources of uncertainties of these assumptions are conceptually understood they remain difficult to quantify due to the lack of reference data it is therefore important and encouraging that despite these uncertainties comparable incidence dynamics were obtained with three independent approaches differences in the incidence dynamics determined by wastewater and confirmed cases may ultimately also be exploited to inform on the duration and degree of clinical undertesting to do so however both incidence estimates need to be further advanced in future work wastewater derived estimates can be enhanced by increasing the wastewater sampling frequency to smooth out measurement outliers developing more sensitive assays to quantify the viral rna at low concentrations better determining sars cov 2 rna recovery from wastewater and establishing a representative shedding load profile case number derived incidence estimates can be improved by taking into account variations in the delay distributions from symptom onset to case confirmation in switzerland the mean delay varied from 3 to 8 days during the first wave huisman et al 2020 yet herein it was held constant at 5 5 days compared to the compartmental model which relies on hospitalization and deaths wbe can determine incidence dynamics with a faster turnaround time rna loads can be measured within 24 hours after sampling compared to clinical tests an additional advantage of wbe is that a much lower number of samples is required to determine incidence dynamics with reasonable accuracy during high positivity rate regimes wbe can thus yield information on the trajectory of a pandemic that is potentially more precise more readily available and more economical than information from clinical data we contend that wbe should be included by epidemiologists and public health agencies as a useful pandemic monitoring tool during periods with high test positivity rates

16928,the effect of mixing in the modelling of processes based on mass transfer phenomena is commonly ignored in wastewater treatment industry in this contribution the effect of the average shear rate in the nucleation and growth rates of struvite is analyzed by combining experimental data with simulation results obtained with a previously presented mass based discretized population balance model according to the obtained results the effect of the average shear rate is identifiable for the selected data and mechanisms therefore it should be considered when a detailed modelling of the process is needed consequently in this contribution the average shear rate has been decoupled from the kinetic constants in addition kinetic rates where it is explicitly included as a power law function have been proposed the exponents in these power law functions for the primary homogeneous nucleation and growth are 1 3 and 0 3 respectively considering shear rate effects allowed to see in the simulation

simulation tools have been widely used in the design operation and optimization of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and processes fernández arévalo et al 2017a 2017b lizarralde et al 2019 to date the main modelling and simulation approach used in wwtps described complex biochemical and physicochemical reactions assumed to take place in continuously stirred tank reactors cstr as in the international water association iwa models activated sludge model asm and anaerobic digestion model adm batstone et al 2002 henze et al 2000 as a result these models are independent of the mixing regime and consequently limited in their application and scope for the design and optimization of technologies dependent upon mass transfer phenomena unit operations based on mass transfer phenomena are especially important in the emerging conception of wwtps as water resource recovery facilities wrrfs and upgrading the classic modelling libraries is necessary for the correct description of the processes occurring within vaneeckhaute et al 2018 clearly accounting for mixing effects in process model development would enhance the understanding of wrrfs unit processes and would be an important step towards more descriptive modelling which could help for design and optimization of new and existing technologies modelling the effect of mixing in wastewater treatment processes is challenging since it occurs at different process scales macromixing describes mixing at reactor scale micromixing considers mixing in the smallest vortices and the ultimate molecular diffusion while mesomixing lies between micromixing and macromixing torbacke and rasmuson 2004 the consideration of the mixing scale compromises the modelling approach needed to represent mixing in the reactors macromixing and even meso scale mixing effects could be associated to the transport of the reactants and different discrete entities i e bubbles or particles in the system by dividing the reactor into smaller zones or elements using different approaches such as computational fluid dynamics compartmental modelling or tanks in series depending on the required detail on the contrary micromixing affects those processes occurring at molecular scale as nucleation and growth in precipitation systems consequently mixing effects in the kinetic rates of precipitation processes should be studied by considering micromixing phillips et al 1999 therefore this contribution considers the effect of the micromixing on the kinetic rates of struvite precipitation mechanisms for their detailed modelling nevertheless the methodology employed could be useful not only to improve the modelling and understanding of struvite precipitation but also of other unit processes based on mass transfer phenomena such as biofilm based processes granular technologies aeration membrane fouling adsorption or other precipitation processes struvite is a salt equimolar in phosphorus p nitrogen n and magnesium mg which can be used as a sustainable fertilizer li et al 2019 its recovery has attracted the interest of the industry and therefore classic one step precipitation kinetic models lizarralde et al 2015 are being upgraded to more complex variants such as the population balance model pbm the pbm tracks changes in the size distribution of the suspended particles by considering the kinetics of the mechanisms of the precipitation the size distribution of particles influences the efficiency of the struvite as a fertilizer li et al 2019 and it is an important operational variable as it affects to the separation of the recovered product from the liquid phase wilsenach et al 2007 therefore it has to be taken into account when evaluating the performance of the technology in the pbm considered mechanisms are usually nucleation and growth hanhoun et al 2013 and often also include aggregation elduayen echave et al 2019 galbraith et al 2014 in each mechanism s formulation supersaturation which combines the effects of concentration of species temperature and ph is explicitly included furthermore the presence of other ions and even seed material can be systematically included in their formulation if needed however there is a clear gap in the available literature regarding the inclusion of the micromixing effects in the pbm approach including micromixing effects in the existing pbms is very challenging as its effect in the reaction mechanisms is poorly understood mao and yang 2017 despite the difficulties some efforts have been already done by following two main approaches in the first one the interaction between micromixing and kinetics in pbms is studied by describing different zones in the reactor depending on the micromixing which is associated with the energy dissipation rate baldyga et al 1995 phillips et al 1999 pohorecki and bałdyga 1983 in the second one an average shear rate is considered in the reactor and explicitly included in the aggregation rate expressions hounslow et al 2013 vaneeckhaute et al 2018 this approach is also used when modelling flocculation nopens et al 2004 both possibilities have in common that the precipitation model is applied in environments considered homogeneous from a mixing perspective as it is recommended in baldyga et al 1995 in addition the operational variables considered to measure the effect of micromixing are similar as the relationship between the energy dissipation rate and the shear rate has been defined elsewhere sánchez pérez et al 2006 in this contribution the second approach will be used to evaluate the effect of the micromixing on the kinetic rates of the mechanisms constituting a previously presented discretized pbm elduayen echave et al 2019 despite the shear rate has been experimentally related with the nucleation de santis et al 2016 forsyth et al 2016 mullin and raven 1962 nappo et al 2018 and growth de santis et al 2016 of crystals its inclusion in the kinetic rates of such mechanisms is not extended therefore this effect should be further studied and if necessary included in the kinetic expressions of the pbm employing them in addition modelling the shear rate as a process variable may help to obtain parameter values that are independent of the local mixing intensity therefore the objectives of this work are twofold first to consider if the shear rate should be decoupled from the kinetic constants of the mechanisms of an existing pbm elduayen echave et al 2019 based on the comparison between the experimental data obtained under different saturation conditions and mixing intensities and simulation outputs secondly if so to propose new expressions for the kinetics of the pbm where the shear rate effect is explicitly included based on parameter values calibrated using bayesian inference for different mixing intensities and develop dependency laws relating them to the shear rate 2 materials and methods this section is divided in two main sections in the first the pbm independent of the mixing intensity is described in the second the experimental runs the simulation studies and the methodology combining both to determine the effect of the shear rate in the kinetics of the pbm is explained the methodology followed could be applied to different modelling frameworks 2 1 population balance model the model in which the suitability of including the effect of the shear rate in the kinetic rates was analyzed is a mass based discretized pbm this model was implemented in west dhi wastewater treatment simulation platform its general description and equations including a sensitivity and identifiability analysis can be found in elduayen echave et al 2019 for the formulation of the pbm the volume size domain was partitioned into 30 different size bins where the volume of each bin is twice the previous one therefore all the particles in each bin have the same size which corresponds to the known volume of spherical particles sized between 0 001 and 0 812 mm of radius the kinetics in the model depend on the saturation index si as precipitation occurs the value of the si is re calculated at every time step the si is defined as 1 si log a m g 2 a nh 4 a po 4 3 ks p stru where a i is the activity of ion i and ks p stru is the solubility product of the salt from the proposed values of the solubility product reported in the literature doyle and parsons 2002 rahaman et al 2006 ks p stru 7 58 10 13 was used the kinetics of the homogeneous nucleation and growth mechanisms were described as follows 2 b 0 k b s i n b v 3 g k g s i n g where b 0 is the particle birth rate due to homogeneous nucleation nuclei day k b is the kinetic constant of the homogeneous nucleation nuclei day m3 v is the liquid volume in the reactor m3 n b is the nucleation exponent g is the particle linear growth rate mm day k g is the kinetic constant of growth mm day and n g is the growth exponent the original model also included a particle aggregation mechanism however this was removed from the discretized pbm in this contribution the particles precipitated in the experiments were single crystals so including this mechanism was not necessary moreover including the aggregation mechanism would mean having more parameters to calibrate which could lead to identifiability problems and compensation in the parameter values the change in the mass of struvite of the first bin x 1 g due to the nucleation mechanism x 1 t n could be described using the particle birth rate eq 4 as 4 x 1 t n k b s i n b v mes f 1 where mes f 1 is the mass of struvite g in a single sphere of the smallest bin the growth mechanism defines how much mass of particles of a certain bin passes to the next one by consuming reactants if only a single particle was being considered the volume increase in the particle due to growth mechanism would be proportional to the area of that particle however as the model is discretized and mass based the mass change due to the growth mechanism needed to be computed for the mass of the whole bin and not a single particle therefore the mass of the ith bin x i g disappearing due to the growth mechanism from the ith to the i 1th size x i t g i i 1 was determined by the growth rate eq 3 and the available crystal surface of all the particles in the ith bin 5 x i t g i i 1 k g s i n g a i ρ being a i the combined area m2 of the i sized crystals at any time and ρ the density g m3 of the crystals despite a i or the number of particles could be obtained by considering the particles spherical as the model is mass based a i was converted to a term depending on mass 6 a i c w i v ρ φ l i l i 1 2 being c w i the concentration of i sized particles at any time in g m3 l i and l i 1 the characteristic lengths of the ith and i 1th bin characterized as the radius of each bin mm and φ a shape factor that relates the volume the area and the characteristic length of the crystals preliminary simulations results not included performed with this model structure showed that the simulation could not faithfully describe the experimental data gathered from experiments therefore some changes were made to the growth model the model formulation previously explained for growth is valid for an isotropic growth of the crystals regardless its shape because in this case φ is a constant numeric value that can be embedded in the k g when this is calibrated however struvite crystals faces do not necessarily grow equally as a result their shapes usually are not spheres or regular polyhedrons prywer et al 2012 shaddel et al 2019 therefore from the total volume of the particle the growth rate is proportional only to a portion of the total area this effect has been addressed in the mathematical model by considering only the effective area of the particle this has been done elevating to an exponent α the characteristic length therefore the effective area of the crystal named a i becomes 7 a i c w i v ρ l i l i 1 2 α if the value of α known as the area exponent is greater than unity growth for bigger particles is less favored than for the smaller ones this change maintains the simplicity of the general pbm structure as the 2 geometric progression for the partition of the volume size domain and the characteristic lengths associated to each bin are maintained as if the particles were spheres but the results addressed are more realistic as the growth is only proportional to the effective area of the crystal however it added an extra parameter to the calibration procedure 2 2 analysis of the shear rate effect the analysis of the effect of the shear rate in the kinetics of the pbm was performed combining experimental results with outputs from simulation case studies bayesian inference was used to relate the model to the experimental results with fig 1 showing the general analysis procedure 2 2 1 experimental runs data from nine experimental runs performed in a previous work elduayen echave et al 2020 were gathered to observe the effect of the shear rate in the precipitation rate of struvite in these experiments a 5 cm diameter 45 pitched 4 bladed impeller was used in a 1 l vessel the experimental runs combined three different initial chemical conditions with three different stirring speeds the average shear rate in the reactor was related with the stirring speed as follows ilievski et al 2001 8 γ p i μ v 1 2 where γ is the average shear rate s 1 in the fluid volume p i is the power input to the reactor w and μ is the dynamic viscosity kg m s the power input is correlated as wodołażski 2017 9 p i n p ρ l n s 3 d 5 where n p is the power number ρ l is the density of the liquid kg m3 n s is the stirring speed s 1 and d is the diameter of the impeller m the power number of this stirrer is considered to be 1 3 asiri 2012 ayranci and kresta 2011 in all the experiments 500 ml of a solution prepared from nah2po4 nh4cl and naoh were charged in the stirred vessel afterwards 250 ml of a mgcl2 6h2o solution were added over a 15 second duration all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water in all the experimental runs the molar ratio p n mg after the mixing of both solutions was 1 2 1 5 as n concentration is usually higher than p concentration in wastewater currents where struvite is recovered lizarralde et al 2019 and the mg source was added in excess in order to optimize p recovery initial ph values were within previously proposed values for a high struvite recovery from ultrapure water hao et al 2009 as it can be seen in the experimental conditions included in table 1 the concentrations are higher than the ones often encountered in wrrfs the high initial supersaturation and the absence of seed material promotes primary homogeneous nucleation over other mechanisms agrawal et al 2018 thus these conditions were chosen so that primary homogeneous nucleation could be analyzed with lesser influence of secondary nucleation measured variables were ph continuously sampled and particle size distribution or psd periodically sampled with a beckman coulter multisizer 4 multisizer 4 coulter counter beckman coulter usa selecting the aperture tube used for particle measurement represents a trade off between resolution for measuring small particles and avoiding blockages by larger particles or highly concentrated suspensions galbraith et al 2014 for this study a 1000 µm aperture tube was employed to measure particles between 20 600 µm of spherical volume equivalent diameter the electrolyte was prepared with ultrapure water and 0 9 wt nacl which was saturated in struvite to avoid particle dissolution during the measurements the control mode in the measurements of the beckman coulter multisizer 4 was the measuring time 7 s the current and gain were 3200 µa and 1 respectively 2 2 2 simulation case studies three different simulation case studies were defined in west dhi based on the experimental runs addressed in section 2 2 1 the shear rate was not included as a process variable in the simulations as the original discretized pbm did not include its effect in the kinetics therefore the difference between the simulation case studies was the initial chemical condition the simulation case studies were named s lsi s msi and s hsi and corresponded to the experimental conditions with low medium and high si respectively see table 2 in each of the simulation case studies defined 500 ml of a solution with the required concentration of nah2po4 and nh4cl were placed in a 1 l capacity reactor starting at simulation time t 0 s 250 ml of a mgcl2 6h2o dissolution were added over a 15 second duration as it was done in the experimental runs after that no further external perturbations were introduced the initial ph in the solutions of each case study is the average of the three experimental runs with the corresponding si the si value was calculated in west dhi using the equations and guidelines from lizarralde et al 2015 2 2 3 bayesian inference module the comparison between the experimental and simulation outputs was done in matlab using bayesian monte carlo techniques its objective was to find a parameter set θ k b n b k g n g α that could faithfully reproduce the ph evolution and the periodically measured psd for each mixing intensity to extract dependency laws that related the parameters to the shear rate the parameters analyzed were those included in nucleation and growth rate equations see table 3 according to the bayes theorem there is a value of the posterior probability density function associated to each parameter set this value of the posterior probability density function depends on the prior knowledge of the parameters in the model and the observed data 10 p θ y p y θ p θ p y p y θ p θ θ p y θ p θ p y θ p θ where p θ y is the value of the posterior probability density function of the parameter set θ for the experimental data y p θ is the prior knowledge p y θ is the likelihood function and p y is the probability of having the observed data which acts as a normalizing constant in order to express the theorem proportionally martin and ayesa 2010 the basic idea behind using bayesian monte carlo technique is that many simulations can produce the approximate shape of the posterior probability density function p θ y instead of analytically computing it vrugt and bouten 2002 the prior knowledge about the model is defined in the prior probability density function p θ where the information available about the parameters before any measurement is done is included in this contribution this information was the upper and lower value of the range of the parameters to be calibrated selected by the authors and based on their own knowledge of the model performance and the results obtained in the previous contribution elduayen echave et al 2019 as every parameter value within the range had the same probability to be chosen the prior probability density function was non informative the likelihood function p y θ quantifies the agreement between the measured data y and the answer of the model for each parameter set θ a higher value in the likelihood function corresponds therefore to a more accurate simulation different likelihood functions have been used in the literature blasone et al 2008 based on vrugt et al 2003 in this contribution the likelihood of a parameter set θ to describe the observed data y was quantified as 11 p y θ m θ n m 1 γ b 2 12 m θ k 1 n obs e k θ 2 n obs is the number of observed variables including ph at different times and psd within the equipment measurement limits 20 600 µm the size bins out of this range were simulated but not included in the calculation of the likelihood function e k θ is the normalized difference between the measurement of each k th variable and its correspondent simulation output these differences were normalized in order to give similar weights for the ph and psd measurements ph differences were divided by 0 5 and psd percentage differences by 10 n m is an adjustable parameter that is used to establish the relative weight for each parameter set if n m 0 the same likelihood is assigned to all parameter sets when n m the posterior probability of the mode the parameter set with the greatest likelihood will tend to 1 whereas the rest will tend to 0 blasone et al 2008 for this contribution n m was fixed at 10 γ b specifies the error model of the residuals which were considered normally distributed γ b 0 the posterior distribution was calculated as follows 13 p θ y p y θ p θ p y m θ n m 2 m θ n m 2 as it is seen in fig 1 the data gathered in the nine experimental runs was classified considering their shear rate therefore the experiments were divided into low shear rate l γ medium shear rate m γ and high shear rate h γ thus each of the groups had the data obtained from three experimental runs performed with the same shear rate and a different initial si previous results showed that parameters in the pbm could have identifiability problems elduayen echave et al 2019 therefore in order to reduce the number of parameters to be calibrated for each shear rate the three exponents n b n g and α were presumed independent of the shear rate and fixed as the first step of the procedure for the other two parameters k b and k g 1000 parameter values were randomly chosen using the metropolis hastings algorithm within previously defined parameter ranges each parameter set was named θ ij corresponding the subscript i to the group with the known and previously fixed exponents and the subscript j to the randomly chosen kinetic constants for the parameter set θ ij a simulation of each case study was performed the outputs of these simulations simi j were compared with the corresponding experimental data of each shear rate l γ m γ and h γ from this comparison a m θ ij z γ value was assigned to each parameter set for each shear rate being the subscript z γ l γ m γ or h γ depending on the case consequently three different distributions of the posterior density function one distribution for each shear rate were obtained the goodness of fit of the 1000 simulations from each i group was evaluated with the total m θ i understanding total m θ i as the sum of the m θ ij z γ obtained for the best parameter set for each shear rate and θ i as the parameter group formed by the exponents of the i group n b i n g i α i and the three pair of kinetic constants k b i z γ and k g i z γ that best represented the experimental data for each shear rate after the 1000 simulations were done and the posterior distributions calculated new values of n b n g and α were selected manually and again 1000 randomly selected kinetic constant values were picked the procedure was repeated until the value of total m θ i could not substantially decrease this procedure was repeated for 21 different value combinations of parameters n b n g and α having in total 21 000 simulations of each case study 3 results and discussion this section is divided into three subsections in the first section the results of the analysis of the effect of the shear rate in the parameters are provided in the second a relationship between the shear rate and the kinetic rates is proposed in the third the experimental results and the results of the simulated case studies are compared 3 1 effect of the shear rate in the kinetic constants calibration results from the simulation group with exponent values n b 13 n g 2 and α 1 8 were used to analyze the effect of the shear rate in the kinetic constants the parameter group k b i l γ k b i m γ k b i h γ n b i k g i l γ k g i m γ k g i h γ n g i α i calibrated from this group was the one that could overall best describe the experimental data fig 2 includes the posterior density distribution for the k b parameter in the selected simulation group for each of the analyzed shear rates fig 2 a c e shows the value of the posterior density for each sampled k b value while fig 2 b d f is a histogram where parameter range has been partitioned in 15 bins and the value of the posterior density for the points within each bin has been added as it is observed the k b parameter is identifiable for every shear rate condition in addition the mode of the k b parameter is different for each shear rate therefore the effect of the shear rate in the k b parameter should be decoupled for a more detailed description of the mechanism moreover the posterior density distribution showed a well defined peak for every shear rate which meant that the selected parameter range was adequate for the study the smallest and the biggest values of k b are related with a too slow or a too fast nucleation rate respectively both possibilities led to a bad representation of the experimental data according to the obtained results analogously to the previously analyzed 1000 simulation group calibration results from each of the other 1000 simulation group showed that the values of k b that best represented the experimental data obtained with each shear rate increased with the shear rate in addition these best k b values were clearly influenced by the pre selected n b value see fig 3 even if the effect of both parameters on the simulation output is not the same the best values of k b were smaller as n b increased therefore there was a compensation effect between both parameters for the type and amount of data used observing fig 3 is of special interest since it likely explains why values of the parameters describing the nucleation mechanism differ in the literature of precipitation modelling of struvite burns et al 2021 galbraith et al 2014 hanhoun et al 2013 triger et al 2012 on one hand the best value of the k b parameter increases with an increasing shear rate having a greater nucleation rate by changing local mixing conditions shows that a macroscopic perspective of the process as the one provided by the classic nucleation theory and often used in struvite precipitation modelling could be limited to fully explain nucleation mechanism and determine the nucleation rate of a system zhang et al 2021 on the other hand the effect of compensation is evident as the best k b value is clearly influenced by the pre selected value of n b therefore both ignoring local mixing effects and compensation could be the reasons for the shifting parameter values of the contributions found in the literature regarding growth mechanism fig 4 a c e shows the value of the posterior density for each sampled k g value in the same 1000 simulation group while fig 4 b d f is a histogram where parameter range has been partitioned in 15 bins as done in fig 2 the trend is similar to the one observed for k b again distributions with distinctive peaks were obtained and the mode is significantly different for each shear rate which means that the k g parameter depends on the shear rate and its effect should also be decoupled fig 5 shows best k g values for each shear rate in each 1000 simulation group against their corresponding value of selected n g as it happened for the nucleation mechanism the best values of the k g parameter were bigger as the shear rate increased within the same 1000 simulation run regarding parameter identifiability lower k g values were obtained for an increasing value of n g in addition k g best values were also lower for an increasing value of α showing that in this case the correlation was more complex than for the nucleation mechanism as it involved the interaction of three parameters therefore even if the role of these three parameters in the equations describing growth mechanism was different see section 2 1 as the k g value calibrated was not unique it could be concluded that correlation existed among the parameters describing growth mechanism 3 2 new proposed kinetic laws table 4 includes the mode of the k b and k g for each shear rate and the pre selected exponent values from the mode of the parameter values a relationship between k b and k g and the shear rate is proposed for the re definition of the kinetic rates these relationships are power functions with the shape 14 k b k b γ n bs 15 k g k g γ n gs where k b nuclei m 3 day s n bs is the new kinetic constant independent of the shear rate for homogeneous nucleation n bs is the exponent of the shear rate dependence for homogeneous nucleation mechanism k g mm α day s n gs is the new kinetic constant independent of the shear rate for growth and n gs is the exponent of the shear rate dependence for growth mechanism therefore the proposed nucleation and growth rate expressions are re written as follows 16 x 1 t n k b γ n bs si n b v mes f 1 17 x i t g k g γ n gs si n g cw i v l i l i 1 2 α from the values included in the table 4 the values of the new parameters k b n bs k g and n gs were regressed and the effect of the shear rate decoupled from the kb and kg 18 k b 10415 γ 1 30 19 k g 0 4578 γ 0 28 for the mixing conditions studied the value of each calibrated k b and k g increased with the shear rate value see table 4 the proposed relationships accounted this effect power functions were chosen in this contribution because they represented well the relationship between the shear rate and k b and k g quantified as a high value of r2 in addition power functions were considered a good option due to the stability they offer when included in mathematical models and because they allow quantitative comparisons of the effect of the shear rate on each mechanism in this sense n bs and n gs were approximately 1 3 and 0 3 respectively therefore according to the analysis procedure followed the effect of the shear rate in the nucleation mechanism was greater than in growth this higher effect of the shear rate on the nucleation mechanism than in growth agrees well with previous literature findings tribout et al 1996 wolkowicz 1978 however the proposed relationships should be considered only a starting point in the evaluation of the shear rate in the modelling of kinetics of the nucleation and growth mechanisms for struvite as other mathematical functions could also relate the shear rate and the kinetic constants for the available data in addition due to the correlation between the parameters describing the same mechanism parameter values from the proposed relationships should not be separately used to express nucleation or growth kinetics also other effects accounted in the literature such as the possible negative effect of attrition in the nucleation for high mixing intensities mullin and raven 1962 are not taken into account in the proposed power functions therefore their use is only recommended within the limits of the operational values for which they have been calibrated i e in similar experimental batch conditions or when considering zones near the feeding points of reactive in continuously operated reactors where high saturation conditions that favour primary homogeneous nucleation can be found mersmann 2001 in order to have results that are more conclusive and to avoid possible confounding effects it is wise to calibrate the model using data from different experimental configurations and with more case studies however changing the experimental configuration would undoubtedly affect the shear rate average value and spatial distribution in the reactor further complicating to obtain representative data the main advance of substituting the original simplified kinetic constants by these new relationships is the decoupling of the shear rate in each kinetic rate this transformation helps to simulate the effect of experimentally changing the local mixing intensity due to a varying stirrer speed this is a step forward in modelling precipitation process as this effect is very often ignored furthermore the methodology followed could help to describe more in detail other unit processes based on mass transfer phenomena and improve existing iwa modelling libraries by decoupling the shear rate in their kinetic constants in addition explicitly including the shear rate effects in the kinetics could be useful for scaling up of processes if methodologies to create compartmental models are further developed compartmental models are a promising solution to simulate in a simplified way the si and solid distribution in precipitation reactors liiri et al 2010 using computational fluid dynamics to create the compartmental models where the calibrated pbm would be implemented would help to have more realistic simulation results as both the effect of macro and micro scale mixing would be included for this issue it is necessary to have a model where the information of the behavior of the psd under different mixing and si regimes is included as the one proposed in this contribution 3 3 comparison between the experimental and simulation results experimental results showed that for the same initial si a higher shear rate as a consequence of a higher stirring speed led to a faster ph decay and to smaller particle sizes here these experimental results are compared with the outputs of simulations performed with the parameter values from table 4 the agreement between the experimental data and the simulation outputs was good and justified both the need of improving the original pbm with an extra parameter α and the shear rate dependency and the methodology followed even if experimental information of particles smaller than 20 µm was not available 3 3 1 low saturation the comparison between the experimental results and the simulations for the low si is included in fig 6 these results show that the ph decay has been well addressed especially in the 400 rpm experiment the experimental samples of the psd for the calibration were taken at minutes 20 and 60 as it can be observed in the ph evolution charts in fig 6 at 20 min the experiments almost had reached the equilibrium i e a constant ph value therefore little change could be observed in the experimentally measured psd this effect was also addressed in the model where the simulated psd were very similar at times 20 and 60 min in the three cases 3 3 2 medium saturation fig 7 shows the comparison between the experimental results and the simulations for the medium si results of the ph decay show a very good agreement between the experimental and simulation results the psd were measured at 90 s and 50 min in order to have values at non equilibrium and equilibrium conditions results from the simulations show how the psd increased from the first sampling time to the second as it happened in the experiment however the model underpredicts the final psd especially in the 400 rpm case 3 3 3 high saturation results from the experiments performed at high si and the corresponding simulation results are included in fig 8 the experimental results showed a faster initial ph decay than in the experiments with lower si which is related with a shorter induction time and an enhanced nucleation rate elduayen echave et al 2020 hanhoun et al 2013 mehta and batstone 2013 this enhanced nucleation rate is confirmed by the little change observed at the psd measurements at times 45 s non equilibrium and 20 min equilibrium as there are more particles growing in the system psd changes are less pronounced the model was able to predict reasonably well the fast ph decay and the non equilibrium and equilibrium psd for all the shear rates 4 conclusion despite the experimental evidence shows that mixing affects the processes based on mass transfer phenomena the impact of a varying mixing intensity is commonly ignored in wastewater treatment modelling for the specific case of precipitation including the shear rate in the kinetics of the mechanisms described in the model is a way to represent the effect of micromixing in the simulations however this effect is rarely considered when modelling nucleation and growth of crystals this should be changed if a more detailed description of the process is required as it happens when design and optimization of the technologies is pursued from the results obtained in this contribution it can be concluded that 1 the comparative analysis performed between the experimental data and the simulation outputs showed that the effect of the shear rate is identifiable in nucleation and growth processes therefore the decoupling of the shear rate from the kinetic constants is recommended for more accurate simulation results 2 from the considered data the new expressions proposed for the nucleation and growth mechanisms of the mass based discretized pbm applied to struvite precipitation are power law functions including the shear rate to an exponent this transformation in the kinetics helped to reproduce in the simulations the effect that changing the stirrer speed had in the experimental results a faster ph decay and a smaller psd for an increasing stirring speed explicitly including the shear rate as a process variable is a step forward in the modelling of wrrf unit processes and opens a way to improve existing iwa modelling libraries develop methodologies to create compartmental models and improve scaling up of such processes in addition it can help to obtain parameter values independent of

16928,the effect of mixing in the modelling of processes based on mass transfer phenomena is commonly ignored in wastewater treatment industry in this contribution the effect of the average shear rate in the nucleation and growth rates of struvite is analyzed by combining experimental data with simulation results obtained with a previously presented mass based discretized population balance model according to the obtained results the effect of the average shear rate is identifiable for the selected data and mechanisms therefore it should be considered when a detailed modelling of the process is needed consequently in this contribution the average shear rate has been decoupled from the kinetic constants in addition kinetic rates where it is explicitly included as a power law function have been proposed the exponents in these power law functions for the primary homogeneous nucleation and growth are 1 3 and 0 3 respectively considering shear rate effects allowed to see in the simulation

simulation tools have been widely used in the design operation and optimization of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and processes fernández arévalo et al 2017a 2017b lizarralde et al 2019 to date the main modelling and simulation approach used in wwtps described complex biochemical and physicochemical reactions assumed to take place in continuously stirred tank reactors cstr as in the international water association iwa models activated sludge model asm and anaerobic digestion model adm batstone et al 2002 henze et al 2000 as a result these models are independent of the mixing regime and consequently limited in their application and scope for the design and optimization of technologies dependent upon mass transfer phenomena unit operations based on mass transfer phenomena are especially important in the emerging conception of wwtps as water resource recovery facilities wrrfs and upgrading the classic modelling libraries is necessary for the correct description of the processes occurring within vaneeckhaute et al 2018 clearly accounting for mixing effects in process model development would enhance the understanding of wrrfs unit processes and would be an important step towards more descriptive modelling which could help for design and optimization of new and existing technologies modelling the effect of mixing in wastewater treatment processes is challenging since it occurs at different process scales macromixing describes mixing at reactor scale micromixing considers mixing in the smallest vortices and the ultimate molecular diffusion while mesomixing lies between micromixing and macromixing torbacke and rasmuson 2004 the consideration of the mixing scale compromises the modelling approach needed to represent mixing in the reactors macromixing and even meso scale mixing effects could be associated to the transport of the reactants and different discrete entities i e bubbles or particles in the system by dividing the reactor into smaller zones or elements using different approaches such as computational fluid dynamics compartmental modelling or tanks in series depending on the required detail on the contrary micromixing affects those processes occurring at molecular scale as nucleation and growth in precipitation systems consequently mixing effects in the kinetic rates of precipitation processes should be studied by considering micromixing phillips et al 1999 therefore this contribution considers the effect of the micromixing on the kinetic rates of struvite precipitation mechanisms for their detailed modelling nevertheless the methodology employed could be useful not only to improve the modelling and understanding of struvite precipitation but also of other unit processes based on mass transfer phenomena such as biofilm based processes granular technologies aeration membrane fouling adsorption or other precipitation processes struvite is a salt equimolar in phosphorus p nitrogen n and magnesium mg which can be used as a sustainable fertilizer li et al 2019 its recovery has attracted the interest of the industry and therefore classic one step precipitation kinetic models lizarralde et al 2015 are being upgraded to more complex variants such as the population balance model pbm the pbm tracks changes in the size distribution of the suspended particles by considering the kinetics of the mechanisms of the precipitation the size distribution of particles influences the efficiency of the struvite as a fertilizer li et al 2019 and it is an important operational variable as it affects to the separation of the recovered product from the liquid phase wilsenach et al 2007 therefore it has to be taken into account when evaluating the performance of the technology in the pbm considered mechanisms are usually nucleation and growth hanhoun et al 2013 and often also include aggregation elduayen echave et al 2019 galbraith et al 2014 in each mechanism s formulation supersaturation which combines the effects of concentration of species temperature and ph is explicitly included furthermore the presence of other ions and even seed material can be systematically included in their formulation if needed however there is a clear gap in the available literature regarding the inclusion of the micromixing effects in the pbm approach including micromixing effects in the existing pbms is very challenging as its effect in the reaction mechanisms is poorly understood mao and yang 2017 despite the difficulties some efforts have been already done by following two main approaches in the first one the interaction between micromixing and kinetics in pbms is studied by describing different zones in the reactor depending on the micromixing which is associated with the energy dissipation rate baldyga et al 1995 phillips et al 1999 pohorecki and bałdyga 1983 in the second one an average shear rate is considered in the reactor and explicitly included in the aggregation rate expressions hounslow et al 2013 vaneeckhaute et al 2018 this approach is also used when modelling flocculation nopens et al 2004 both possibilities have in common that the precipitation model is applied in environments considered homogeneous from a mixing perspective as it is recommended in baldyga et al 1995 in addition the operational variables considered to measure the effect of micromixing are similar as the relationship between the energy dissipation rate and the shear rate has been defined elsewhere sánchez pérez et al 2006 in this contribution the second approach will be used to evaluate the effect of the micromixing on the kinetic rates of the mechanisms constituting a previously presented discretized pbm elduayen echave et al 2019 despite the shear rate has been experimentally related with the nucleation de santis et al 2016 forsyth et al 2016 mullin and raven 1962 nappo et al 2018 and growth de santis et al 2016 of crystals its inclusion in the kinetic rates of such mechanisms is not extended therefore this effect should be further studied and if necessary included in the kinetic expressions of the pbm employing them in addition modelling the shear rate as a process variable may help to obtain parameter values that are independent of the local mixing intensity therefore the objectives of this work are twofold first to consider if the shear rate should be decoupled from the kinetic constants of the mechanisms of an existing pbm elduayen echave et al 2019 based on the comparison between the experimental data obtained under different saturation conditions and mixing intensities and simulation outputs secondly if so to propose new expressions for the kinetics of the pbm where the shear rate effect is explicitly included based on parameter values calibrated using bayesian inference for different mixing intensities and develop dependency laws relating them to the shear rate 2 materials and methods this section is divided in two main sections in the first the pbm independent of the mixing intensity is described in the second the experimental runs the simulation studies and the methodology combining both to determine the effect of the shear rate in the kinetics of the pbm is explained the methodology followed could be applied to different modelling frameworks 2 1 population balance model the model in which the suitability of including the effect of the shear rate in the kinetic rates was analyzed is a mass based discretized pbm this model was implemented in west dhi wastewater treatment simulation platform its general description and equations including a sensitivity and identifiability analysis can be found in elduayen echave et al 2019 for the formulation of the pbm the volume size domain was partitioned into 30 different size bins where the volume of each bin is twice the previous one therefore all the particles in each bin have the same size which corresponds to the known volume of spherical particles sized between 0 001 and 0 812 mm of radius the kinetics in the model depend on the saturation index si as precipitation occurs the value of the si is re calculated at every time step the si is defined as 1 si log a m g 2 a nh 4 a po 4 3 ks p stru where a i is the activity of ion i and ks p stru is the solubility product of the salt from the proposed values of the solubility product reported in the literature doyle and parsons 2002 rahaman et al 2006 ks p stru 7 58 10 13 was used the kinetics of the homogeneous nucleation and growth mechanisms were described as follows 2 b 0 k b s i n b v 3 g k g s i n g where b 0 is the particle birth rate due to homogeneous nucleation nuclei day k b is the kinetic constant of the homogeneous nucleation nuclei day m3 v is the liquid volume in the reactor m3 n b is the nucleation exponent g is the particle linear growth rate mm day k g is the kinetic constant of growth mm day and n g is the growth exponent the original model also included a particle aggregation mechanism however this was removed from the discretized pbm in this contribution the particles precipitated in the experiments were single crystals so including this mechanism was not necessary moreover including the aggregation mechanism would mean having more parameters to calibrate which could lead to identifiability problems and compensation in the parameter values the change in the mass of struvite of the first bin x 1 g due to the nucleation mechanism x 1 t n could be described using the particle birth rate eq 4 as 4 x 1 t n k b s i n b v mes f 1 where mes f 1 is the mass of struvite g in a single sphere of the smallest bin the growth mechanism defines how much mass of particles of a certain bin passes to the next one by consuming reactants if only a single particle was being considered the volume increase in the particle due to growth mechanism would be proportional to the area of that particle however as the model is discretized and mass based the mass change due to the growth mechanism needed to be computed for the mass of the whole bin and not a single particle therefore the mass of the ith bin x i g disappearing due to the growth mechanism from the ith to the i 1th size x i t g i i 1 was determined by the growth rate eq 3 and the available crystal surface of all the particles in the ith bin 5 x i t g i i 1 k g s i n g a i ρ being a i the combined area m2 of the i sized crystals at any time and ρ the density g m3 of the crystals despite a i or the number of particles could be obtained by considering the particles spherical as the model is mass based a i was converted to a term depending on mass 6 a i c w i v ρ φ l i l i 1 2 being c w i the concentration of i sized particles at any time in g m3 l i and l i 1 the characteristic lengths of the ith and i 1th bin characterized as the radius of each bin mm and φ a shape factor that relates the volume the area and the characteristic length of the crystals preliminary simulations results not included performed with this model structure showed that the simulation could not faithfully describe the experimental data gathered from experiments therefore some changes were made to the growth model the model formulation previously explained for growth is valid for an isotropic growth of the crystals regardless its shape because in this case φ is a constant numeric value that can be embedded in the k g when this is calibrated however struvite crystals faces do not necessarily grow equally as a result their shapes usually are not spheres or regular polyhedrons prywer et al 2012 shaddel et al 2019 therefore from the total volume of the particle the growth rate is proportional only to a portion of the total area this effect has been addressed in the mathematical model by considering only the effective area of the particle this has been done elevating to an exponent α the characteristic length therefore the effective area of the crystal named a i becomes 7 a i c w i v ρ l i l i 1 2 α if the value of α known as the area exponent is greater than unity growth for bigger particles is less favored than for the smaller ones this change maintains the simplicity of the general pbm structure as the 2 geometric progression for the partition of the volume size domain and the characteristic lengths associated to each bin are maintained as if the particles were spheres but the results addressed are more realistic as the growth is only proportional to the effective area of the crystal however it added an extra parameter to the calibration procedure 2 2 analysis of the shear rate effect the analysis of the effect of the shear rate in the kinetics of the pbm was performed combining experimental results with outputs from simulation case studies bayesian inference was used to relate the model to the experimental results with fig 1 showing the general analysis procedure 2 2 1 experimental runs data from nine experimental runs performed in a previous work elduayen echave et al 2020 were gathered to observe the effect of the shear rate in the precipitation rate of struvite in these experiments a 5 cm diameter 45 pitched 4 bladed impeller was used in a 1 l vessel the experimental runs combined three different initial chemical conditions with three different stirring speeds the average shear rate in the reactor was related with the stirring speed as follows ilievski et al 2001 8 γ p i μ v 1 2 where γ is the average shear rate s 1 in the fluid volume p i is the power input to the reactor w and μ is the dynamic viscosity kg m s the power input is correlated as wodołażski 2017 9 p i n p ρ l n s 3 d 5 where n p is the power number ρ l is the density of the liquid kg m3 n s is the stirring speed s 1 and d is the diameter of the impeller m the power number of this stirrer is considered to be 1 3 asiri 2012 ayranci and kresta 2011 in all the experiments 500 ml of a solution prepared from nah2po4 nh4cl and naoh were charged in the stirred vessel afterwards 250 ml of a mgcl2 6h2o solution were added over a 15 second duration all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water in all the experimental runs the molar ratio p n mg after the mixing of both solutions was 1 2 1 5 as n concentration is usually higher than p concentration in wastewater currents where struvite is recovered lizarralde et al 2019 and the mg source was added in excess in order to optimize p recovery initial ph values were within previously proposed values for a high struvite recovery from ultrapure water hao et al 2009 as it can be seen in the experimental conditions included in table 1 the concentrations are higher than the ones often encountered in wrrfs the high initial supersaturation and the absence of seed material promotes primary homogeneous nucleation over other mechanisms agrawal et al 2018 thus these conditions were chosen so that primary homogeneous nucleation could be analyzed with lesser influence of secondary nucleation measured variables were ph continuously sampled and particle size distribution or psd periodically sampled with a beckman coulter multisizer 4 multisizer 4 coulter counter beckman coulter usa selecting the aperture tube used for particle measurement represents a trade off between resolution for measuring small particles and avoiding blockages by larger particles or highly concentrated suspensions galbraith et al 2014 for this study a 1000 µm aperture tube was employed to measure particles between 20 600 µm of spherical volume equivalent diameter the electrolyte was prepared with ultrapure water and 0 9 wt nacl which was saturated in struvite to avoid particle dissolution during the measurements the control mode in the measurements of the beckman coulter multisizer 4 was the measuring time 7 s the current and gain were 3200 µa and 1 respectively 2 2 2 simulation case studies three different simulation case studies were defined in west dhi based on the experimental runs addressed in section 2 2 1 the shear rate was not included as a process variable in the simulations as the original discretized pbm did not include its effect in the kinetics therefore the difference between the simulation case studies was the initial chemical condition the simulation case studies were named s lsi s msi and s hsi and corresponded to the experimental conditions with low medium and high si respectively see table 2 in each of the simulation case studies defined 500 ml of a solution with the required concentration of nah2po4 and nh4cl were placed in a 1 l capacity reactor starting at simulation time t 0 s 250 ml of a mgcl2 6h2o dissolution were added over a 15 second duration as it was done in the experimental runs after that no further external perturbations were introduced the initial ph in the solutions of each case study is the average of the three experimental runs with the corresponding si the si value was calculated in west dhi using the equations and guidelines from lizarralde et al 2015 2 2 3 bayesian inference module the comparison between the experimental and simulation outputs was done in matlab using bayesian monte carlo techniques its objective was to find a parameter set θ k b n b k g n g α that could faithfully reproduce the ph evolution and the periodically measured psd for each mixing intensity to extract dependency laws that related the parameters to the shear rate the parameters analyzed were those included in nucleation and growth rate equations see table 3 according to the bayes theorem there is a value of the posterior probability density function associated to each parameter set this value of the posterior probability density function depends on the prior knowledge of the parameters in the model and the observed data 10 p θ y p y θ p θ p y p y θ p θ θ p y θ p θ p y θ p θ where p θ y is the value of the posterior probability density function of the parameter set θ for the experimental data y p θ is the prior knowledge p y θ is the likelihood function and p y is the probability of having the observed data which acts as a normalizing constant in order to express the theorem proportionally martin and ayesa 2010 the basic idea behind using bayesian monte carlo technique is that many simulations can produce the approximate shape of the posterior probability density function p θ y instead of analytically computing it vrugt and bouten 2002 the prior knowledge about the model is defined in the prior probability density function p θ where the information available about the parameters before any measurement is done is included in this contribution this information was the upper and lower value of the range of the parameters to be calibrated selected by the authors and based on their own knowledge of the model performance and the results obtained in the previous contribution elduayen echave et al 2019 as every parameter value within the range had the same probability to be chosen the prior probability density function was non informative the likelihood function p y θ quantifies the agreement between the measured data y and the answer of the model for each parameter set θ a higher value in the likelihood function corresponds therefore to a more accurate simulation different likelihood functions have been used in the literature blasone et al 2008 based on vrugt et al 2003 in this contribution the likelihood of a parameter set θ to describe the observed data y was quantified as 11 p y θ m θ n m 1 γ b 2 12 m θ k 1 n obs e k θ 2 n obs is the number of observed variables including ph at different times and psd within the equipment measurement limits 20 600 µm the size bins out of this range were simulated but not included in the calculation of the likelihood function e k θ is the normalized difference between the measurement of each k th variable and its correspondent simulation output these differences were normalized in order to give similar weights for the ph and psd measurements ph differences were divided by 0 5 and psd percentage differences by 10 n m is an adjustable parameter that is used to establish the relative weight for each parameter set if n m 0 the same likelihood is assigned to all parameter sets when n m the posterior probability of the mode the parameter set with the greatest likelihood will tend to 1 whereas the rest will tend to 0 blasone et al 2008 for this contribution n m was fixed at 10 γ b specifies the error model of the residuals which were considered normally distributed γ b 0 the posterior distribution was calculated as follows 13 p θ y p y θ p θ p y m θ n m 2 m θ n m 2 as it is seen in fig 1 the data gathered in the nine experimental runs was classified considering their shear rate therefore the experiments were divided into low shear rate l γ medium shear rate m γ and high shear rate h γ thus each of the groups had the data obtained from three experimental runs performed with the same shear rate and a different initial si previous results showed that parameters in the pbm could have identifiability problems elduayen echave et al 2019 therefore in order to reduce the number of parameters to be calibrated for each shear rate the three exponents n b n g and α were presumed independent of the shear rate and fixed as the first step of the procedure for the other two parameters k b and k g 1000 parameter values were randomly chosen using the metropolis hastings algorithm within previously defined parameter ranges each parameter set was named θ ij corresponding the subscript i to the group with the known and previously fixed exponents and the subscript j to the randomly chosen kinetic constants for the parameter set θ ij a simulation of each case study was performed the outputs of these simulations simi j were compared with the corresponding experimental data of each shear rate l γ m γ and h γ from this comparison a m θ ij z γ value was assigned to each parameter set for each shear rate being the subscript z γ l γ m γ or h γ depending on the case consequently three different distributions of the posterior density function one distribution for each shear rate were obtained the goodness of fit of the 1000 simulations from each i group was evaluated with the total m θ i understanding total m θ i as the sum of the m θ ij z γ obtained for the best parameter set for each shear rate and θ i as the parameter group formed by the exponents of the i group n b i n g i α i and the three pair of kinetic constants k b i z γ and k g i z γ that best represented the experimental data for each shear rate after the 1000 simulations were done and the posterior distributions calculated new values of n b n g and α were selected manually and again 1000 randomly selected kinetic constant values were picked the procedure was repeated until the value of total m θ i could not substantially decrease this procedure was repeated for 21 different value combinations of parameters n b n g and α having in total 21 000 simulations of each case study 3 results and discussion this section is divided into three subsections in the first section the results of the analysis of the effect of the shear rate in the parameters are provided in the second a relationship between the shear rate and the kinetic rates is proposed in the third the experimental results and the results of the simulated case studies are compared 3 1 effect of the shear rate in the kinetic constants calibration results from the simulation group with exponent values n b 13 n g 2 and α 1 8 were used to analyze the effect of the shear rate in the kinetic constants the parameter group k b i l γ k b i m γ k b i h γ n b i k g i l γ k g i m γ k g i h γ n g i α i calibrated from this group was the one that could overall best describe the experimental data fig 2 includes the posterior density distribution for the k b parameter in the selected simulation group for each of the analyzed shear rates fig 2 a c e shows the value of the posterior density for each sampled k b value while fig 2 b d f is a histogram where parameter range has been partitioned in 15 bins and the value of the posterior density for the points within each bin has been added as it is observed the k b parameter is identifiable for every shear rate condition in addition the mode of the k b parameter is different for each shear rate therefore the effect of the shear rate in the k b parameter should be decoupled for a more detailed description of the mechanism moreover the posterior density distribution showed a well defined peak for every shear rate which meant that the selected parameter range was adequate for the study the smallest and the biggest values of k b are related with a too slow or a too fast nucleation rate respectively both possibilities led to a bad representation of the experimental data according to the obtained results analogously to the previously analyzed 1000 simulation group calibration results from each of the other 1000 simulation group showed that the values of k b that best represented the experimental data obtained with each shear rate increased with the shear rate in addition these best k b values were clearly influenced by the pre selected n b value see fig 3 even if the effect of both parameters on the simulation output is not the same the best values of k b were smaller as n b increased therefore there was a compensation effect between both parameters for the type and amount of data used observing fig 3 is of special interest since it likely explains why values of the parameters describing the nucleation mechanism differ in the literature of precipitation modelling of struvite burns et al 2021 galbraith et al 2014 hanhoun et al 2013 triger et al 2012 on one hand the best value of the k b parameter increases with an increasing shear rate having a greater nucleation rate by changing local mixing conditions shows that a macroscopic perspective of the process as the one provided by the classic nucleation theory and often used in struvite precipitation modelling could be limited to fully explain nucleation mechanism and determine the nucleation rate of a system zhang et al 2021 on the other hand the effect of compensation is evident as the best k b value is clearly influenced by the pre selected value of n b therefore both ignoring local mixing effects and compensation could be the reasons for the shifting parameter values of the contributions found in the literature regarding growth mechanism fig 4 a c e shows the value of the posterior density for each sampled k g value in the same 1000 simulation group while fig 4 b d f is a histogram where parameter range has been partitioned in 15 bins as done in fig 2 the trend is similar to the one observed for k b again distributions with distinctive peaks were obtained and the mode is significantly different for each shear rate which means that the k g parameter depends on the shear rate and its effect should also be decoupled fig 5 shows best k g values for each shear rate in each 1000 simulation group against their corresponding value of selected n g as it happened for the nucleation mechanism the best values of the k g parameter were bigger as the shear rate increased within the same 1000 simulation run regarding parameter identifiability lower k g values were obtained for an increasing value of n g in addition k g best values were also lower for an increasing value of α showing that in this case the correlation was more complex than for the nucleation mechanism as it involved the interaction of three parameters therefore even if the role of these three parameters in the equations describing growth mechanism was different see section 2 1 as the k g value calibrated was not unique it could be concluded that correlation existed among the parameters describing growth mechanism 3 2 new proposed kinetic laws table 4 includes the mode of the k b and k g for each shear rate and the pre selected exponent values from the mode of the parameter values a relationship between k b and k g and the shear rate is proposed for the re definition of the kinetic rates these relationships are power functions with the shape 14 k b k b γ n bs 15 k g k g γ n gs where k b nuclei m 3 day s n bs is the new kinetic constant independent of the shear rate for homogeneous nucleation n bs is the exponent of the shear rate dependence for homogeneous nucleation mechanism k g mm α day s n gs is the new kinetic constant independent of the shear rate for growth and n gs is the exponent of the shear rate dependence for growth mechanism therefore the proposed nucleation and growth rate expressions are re written as follows 16 x 1 t n k b γ n bs si n b v mes f 1 17 x i t g k g γ n gs si n g cw i v l i l i 1 2 α from the values included in the table 4 the values of the new parameters k b n bs k g and n gs were regressed and the effect of the shear rate decoupled from the kb and kg 18 k b 10415 γ 1 30 19 k g 0 4578 γ 0 28 for the mixing conditions studied the value of each calibrated k b and k g increased with the shear rate value see table 4 the proposed relationships accounted this effect power functions were chosen in this contribution because they represented well the relationship between the shear rate and k b and k g quantified as a high value of r2 in addition power functions were considered a good option due to the stability they offer when included in mathematical models and because they allow quantitative comparisons of the effect of the shear rate on each mechanism in this sense n bs and n gs were approximately 1 3 and 0 3 respectively therefore according to the analysis procedure followed the effect of the shear rate in the nucleation mechanism was greater than in growth this higher effect of the shear rate on the nucleation mechanism than in growth agrees well with previous literature findings tribout et al 1996 wolkowicz 1978 however the proposed relationships should be considered only a starting point in the evaluation of the shear rate in the modelling of kinetics of the nucleation and growth mechanisms for struvite as other mathematical functions could also relate the shear rate and the kinetic constants for the available data in addition due to the correlation between the parameters describing the same mechanism parameter values from the proposed relationships should not be separately used to express nucleation or growth kinetics also other effects accounted in the literature such as the possible negative effect of attrition in the nucleation for high mixing intensities mullin and raven 1962 are not taken into account in the proposed power functions therefore their use is only recommended within the limits of the operational values for which they have been calibrated i e in similar experimental batch conditions or when considering zones near the feeding points of reactive in continuously operated reactors where high saturation conditions that favour primary homogeneous nucleation can be found mersmann 2001 in order to have results that are more conclusive and to avoid possible confounding effects it is wise to calibrate the model using data from different experimental configurations and with more case studies however changing the experimental configuration would undoubtedly affect the shear rate average value and spatial distribution in the reactor further complicating to obtain representative data the main advance of substituting the original simplified kinetic constants by these new relationships is the decoupling of the shear rate in each kinetic rate this transformation helps to simulate the effect of experimentally changing the local mixing intensity due to a varying stirrer speed this is a step forward in modelling precipitation process as this effect is very often ignored furthermore the methodology followed could help to describe more in detail other unit processes based on mass transfer phenomena and improve existing iwa modelling libraries by decoupling the shear rate in their kinetic constants in addition explicitly including the shear rate effects in the kinetics could be useful for scaling up of processes if methodologies to create compartmental models are further developed compartmental models are a promising solution to simulate in a simplified way the si and solid distribution in precipitation reactors liiri et al 2010 using computational fluid dynamics to create the compartmental models where the calibrated pbm would be implemented would help to have more realistic simulation results as both the effect of macro and micro scale mixing would be included for this issue it is necessary to have a model where the information of the behavior of the psd under different mixing and si regimes is included as the one proposed in this contribution 3 3 comparison between the experimental and simulation results experimental results showed that for the same initial si a higher shear rate as a consequence of a higher stirring speed led to a faster ph decay and to smaller particle sizes here these experimental results are compared with the outputs of simulations performed with the parameter values from table 4 the agreement between the experimental data and the simulation outputs was good and justified both the need of improving the original pbm with an extra parameter α and the shear rate dependency and the methodology followed even if experimental information of particles smaller than 20 µm was not available 3 3 1 low saturation the comparison between the experimental results and the simulations for the low si is included in fig 6 these results show that the ph decay has been well addressed especially in the 400 rpm experiment the experimental samples of the psd for the calibration were taken at minutes 20 and 60 as it can be observed in the ph evolution charts in fig 6 at 20 min the experiments almost had reached the equilibrium i e a constant ph value therefore little change could be observed in the experimentally measured psd this effect was also addressed in the model where the simulated psd were very similar at times 20 and 60 min in the three cases 3 3 2 medium saturation fig 7 shows the comparison between the experimental results and the simulations for the medium si results of the ph decay show a very good agreement between the experimental and simulation results the psd were measured at 90 s and 50 min in order to have values at non equilibrium and equilibrium conditions results from the simulations show how the psd increased from the first sampling time to the second as it happened in the experiment however the model underpredicts the final psd especially in the 400 rpm case 3 3 3 high saturation results from the experiments performed at high si and the corresponding simulation results are included in fig 8 the experimental results showed a faster initial ph decay than in the experiments with lower si which is related with a shorter induction time and an enhanced nucleation rate elduayen echave et al 2020 hanhoun et al 2013 mehta and batstone 2013 this enhanced nucleation rate is confirmed by the little change observed at the psd measurements at times 45 s non equilibrium and 20 min equilibrium as there are more particles growing in the system psd changes are less pronounced the model was able to predict reasonably well the fast ph decay and the non equilibrium and equilibrium psd for all the shear rates 4 conclusion despite the experimental evidence shows that mixing affects the processes based on mass transfer phenomena the impact of a varying mixing intensity is commonly ignored in wastewater treatment modelling for the specific case of precipitation including the shear rate in the kinetics of the mechanisms described in the model is a way to represent the effect of micromixing in the simulations however this effect is rarely considered when modelling nucleation and growth of crystals this should be changed if a more detailed description of the process is required as it happens when design and optimization of the technologies is pursued from the results obtained in this contribution it can be concluded that 1 the comparative analysis performed between the experimental data and the simulation outputs showed that the effect of the shear rate is identifiable in nucleation and growth processes therefore the decoupling of the shear rate from the kinetic constants is recommended for more accurate simulation results 2 from the considered data the new expressions proposed for the nucleation and growth mechanisms of the mass based discretized pbm applied to struvite precipitation are power law functions including the shear rate to an exponent this transformation in the kinetics helped to reproduce in the simulations the effect that changing the stirrer speed had in the experimental results a faster ph decay and a smaller psd for an increasing stirring speed explicitly including the shear rate as a process variable is a step forward in the modelling of wrrf unit processes and opens a way to improve existing iwa modelling libraries develop methodologies to create compartmental models and improve scaling up of such processes in addition it can help to obtain parameter values independent of

16929,microplastics are widely distributed throughout aquatic environments information about the vertical distribution and fate of microplastics in seawater remains limited to elucidate the vertical distribution of microplastics three to six vertical water column layers were sampled based on the thermocline depth from which the vertical distribution and characteristics of microplastics larger than 20 μm were investigated in continental shelf and deep sea waters around south korea in addition microplastics incorporated into marine aggregates aggregated fraction were investigated to determine the contribution of aggregates to vertical transport of microplastics the abundance of microplastics was in the range of 15 9 400 particles m3 no consistent trend was observed in the overall vertical profiles the size shape and polymer compositions of microplastics at each station were generally comparable throughout the water column unexpectedly high density hd 1 02 g cm3 polymers accounted for an average of 73 of total microplastics as polymer density increased the proportion of microplastics less than 100 μm in size increased hd polymers also accounted for 68 of the aerosol samples collected together with water samples due to the relatively high proportion of hd polymers in far offshore waters high density solution should be used to extract microplastics even from surface seawaters the aggregated fraction accounted for 0 28 6 average 3 4 of total microplastics marine aggregates are considered an important mechanism of transport for microplastics less dense than

microplastics offshore water vertical distribution continental shelf deep sea marine aggregate 1 introduction marine plastics may originate from land based or marine sources jang et al 2020 and land based sources contribute about 80 of marine plastics debris andrady 2011 jambeck et al 2015 a trend of decreasing abundance of microplastics with distance from the shore has been observed steer et al 2017 eo et al 2018 seo and park 2020 the presence of microplastics has been reported even in areas far from their sources such as deep sea regions peng et al 2020 polar regions cincinelli et al 2017 and remote mountain catchments allen et al 2019 the relative abundance of low density microplastics shows a rising trend with distance from land enders et al 2015 microplastics denser than seawater do not easily reach distant regions as they sink through the water column due to their high density however even polymers less dense than seawater cannot float continuously in the sea due to physical and biological interactions wu et al 2019 although it is important to understand the input pathways of microplastics to remote areas to manage them these pathways have not yet been thoroughly investigated many studies of microplastics have reported little or no information on polymer composition because they analyze samples using only a microscope or report only limited information based on analysis of subsamples silva et al 2018 to investigate the input pathways of microplastics accurate information about their size shape and polymer composition is required most monitoring of microplastics has been conducted in surface waters song et al 2014 cincinelli et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 mu et al 2019 brandon et al 2020 estimation of the total amounts of microplastics only in surface waters could lead to large underestimation of the standing stock of microplastics in the world ocean eriksen et al 2014 koelmans et al 2017 song et al 2018 attempts have been made to estimate microplastic levels through integration of their water column distribution calculated using a physical mixing model with only surface abundance data isobe et al 2015 enders et al 2015 however higher microplastic abundances were observed in the water column than predicted by a physical mixing model in coastal waters song et al 2018 large amounts of microplastics have been found in bottom water as well as surface water bagaev et al 2018 some studies have observed a greater abundance of microplastic in the water column than in surface water dai et al 2018 kanhai et al 2018 choy et al 2019 therefore in situ observation data for both surface and sub surface waters is essential for precise estimation of microplastic standing stocks in the world ocean microplastics in the water column have been sampled using nets gorokhova 2015 uurasjärvi et al 2021 rosette and niskin bottles bagaev et al 2018 cordova and hernawan 2018 dai et al 2018 kanhai et al 2018 submersible pumps lusher et al 2015 song et al 2018 and in situ filtering systems choy et al 2019 tekman et al 2020 however the water volumes sampled were generally less than 100 l most studies have investigated fewer than five stations or five vertical layers and these limited numbers of stations and layers may lead to inaccurate vertical profiles gorokhova 2015 lusher et al 2015 song et al 2018 choy et al 2019 zobkov et al 2019 tekman et al 2020 the generation of comprehensive vertical profiles from measurements at various stations and water layers may improve our understanding of the fate of microplastics in the water column where various marine organisms dwell while microplastics that are less dense than seawater such as polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp are expected to float on the sea surface they are also the dominant polymer types throughout the water column and in bottom waters song et al 2018 previous research has also reported low density polymers in benthic sediments bergmann et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 in addition to density particle size and shape can affect the vertical movement of microplastics kowalski et al 2016 physical mixing and biological interactions can transport microplastics that are less dense than seawater through the water column kukulka et al 2012 long et al 2015 cole et al 2016 rummel et al 2017 microplastics rapidly aggregate with marine biogenic particles michels et al 2018 which accelerates the sinking velocity of the microplastics porter et al 2018 among aggregates collected from a depth of 0 5 m in a 3 m deep harbor 70 contained microplastics zhao et al 2018a however little is known about the contribution of aggregates to vertical transport of microplastics in real marine environments especially in oligotrophic offshore regions zhao et al 2017 de haan et al 2019 the northern and western yellow sea receives the highest level of plastic debris input from china and has relatively high microplastic abundances in the water and sediment zhao et al 2018b zhu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 however no information about the eastern yellow sea the northern east china sea south sea of korea hereafter south sea or the east sea is available fig 1 a in addition the east sea a marginal sea surrounded by korea japan and russia is a deep sea with its own circulation and a good surrogate study area for open ocean processes it is essential to evaluate the abundance distribution and characteristics of microplastics to achieve a global assessment of microplastic pollution moreover revealing the vertical distribution characteristics of microplastics in korean offshore waters may provide useful information for understanding the distribution and fate of microplastics in continental shelf e g the eastern yellow sea and south sea and deep sea e g the east sea regions of the global ocean in this study water samples were collected from surface thermocline and bottom layers to investigate the vertical distribution and characteristics of microplastics larger than 20 μm in the yellow sea south sea and east sea moreover we investigated microplastics in the marine aggregated fraction in continental shelf and deep sea areas compared with the loose fraction through in situ sampling to determine the contribution of aggregates to the vertical transport of microplastics in this study we tested the following hypotheses i the abundance of microplastics will decrease with increasing distance from the coast along which terrestrial input sources are located ii if currents are the main pathway for microplastics from land based sources low density polymers will be dominant in offshore waters due to density fractionation and iii microplastics incorporated into marine aggregates will account for a larger proportion of total microplastics than those floating freely in the water column 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yellow sea is a bay shaped shelf sea located in the northwestern part of the western pacific ocean surrounded by the korean peninsula and china its area is about 380 000 km2 the average depth is 44 m and the maximum depth is 103 m the east sea is a deep marginal sea surrounded by korea russia and japan its area is about 1 070 000 km2 the average depth is 1361 m and the maximum depth is 4049 m the east and yellow seas are connected via both the jeju and korea straits south sea which have a mean depth of 100 m and maximum depth of 210 m along the west coast of korea the dominant flow is northward during winter and southward in summer fig s1 in the central part of the yellow sea a northward current the yellow sea warm current exists only in winter in the south sea the main current is the tsushima warm current which is supplied by a branch of the kuroshio current the taiwan warm current northeastward coastal currents along the chinese coast south 30 n and the yangtze diluted water on entering the east sea the tsushima warm current bifurcates into the east korea warm current moving northward along the east coast of korea and the nearshore branch moving northeast along the west coast of japan 2 2 sample collection in july august 2018 vertical water samples were collected from nine stations in the yellow sea and five stations in the south sea of korea from the r v eardo fig 1b table s1 vertical water samples were collected from eight stations in the east sea in july august 2019 from the r v eardo this is the rainy season in korea and the worst case for microplastic input from land based sources in each area one section perpendicular to the coast was examined to investigate whether the abundance of microplastics decreases with distance from the coast another meridional section was selected to see if the abundance decreases downstream in the main current at each station four to six samples were taken fig 1c one sample was collected in the surface layer v1 1 m below the water surface in the thermocline samples were obtained at the beginning v2 and end points v4 of the layer as determined from the density profile measured with a conductivity temperature depth sampler sbe 911plus ctd seabird sea bird electronics inc bellevue wa usa table s1 at some stations a third sample was collected at the mid point of the thermocline v3 at station ys2 where no thermocline was present intermediate water was sampled at the mid point between the surface and seafloor in the deep layer one sample v6 was collected 2 210 m above the seafloor depending on the depth at some stations another sample v5 was taken at the mid point of the deep layer a total of 102 water samples were collected in three offshore waters around south korea in the yellow and south seas water was sampled using a submersible pump pd 272 wilo fig s2a at each sampling depth using a hose equipped with a flow meter 200 l of water was directly filtered through a 20 μm polyester pes mesh portable net bottom water samples from three stations ys7 ss4 and ss5 were unavailable due to pump failure below 80 m depth in the east sea surface waters v1 were collected using a submersible pump while deeper waters v2 v6 were collected using a rosette sampler with niskin bottles 10 l 20 200 l due to the depth fig s2b the sample in the cod end of the net was transferred to a 1 l pre cleaned amber glass bottle 2 3 analysis of water samples each sample was passed through a 20 µm metal sieve 10 cm ø and washed with high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade water particles remaining on the sieve were transferred to a 250 ml glass beaker and then dried at 60 c in a drying oven until all water had evaporated after drying the organic matter was digested using 20 ml of 35 h2o2 and fe ii solution on a hot plate 75 c 180 rpm for 30 min this process was repeated by adding 20 ml of h2o2 until no organic matter was seen the resulting mixture was passed through a 20 µm metal sieve to remove the remaining solution the particles were transferred to a 120 ml glass density separation funnel using lithium metatungstate lmt solution and allowed to settle overnight the original density of the lmt was 2 95 g cm3 but it was diluted to 1 6 g cm3 with hplc grade water to separate microplastics from denser inorganic particles the settled particles were drained and the remaining solution was filtered onto a 5 µm polycarbonate filter 47 mm ø using a vacuum pump all particles that appeared to be plastic on the filter were identified using micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy micro ft ir nicolet in10 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa in attenuated total reflectance atr mode microplastic particles were randomly examined in 12 5 100 of the total filter area the spectrum was collected with 16 scans in the spectral range of 675 4000 cm 1 and compared with all libraries provided by thermo fisher scientific a spectrum with a hitting rate greater than 70 was considered a microplastic the size of the microplastics was measured as the longest dimension under a microscope with a measurement tool in the ft ir software omnic picta thermo fisher scientific the quality control and blank test are provided in the supplementary information si 2 4 collection and analysis of marine aggregates water samples for investigation of marine aggregates were collected using niskin bottles at 16 stations table 1 these samples were collected mainly at v4 and also in deeper layers v5 or v6 at some stations the water was gently transferred using a peristaltic pump from a niskin bottle into the imhoff settling cone described by lyons et al 2005 with some modifications the cone was fitted with a three way valve between a 5 l inverted square pyramid acrylic container and a 50 ml conical tube falcon high clarity pp centrifuge tube usa fig s2c in total three 15 l or six 30 l cones were used for each sample after the cone was filled with water and left for 2 h to allow settling of marine aggregates the 50 ml conical tube attached to the bottom of the cone was removed all settled aggregates larger than 200 μm in the conical tube were removed using a pipette under an 8 magnifier and stored in a glass vial analysis of these samples followed the same procedures as analysis of water samples all plastic like particles in marine aggregates aggregated fraction and in the remaining water including that in the imhoff cone and conical tube loose fraction were identified using ft ir under the same conditions as water sample analysis 2 5 statistical analyses to compare the abundance of microplastics across the vertical profile the mann whitney u test and kruskal wallis test were used pearson correlation was used to compare the abundance of microplastics and density of water the significance level set to 0 05 for all statistical tests all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistics ver 19 ibm corp armonk ny usa 3 results 3 1 horizontal distributions of microplastics due to contamination by polyvinyl chloride pvc particles from niskin bottles pvc was eliminated from all results see s4 of si for more details microplastics were identified in all 102 water samples the abundance of microplastics was in the range of 15 ss3 v6 9400 es6 v6 particles m3 in surface water samples v1 the latitudinal distribution of microplastics showed similar patterns in the ys and es it decreased gradually toward the south and then increased at the southernmost station fig 1b along three lines perpendicular to the coastline of each sea ys2 ys6 ss2 ss4 and es3 es6 the highest abundances of microplastics in surface waters were found near the coasts of the ys ys2 1820 particles m3 and es es3 860 particles m3 and farthest from the coast of the ss ss4 350 particles m3 excluding two coastal stations ys2 and es3 no monotonic decreasing tendency away from the coast was observed along either of the lines in fact the abundance increased slightly although not significantly in the offshore direction in the ss the abundance decreased and then increased again reaching the maximum farthest from the coast the distances between two adjacent stations on the three lines were between 47 and 105 km for all stations 3 2 vertical distributions of microplastics when the vertical layers were divided into three sections surface v1 thermocline v2 v4 bottom v5 v6 the respective mean abundances of microplastics in the surface thermocline and bottom layers were 266 459 228 330 and 136 104 particles m3 in the continental shelf area ys and ss and 289 280 260 125 and 1136 2043 particles m3 in the deep sea area es table 2 the mean abundance of microplastics in the three vertical layers did not significantly differ in any of the areas kruskal wallis test p 0 05 due to high variability among stations the highest microplastic abundance among vertical layers was found in the bottom layer at 9 stations in the surface layer at 8 stations and in the thermocline at 5 stations among the 22 stations surveyed the individual vertical distribution profiles v1 v6 of microplastic abundances are shown in fig 2 no relationship was observed between the abundance of microplastics and vertical water density δt calculated based on the temperature and salinity pearson correlation p 0 05 six stations had the highest abundance of microplastic at v1 ys2 ys5 ys6 ss1 ss4 and es3 among the eight stations that showed the highest abundance of microplastic at v6 samples from ss5 and es6 es8 showed remarkably higher abundances of microplastics relative to other layers their abundances were 16 52 6 and 4 times higher than those at v1 respectively overall stations in the es showed high abundances in bottom waters however no consistent trend was found in the overall vertical profiles 3 3 polymer composition of microplastics in total 35 polymer types were identified in the water samples based on their theoretical density compared with seawater they were categorized into two polymer types low density ld 1 02 g cm3 and high density hd 1 02 g cm3 polymers high density polymers were further divided into two categories based on the density of saturated nacl solution which is commonly used as a density separation solution high density 1 hd1 1 02 1 2 g cm3 and high density 2 hd2 1 2 g cm3 polymers table s2 the polymer compositions at each station were generally comparable across vertical layers and no vertical gradient in proportions according to polymer density was observed fig 3 moreover ld polymers were found throughout the water column at levels as high as in the surface water except for ys9 the proportion of ld polymers throughout the water column averaged 27 while those of hd1 and hd2 were 33 and 40 respectively fig s5 at es6 pp increased with water depth and accounted for over 80 in all layers except v1 27 7 the proportion of alkyd was remarkably high at stations es7 and es8 located in the southern part of the es 3 4 shape composition and size distribution the fragment shape accounted for more than 70 of particles in the three vertical layers followed by fibers while the sphere and film types were negligible the size distribution exhibited similar patterns for non fiber particles fragment sphere and film types in all three layers showing increasing abundance with decreasing size with peaks in the 50 100 μm range in the ys and ss and the 100 150 μm range in the es followed by decreases at smaller sizes fig s6 in comparison the size distribution of fibers was generally a gentle curve with a broad increase between 50 and 850 μm that peaked at 1000 2000 μm whereas bottom layers showed two peaks in their size distributions the surface layer of ys and ss were similar in terms of their non fiber distributions but fiber type showed higher values at 200 μm sizes the non fiber type showed similar size distribution patterns in all three polymer density groups but the peak shifted toward a smaller size in the order hd2 hd1 and ld the proportions of hd2 hd1 and ld polymers that were smaller than 100 μm in size were 53 38 and 23 respectively fig 4 3 5 marine aggregated microplastics in off shore regions in total 12 microplastics were found in 459 marine aggregates aggregated fraction and 342 microplastics were found in the remaining water loose fraction aggregated microplastics were found in only 8 of the 21 samples fig s7 the aggregated fraction accounted for 0 28 6 average 3 4 of total microplastics in the water samples from each sampling layer table 1 in the three samples that contained more than 20 of microplastics in the aggregated fraction this pattern resulted from lower abundance of the loose fraction rather than higher abundance of the aggregated fraction polymers observed in the aggregated fraction were five pes three pp two polyurethane pu and two poly ethylene vinyl acetate peva all pes and one pp particles were fiber type and the others were the fragment type in the loose fraction pp 39 pes 19 and alkyd 7 3 were the most abundant polymers and the average proportion of ld polymers was 48 4 the average abundance of microplastics in the loose fraction was about two times higher in the deep sea area relative to continental shelf areas while that in the aggregated fraction was three times lower the average aggregated fractions in the continental shelf and deep sea areas were 7 7 and 1 6 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 abundance and spatial distribution of microplastics the sampling campaigns in this study were conducted once each in the yellow south and east seas it was difficult to address temporal variability in the microplastic distribution at the surface as well as in the water column however the results give an idea of the horizontal and vertical spatial variability by covering a wide area including 22 stations with up to six vertical layers total samples 102 although the continental shelf area yellow and south seas and deep sea area east sea were investigated separately in two different years small hd polymers were consistently abundant at most of the stations surveyed microplastic abundance and polymer composition can vary seasonally and annually the same distribution pattern occurring over wide continental and deep areas over 2 years implies that this trend is probably not a localized phenomenon further study is needed to confirm whether there is seasonal and annual variation in the vertical distribution of microplastics especially in winter when there is no water column stratification the mean abundance of microplastics in surface waters of three regions offshore of south korea was 274 396 particles m3 compared to other studies investigating microplastics less than 100 μm size in offshore waters this value was an order of magnitude lower than those reported in the southern yellow sea 5300 particles m3 converted from the seasonal average of 5 3 items l and south china sea 2569 1770 particles m3 cai et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 the northern yellow sea 545 282 particles m3 and atlantic ocean 13 501 particles m3 showed similar ranges within the present study areas enders et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 to identify the effect of terrestrial inputs of microplastics lines of stations perpendicular to the coast were sampled ys2 ys6 ss2 ss4 es3 es6 along each line the highest abundance of microplastics in surface water was found at stations ys2 and es3 near the coasts and at ss4 far from the coast the south sea was likely affected more strongly by the current than inputs from land as ss4 was located in the region of the tsushima warm current fig s1 and showed high abundance in addition no increasing or decreasing trend in the spatial distribution of microplastics was found among the three offshore regions fig 1b hypothesis i the abundance of microplastics will decrease with increasing distance from the coast along which terrestrial input sources are located is rejected in the study area however at least ys and es showed relatively high abundances of microplastics at the stations closest to the land this finding indicates areas at a distance from land can be directly affected by land based sources 4 2 vertical distribution of microplastics in the water column the size shape and polymer composition of microplastics at each station were generally comparable throughout the water column distinctively the bottom waters of es6 and es8 showed exceptionally high abundance of microplastics in these samples the polymer composition was 96 for pp at es6 and 82 for alkyd at es8 es8 is the station closest 36 km to the southwestern part of an ocean dumping site in the east sea in which dumping is concentrated in a designated area while es6 is located down current from the dumping site figs 5 and s1 this dumping site received terrestrial waste from 1988 to 2015 most of the waste was made up of industrial wastewater and sewage sludge kim et al 2018 which are sources of microplastics murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 the surface sediments at the dumping site contained an extraordinary abundance of microplastics unpublished data the entire water column at es6 except v1 v2 v6 was predominated by pp making up more than 80 of total microplastics although pp is less dense than seawater the proportion increased sharply from v1 28 to v6 97 the dominance of a single polymer over the entire water layer at es6 unlike the adjacent stations indicates that there may be a local source nearby the distribution at es6 was assumed to originate from nearby dokdo island 33 km northeast from es6 which had 230 000 visitors in 2019 fig 1b microplastics can be transported vertically by physical forces such as wind driven mixing kukulka et al 2012 considering such physical factors the abundance of microplastics at the surface is considered to be high and to decrease exponentially toward the bottom kooi et al 2016 song et al 2018 stratification of microplastic abundances across the thermocline was observed in the baltic sea zobkov et al 2019 uurasjärvi et al 2021 and sumba waters cordova and hernawan 2018 the density gradients at the thermocline can retain microplastics in this study however there was no clear tendency in the vertical distribution of microplastics even at the thermocline and the depth with the highest abundance of microplastics varied among stations figs 2 and s8 although microplastics are expected to be most abundant in surface waters song et al 2014 only 7 of 22 stations sampled in this study had the highest abundance in the surface waters the high amount of hd polymers could partly contribute to this vertical distribution hd polymers denser than seawater sink over time without assistance from other factors in comparison 27 of the particles in the whole water column were ld polymers which cannot sink alone among three studies reporting stratification at the thermocline two were dominated by ld polymers pe and pp 70 cordova and hernawan 2018 uurasjärvi et al 2021 the mean percentages of the total microplastic abundance in the surface v1 thermocline v2 v4 and bottom v5 v6 layers for ld polymers were 38 30 and 32 respectively fig s9 however hd polymers had slightly lower percentages in the surface layer than in the thermocline and bottom layers on the other hand the water column is not a homogenous mass of water there are also be differences in the vertical distribution of microplastics resulting from the different origins of the water masses the role of marine aggregates in the sinking of ld polymers through the water column has been reported zhao et al 2017 porter et al 2018 michels et al 2018 although 27 of microplastics in the water column were ld polymers the aggregated fraction accounted for only 7 7 in continental shelf areas and 1 6 in deep sea areas the aggregated fraction accounted for a small fraction and was insufficient to explain the presence of ld polymers in the water column hypothesis iii microplastics incorporated into marine aggregates will account for a larger portion of total microplastics than those floating freely in the water column is rejected in the study area although the aggregated fraction contributes a smaller proportion than the loose fraction in the water column it was confirmed to at least partly contribute to the vertical transport of polymers in offshore areas our understanding of this process remains limited and further field investigations are needed to explain the presence of ld polymers in the water column for which several hypotheses have been proposed first even particles classified as ld polymers may behave differently from virgin resins as plastics in products are often mixed with fillers and other additives that may alter their specific gravity andrady 2011 second interactions with aggregates biofouling and fecal matter facilitate microplastic settling by reducing buoyancy long et al 2015 cole et al 2016 rummel et al 2017 porter et al 2018 chen et al 2019 if organic matter associated with microplastics is consumed decomposed and mineralized during settling those plastics may change into the loose fraction kooi et al 2017 the aggregated fraction was 4 6 times more abundant in the continental shelf area than in the deep sea area this difference was likely due to differing primary productivity formation of aggregates from organic matter in the surface layer and or differing decomposition capacity of organic matter according to water depth third after removal of plankton that ingested microplastics during wet peroxide oxidation the microplastics remaining in the sample were in the loose fraction sun et al 2018 however further research is needed to understand how these factors affect the vertical transport of microplastics in the field 4 3 prevalence of high density polymers in offshore waters hd polymers were pervasive in offshore sites located far 210 km from land which is the source of microplastics gesamp 2016 regularly shaped hd polymer particles larger than a few hundred micrometers can sink to the deep ocean floor within a few days kowalski et al 2016 and cannot travel far in seawater irregularly shaped smaller hd polymers less than a few hundred micrometers settle more slowly kaiser et al 2019 and can travel for periods of months to decades via ocean currents before reaching the sea floor our observation is consistent with this sinking behavior in that at higher polymer densities the proportion of smaller particles increased the tsushima warm current flows consistently from the south sea into the east sea as shown in fig 5a if the hypothesis ii were valid the concentration of hd polymers would decease to the north which is the downstream direction along the east coast of korea deep flow is in the southward direction park et al 2010 however this deep flow is less than 10 of the surface flow and its effect is minor the horizontal distributions of hd polymers in deep waters did not generally show such a decreasing tendency in layer v6 the largest value was found at es8 and a northward decreasing trend was observed considering that the concentration at v5 fig 5c was much lower than that at v6 the high value at v6 originated not from the surface but from the bottom due to ocean dumping when v6 was excluded no decreasing tendency in the downstream direction was found therefore hypothesis ii if currents are the main pathway for microplastics from land based sources low density polymers will be dominant in offshore waters due to density fractionation can be rejected atmospheric deposition is an important pathway for transporting microplastics to the ocean liu et al 2019 microplastic transport through the atmosphere has been reported over distances of up to 95 km followed by deposition in a remote pristine mountain catchment allen et al 2019 in a pilot study we collected atmospheric microplastic collected using a high volume air sampler hv 1000f sibata saitama japan equipped with a pm 2 5 impactor and analyzed by raman spectroscopy during the 2019 east sea cruise see sampling and analytical methods in s11 of si the abundance of microplastic in aerosol was 0 036 particles m3 in the northern es es at1 and 0 016 particles m3 in the southern es es at2 the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa was used to analyze the back trajectory of air mass movement from the station during the sampling period fig s11 this showed that the source of the air mass of es at1 was mainly land based while that of es at2 was land and marine based in the first half but mainly marine based in the second half the size was in the range 6 91 μm and averaged 25 μm 68 of the particles were hd polymers this indicates that atmospheric long range transport is an important input pathway for hd and ld polymer microplastics reaching far offshore waters although their fate is not yet fully understood microplastics arrive in remote areas via several pathways the sinking rate of hd polymers decreases substantially when in aggregates with less dense materials and hd polymer aggregates can be transported farther than individual particles long et al 2015 intentional or accidental waste discharge from ships can also be a source of microplastics and paint chips from ships are the main source of alkyd particles song et al 2014 waller et al 2017 even if microplastic sinks to the seabed that may not be its final destination the spatial distribution and ultimate fate of microplastics is strongly controlled by near bed currents kane et al 2020 non buoyant microplastic particles may be transported as bed load or suspended load depending on benthic shear stress across the sediment water interface zhang 2017 compared to this study dominated by hd polymers pe and pp were the main polymers found in samples from the australian coast reisser et al 2013 mediterranean waters suaria et al 2016 adriatic sea gajst et al 2016 korean coast song et al 2018 north yellow sea zhu et al 2018 and northwestern pacific ocean pan et al 2019 those studies used water collected with manta nets or used saturated nacl solution 1 2 g cm3 for density separation in particular the proportion of ld polymers differed sharply between coastal areas 81 song et al 2018 and offshore areas 23 this study of south korea the major analytical difference between those studies is that song et al 2018 used nacl and this study used lmt for density separation microplastics smaller than 300 μm accounted for 84 of total microplastics in the present study and the proportion of particles in the 20 100 μm size range increased in the order ld 23 hd1 38 and hd2 53 polymers a similar result was reported from the water column along the korean coast with microplastics smaller than 100 μm tending to be composed of hd polymers song et al 2018 this finding indicates that small hd polymers can move over relatively long distances which has two important implications first small microplastics should be included in the sampling and analysis methods for microplastics especially for studies of their fate second even for surface water samples a high density solution should be used for density separation of microplastics especially those of small size in general smaller microplastics had larger proportions of hd polymers the presence of hd polymers should not be overlooked even in surface water 5 conclusion the vertical distribution and characteristics of microplastics were investigated in korean offshore waters the results show that small hd polymers are pervasive in both continental shelf and deep sea areas however hd polymers sink over time and are unlikely to have been transported from land to the study area only by ocean currents based on our analysis the potential for atmospheric transportation of hd polymers was partly demonstrated in this study further research is needed to investigate alternative input pathways of hd polymers such as atmospheric deposition and ship based direct input in remote areas in addition due to the relatively high proportion of hd polymers in offshore waters it is essential to use high density solution to extract microplastics even from surface water samples especially when analyzing small microplastic particles on the other hand ld polymers were observed throughout the water column the aggregated fraction was at low levels in both continental shelf and deep sea waters marine aggregates are thought to be a major sinking mechanism of ld polymers but our results show that the proportion of aggregates in offshore waters was far lower than expected although they were insufficient to explain the presence of ld polymers in the deep water column marine aggregates were confirmed to contribute to the vertical transport of microplastics in offshore areas to understand the vertical transport of microplastics it is essential to investigate the major factors and sinking mechanism of ld polymers in the field declaration of

16929,microplastics are widely distributed throughout aquatic environments information about the vertical distribution and fate of microplastics in seawater remains limited to elucidate the vertical distribution of microplastics three to six vertical water column layers were sampled based on the thermocline depth from which the vertical distribution and characteristics of microplastics larger than 20 μm were investigated in continental shelf and deep sea waters around south korea in addition microplastics incorporated into marine aggregates aggregated fraction were investigated to determine the contribution of aggregates to vertical transport of microplastics the abundance of microplastics was in the range of 15 9 400 particles m3 no consistent trend was observed in the overall vertical profiles the size shape and polymer compositions of microplastics at each station were generally comparable throughout the water column unexpectedly high density hd 1 02 g cm3 polymers accounted for an average of 73 of total microplastics as polymer density increased the proportion of microplastics less than 100 μm in size increased hd polymers also accounted for 68 of the aerosol samples collected together with water samples due to the relatively high proportion of hd polymers in far offshore waters high density solution should be used to extract microplastics even from surface seawaters the aggregated fraction accounted for 0 28 6 average 3 4 of total microplastics marine aggregates are considered an important mechanism of transport for microplastics less dense than seawater to the deep water column but they showed lower proportions than expected in continental shelf and deep sea waters around south korea graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

based sources contribute about 80 of marine plastics debris andrady 2011 jambeck et al 2015 a trend of decreasing abundance of microplastics with distance from the shore has been observed steer et al 2017 eo et al 2018 seo and park 2020 the presence of microplastics has been reported even in areas far from their sources such as deep sea regions peng et al 2020 polar regions cincinelli et al 2017 and remote mountain catchments allen et al 2019 the relative abundance of low density microplastics shows a rising trend with distance from land enders et al 2015 microplastics denser than seawater do not easily reach distant regions as they sink through the water column due to their high density however even polymers less dense than seawater cannot float continuously in the sea due to physical and biological interactions wu et al 2019 although it is important to understand the input pathways of microplastics to remote areas to manage them these pathways have not yet been thoroughly investigated many studies of microplastics have reported little or no information on polymer composition because they analyze samples using only a microscope or report only limited information based on analysis of subsamples silva et al 2018 to investigate the input pathways of microplastics accurate information about their size shape and polymer composition is required most monitoring of microplastics has been conducted in surface waters song et al 2014 cincinelli et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 mu et al 2019 brandon et al 2020 estimation of the total amounts of microplastics only in surface waters could lead to large underestimation of the standing stock of microplastics in the world ocean eriksen et al 2014 koelmans et al 2017 song et al 2018 attempts have been made to estimate microplastic levels through integration of their water column distribution calculated using a physical mixing model with only surface abundance data isobe et al 2015 enders et al 2015 however higher microplastic abundances were observed in the water column than predicted by a physical mixing model in coastal waters song et al 2018 large amounts of microplastics have been found in bottom water as well as surface water bagaev et al 2018 some studies have observed a greater abundance of microplastic in the water column than in surface water dai et al 2018 kanhai et al 2018 choy et al 2019 therefore in situ observation data for both surface and sub surface waters is essential for precise estimation of microplastic standing stocks in the world ocean microplastics in the water column have been sampled using nets gorokhova 2015 uurasjärvi et al 2021 rosette and niskin bottles bagaev et al 2018 cordova and hernawan 2018 dai et al 2018 kanhai et al 2018 submersible pumps lusher et al 2015 song et al 2018 and in situ filtering systems choy et al 2019 tekman et al 2020 however the water volumes sampled were generally less than 100 l most studies have investigated fewer than five stations or five vertical layers and these limited numbers of stations and layers may lead to inaccurate vertical profiles gorokhova 2015 lusher et al 2015 song et al 2018 choy et al 2019 zobkov et al 2019 tekman et al 2020 the generation of comprehensive vertical profiles from measurements at various stations and water layers may improve our understanding of the fate of microplastics in the water column where various marine organisms dwell while microplastics that are less dense than seawater such as polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp are expected to float on the sea surface they are also the dominant polymer types throughout the water column and in bottom waters song et al 2018 previous research has also reported low density polymers in benthic sediments bergmann et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 in addition to density particle size and shape can affect the vertical movement of microplastics kowalski et al 2016 physical mixing and biological interactions can transport microplastics that are less dense than seawater through the water column kukulka et al 2012 long et al 2015 cole et al 2016 rummel et al 2017 microplastics rapidly aggregate with marine biogenic particles michels et al 2018 which accelerates the sinking velocity of the microplastics porter et al 2018 among aggregates collected from a depth of 0 5 m in a 3 m deep harbor 70 contained microplastics zhao et al 2018a however little is known about the contribution of aggregates to vertical transport of microplastics in real marine environments especially in oligotrophic offshore regions zhao et al 2017 de haan et al 2019 the northern and western yellow sea receives the highest level of plastic debris input from china and has relatively high microplastic abundances in the water and sediment zhao et al 2018b zhu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 however no information about the eastern yellow sea the northern east china sea south sea of korea hereafter south sea or the east sea is available fig 1 a in addition the east sea a marginal sea surrounded by korea japan and russia is a deep sea with its own circulation and a good surrogate study area for open ocean processes it is essential to evaluate the abundance distribution and characteristics of microplastics to achieve a global assessment of microplastic pollution moreover revealing the vertical distribution characteristics of microplastics in korean offshore waters may provide useful information for understanding the distribution and fate of microplastics in continental shelf e g the eastern yellow sea and south sea and deep sea e g the east sea regions of the global ocean in this study water samples were collected from surface thermocline and bottom layers to investigate the vertical distribution and characteristics of microplastics larger than 20 μm in the yellow sea south sea and east sea moreover we investigated microplastics in the marine aggregated fraction in continental shelf and deep sea areas compared with the loose fraction through in situ sampling to determine the contribution of aggregates to the vertical transport of microplastics in this study we tested the following hypotheses i the abundance of microplastics will decrease with increasing distance from the coast along which terrestrial input sources are located ii if currents are the main pathway for microplastics from land based sources low density polymers will be dominant in offshore waters due to density fractionation and iii microplastics incorporated into marine aggregates will account for a larger proportion of total microplastics than those floating freely in the water column 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yellow sea is a bay shaped shelf sea located in the northwestern part of the western pacific ocean surrounded by the korean peninsula and china its area is about 380 000 km2 the average depth is 44 m and the maximum depth is 103 m the east sea is a deep marginal sea surrounded by korea russia and japan its area is about 1 070 000 km2 the average depth is 1361 m and the maximum depth is 4049 m the east and yellow seas are connected via both the jeju and korea straits south sea which have a mean depth of 100 m and maximum depth of 210 m along the west coast of korea the dominant flow is northward during winter and southward in summer fig s1 in the central part of the yellow sea a northward current the yellow sea warm current exists only in winter in the south sea the main current is the tsushima warm current which is supplied by a branch of the kuroshio current the taiwan warm current northeastward coastal currents along the chinese coast south 30 n and the yangtze diluted water on entering the east sea the tsushima warm current bifurcates into the east korea warm current moving northward along the east coast of korea and the nearshore branch moving northeast along the west coast of japan 2 2 sample collection in july august 2018 vertical water samples were collected from nine stations in the yellow sea and five stations in the south sea of korea from the r v eardo fig 1b table s1 vertical water samples were collected from eight stations in the east sea in july august 2019 from the r v eardo this is the rainy season in korea and the worst case for microplastic input from land based sources in each area one section perpendicular to the coast was examined to investigate whether the abundance of microplastics decreases with distance from the coast another meridional section was selected to see if the abundance decreases downstream in the main current at each station four to six samples were taken fig 1c one sample was collected in the surface layer v1 1 m below the water surface in the thermocline samples were obtained at the beginning v2 and end points v4 of the layer as determined from the density profile measured with a conductivity temperature depth sampler sbe 911plus ctd seabird sea bird electronics inc bellevue wa usa table s1 at some stations a third sample was collected at the mid point of the thermocline v3 at station ys2 where no thermocline was present intermediate water was sampled at the mid point between the surface and seafloor in the deep layer one sample v6 was collected 2 210 m above the seafloor depending on the depth at some stations another sample v5 was taken at the mid point of the deep layer a total of 102 water samples were collected in three offshore waters around south korea in the yellow and south seas water was sampled using a submersible pump pd 272 wilo fig s2a at each sampling depth using a hose equipped with a flow meter 200 l of water was directly filtered through a 20 μm polyester pes mesh portable net bottom water samples from three stations ys7 ss4 and ss5 were unavailable due to pump failure below 80 m depth in the east sea surface waters v1 were collected using a submersible pump while deeper waters v2 v6 were collected using a rosette sampler with niskin bottles 10 l 20 200 l due to the depth fig s2b the sample in the cod end of the net was transferred to a 1 l pre cleaned amber glass bottle 2 3 analysis of water samples each sample was passed through a 20 µm metal sieve 10 cm ø and washed with high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade water particles remaining on the sieve were transferred to a 250 ml glass beaker and then dried at 60 c in a drying oven until all water had evaporated after drying the organic matter was digested using 20 ml of 35 h2o2 and fe ii solution on a hot plate 75 c 180 rpm for 30 min this process was repeated by adding 20 ml of h2o2 until no organic matter was seen the resulting mixture was passed through a 20 µm metal sieve to remove the remaining solution the particles were transferred to a 120 ml glass density separation funnel using lithium metatungstate lmt solution and allowed to settle overnight the original density of the lmt was 2 95 g cm3 but it was diluted to 1 6 g cm3 with hplc grade water to separate microplastics from denser inorganic particles the settled particles were drained and the remaining solution was filtered onto a 5 µm polycarbonate filter 47 mm ø using a vacuum pump all particles that appeared to be plastic on the filter were identified using micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy micro ft ir nicolet in10 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa in attenuated total reflectance atr mode microplastic particles were randomly examined in 12 5 100 of the total filter area the spectrum was collected with 16 scans in the spectral range of 675 4000 cm 1 and compared with all libraries provided by thermo fisher scientific a spectrum with a hitting rate greater than 70 was considered a microplastic the size of the microplastics was measured as the longest dimension under a microscope with a measurement tool in the ft ir software omnic picta thermo fisher scientific the quality control and blank test are provided in the supplementary information si 2 4 collection and analysis of marine aggregates water samples for investigation of marine aggregates were collected using niskin bottles at 16 stations table 1 these samples were collected mainly at v4 and also in deeper layers v5 or v6 at some stations the water was gently transferred using a peristaltic pump from a niskin bottle into the imhoff settling cone described by lyons et al 2005 with some modifications the cone was fitted with a three way valve between a 5 l inverted square pyramid acrylic container and a 50 ml conical tube falcon high clarity pp centrifuge tube usa fig s2c in total three 15 l or six 30 l cones were used for each sample after the cone was filled with water and left for 2 h to allow settling of marine aggregates the 50 ml conical tube attached to the bottom of the cone was removed all settled aggregates larger than 200 μm in the conical tube were removed using a pipette under an 8 magnifier and stored in a glass vial analysis of these samples followed the same procedures as analysis of water samples all plastic like particles in marine aggregates aggregated fraction and in the remaining water including that in the imhoff cone and conical tube loose fraction were identified using ft ir under the same conditions as water sample analysis 2 5 statistical analyses to compare the abundance of microplastics across the vertical profile the mann whitney u test and kruskal wallis test were used pearson correlation was used to compare the abundance of microplastics and density of water the significance level set to 0 05 for all statistical tests all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistics ver 19 ibm corp armonk ny usa 3 results 3 1 horizontal distributions of microplastics due to contamination by polyvinyl chloride pvc particles from niskin bottles pvc was eliminated from all results see s4 of si for more details microplastics were identified in all 102 water samples the abundance of microplastics was in the range of 15 ss3 v6 9400 es6 v6 particles m3 in surface water samples v1 the latitudinal distribution of microplastics showed similar patterns in the ys and es it decreased gradually toward the south and then increased at the southernmost station fig 1b along three lines perpendicular to the coastline of each sea ys2 ys6 ss2 ss4 and es3 es6 the highest abundances of microplastics in surface waters were found near the coasts of the ys ys2 1820 particles m3 and es es3 860 particles m3 and farthest from the coast of the ss ss4 350 particles m3 excluding two coastal stations ys2 and es3 no monotonic decreasing tendency away from the coast was observed along either of the lines in fact the abundance increased slightly although not significantly in the offshore direction in the ss the abundance decreased and then increased again reaching the maximum farthest from the coast the distances between two adjacent stations on the three lines were between 47 and 105 km for all stations 3 2 vertical distributions of microplastics when the vertical layers were divided into three sections surface v1 thermocline v2 v4 bottom v5 v6 the respective mean abundances of microplastics in the surface thermocline and bottom layers were 266 459 228 330 and 136 104 particles m3 in the continental shelf area ys and ss and 289 280 260 125 and 1136 2043 particles m3 in the deep sea area es table 2 the mean abundance of microplastics in the three vertical layers did not significantly differ in any of the areas kruskal wallis test p 0 05 due to high variability among stations the highest microplastic abundance among vertical layers was found in the bottom layer at 9 stations in the surface layer at 8 stations and in the thermocline at 5 stations among the 22 stations surveyed the individual vertical distribution profiles v1 v6 of microplastic abundances are shown in fig 2 no relationship was observed between the abundance of microplastics and vertical water density δt calculated based on the temperature and salinity pearson correlation p 0 05 six stations had the highest abundance of microplastic at v1 ys2 ys5 ys6 ss1 ss4 and es3 among the eight stations that showed the highest abundance of microplastic at v6 samples from ss5 and es6 es8 showed remarkably higher abundances of microplastics relative to other layers their abundances were 16 52 6 and 4 times higher than those at v1 respectively overall stations in the es showed high abundances in bottom waters however no consistent trend was found in the overall vertical profiles 3 3 polymer composition of microplastics in total 35 polymer types were identified in the water samples based on their theoretical density compared with seawater they were categorized into two polymer types low density ld 1 02 g cm3 and high density hd 1 02 g cm3 polymers high density polymers were further divided into two categories based on the density of saturated nacl solution which is commonly used as a density separation solution high density 1 hd1 1 02 1 2 g cm3 and high density 2 hd2 1 2 g cm3 polymers table s2 the polymer compositions at each station were generally comparable across vertical layers and no vertical gradient in proportions according to polymer density was observed fig 3 moreover ld polymers were found throughout the water column at levels as high as in the surface water except for ys9 the proportion of ld polymers throughout the water column averaged 27 while those of hd1 and hd2 were 33 and 40 respectively fig s5 at es6 pp increased with water depth and accounted for over 80 in all layers except v1 27 7 the proportion of alkyd was remarkably high at stations es7 and es8 located in the southern part of the es 3 4 shape composition and size distribution the fragment shape accounted for more than 70 of particles in the three vertical layers followed by fibers while the sphere and film types were negligible the size distribution exhibited similar patterns for non fiber particles fragment sphere and film types in all three layers showing increasing abundance with decreasing size with peaks in the 50 100 μm range in the ys and ss and the 100 150 μm range in the es followed by decreases at smaller sizes fig s6 in comparison the size distribution of fibers was generally a gentle curve with a broad increase between 50 and 850 μm that peaked at 1000 2000 μm whereas bottom layers showed two peaks in their size distributions the surface layer of ys and ss were similar in terms of their non fiber distributions but fiber type showed higher values at 200 μm sizes the non fiber type showed similar size distribution patterns in all three polymer density groups but the peak shifted toward a smaller size in the order hd2 hd1 and ld the proportions of hd2 hd1 and ld polymers that were smaller than 100 μm in size were 53 38 and 23 respectively fig 4 3 5 marine aggregated microplastics in off shore regions in total 12 microplastics were found in 459 marine aggregates aggregated fraction and 342 microplastics were found in the remaining water loose fraction aggregated microplastics were found in only 8 of the 21 samples fig s7 the aggregated fraction accounted for 0 28 6 average 3 4 of total microplastics in the water samples from each sampling layer table 1 in the three samples that contained more than 20 of microplastics in the aggregated fraction this pattern resulted from lower abundance of the loose fraction rather than higher abundance of the aggregated fraction polymers observed in the aggregated fraction were five pes three pp two polyurethane pu and two poly ethylene vinyl acetate peva all pes and one pp particles were fiber type and the others were the fragment type in the loose fraction pp 39 pes 19 and alkyd 7 3 were the most abundant polymers and the average proportion of ld polymers was 48 4 the average abundance of microplastics in the loose fraction was about two times higher in the deep sea area relative to continental shelf areas while that in the aggregated fraction was three times lower the average aggregated fractions in the continental shelf and deep sea areas were 7 7 and 1 6 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 abundance and spatial distribution of microplastics the sampling campaigns in this study were conducted once each in the yellow south and east seas it was difficult to address temporal variability in the microplastic distribution at the surface as well as in the water column however the results give an idea of the horizontal and vertical spatial variability by covering a wide area including 22 stations with up to six vertical layers total samples 102 although the continental shelf area yellow and south seas and deep sea area east sea were investigated separately in two different years small hd polymers were consistently abundant at most of the stations surveyed microplastic abundance and polymer composition can vary seasonally and annually the same distribution pattern occurring over wide continental and deep areas over 2 years implies that this trend is probably not a localized phenomenon further study is needed to confirm whether there is seasonal and annual variation in the vertical distribution of microplastics especially in winter when there is no water column stratification the mean abundance of microplastics in surface waters of three regions offshore of south korea was 274 396 particles m3 compared to other studies investigating microplastics less than 100 μm size in offshore waters this value was an order of magnitude lower than those reported in the southern yellow sea 5300 particles m3 converted from the seasonal average of 5 3 items l and south china sea 2569 1770 particles m3 cai et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 the northern yellow sea 545 282 particles m3 and atlantic ocean 13 501 particles m3 showed similar ranges within the present study areas enders et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 to identify the effect of terrestrial inputs of microplastics lines of stations perpendicular to the coast were sampled ys2 ys6 ss2 ss4 es3 es6 along each line the highest abundance of microplastics in surface water was found at stations ys2 and es3 near the coasts and at ss4 far from the coast the south sea was likely affected more strongly by the current than inputs from land as ss4 was located in the region of the tsushima warm current fig s1 and showed high abundance in addition no increasing or decreasing trend in the spatial distribution of microplastics was found among the three offshore regions fig 1b hypothesis i the abundance of microplastics will decrease with increasing distance from the coast along which terrestrial input sources are located is rejected in the study area however at least ys and es showed relatively high abundances of microplastics at the stations closest to the land this finding indicates areas at a distance from land can be directly affected by land based sources 4 2 vertical distribution of microplastics in the water column the size shape and polymer composition of microplastics at each station were generally comparable throughout the water column distinctively the bottom waters of es6 and es8 showed exceptionally high abundance of microplastics in these samples the polymer composition was 96 for pp at es6 and 82 for alkyd at es8 es8 is the station closest 36 km to the southwestern part of an ocean dumping site in the east sea in which dumping is concentrated in a designated area while es6 is located down current from the dumping site figs 5 and s1 this dumping site received terrestrial waste from 1988 to 2015 most of the waste was made up of industrial wastewater and sewage sludge kim et al 2018 which are sources of microplastics murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 the surface sediments at the dumping site contained an extraordinary abundance of microplastics unpublished data the entire water column at es6 except v1 v2 v6 was predominated by pp making up more than 80 of total microplastics although pp is less dense than seawater the proportion increased sharply from v1 28 to v6 97 the dominance of a single polymer over the entire water layer at es6 unlike the adjacent stations indicates that there may be a local source nearby the distribution at es6 was assumed to originate from nearby dokdo island 33 km northeast from es6 which had 230 000 visitors in 2019 fig 1b microplastics can be transported vertically by physical forces such as wind driven mixing kukulka et al 2012 considering such physical factors the abundance of microplastics at the surface is considered to be high and to decrease exponentially toward the bottom kooi et al 2016 song et al 2018 stratification of microplastic abundances across the thermocline was observed in the baltic sea zobkov et al 2019 uurasjärvi et al 2021 and sumba waters cordova and hernawan 2018 the density gradients at the thermocline can retain microplastics in this study however there was no clear tendency in the vertical distribution of microplastics even at the thermocline and the depth with the highest abundance of microplastics varied among stations figs 2 and s8 although microplastics are expected to be most abundant in surface waters song et al 2014 only 7 of 22 stations sampled in this study had the highest abundance in the surface waters the high amount of hd polymers could partly contribute to this vertical distribution hd polymers denser than seawater sink over time without assistance from other factors in comparison 27 of the particles in the whole water column were ld polymers which cannot sink alone among three studies reporting stratification at the thermocline two were dominated by ld polymers pe and pp 70 cordova and hernawan 2018 uurasjärvi et al 2021 the mean percentages of the total microplastic abundance in the surface v1 thermocline v2 v4 and bottom v5 v6 layers for ld polymers were 38 30 and 32 respectively fig s9 however hd polymers had slightly lower percentages in the surface layer than in the thermocline and bottom layers on the other hand the water column is not a homogenous mass of water there are also be differences in the vertical distribution of microplastics resulting from the different origins of the water masses the role of marine aggregates in the sinking of ld polymers through the water column has been reported zhao et al 2017 porter et al 2018 michels et al 2018 although 27 of microplastics in the water column were ld polymers the aggregated fraction accounted for only 7 7 in continental shelf areas and 1 6 in deep sea areas the aggregated fraction accounted for a small fraction and was insufficient to explain the presence of ld polymers in the water column hypothesis iii microplastics incorporated into marine aggregates will account for a larger portion of total microplastics than those floating freely in the water column is rejected in the study area although the aggregated fraction contributes a smaller proportion than the loose fraction in the water column it was confirmed to at least partly contribute to the vertical transport of polymers in offshore areas our understanding of this process remains limited and further field investigations are needed to explain the presence of ld polymers in the water column for which several hypotheses have been proposed first even particles classified as ld polymers may behave differently from virgin resins as plastics in products are often mixed with fillers and other additives that may alter their specific gravity andrady 2011 second interactions with aggregates biofouling and fecal matter facilitate microplastic settling by reducing buoyancy long et al 2015 cole et al 2016 rummel et al 2017 porter et al 2018 chen et al 2019 if organic matter associated with microplastics is consumed decomposed and mineralized during settling those plastics may change into the loose fraction kooi et al 2017 the aggregated fraction was 4 6 times more abundant in the continental shelf area than in the deep sea area this difference was likely due to differing primary productivity formation of aggregates from organic matter in the surface layer and or differing decomposition capacity of organic matter according to water depth third after removal of plankton that ingested microplastics during wet peroxide oxidation the microplastics remaining in the sample were in the loose fraction sun et al 2018 however further research is needed to understand how these factors affect the vertical transport of microplastics in the field 4 3 prevalence of high density polymers in offshore waters hd polymers were pervasive in offshore sites located far 210 km from land which is the source of microplastics gesamp 2016 regularly shaped hd polymer particles larger than a few hundred micrometers can sink to the deep ocean floor within a few days kowalski et al 2016 and cannot travel far in seawater irregularly shaped smaller hd polymers less than a few hundred micrometers settle more slowly kaiser et al 2019 and can travel for periods of months to decades via ocean currents before reaching the sea floor our observation is consistent with this sinking behavior in that at higher polymer densities the proportion of smaller particles increased the tsushima warm current flows consistently from the south sea into the east sea as shown in fig 5a if the hypothesis ii were valid the concentration of hd polymers would decease to the north which is the downstream direction along the east coast of korea deep flow is in the southward direction park et al 2010 however this deep flow is less than 10 of the surface flow and its effect is minor the horizontal distributions of hd polymers in deep waters did not generally show such a decreasing tendency in layer v6 the largest value was found at es8 and a northward decreasing trend was observed considering that the concentration at v5 fig 5c was much lower than that at v6 the high value at v6 originated not from the surface but from the bottom due to ocean dumping when v6 was excluded no decreasing tendency in the downstream direction was found therefore hypothesis ii if currents are the main pathway for microplastics from land based sources low density polymers will be dominant in offshore waters due to density fractionation can be rejected atmospheric deposition is an important pathway for transporting microplastics to the ocean liu et al 2019 microplastic transport through the atmosphere has been reported over distances of up to 95 km followed by deposition in a remote pristine mountain catchment allen et al 2019 in a pilot study we collected atmospheric microplastic collected using a high volume air sampler hv 1000f sibata saitama japan equipped with a pm 2 5 impactor and analyzed by raman spectroscopy during the 2019 east sea cruise see sampling and analytical methods in s11 of si the abundance of microplastic in aerosol was 0 036 particles m3 in the northern es es at1 and 0 016 particles m3 in the southern es es at2 the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa was used to analyze the back trajectory of air mass movement from the station during the sampling period fig s11 this showed that the source of the air mass of es at1 was mainly land based while that of es at2 was land and marine based in the first half but mainly marine based in the second half the size was in the range 6 91 μm and averaged 25 μm 68 of the particles were hd polymers this indicates that atmospheric long range transport is an important input pathway for hd and ld polymer microplastics reaching far offshore waters although their fate is not yet fully understood microplastics arrive in remote areas via several pathways the sinking rate of hd polymers decreases substantially when in aggregates with less dense materials and hd polymer aggregates can be transported farther than individual particles long et al 2015 intentional or accidental waste discharge from ships can also be a source of microplastics and paint chips from ships are the main source of alkyd particles song et al 2014 waller et al 2017 even if microplastic sinks to the seabed that may not be its final destination the spatial distribution and ultimate fate of microplastics is strongly controlled by near bed currents kane et al 2020 non buoyant microplastic particles may be transported as bed load or suspended load depending on benthic shear stress across the sediment water interface zhang 2017 compared to this study dominated by hd polymers pe and pp were the main polymers found in samples from the australian coast reisser et al 2013 mediterranean waters suaria et al 2016 adriatic sea gajst et al 2016 korean coast song et al 2018 north yellow sea zhu et al 2018 and northwestern pacific ocean pan et al 2019 those studies used water collected with manta nets or used saturated nacl solution 1 2 g cm3 for density separation in particular the proportion of ld polymers differed sharply between coastal areas 81 song et al 2018 and offshore areas 23 this study of south korea the major analytical difference between those studies is that song et al 2018 used nacl and this study used lmt for density separation microplastics smaller than 300 μm accounted for 84 of total microplastics in the present study and the proportion of particles in the 20 100 μm size range increased in the order ld 23 hd1 38 and hd2 53 polymers a similar result was reported from the water column along the korean coast with microplastics smaller than 100 μm tending to be composed of hd polymers song et al 2018 this finding indicates that small hd polymers can move over relatively long distances which has two important implications first small microplastics should be included in the sampling and analysis methods for microplastics especially for studies of their fate second even for surface water samples a high density solution should be used for density separation of microplastics especially those of small size in general smaller microplastics had larger proportions of hd polymers the presence of hd polymers should not be overlooked even in surface water 5 conclusion the vertical distribution and characteristics of microplastics were investigated in korean offshore waters the results show that small hd polymers are pervasive in both continental shelf and deep sea areas however hd polymers sink over time and are unlikely to have been transported from land to the study area only by ocean currents based on our analysis the potential for atmospheric transportation of hd polymers was partly demonstrated in this study further research is needed to investigate alternative input pathways of hd polymers such as atmospheric deposition and ship based direct input in remote areas in addition due to the relatively high proportion of hd polymers in offshore waters it is essential to use high density solution to extract microplastics even from surface water samples especially when analyzing small microplastic particles on the other hand ld polymers were observed throughout the water column the aggregated fraction was at low levels in both continental shelf and deep sea waters marine aggregates are thought to be a major sinking mechanism of ld polymers but our results show that the proportion of aggregates in offshore waters was far lower than expected although they were insufficient to explain the presence of ld polymers in the deep water column marine aggregates were confirmed to contribute to the vertical transport of microplastics in offshore areas to understand the vertical transport of microplastics it is essential to investigate the major factors and sinking mechanism of ld polymers in the field declaration of
