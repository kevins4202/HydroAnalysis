curve swcc for unfrozen soils kurylyk and watanabe 2013 the underlying mechanism is the similarity between the drying wetting process in ice free unsaturated soil and freezing thawing process in air free frozen soil koopmans and miller 1966 spaans and baker 1996 miller 1980 pointed out the matric suction at the water air interface resisting the draining of liquid water from the pores acts in the same way as the suction at the water ice interface resisting the change of phase of the liquid water to ice utilizing this similarity the bundle of cylindrical capillary bcc model where a soil is conceptualized as a bundle of cylindrical capillaries can also be extended from ice free unsaturated soils to partially frozen soils liu and yu 2013 in theory an sfcc can be formulated by choosing an appropriate equation for the swcc in which the water content associated with the matric suction can be obtained firstly this matric suction is then replaced by the suction at the water ice interface with the determination by a form of the clapeyron equation that provides the relationship between cryogenic suction and negative temperature finally the water content associated with negative temperature i e the sfcc can be obtained it should be pointed out the similarity between the drying wetting process and freezing thawing process in the soil not only provides the theoretical basis formulating a physically based equation for the sfcc but also facilitates making use of research achievement in abundant swccs several swcc derived sfccs are listed here for reference sheshukov and nieber 2011 watanabe et al 2011 liu and yu 2013 teng et al 2020 soils are usually subjected to various hydraulic and stress conditions in the field affecting the pore structure ng and pang 2000 zhou and ng 2014 and thus the sfcc wang et al 2017 mu et al 2019 for some gap graded soils and bentonites they usually exhibit a bimodal or multimodal pore size distribution due to at least two scales of pore sizes resulting in a multimodal swcc or sfcc zhang and chen 2005 kozlowski and nartowska 2013 in this regard the equation predicting a bimodal or multimodal sfcc should accommodate soil heterogeneous pore structure relevant work was shown by watanabe et al 2011 where an sfcc was formulated by multiplying the expressions of the sfcc in each level of the pore size with respective weighing factors which follows the similar idea dealing with a bimodal swcc in unfrozen soils zhang and chen 2005 della vecchia et al 2015 in addition for an expansive soil the swelling property of the aggregates needs to be considered while formulating the swcc or sfcc especially the evolution of the microstructural pore structure along the hydro mechanical paths delage et al 2006 monroy et al 2010 zhang and li 2010 romero et al 2011 wang et al 2013 saba et al 2014 romero et al 2011 and della vecchia et al 2015 pointed out the important role of the pore size distribution evolving for modelling an swcc in expansive materials so does the sfcc previous studies on the sfcc mainly focused on the effects of soil physical properties such as specific surface area liquid limit plasticity

studied the influences of stress history mechanical loads and freeze thaw cycles konrad 1990 kozlowski and nartowska 2013 mu et al 2019 kong et al 2022 carried out the nuclear magnetic resonance nmr test to measure the unfrozen water content for expansive soils with a bimodal pore size distribution and formulated a mathematical model to predict the sfccs however the parameters used in their model lacked of physical mechanism and the effects of typically swelling property in an expansive soil on the sfcc were neglected relevant studies in formulating a physically based equation predicting the sfcc for the expansive soil with the consideration of microstructural pore structure and its evolution along hydration have not been found yet in this paper a physically based equation of the sfcc for single porosity soil is firstly presented and the parameters involved are analyzed in detail then the equation is extended for expansive soils with a double porosity structure and two scenarios of the hydraulic conditions for expansive soils are introduced for each scenario the equation predicting the sfcc accounting for the microstructural pore size evolving or not due to the swelling potential of the aggregates is validated by the experimental data respectively the influences of hydraulic condition on the pore structure of expansive soils as well as the consequences of this pore structure evolving on the sfcc are emphasized and quantified note that the measurement of the sfcc is currently only carried out in a closed system the framework presented herein however could provide the theoretical prediction of the sfcc upon hydration which contributes to modelling the water heat transfer process in an unsaturated freezing soil 2 the physically based equation predicting the sfcc the measured swccs for the sand diatomaceous earth mixtures by burger and shackelford 2001a 2001b demonstrates that when two or more pore series exist in a soil the swcc can be bimodal or multimodal which is different to the normally unimodal characteristic likewise bimodal sfccs have been observed in the experiments of representative bentonites carried out by kozlowski and nartowska 2013 due to the bimodal pore size distribution kong et al 2022 therefore the equations predicting the sfcc for single porosity and double porosity soil should be distinguished and formulated by their instinct pore structures respectively 2 1 for single porosity soil a physically based equation predicting the sfcc can be formulated starting from the equation most commonly used for the swcc that is the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 1 θ 1 1 α s n m where s is the matric suction α n and m are three parameters θ is the normalized water content written as 2 θ θ θ r θ s θ r where the subscripts s and r indicate respectively the saturated and residual values of the water content θ which defines the amount of water contained within the pores of soil in the different fields such as soil science geotechnical engineering and geophysics θ can refer to the volumetric water content gravimetric water content and the degree of saturation respectively fredlund and xing 1994 to extend eq 2 to unsaturated frozen soils however some notations should be slightly modified and interpretated eq 3 gives the modified expression of the normalized water content for unsaturated frozen soils 3 θ θ u θ r θ 0 θ r it can be seen that the subscript u is added to specifically represent the unfrozen water and θ s in eq 2 is replaced by θ 0 to accommodate both saturated and unsaturated conditions where the subscript 0 indicates the initial value of water content and θ 0 equals to θ s given the initially saturated state same treatments can be found elsewhere liu and yu 2013 bai et al 2018 the similitude theory provides the relationship between the matric suction at the water air interface s and the suction at the water ice interface s t koopmans and miller 1966 spaans and baker 1996 as below 4 s t γ s where the coefficient γ represents a ratio of specific surface energies at the air water and ice water interfaces under saturated conditions koopmans and miller 1966 concluded that for ss soils with direct solid solid contact between particles γ 2 2 while γ 1 for sls soils with solid liquid solid contact where the particles are always separated by liquid water although the temperature dependence of γ has also been addressed by kurylyk and watanabe 2013 given the uncertainty in defining γ for different types of soil and to keep the model simple enough we set γ 1 in this paper it should be noted that eq 4 has been widely used for unsaturated freezing soils although it was primarily developed for saturated frozen soils sheshukov and nieber 2011 the clapeyron equation gives the relationship between the pressure and negative temperature for the water ice system black 1995 henry 2000 utilizing this relationship thomas et al 2009 derived the expression of the suction at water ice interface with negative temperature 5 s t ρ w l t t 0 t 0 where ρ w is the density of liquid water l is the latent heat of water fusion t is the temperature and t 0 is the freezing point of pore water both in kelvin combining eqs 1 3 4 and 5 we obtain the equation predicting the sfcc for a single porosity soil in the following form 6 1 θ θ u θ r θ 0 θ r 1 1 α ρ w l t t 0 t 0 n m then the unfrozen water content can be formulated as 6 2 θ u θ 0 θ r θ θ r θ 0 θ r 1 1 α ρ w l t t 0 t 0 n m θ r note that eqs 6 1 and 6 2 are valid with a negative temperature when the temperature is higher than 0 c θ 1 and θ u θ 0 compared with the empirical expressions predicting the sfcc such as the power function by anderson and tice 1972 the exponential function by michalowski and zhu 2006 one of the advantages using the physically based equation is that the parameters α m and n are not restricted by one type of soils and the model can be easily extended and further investigated based on the information provided by parametric analysis the model prediction using eq 6 2 is shown in fig 1 the values of involved parameters are first determined followed by the parametric analysis to study the influences of model parameters on the shape of the sfcc which is shown in fig 2 as can be observed from fig 2 a a typical sfcc includes three distinct stages the supercooling stage with the unfrozen water content remaining unchanged as the initial water content when the temperature drops below 0 c the fast freezing stage with the unfrozen water content decreasing rapidly the stable frozen stage with the unfrozen water content keeping unchanged at the residual water content with temperature further decreasing bai et al 2018 kong et al 2020 wang et al 2017 investigated the sfcc based on pore size distribution for single porosity soil and concluded that the parameters α m and n are closely related to the initial freezing point of maximum pores in the soil the residual water content and the phase change intensity respectively to avoid the discussion on the effects of initial and residual values of the water content we choose the normalized water content as the ordinate for the parametric analysis the results can be seen in fig 2 b c and d generally speaking α dominants the supercooling stage n influences the fast freezing stage and m controls the stable frozen stage respectively as shown in fig 2 b when α 1 kpa increases from 1e 4 to 8e 4 while n and m are fixed as 7 729 and 0 49 respectively the curve as a whole shifts to the left with a shorter supercooling stage as can be seen from fig 2 c n has a minor effect on the supercooling stage compared with α but it controls the slope of the rapid freezing stage where the steeper slope could be observed with the higher value m has little effect on the supercooling stage and it dominates the stable frozen stage as presented in fig 2 d a lower value of m determines a gentler slope of the rapid freezing stage and results in a higher water content when the temperature achieves below 30 c 2 2 for double porosity soil many natural geomaterials such as aggregated soils exhibit a pore size distribution with at least two dominant scales of pore sizes corresponding to the macropores and micropores macropores herein refer to pores between aggregates or inter aggregate pores and micropores are pores inside aggregates or intra aggregate pores more information on criteria to distinguish the macropores and micropores for interested readers is available in romero et al 2011 following the methods formulating an equation predicting the bimodal swcc della vecchia et al 2015 the equation predicting a bimodal sfcc can be obtained by assigning the weighing factors to unfrozen water contents in two classes of pore sizes 7 θ e m e 1 1 α m ρ w l t t 0 t 0 n m m m e m e 1 1 α m ρ w l t t 0 t 0 n m m m where subscripts m and m represent the macropores and micropores respectively e is the current void ratio e m is the macrostructural void ratio defined as the ratio of volume occupied by macropores to the volume of soil solids e m refers to the microstructural void ratio defined as the ratio of volume occupied by micropores to the volume of soil solids obviously e e m e m the weighing factors e m e and e m e represent the proportions of volume occupied by micropores and macropores to the total pore volume and satisfy e m e 1 e m e thus eq 7 is used to predict a bimodal sfcc with one independent weighing factor and two pairs of parameters α n and m in respective levels of pore sizes the conceptual superposition of unfrozen water contents in two scales of pore sizes whose envelopes finally result in the bimodality of the sfcc is shown in fig 3 as can be seen the resultant sfcc shows the similar behavior to the one of macrostructure in the small range of temperature deviating from 0 c and reaches the curve corresponding to the one of microstructure in the stable frozen stage the value of the microstructural weighing factor e m e determines the vertical position of the inflection point in the resultant bimodal sfcc and the range of bimodality is affected by the supercooling stage exhibiting in the sfcc of the microstructural pore size which is determined by the value of α m the predicted sfccs of five representative bentonites kozlowski and nartowska 2013 using eq 7 with the combination of eq 3 are presented in fig 4 the results show that model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data by utilizing eq 7 the bimodality in measured sfccs can be well characterized all the water content data are normalized before the calibration of model parameters is conducted as can be seen the measured sfccs can be divided into a rapid drop part and a slow drop part and a plateau occurs between these two parts the value of e m e is determined and fixed as the normalized water content where the plateau lies given tentative values of α m and α m to fit the general shape of the measured curve macroscopic parameters α m n m and m m and microscopic parameters α m n m and m m are calibrated through the water content above and below the plateau respectively further parameter adjustment is processed by the best fitting of the plateau these values of model parameters can be found in the embedded table of the relevant figures 3 formulating the sfcc of the expansive soil in two scenarios of the hydraulic conditions most expansive soils exhibit an initially bimodal pore structure such as compacted clay romero et al 2011 bentonite sand mixture saba et al 2014 and bentonite silty clay mixture kong et al 2022 this bimodality in the pore size distribution results in a correspondingly bimodal sfcc which has been validated by both experimental observation and model prediction shown in fig 4 likewise using eq 7 the bimodal curves of bentonite silty clay mixtures kong et al 2022 are predicted and depicted in fig 5 however the measured sfccs for these bentonite silty clay mixtures rarely show a bimodal shape it should be pointed out that eq 7 is primarily formulated for the soil exhibiting double porosity structure with no focus on the effects of the evolution of bimodality however to formulate the sfcc of the expansive soil the swelling potential of the aggregates along different hydraulic paths should be taken into consideration this also explains why the measured sfccs exhibit bimodal characteristic by kozlowski and nartowska 2013 while the sfccs by kong et al 2022 show unimodal shape in the experiments carried out by kozlowski and nartowska 2013 the unfrozen water content was obtained by the differential scanning calorimeter dsc method which required a closed system where low permeability soils undergo freezing without access to a free water source herein we refer this hydraulic condition as the first scenario in the experiments conducted by kong et al 2022 another scenario of hydraulic condition can be found where all the samples were fully saturated before freezing for the first scenario the initial bimodality in the pore size distribution can be regarded undisturbed due to the low permeability of the soil and no access to the water supply thus eq 7 is applicable for this scenario however for the second scenario the initially bimodal structure has changed after saturation which is originated by both expansion of the micropores and reduction of macropores with access to free water the evolved soil fabric after saturation needs to be reconsidered while using eq 7 obviously kong et al 2022 neglected the important role of aggregate swelling and the accompanying evolution of pore structure while proposing their mathematical model many experiments on compacted clays have provided an insight to the law ruling the evolution of microstructure the swelling property of the aggregates along hydro mechanical paths can be given as the following form referred to della vecchia et al 2015 8 e m e β 0 e s r 2 β 1 s r e m 0 e it should be pointed out that despite the fact that eq 8 is capable of accounting for both hydraulic and mechanical paths considering that experiments by kozlowski and nartowska 2013 and kong et al 2022 are all carried out without any loads the effects of hydraulic path only on the swelling potential and thus on the model parameters of the sfcc are taken into consideration and the void ratio e is assumed to keep as the initial value as can be seen the weighing factor e m e is no longer the constant in eq 7 β 0 and β 1 are parameters quantifying the swelling potential of the aggregates which are related to the activity index of soils e m 0 is the initially microstructural void ratio e m 0 e represents the initial ratio of the volume of micropores to the total pore volume before freezing referring to kong et al 2022 the pore radius discriminating micropores and macropores for four bentonite silty clay mixtures is set as 0 1 μ m the weighting factor e m 0 e can be obtained by extracting the mercury intrusion curve data at the mercury pressure corresponding to the pore radius determined for an unsaturated frozen soil the degree of saturation s r is defined as the proportion of the volume of the equivalent water liquid water and ice to the total pore volume s r 0 means there is no equivalent water in soils and s r 1 means there is no air in soils this concept will help to clarify the freezing process of unsaturated soils and analyze the evolution of the sfcc along saturation hereinafter except for the evolving law of soil fabric the evolving trend that α m decreases and α m increases upon hydration is concluded by della vecchia et al 2015 through the calibration procedure which is helpful for determining the values of model parameters simulating the sfcc in the second scenario the physical and swelling properties of bentonite silty clay mixtures are shown in table 1 using eq 8 we calculate the final values of e m e for the mixtures along saturation at the constant volume condition the degree of saturation s r equals to 1 and the void ratio e equals to the initial value the calculated values are also listed in table 1 compared with the initial values originated by the initial pore size distributions the final values of e m e after saturation increase due to the expansion of the aggregates note that for samples b70 and b100 the calculated values of e m e reach near and exceed 1 which means there only exist one dominant pore size in these two samples after saturation romero et al 2011 analyzed the sensitivity of the aggregates of boom clay to hydraulic and mechanical paths they found that a clear bimodal distribution with dominant pore modes at around 13 μ m and 60 nm for macro and micropores respectively evolves into only a single peak at around 1 2 μ m after saturation herein we use the mathematical computation of e m e more than or equal to 1 to represent the experimental observation therefore for samples b70 and b100 eq 6 2 for a single porosity soil can be used to model the sfcc for samples b30 and b50 eqs 3 and 7 are combined to simulate the observed unimodal sfccs where the weighing factor is calculated by eq 8 accounting for the evolved pore size distribution after saturation the predicted curves of four samples are depicted in fig 6 it can be seen that the method not only generates the unimodal sfccs as observed in four samples but also predicts the supercooling stage very well which covers the deficiency of the model proposed by kong et al 2022 4 theoretical sfccs along hydration at constant volume condition as pointed out in the previous section sfccs depicted in fig 6 are determined by soil fabric at finally saturated state no relevant sfccs at different levels of saturation are provided in general in the process of soil freezing water will flow into the soil pores resulting in water redistribution in the soil this change of water content affects the swelling of an expansive soil in the first scenario where low permeability soils undergo freezing without access to a free water source the swelling potential of the expansive soils during freezing can be assumed to be negligible because the hydration process accompanied by the freezing process is not obvious for an unsaturated soil undergoing freezing in an open hydraulic system where the soil is accessible to the free water the water can migrate into the soil and solidify into ice due to the cryogenic suction in this freezing process the air in the soil would be discharged and the degree of saturation s r increases sheshukov and nieber 2011 yin et al 2018 the hydraulic condition from unsaturated to saturated state affects the pore structure in the expansive soil due to the swelling potential of the aggregates thus the permeability of the soil and the amount of unfrozen water content knowing the unfrozen water content at different levels of saturation along hydration plays an important role in modelling the water heat transfer in the freezing process and contributes to quantifying the frost heave in an unsaturated expansive soil however most sfccs neglect the hydraulic effects and experiments measuring the sfcc are all conducted in a closed system the evolution of the sfcc along hydration should be given at least in the scope of the theoretical framework in this section we provide the theoretical sfccs at different levels of saturation for an expansive soil at the constant volume condition the original soil fabric is extracted from the sample b30 four degrees of saturation s r are given for modelling to reduce the number of parameters affecting the evolution of the sfcc as much as possible n m m m n m and m m in eq 7 are assumed to be constant along hydration at any level of saturation a microstructural pore structure can be specifically determined followed by the specific values of α m α m and e m e the values of e m e can be calculated by eq 8 the evolving trend of α m and α m that is an increase of α m and a decrease of α m followed by the expansion of the micropores and reduction of macropores along saturation from as compacted to s r 1 is captured in fig 7 to give the theoretical values of α m and α m at any other levels of saturation exponential expressions of α m and α m with e m and e m e respectively are used herein referred to della vecchia et al 2015 although the validity of these expressions for the sample b30 needs to be claimed in future work the values of model parameter under four degrees of saturation are listed in table 2 the theoretical sfccs of an expansive soil along hydration are shown in fig 8 along hydration the vertical position of the inflection point elevates with e m e increasing gradually and an initially bimodal sfcc evolves into a finally unimodal shape which tends to a longer supercooling stage and a gentler slope in the fast freezing stage 5 conclusions a physically based equation predicting the sfcc is based on the similarity between the drying wetting process and freezing thawing process in this study the approach formulating the sfcc of the expansive soil is presented accounting for the pore size distribution and its evolution along the hydraulic path followed by model validation and detailed analysis the main conclusions are as follows 1 in general parameter α dominants the supercooling stage n controls the slope of the rapid freezing stage and m influences the stable frozen stage a shorter supercooling stage a steeper rapid freezing stage and a lower water content in the stable frozen stage can be observed with an increase in α n and m respectively 2 by introducing the weighing factors in two scales of pore sizes the equation for single porosity soil is extended for double porosity soil with the ability in well characterizing the bimodality of the sfcc the resultant sfcc shows the similar behavior to the one of macrostructure in the small range of temperature deviating from 0 c and reaches the curve corresponding to the one of microstructure in the stable frozen stage the vertical position of the inflection point in the resultant sfcc is determined by the microstructural weighing factor e m e and the range of bimodality is affected by the microstructural value α m 3 two scenarios of the hydraulic conditions should be distinguished in formulating the sfcc for an expansive soil for the first scenario where the soil exhibits low permeability and has no access to the free water the evolution of soil fabric can be neglected for the second scenario where the soil has access to the free water the important role of aggregate swelling and the accompanying evolution of the pore structure should be taken into consideration in the model 4 theoretical sfccs along hydration are given at four levels of saturation with the degree of saturation s r increasing an increase of α m and a decrease of α m is expected due to the expansion of the micropores and reduction of macropores the vertical position of the inflection point elevates with an increase in e m e and an initially bimodal sfcc evolves into a finally unimodal shape which exhibits a longer supercooling stage and a gentler slope in the fast cooling stage credit authorship contribution statement xiao yin conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis

the subscript 0 indicates the initial value of water content and θ 0 equals to θ s given the initially saturated state same treatments can be found elsewhere liu and yu 2013 bai et al 2018 the similitude theory provides the relationship between the matric suction at the water air interface s and the suction at the water ice interface s t koopmans and miller 1966 spaans and baker 1996 as below 4 s t γ s where the coefficient γ represents a ratio of specific surface energies at the air water and ice water interfaces under saturated conditions koopmans and miller 1966 concluded that for ss soils with direct solid solid contact between particles γ 2 2 while γ 1 for sls soils with solid liquid solid contact where the particles are always separated by liquid water although the temperature dependence of γ has also been addressed by kurylyk and watanabe 2013 given the uncertainty in defining γ for different types of soil and to keep the model simple enough we set γ 1 in this paper it should be noted that eq 4 has been widely used for unsaturated freezing soils although it was primarily developed for saturated frozen soils sheshukov and nieber 2011 the clapeyron equation gives the relationship between the pressure and negative temperature for the water ice system black 1995 henry 2000 utilizing this relationship thomas et al 2009 derived the expression of the suction at water ice interface with negative temperature 5 s t ρ w l t t 0 t 0 where ρ w is the density of liquid water l is the latent heat of water fusion t is the temperature and t 0 is the freezing point of pore water both in kelvin combining eqs 1 3 4 and 5 we obtain the equation predicting the sfcc for a single porosity soil in the following form 6 1 θ θ u θ r θ 0 θ r 1 1 α ρ w l t t 0 t 0 n m then the unfrozen water content can be formulated as 6 2 θ u θ 0 θ r θ θ r θ 0 θ r 1 1 α ρ w l t t 0 t 0 n m θ r note that eqs 6 1 and 6 2 are valid with a negative temperature when the temperature is higher than 0 c θ 1 and θ u θ 0 compared with the empirical expressions predicting the sfcc such as the power function by anderson and tice 1972 the exponential function by michalowski and zhu 2006 one of the advantages using the physically based equation is that the parameters α m and n are not restricted by one type of soils and the model can be easily extended and further investigated based on the information provided by parametric analysis the model prediction using eq 6 2 is shown in fig 1 the values of involved parameters are first determined followed by the parametric analysis to study the influences of model parameters on the shape of the sfcc which is shown in fig 2 as can be observed from fig 2 a a typical sfcc includes three distinct stages the supercooling stage with the unfrozen water content remaining unchanged as the initial water content when the temperature drops below 0 c the fast freezing stage with the unfrozen water content decreasing rapidly the stable frozen stage with the unfrozen water content keeping unchanged at the residual water content with temperature further decreasing bai et al 2018 kong et al 2020 wang et al 2017 investigated the sfcc based on pore size distribution for single porosity soil and concluded that the parameters α m and n are closely related to the initial freezing point of maximum pores in the soil the residual water content and the phase change intensity respectively to avoid the discussion on the effects of initial and residual values of the water content we choose the normalized water content as the ordinate for the parametric analysis the results can be seen in fig 2 b c and d generally speaking α dominants the supercooling stage n influences the fast freezing stage and m controls the stable frozen stage respectively as shown in fig 2 b when α 1 kpa increases from 1e 4 to 8e 4 while n and m are fixed as 7 729 and 0 49 respectively the curve as a whole shifts to the left with a shorter supercooling stage as can be seen from fig 2 c n has a minor effect on the supercooling stage compared with α but it controls the slope of the rapid freezing stage where the steeper slope could be observed with the higher value m has little effect on the supercooling stage and it dominates the stable frozen stage as presented in fig 2 d a lower value of m determines a gentler slope of the rapid freezing stage and results in a higher water content when the temperature achieves below 30 c 2 2 for double porosity soil many natural geomaterials such as aggregated soils exhibit a pore size distribution with at least two dominant scales of pore sizes corresponding to the macropores and micropores macropores herein refer to pores between aggregates or inter aggregate pores and micropores are pores inside aggregates or intra aggregate pores more information on criteria to distinguish the macropores and micropores for interested readers is available in romero et al 2011 following the methods formulating an equation predicting the bimodal swcc della vecchia et al 2015 the equation predicting a bimodal sfcc can be obtained by assigning the weighing factors to unfrozen water contents in two classes of pore sizes 7 θ e m e 1 1 α m ρ w l t t 0 t 0 n m m m e m e 1 1 α m ρ w l t t 0 t 0 n m m m where subscripts m and m represent the macropores and micropores respectively e is the current void ratio e m is the macrostructural void ratio defined as the ratio of volume occupied by macropores to the volume of soil solids e m refers to the microstructural void ratio defined as the ratio of volume occupied by micropores to the volume of soil solids obviously e e m e m the weighing factors e m e and e m e represent the proportions of volume occupied by micropores and macropores to the total pore volume and satisfy e m e 1 e m e thus eq 7 is used to predict a bimodal sfcc with one independent weighing factor and two pairs of parameters α n and m in respective levels of pore sizes the conceptual superposition of unfrozen water contents in two scales of pore sizes whose envelopes finally result in the bimodality of the sfcc is shown in fig 3 as can be seen the resultant sfcc shows the similar behavior to the one of macrostructure in the small range of temperature deviating from 0 c and reaches the curve corresponding to the one of microstructure in the stable frozen stage the value of the microstructural weighing factor e m e determines the vertical position of the inflection point in the resultant bimodal sfcc and the range of bimodality is affected by the supercooling stage exhibiting in the sfcc of the microstructural pore size which is determined by the value of α m the predicted sfccs of five representative bentonites kozlowski and nartowska 2013 using eq 7 with the combination of eq 3 are presented in fig 4 the results show that model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data by utilizing eq 7 the bimodality in measured sfccs can be well characterized all the water content data are normalized before the calibration of model parameters is conducted as can be seen the measured sfccs can be divided into a rapid drop part and a slow drop part and a plateau occurs between these two parts the value of e m e is determined and fixed as the normalized water content where the plateau lies given tentative values of α m and α m to fit the general shape of the measured curve macroscopic parameters α m n m and m m and microscopic parameters α m n m and m m are calibrated through the water content above and below the plateau respectively further parameter adjustment is processed by the best fitting of the plateau these values of model parameters can be found in the embedded table of the relevant figures 3 formulating the sfcc of the expansive soil in two scenarios of the hydraulic conditions most expansive soils exhibit an initially bimodal pore structure such as compacted clay romero et al 2011 bentonite sand mixture saba et al 2014 and bentonite silty clay mixture kong et al 2022 this bimodality in the pore size distribution results in a correspondingly bimodal sfcc which has been validated by both experimental observation and model prediction shown in fig 4 likewise using eq 7 the bimodal curves of bentonite silty clay mixtures kong et al 2022 are predicted and depicted in fig 5 however the measured sfccs for these bentonite silty clay mixtures rarely show a bimodal shape it should be pointed out that eq 7 is primarily formulated for the soil exhibiting double porosity structure with no focus on the effects of the evolution of bimodality however to formulate the sfcc of the expansive soil the swelling potential of the aggregates along different hydraulic paths should be taken into consideration this also explains why the measured sfccs exhibit bimodal characteristic by kozlowski and nartowska 2013 while the sfccs by kong et al 2022 show unimodal shape in the experiments carried out by kozlowski and nartowska 2013 the unfrozen water content was obtained by the differential scanning calorimeter dsc method which required a closed system where low permeability soils undergo freezing without access to a free water source herein we refer this hydraulic condition as the first scenario in the experiments conducted by kong et al 2022 another scenario of hydraulic condition can be found where all the samples were fully saturated before freezing for the first scenario the initial bimodality in the pore size distribution can be regarded undisturbed due to the low permeability of the soil and no access to the water supply thus eq 7 is applicable for this scenario however for the second scenario the initially bimodal structure has changed after saturation which is originated by both expansion of the micropores and reduction of macropores with access to free water the evolved soil fabric after saturation needs to be reconsidered while using eq 7 obviously kong et al 2022 neglected the important role of aggregate swelling and the accompanying evolution of pore structure while proposing their mathematical model many experiments on compacted clays have provided an insight to the law ruling the evolution of microstructure the swelling property of the aggregates along hydro mechanical paths can be given as the following form referred to della vecchia et al 2015 8 e m e β 0 e s r 2 β 1 s r e m 0 e it should be pointed out that despite the fact that eq 8 is capable of accounting for both hydraulic and mechanical paths considering that experiments by kozlowski and nartowska 2013 and kong et al 2022 are all carried out without any loads the effects of hydraulic path only on the swelling potential and thus on the model parameters of the sfcc are taken into consideration and the void ratio e is assumed to keep as the initial value as can be seen the weighing factor e m e is no longer the constant in eq 7 β 0 and β 1 are parameters quantifying the swelling potential of the aggregates which are related to the activity index of soils e m 0 is the initially microstructural void ratio e m 0 e represents the initial ratio of the volume of micropores to the total pore volume before freezing referring to kong et al 2022 the pore radius discriminating micropores and macropores for four bentonite silty clay mixtures is set as 0 1 μ m the weighting factor e m 0 e can be obtained by extracting the mercury intrusion curve data at the mercury pressure corresponding to the pore radius determined for an unsaturated frozen soil the degree of saturation s r is defined as the proportion of the volume of the equivalent water liquid water and ice to the total pore volume s r 0 means there is no equivalent water in soils and s r 1 means there is no air in soils this concept will help to clarify the freezing process of unsaturated soils and analyze the evolution of the sfcc along saturation hereinafter except for the evolving law of soil fabric the evolving trend that α m decreases and α m increases upon hydration is concluded by della vecchia et al 2015 through the calibration procedure which is helpful for determining the values of model parameters simulating the sfcc in the second scenario the physical and swelling properties of bentonite silty clay mixtures are shown in table 1 using eq 8 we calculate the final values of e m e for the mixtures along saturation at the constant volume condition the degree of saturation s r equals to 1 and the void ratio e equals to the initial value the calculated values are also listed in table 1 compared with the initial values originated by the initial pore size distributions the final values of e m e after saturation increase due to the expansion of the aggregates note that for samples b70 and b100 the calculated values of e m e reach near and exceed 1 which means there only exist one dominant pore size in these two samples after saturation romero et al 2011 analyzed the sensitivity of the aggregates of boom clay to hydraulic and mechanical paths they found that a clear bimodal distribution with dominant pore modes at around 13 μ m and 60 nm for macro and micropores respectively evolves into only a single peak at around 1 2 μ m after saturation herein we use the mathematical computation of e m e more than or equal to 1 to represent the experimental observation therefore for samples b70 and b100 eq 6 2 for a single porosity soil can be used to model the sfcc for samples b30 and b50 eqs 3 and 7 are combined to simulate the observed unimodal sfccs where the weighing factor is calculated by eq 8 accounting for the evolved pore size distribution after saturation the predicted curves of four samples are depicted in fig 6 it can be seen that the method not only generates the unimodal sfccs as observed in four samples but also predicts the supercooling stage very well which covers the deficiency of the model proposed by kong et al 2022 4 theoretical sfccs along hydration at constant volume condition as pointed out in the previous section sfccs depicted in fig 6 are determined by soil fabric at finally saturated state no relevant sfccs at different levels of saturation are provided in general in the process of soil freezing water will flow into the soil pores resulting in water redistribution in the soil this change of water content affects the swelling of an expansive soil in the first scenario where low permeability soils undergo freezing without access to a free water source the swelling potential of the expansive soils during freezing can be assumed to be negligible because the hydration process accompanied by the freezing process is not obvious for an unsaturated soil undergoing freezing in an open hydraulic system where the soil is accessible to the free water the water can migrate into the soil and solidify into ice due to the cryogenic suction in this freezing process the air in the soil would be discharged and the degree of saturation s r increases sheshukov and nieber 2011 yin et al 2018 the hydraulic condition from unsaturated to saturated state affects the pore structure in the expansive soil due to the swelling potential of the aggregates thus the permeability of the soil and the amount of unfrozen water content knowing the unfrozen water content at different levels of saturation along hydration plays an important role in modelling the water heat transfer in the freezing process and contributes to quantifying the frost heave in an unsaturated expansive soil however most sfccs neglect the hydraulic effects and experiments measuring the sfcc are all conducted in a closed system the evolution of the sfcc along hydration should be given at least in the scope of the theoretical framework in this section we provide the theoretical sfccs at different levels of saturation for an expansive soil at the constant volume condition the original soil fabric is extracted from the sample b30 four degrees of saturation s r are given for modelling to reduce the number of parameters affecting the evolution of the sfcc as much as possible n m m m n m and m m in eq 7 are assumed to be constant along hydration at any level of saturation a microstructural pore structure can be specifically determined followed by the specific values of α m α m and e m e the values of e m e can be calculated by eq 8 the evolving trend of α m and α m that is an increase of α m and a decrease of α m followed by the expansion of the micropores and reduction of macropores along saturation from as compacted to s r 1 is captured in fig 7 to give the theoretical values of α m and α m at any other levels of saturation exponential expressions of α m and α m with e m and e m e respectively are used herein referred to della vecchia et al 2015 although the validity of these expressions for the sample b30 needs to be claimed in future work the values of model parameter under four degrees of saturation are listed in table 2 the theoretical sfccs of an expansive soil along hydration are shown in fig 8 along hydration the vertical position of the inflection point elevates with e m e increasing gradually and an initially bimodal sfcc evolves into a finally unimodal shape which tends to a longer supercooling stage and a gentler slope in the fast freezing stage 5 conclusions a physically based equation predicting the sfcc is based on the similarity between the drying wetting process and freezing thawing process in this study the approach formulating the sfcc of the expansive soil is presented accounting for the pore size distribution and its evolution along the hydraulic path followed by model validation and detailed analysis the main conclusions are as follows 1 in general parameter α dominants the supercooling stage n controls the slope of the rapid freezing stage and m influences the stable frozen stage a shorter supercooling stage a steeper rapid freezing stage and a lower water content in the stable frozen stage can be observed with an increase in α n and m respectively 2 by introducing the weighing factors in two scales of pore sizes the equation for single porosity soil is extended for double porosity soil with the ability in well characterizing the bimodality of the sfcc the resultant sfcc shows the similar behavior to the one of macrostructure in the small range of temperature deviating from 0 c and reaches the curve corresponding to the one of microstructure in the stable frozen stage the vertical position of the inflection point in the resultant sfcc is determined by the microstructural weighing factor e m e and the range of bimodality is affected by the microstructural value α m 3 two scenarios of the hydraulic conditions should be distinguished in formulating the sfcc for an expansive soil for the first scenario where the soil exhibits low permeability and has no access to the free water the evolution of soil fabric can be neglected for the second scenario where the soil has access to the free water the important role of aggregate swelling and the accompanying evolution of the pore structure should be taken into consideration in the model 4 theoretical sfccs along hydration are given at four levels of saturation with the degree of saturation s r increasing an increase of α m and a decrease of α m is expected due to the expansion of the micropores and reduction of macropores the vertical position of the inflection point elevates with an increase in e m e and an initially bimodal sfcc evolves into a finally unimodal shape which exhibits a longer supercooling stage and a gentler slope in the fast cooling stage credit authorship contribution statement xiao yin conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis

3001,the adverse effects of sea level rise on coastal wetlands have been extensively reported whereas the positive effects on wetland composition have tended to receive less attention using a coupled hydro vegetation model we modeled the spatial and temporal distribution of native and exotic mangroves for 120 years in a mangrove forest in southern china in scenarios with and without sea level rise after approximately 50 years the self reinforcing feedback between mangroves and subsurface salinity is expected to create a stable ecosystem without sea level rise salt sensitive exotic species will inhibit the growth of native mangroves potentially leading to a more fragile ecosystem native mangroves are predicted to grow best under moderate sea level rise 0 5 m if sea level rises by 1 m exotic mangrove populations in southern china are predicted to drastically decline competition between salt tolerant and salt intolerant plants is common in coastal wetlands and the modeling method presented in this study may be globally applicable keywords climate change sea level rise mangrove exotic species groundwater numerical modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the context of future climate change coastal areas are expected to experience more dynamic external environmental changes such as sea level rise by the end of the 21st century 95 of the global ocean area is expected to experience a continuous rise in sea level ipcc 2014 these climatic and hydrological changes may shift mangrove species composition in coastal areas gabler et al 2017 sarker 2017 the resulting instability of mangrove ecosystems is likely to contribute to considerable greenhouse gas emissions as mangroves are among the most carbon rich forests sequestering more than four times the organic carbon content per unit area of other terrestrial forests donato et al 2011 hamilton friess 2018 therefore the invasion risks of exotic mangroves in response to climate change deserve more in depth investigation however few studies have predicted and visualized the distribution of native and exotic mangroves under future climate change scenarios moreover sea level rise the most discussed coastal impact of climate change along the coasts is generally considered a threat to coastal wetlands because inundation and salinity regime shifts can erode and degrade seaward wetlands especially when landward migration corridors are restricted by natural or artificial barriers enwright et al 2016 kirwan et al 2016 lovelock et al 2015 luo et al 2018 vulnerabilities to sea level rise may appear so severe that other aspects of sea level rise critical for wetland composition may be overlooked in this case advancing our knowledge of coastal exotic species invasion and predicting their distributions under future sea level rise scenarios will facilitate coastal wetland management and greenhouse gas emission mitigation mangroves live in harsh and specific coastal environments and are thus generally considered resistant to invasion lugo 1999 however in the past 20 years an increasing number of studies have investigated mangrove related invasion fig 1 a spartina alterniflora is the most frequently studied exotic plant followed by sonneratia spp and rhizophora mangle these plants have characteristics suitable for coastal conditions namely salt tolerance anaerobic condition tolerance and rapid reproduction and growth biswas et al 2018 r mangle invasion has been reported in hawaii usa and s alterniflora and sonneratia spp invasion are mainly observed in southern china in addition to the common characteristics of invasive species sonneratia spp are taller than native mangroves in southern china increasing their ability to invade coastal wetlands li et al 2016 liu et al 2014 ren et al 2009 xin et al 2013 due to its superiority in fertilizing soil and stabilizing coastlines sonneratia was first introduced to hainan province in 1985 for mangrove reforestation and restoration and has since spread along the coastlines of guangxi guangdong and fujian provinces fig 1b ren et al 2009 despite concerns that the adaptivity of sonneratia could be enhanced reducing biodiversity and destabilizing the local mangrove community fourqurean et al 2010 some researchers argue that sonneratia is not invasive because its growth is restricted by the local environment particularly salinity and it does not prevent native species from establishing or spreading liu et al 2014 xin et al 2013 although many attempts have been made to identify the characteristics that make exotic species prone to invasion predicting whether exotic species will become invaders especially in future changing environments remains challenging li et al 2016 thus models that incorporate the characteristics of plant growth and the living environment are needed groundwater properties as essential and influential abiotic factors for mangrove growth are often incorporated into models however these models generally assume constant abiotic conditions e g constant salinity and nutrient availability or unlimited water availability the complex feedback mechanisms between groundwater dynamics and vegetation dynamics have not been sufficiently studied peters et al 2020 detailed descriptions of coupled hydro vegetation models are provided in the supplementary material introduction section in this regard the mantra model is a pioneer in describing the interactions between mangrove and complex groundwater hydrology under the combined actions of tides precipitation and upstream groundwater inflow mantra was developed by teh et al 2013 based on a spatially explicit plant competition model the mangrove hardwood hammock model manham and a groundwater model the saturated unsaturated transport model sutra sutra which was first released by the united states geological survey usgs voss 1984 simulates saturated and unsaturated variable density groundwater flow with solute or energy transport using the finite element method mantra was successfully applied in everglades national park usa to simultaneously simulate the spatiotemporal variations of mangrove and hammock competition as well as groundwater dynamics teh et al 2015 the application and further improvement of mantra for simulating mangrove competition and interactions with groundwater in other regions are worth exploring considering the potential changes in future climate and hydrology we used numerical modeling to examine whether sea level rise will enhance exotic mangrove invasion placing additional stress on the native mangrove ecosystem we integrated extensive field data and remote sensing data collected in a mangrove forest in southern china to build a 3d coupled hydro vegetation model based on mantra the model resolves water and mass balance at daily timescales accounting for spatially and temporally varying groundwater dynamics and vegetation competition based on previous studies and ecological descriptions in the literature we hypothesize that salinity is the main driver affecting exotic mangrove distribution in southern china further based on the current salinity conditions and sea level rise projections in southern china we hypothesize that sea level rise will mitigate the encroachment of exotic mangroves because of the groundwater salinity increase in future sea level rise scenarios salt sensitive exotic mangroves are not expected to replace the native species in southern china 2 methods 2 1 model development as mentioned earlier mantra was developed from manham and sutra teh et al 2013 eq 1 shows the exact form of fluid mass balance implemented in sutra the first two terms on the left represent the total change in fluid mass with time kg m 3s 1 in terms of pressure p and concentration or temperature u the term involving represents the net fluid outflow in terms of darcy s law darcy 1856 kg m 3s 1 qp denotes the external additions of fluid mass including pure water mass plus solute mass dissolved in source water kg m 3s 1 the original fluid mass balance equation does not include the last term qpla which denotes the actual total fluid mass sink due to water uptake by plants kg s 1 manham and sutra are coupled through the water uptake of plants thus qpla is added on the right of the fluid mass balance equation as shown in eq 1 1 s w ρ s op ε ρ s w p p t ε s w ρ u u t k k r ρ μ p ρ g q p q pla where sw denotes water saturation ρ denotes fluid density kg m 3 sop denotes the specific pressure storativity m s2 kg 1 ε denotes porosity p denotes fluid pressure kg m 1s 2 and u denotes fluid concentration kg kg 1 or temperature c in this study fluid concentration is applied k denotes the solid matrix permeability m2 kr denotes the relative permeability to fluid flow assumed to be independent of direction μ denotes the fluid viscosity kg m 1s 1 and g denotes the gravitational acceleration m s 2 the fluid mass required by plants in a certain cell in mantra is affected by local groundwater salinity and is estimated as 2 q pl r 1 s v r 2 s v a s ρ where qpl denotes the estimated fluid mass per unit time required by plants kg s 1 ri sv denotes the water uptake rate of each plant mm day 1 reflecting the plant growth status see below and as denotes the cell surface area m2 figure s3 in manham ri sv is a function of groundwater salinity sv given by empirical equations 3 r 1 s v r m a x 1 1 s v s a t k 1 s v 4 r 2 s v r m a x 2 100 s v s a t k 2 100 s v where eq 3 is for hammock and eq 4 is for mangrove rmaxi denotes the maximum water uptake rate of each plant mm day 1 satk1 denotes the salinity when the water uptake rate of hammock declines to half of the maximum psu and 100 satk2 denotes the salinity when the water uptake rate of mangrove declines to half of the maximum psu the actual fluid mass for plant transpiration is determined by porosity and water saturation 5 q pla q pl ε s w the coupling was achieved by embedding manham into sutra as multiple subroutines each performing a different function reading manham input files calculating biomass changes and generating precipitation and tide boundary conditions etc we developed a 3d coupled hydro vegetation model based on mantra to simultaneously simulate mangrove competition and groundwater dynamics under different climatic and hydrological scenarios major modifications to the original mantra model include 2d to 3d conversion fishnet to irregular mesh conversion and a boundary condition reading method upgrade the modifications were mainly the manham modules embedded in sutra after modification the source codes were compiled using microsoft visual studio 2019 and the resulting executable file was run using modelmuse a graphical user interface for sutra winston 2019 more details of the governing equations coupling and modifications can be found in the model documentation provided as supplementary material 2 2 study site selection analyzing the literature on exotic mangroves in southern china sonneratia was reported in at least 26 mangrove stands across four coastal provinces see fig 1 caption for the literature search method more than half of the mangrove stands with sonneratia are in guangdong province and pearl river estuary is a hotspot for exotic mangrove presence fig 1b unlike other mangrove species that are highly salt tolerant sonneratia spp prefer less saline environments rahman et al 2020 fig 1b shows the average summer surface seawater salinity distribution in the south china sea from 2005 to 2012 pearl river estuary has a lower salinity than the rest of southern china s coastline because pearl river the third longest and second largest river in china discharges large amounts of freshwater into the estuary although exotic mangroves may have been planted in pearl river estuary the low salinity in this area could explain why sonneratia is mainly distributed in pearl river outlets our study site mai po located in a semi enclosed bay inner deep bay in the northwest of the hong kong special administrative region sar has the lowest salinity in southern china and is hypothesized to be the most likely invaded by sonneratia fig 2 considering that sonneratia prefers to live in low salinity conditions areas with higher salinity should be impervious to invasion if areas with low salinity can resist invasion mai po is the largest mangrove forest in pearl river estuary with more than 300 ha of mangrove plants mai po is among the few mangrove swamps that have not had sonneratia planted for reforestation nor been invaded by s alterniflora which reduces external interferences for the purpose of our study moreover in the context of global climate change pearl river estuary is projected to experience continuous sea level rise yang chui 2017 therefore establishing the relationship between the living environment and native exotic mangrove competition and predicting the potential invasion risks of exotic mangroves are particularly important in this region of southern china the dominant species of natural mangroves kandelia obovata accounts for 62 of the total area of mai po jia et al 2014 exotic mangroves are mainly found at the river outlets or inland pockets where salinity is low and light is strong tang 2009 in other words exotic and native mangrove distributions may differ with salinity and light the tides around mai po are mixed semi diurnal and the mean tidal range is 1 4 m the annual average rainfall is approximately 1400 mm and the precipitation is mainly concentrated from april to september the seawater salinity is nearly fresh 3 psu in the wet season from late spring to summer and relatively saline 23 psu in winter early spring during the dry season the groundwater is less saline in the vicinity of four major drainage channels and rivers and tidal creeks in the mangrove swamp 2 3 datasets to calibrate and validate the groundwater part of the model groundwater piezometric head and salinity were recorded at 0 2 m below the ground surface at five locations gw1 5 in the mangrove forest from january 3 to december 31 2018 fig 2 the data were aggregated to daily averages and divided into two parts jan jun and jul dec for model calibration and validation respectively when a day had missing values or abnormal data the day was eliminated from comparison the groundwater data collection details can be found in luo et al 2020 native mangrove biomass was estimated by allometric equations using tree heights and diameters at breast heights measured in situ at the locations shown in fig 2 the total biomass in a sampling plot divided by the plot area is regarded as the above ground biomass g m 2 for the plot central point above ground biomass in terms of carbon g c m 2 is derived following the assumption that the mangrove tree with an average 35 of organic carbon lee 1990 the unit mass of organic carbon per unit area is a typical expression for biomass of forest also called biomass density exotic mangrove biomass was also estimated by allometric equations using data from multiple sources more details such as the allometric equations are provided in supplementary material text s2 and table s1 the natural topography of mai po was derived from a contour map chan 2009 using the kriging tool in arcgis 10 2 fig 3 a the elevations are generally flat with a decreasing trend from land to sea the surface seawater salinity distribution of the south china sea in fig 1b was generated using the kriging tool in arcgis 10 2 based on the average summer surface salinity data from 2005 to 2012 of the world ocean atlas 1 4 grid provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration boyer et al 2018 zweng et al 2019 to adapt the changing mangrove area different mangrove domains were used for the simulation every year the mangrove extent used for the vegetation domain was derived from landsat tm etm images using the supervised maximum likelihood method the mangrove extent from 2000 to 2011 was provided by luo and chui 2020 and the extent from 2012 to 2018 was derived in this study fig 2 shows the mangrove domains of 2000 and 2018 compared to the domain in 2000 the domain in 2018 has extended in the seaward direction and the mangroves at the outlet of shan pui river were pruned the mangrove areas in other years are shown in figure s4 supplementary material the daily evaporation and precipitation from 1980 to 2018 and the hourly tidal elevation were provided by the hong kong observatory hko 2020 the maximum tidal elevation was set as the daily tidal range tidal elevation and precipitation data were recorded at tsim bei tsui fig 2 the tidal datum was then transformed from chart datum to hong kong mean sea level evaporation data were recorded at king s park meteorological station in kowloon hong kong the monthly seawater salinity from 1986 to 2018 recorded at dm1 shown in fig 2 was provided by the environmental protection department of the hong kong sar hkepd 2020 and averaged over the years hourly seawater conductivity and temperature were recorded at the gw5 surface in 2018 and converted to salinity according to the method of rice et al 2012 linear interpolation was performed for the missing salinity values at low tides and the daily mean of all salinity data was calculated the river stage per minute from 2005 to 2018 was provided by the drainage service department of the hong kong sar hkdsd 2020 and aggregated into daily maximum values because the time ranges of the river data were not consistent with that of our study multiyear averages were used the average daily stage of shan pui river and kam tin river from 2008 to 2018 was 0 9 m msl and that of shenzhen river from 2005 to 2018 was 1 2 m msl the average daily stage of the drainage channel was assumed to be 0 m msl as it is predominantly tidally dominated 2 4 model configuration the simulation build up was mainly completed in modelmuse the timestep is 1 day and the entire simulation period is 39 years 1980 2018 first a mature native mangrove forest and natural groundwater condition were established by simulating the years 1980 to 1999 then simulations were performed for the years 2000 to 2018 to validate the model s performance in simulating the groundwater dynamics and vegetation distribution as shown in fig 2 the groundwater simulation domain consists of the entire mangrove forest and the outside mudflat which is used to mitigate the boundary effect from the mangrove forest margin there are 46 057 irregularly meshed elements to balance the simulation accuracy and efficiency finer mesh spacing is used along the mangrove forest margin and four major rivers and coarser mesh spacing is used for the outside mudflat fig 3b the domain is 3d and the natural topography is imposed on the simulation domain two distinct units are used in the vertical direction the finer discretized silt and clay unit for the surface layer to 1 2 m below the surface layer and the coarser discretized silty sand and gravel unit for the left 10 m cedd 2017 frost 1992 langford et al 1989 the permeability of the active root zone top 20 cm is set to three orders of magnitude higher than the underlying silt and clay zone because animal burrows and humus largely increase the permeability of upper mangrove soils mazda ikeda 2006 the hydrostatic pressure distribution in the domain on the first day of 1980 was used as the initial condition the time from 1980 to 2017 served as a warm up period to ensure that a dynamic quasi steady condition was attained tides are applied daily over the land surface that is low enough to be affected the boundary conditions for salinity concentrations are set as multidecadal monthly averages where tides exist and as 0 kg of salt per kg of water otherwise rainfall infiltration is applied daily over the land surface with an infiltration rate of 30 due to 70 runoff loss twilley chen 1998 evaporation is only applied on the mudflat because the mangrove forest was assumed to have a dense canopy which inhibits evaporation teh et al 2015 transpiration is characterized by the water uptake of plants and is affected by groundwater salinity the river boundaries correspond to the tidal boundary unless the tidal height cannot be higher than the river bottom at that time the river boundaries are set as a multidecadal average stage with a salinity of 0 kg of salt per kg of water following the usual method xia li 2012 the seaward vertical boundary located at the middle line of a river is assumed to be a no flow boundary due to symmetry fig 2 and fig 3a and the boundary on the bottom of the domain is also assumed to be no flow hydrostatic pressure is applied on the inland vertical boundary as a groundwater specified pressure beginning in 2018 seawater salinity observations were used to replace the previous multidecadal monthly averages as the boundary conditions for salinity concentration groundwater observations in 2018 were used to validate the model s performance in simulating the groundwater hydrodynamics in mai po vegetation simulation and validation were also performed as the higher exotic mangrove dominates the canopy over the lower native mangrove the former is given an advantage in light use to outcompete the latter in lower salinity the mangrove biomass simulation is divided into two periods in the first period from 1980 to 1999 exotic mangroves were not included because sonneratia spp were first documented in mai po in 2000 afcd 2011 in the whole vegetation domain the biomass of native mangroves was set as 1 g c m 2 this period was used to establish a mature native mangrove forest exotic mangroves 1 g c m 2 were introduced into the vegetation domain at the beginning of 2000 the second period ended in 2018 when the model s performance in simulating the biomass of native and exotic mangroves had been validated the above mentioned boundary conditions precipitation tides rivers and evaporation correspond to the term qp in the fluid mass balance equation eq 1 which represents the external additions extractions of fluid mass transpiration corresponds to the term qpla changes in these terms drive the changes in pressure and concentration with time on the left of the equation details of the mantra parameter settings such as those required by the equations in section 2 1 are provided as supplementary material table s2 and table s3 2 5 scenario design after the simulation of 2018 scenario experiments were performed to investigate the potential impacts of sea level rise because the vertical accretion of mangrove soil is expected to keep pace with sea level rise kirwan megonigal 2013 lovelock et al 2015 and there is no clear pattern linking mangrove type to the soil accretion rate mcivor et al 2013 it was assumed that the mangrove soils surrounding the two species are capable of keeping pace with future sea level rise thus the vegetation domain would remain the same as that of 2018 six simulation scenarios were developed to investigate the possible long term impacts of climate change induced sea level rise on the distribution of exotic mangroves table 1 two sea level rise scenarios with a sea level rise of 0 5 m and 1 m respectively were developed based on the 2018 conditions as well as a base case with model settings identical to the former two scenarios but without sea level rise for comparison the distribution when new mangroves are allowed to grow in the pruned region at shan pui river was also simulated the surface water dynamics i e tidal elevation and seawater salinity under future sea level rise were derived from the results of a surface water model the environmental fluid dynamic code yang chui 2017 2021 based on the projections reported in huang et al 2004 and nicholls and cazenave 2010 pearl river estuary faces a sea level rise rate of approximately 1 cm per year while the global average rate is about 0 5 cm per year ipcc 2001 yang chui 2017 therefore in this study sea level rise rates of 0 5 and 1 cm per year were adopted corresponding respectively to 0 5 m and 1 m sea level rises in the next 100 years sea level rises of 0 5 m and 1 m were set at the sea s open boundary south china sea and the average changes in tidal elevation and seawater salinity near mai po were used for scenario experiments the tidal elevation seawater salinity in mai po are expected to rise by 0 29 m 3 psu and 0 83 m 7 psu for sea level rise scenarios of 0 5 m and 1 m respectively together with sea level rise scenarios a base case without sea level rise was also performed for comparison the simulation was extended another 20 years to determine whether the exotic biomass would reach a stable state after 100 years without sea level rise in this study sea level evolution was not taken into account because of uncertainty regarding external seawater salinity changes with sea level rise therefore the sea level rise of 0 5 m and 1 m conditions and other boundary conditions i e precipitation evaporation and river stage were applied repeatedly over 120 years 3 results 3 1 model validation we validated the groundwater simulations using data from 2018 and the vegetation simulations using data from 2005 2010 and 2018 a process of trial and error was used to validate the coupled vegetation and groundwater simulation the simulated and observed results are compared in fig 4 the simulated piezometric head and salinity showed good agreement with the observed data in both dry and wet seasons the mean error root mean square error and correlation coefficient are reported in the table 2 based on comparisons at a daily timescale for a whole year all correlation coefficients for piezometric head were larger than 0 85 with p values less than 0 001 confirming the good performance of the model in simulating groundwater pressure variations in mai po the simulated groundwater salinity distribution is shown in fig 4c as expected the salinity was lower in regions near rivers than in other places seasonal salinity changes were also well captured fig 4d the simulated distributions of exotic and native mangroves used for validation are shown in fig 5 a during the simulation period the simulated exotic mangroves were mainly distributed around river outlets especially next to the largest river shenzhen river until 2010 many vacant spaces without exotic mangroves remained and native mangrove biomass was highest the simulated native mangrove forest exhibited an increasing then decreasing trend from the inland area to the forest fringe the native biomass at the forest fringe was lowest because those mangroves were newly recruited and youngest the simulated exotic mangrove biomass was validated using historical observations in 2005 1 305 mature sonneratia spp individuals were recorded constituting an average biomass of 6 0 g c m 2 tang 2009 in 2010 3 678 mature individuals were recorded with an average biomass of 15 2 g c m 2 wan et al 2020 seedlings and saplings smaller than 1 5 m in height were omitted from the calculation because their biomass is smaller than that of mature mangroves as shown in fig 5b the average simulated biomass of exotic mangroves increased gradually from 2000 plateaued after 2010 and finally decreased in 2015 the decline was due to pruning at the outlet of shan pui river the simulated results agree well with the historical exotic mangrove biomass observations the simulated native mangrove biomass was validated using in situ measurements at three 10 m 10 m plots in 2018 the general trend of the simulations was similar to that of the observations which peaked in the middle of the forest and reached a minimum at the forest fringe fig 5b the comparisons between the model simulations and observations verify the good performance of the model in simulating plant competition 3 2 predicted exotic mangrove distribution the biomass of 2018 was used as the initial biomass for the sea level rise scenario experiments fig 6 in 2018 exotic mangroves were mainly distributed at the river outlets especially the shenzhen river outlet where salinity is relatively low as shown in fig 6 for the base case no sea level rise simulation the biomass density of exotic mangroves will reach nearly 1500 g c m 2 at the river outlets after 120 years other places in the mangrove forest will also see more exotic mangroves in the 0 5 m sea level rise scenario the biomass density of the exotic mangroves will increase around the river outlets however exotic mangroves will not be seen elsewhere in the mangrove forest in the 1 m sea level rise scenario exotic mangroves will not be observed in other parts of the forest and their biomass density at river outlets will be lower than in the 0 5 m scenario the average biomass density across the vegetation domain is shown in fig 7 after 120 years under the same environmental conditions as in 2018 the average biomass density of both native and exotic mangroves will increase but the increase of native mangroves will be much greater the exotic mangrove biomass is expected to represent only 1 of the native mangrove biomass after approximately 50 years from 2018 the native mangrove biomass is expected to gradually decline it is possible that the exotic mangroves will invade the mangrove forest and replace the native mangroves discussed in sec 4 2 however after 50 years in the sea level rise scenarios the average biomass of native mangroves will not decline but will level off the native biomass density under the 0 5 m sea level rise scenario is expected to exceed that under the 1 m sea level rise scenario when sea level rises by 0 5 m the average biomass density of exotic mangroves will first increase and then decrease before increasing again after about 50 years eventually reaching 25 of the predicted biomass in the base case scenario when sea level rises by 1 m the average biomass density of exotic mangroves is expected to continuously decline over 120 years eventually reaching zero for comparison we also simulated the distribution when new mangroves are allowed to grow in the pruned region at shan pui river in the base case the distribution of exotic mangroves is expected to be similar except that exotic mangroves will be more densely distributed in the unpruned areas fig 6 in the 0 5 and 1 m sea level scenarios the distributions are expected to be similar in the pruned and unpruned domains as shown in the right column of fig 7 the average biomass density of exotic mangroves is also expected to be similar in the pruned and unpruned conditions the greatest difference was observed in the 0 5 m sea level rise scenarios where unlike the decreasing then increasing trend in the pruned domain the average biomass density of exotic mangroves in the unpruned domain is expected to continuously increase fig 7f 4 discussion 4 1 possible positive effects of sea level rise on subtropical mangrove ecosystems our findings suggest that sea level rise may benefit native mangrove growth and inhibit exotic mangrove growth in the absence of sea level rise exotic mangroves may continue to grow and expand in the existing mangrove forest disrupting the growth of native mangroves the invasion may occur not only in vulnerable areas i e river outlets but also inside the mangrove forest however as sea level rises exotic mangrove growth is expected to be inhibited by the increased salinity meanwhile different sea level rise scenarios produced different effects on the growth of native mangroves compared with the 0 5 m sea level rise scenario the growth of native mangroves was more adversely affected in the 1 m sea level rise scenario although native mangroves are more salt tolerant than exotic mangroves their growth may still be limited in high salt environments these findings suggest that the most basic nature of mangrove invasion can only be assessed through a combination of coastal environmental change and plant adaptation to the local environment salinity increases induced by moderate sea level rise may not necessarily threaten coastal wetlands such as mangrove forests the salt sensitive nature of exotic mangroves may cause drastic population declines in southern china as sea level rises studies have shown that exotic mangrove sonneratia spp prefer low saline environments rahman et al 2020 tang 2009 consistent with our simulation results in fig 7e and 7f an increase in exotic mangrove biomass was observed mainly during the wet season when salinity was low as our study site is in the region with the lowest salinity in southern china we can reasonably infer that exotic mangroves in southern china may dramatically decline with a 1 m sea level rise if sea level rises by 0 5 m the disappearance of exotic mangroves in non vulnerable areas away from river outlets will facilitate the control of exotic species notably although exotic biomass is small compared to native mangrove biomass the simulation results varied considerably under different sea level rise scenarios confirming the ability of modified mantra to simulate the mangrove interspecies competition especially in the absence of sea level rise we saw a decline in the native biomass after approximately 50 years of simulation this was attributed to the increase in exotic mangroves meanwhile in teh et al 2015 mangroves can even take over the entire habitat that was previously occupied by hammock given suitable conditions e g storm surge here therefore the difference between the magnitudes of native and exotic mangrove biomass is not considered as an exceptional factor affecting modeling results 4 2 self reinforcing feedback between groundwater salinity and mangrove growth the most important mechanism driving the model is the self reinforcing feedback relationship between the mangroves and subsurface salinity at each location these interactions create favorable conditions for the current mangrove type teh et al 2015 for example groundwater salinity increases during the dry season when there is less freshwater input as salinity increases exotic mangroves reduce transpiration thereby reducing water uptake from the subsurface and limiting further salinity increase however even when salinity increases during the dry season native mangroves can maintain normal transpiration as a result the groundwater salinity around native mangroves will continue to increase in this way each mangrove type tends to maintain dominance in its current location through self reinforcing feedback rietkerk et al 2004 sternberg et al 2007 our results show that in the absence of sea level rise the growth rate of exotic mangroves will decrease first and then increase initially the biomass density of both native and exotic mangroves is expected to increase and then stabilize due to self reinforcing feedback fig 7a and 7c however when native mangrove growth reaches a plateau exotic mangroves will undergo a relatively rapid growth increase until reaching a plateau due to self reinforcing feedback the biomass density of native mangroves will decline due to the increase in exotic mangroves it is reasonable to suspect that when the native mangrove population declines to a critical level the biomass of exotic mangroves may increase due to the decreased subsurface salinity thus the presence of a relatively large exotic mangrove population may increase ecosystem instability in the case of moderate sea level rise 0 5 m subsurface salinity will increase due to the simultaneous effects of native mangrove feedback and sea level rise leading to a decline in exotic mangrove growth exotic mangrove growth is expected to increase when native mangrove growth reaches a plateau but in this scenario the population of exotic mangroves would not be sufficient to offset the established positive self reinforcing feedback of native mangroves fig 7a and 7e as a result native mangroves are expected to resist the invasion of exotic mangroves under moderate sea level rise the population of native mangroves will increase due to modest increases in salinity compared with the scenario without sea level rise 4 3 effects of human activities on exotic species invasion in coastal regions whether rising sea levels will help eliminate exotic mangroves in southern china also depends on human intervention this phenomenon was most pronounced in the moderate sea level rise scenario in contrast to the biomass decline in the pruned vegetation domain the results in the unpruned domain showed that exotic mangrove biomass is expected to increase as salinity increases due to the simultaneous effects of native mangrove feedback and sea level rise fig 7d and 7f this predicted change was observed when pruning in a small area at the outlet of the shan pui river was stopped suggesting that there is a need for continuous monitoring and effective management of exotic mangroves however monitoring and management are expected to improve with sea level rise as exotic mangrove growth will be concentrated in low salinity areas fig 6 which will have little impact on native mangrove growth our results indicated that the invasion risk of the exotic mangrove sonneratia in southern china is low under sea level rise scenarios however these results are likely genus specific and may not be true for exotic species in other regions although coastal environments are inhospitable to many species an increasing number of exotic species are appearing on coastlines around the world due to human activity in an age of globalization human mediated mangrove dispersal further facilitates the spread of exotic mangroves and induces interspecies competition between exotic and native mangroves fourqurean et al 2010 as mentioned earlier three main species invade mangrove forests namely s alterniflora sonneratia spp and r mangle which were all introduced by humans for species with invasive potential human intervention measures should be taken to mitigate the loss of biodiversity and valuable coastal wetlands exotic species with low invasion risks can be carefully used for restoration because their traits i e salt tolerance anaerobic condition tolerance high reproduction and rapid growth are suitable for ecological restoration ren et al 2009 such approaches will be particularly useful for restoring the valuable tropical and subtropical regions where coastal wetlands serve as large carbon pools 4 4 limitations and future research despite the progress in understanding interactions between groundwater and mangroves through numerical modeling this study has some shortcomings the performance of the coupled model was validated using observations confirming its ability to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in vegetation composition and groundwater dynamics under varying climate and external hydrology conditions however the model can be further validated and improved by using more extensive and higher quality data in other regions and habitats such as tropical forests our study site is located in a semi enclosed bay so changes in tidal elevation and salinity due to sea level rise are determined by multiple environmental factors including sea level rise precipitation river flow wind and coastline shape the application of this model to open sea coastal wetlands to examine the direct effects of sea level rise especially the impact of different sea level rise rates is worth investigating moreover as a pioneer in examining the feedback between mangrove and groundwater dynamics we focused only on the above ground biomass carbon stocks and ignored those in the subsurface i e below ground biomass and soil which account for a much higher proportion than the above ground carbon stocks alongi 2014 hamilton friess 2018 future studies that incorporate subsurface carbon stocks into the modified mantra model are needed to improve carbon stock estimation at a finer spatiotemporal scale besides we assumed that the soil accretion rates of the two mangrove species will keep pace with the sea level rise rate because no clear pattern has shown that the soil accretion rate is associated with mangrove type kirwan megonigal 2013 lovelock et al 2015 mcivor et al 2013 however future studies incorporating various biotic and abiotic factors may be needed to better understand the interactions between soil accretion mangrove type and sea level rise in addition the representation of vegetation in the modified mantra relies on empirical estimation future efforts to improve the model should focus on the mechanistic explanation of plant behavior in varying external environments for example the model should clearly describe the allocation of water and biomass absorbed from the soil to the different parts of the tree berger et al 2008 peters et al 2020 5 conclusion our study showed that ecohydrological simulations of the spatiotemporal variations in groundwater and vegetation competition are helpful for understanding the potential invasion risks of exotic species and identifying areas vulnerable to invasion we demonstrated that in future sea level rise scenarios the invasion risks of exotic mangroves sonneratia spp in southern china are low we do not discount the negative effects of sea level rise on coastal wetlands but hope to provide a new perspective beyond the negative impacts the competition between halophytic and glycophytic vegetation is typical of many coastal areas around the world therefore we believe that the model presented in this study will have implications for conservation and restoration beyond our area of focus our model after essential calibration and validation can be applied to simulate and predict plant community transformations

3001,the adverse effects of sea level rise on coastal wetlands have been extensively reported whereas the positive effects on wetland composition have tended to receive less attention using a coupled hydro vegetation model we modeled the spatial and temporal distribution of native and exotic mangroves for 120 years in a mangrove forest in southern china in scenarios with and without sea level rise after approximately 50 years the self reinforcing feedback between mangroves and subsurface salinity is expected to create a stable ecosystem without sea level rise salt sensitive exotic species will inhibit the growth of native mangroves potentially leading to a more fragile ecosystem native mangroves are predicted to grow best under moderate sea level rise 0 5 m if sea level rises by 1 m exotic mangrove populations in southern china are predicted to drastically decline competition between salt tolerant and salt intolerant plants is common in coastal wetlands and the modeling method presented in this study may be globally applicable keywords climate change sea level rise mangrove exotic species groundwater numerical modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the context of future climate change coastal areas are expected to experience more dynamic external environmental changes such as sea level rise by the end of the 21st century 95 of the global ocean area is expected to experience a continuous rise in sea level ipcc 2014 these climatic and hydrological changes may shift mangrove species composition in coastal areas gabler et al 2017 sarker 2017 the resulting instability of mangrove ecosystems is likely to contribute to considerable greenhouse gas emissions as mangroves are among the most carbon rich forests sequestering more than four times the organic carbon content per unit area of other terrestrial forests donato et al 2011 hamilton friess 2018 therefore the invasion risks of exotic mangroves in response to climate change deserve more in depth investigation however few studies have predicted and visualized the distribution of native and exotic mangroves under future climate change scenarios moreover sea level rise the most discussed coastal impact of climate change along the coasts is generally considered a threat to coastal wetlands because inundation and salinity regime shifts can erode and degrade seaward wetlands especially when landward migration corridors are restricted by natural or artificial barriers enwright et al 2016 kirwan et al 2016 lovelock et al 2015 luo et al 2018 vulnerabilities to sea level rise may appear so severe that other aspects of sea level rise critical for wetland composition may be overlooked in this case advancing our knowledge of coastal exotic species invasion and predicting their distributions under future sea level rise scenarios will facilitate coastal wetland management and greenhouse gas emission mitigation mangroves live in harsh and specific coastal environments and are thus generally considered resistant to invasion lugo 1999 however in the past 20 years an increasing number of studies have investigated mangrove related invasion fig 1 a spartina alterniflora is the most frequently studied exotic plant followed by sonneratia spp and rhizophora mangle these plants have characteristics suitable for coastal conditions namely salt tolerance anaerobic condition tolerance and rapid reproduction and growth biswas et al 2018 r mangle invasion has been reported in hawaii usa and s alterniflora and sonneratia spp invasion are mainly observed in southern china in addition to the common characteristics of invasive species sonneratia spp are taller than native mangroves in southern china increasing their ability to invade coastal wetlands li et al 2016 liu et al 2014 ren et al 2009 xin et al 2013 due to its superiority in fertilizing soil and stabilizing coastlines sonneratia was first introduced to hainan province in 1985 for mangrove reforestation and restoration and has since spread along the coastlines of guangxi guangdong and fujian provinces fig 1b ren et al 2009 despite concerns that the adaptivity of sonneratia could be enhanced reducing biodiversity and destabilizing the local mangrove community fourqurean et al 2010 some researchers argue that sonneratia is not invasive because its growth is restricted by the local environment particularly salinity and it does not prevent native species from establishing or spreading liu et al 2014 xin et al 2013 although many attempts have been made to identify the characteristics that make exotic species prone to invasion predicting whether exotic species will become invaders especially in future changing environments remains challenging li et al 2016 thus models that incorporate the characteristics of plant growth and the living environment are needed groundwater properties as essential and influential abiotic factors for mangrove growth are often incorporated into models however these models generally assume constant abiotic conditions e g constant salinity and nutrient availability or unlimited water availability the complex feedback mechanisms between groundwater dynamics and vegetation dynamics have not been sufficiently studied peters et al 2020 detailed descriptions of coupled hydro vegetation models are provided in the supplementary material introduction section in this regard the mantra model is a pioneer in describing the interactions between mangrove and complex groundwater hydrology under the combined actions of tides precipitation and upstream groundwater inflow mantra was developed by teh et al 2013 based on a spatially explicit plant competition model the mangrove hardwood hammock model manham and a groundwater model the saturated unsaturated transport model sutra sutra which was first released by the united states geological survey usgs voss 1984 simulates saturated and unsaturated variable density groundwater flow with solute or energy transport using the finite element method mantra was successfully applied in everglades national park usa to simultaneously simulate the spatiotemporal variations of mangrove and hammock competition as well as groundwater dynamics teh et al 2015 the application and further improvement of mantra for simulating mangrove competition and interactions with groundwater in other regions are worth exploring considering the potential changes in future climate and hydrology we used numerical modeling to examine whether sea level rise will enhance exotic mangrove invasion placing additional stress on the native mangrove ecosystem we integrated extensive field data and remote sensing data collected in a mangrove forest in southern china to build a 3d coupled hydro vegetation model based on mantra the model resolves water and mass balance at daily timescales accounting for spatially and temporally varying groundwater dynamics and vegetation competition based on previous studies and ecological descriptions in the literature we hypothesize that salinity is the main driver affecting exotic mangrove distribution in southern china further based on the current salinity conditions and sea level rise projections in southern china we hypothesize that sea level rise will mitigate the encroachment of exotic mangroves because of the groundwater salinity increase in future sea level rise scenarios salt sensitive exotic mangroves are not expected to replace the native species in southern china 2 methods 2 1 model development as mentioned earlier mantra was developed from manham and sutra teh et al 2013 eq 1 shows the exact form of fluid mass balance implemented in sutra the first two terms on the left represent the total change in fluid mass with time kg m 3s 1 in terms of pressure p and concentration or temperature u the term involving represents the net fluid outflow in terms of darcy s law darcy 1856 kg m 3s 1 qp denotes the external additions of fluid mass including pure water mass plus solute mass dissolved in source water kg m 3s 1 the original fluid mass balance equation does not include the last term qpla which denotes the actual total fluid mass sink due to water uptake by plants kg s 1 manham and sutra are coupled through the water uptake of plants thus qpla is added on the right of the fluid mass balance equation as shown in eq 1 1 s w ρ s op ε ρ s w p p t ε s w ρ u u t k k r ρ μ p ρ g q p q pla where sw denotes water saturation ρ denotes fluid density kg m 3 sop denotes the specific pressure storativity m s2 kg 1 ε denotes porosity p denotes fluid pressure kg m 1s 2 and u denotes fluid concentration kg kg 1 or temperature c in this study fluid concentration is applied k denotes the solid matrix permeability m2 kr denotes the relative permeability to fluid flow assumed to be independent of direction μ denotes the fluid viscosity kg m 1s 1 and g denotes the gravitational acceleration m s 2 the fluid mass required by plants in a certain cell in mantra is affected by local groundwater salinity and is estimated as 2 q pl r 1 s v r 2 s v a s ρ where qpl denotes the estimated fluid mass per unit time required by plants kg s 1 ri sv denotes the water uptake rate of each plant mm day 1 reflecting the plant growth status see below and as denotes the cell surface area m2 figure s3 in manham ri sv is a function of groundwater salinity sv given by empirical equations 3 r 1 s v r m a x 1 1 s v s a t k 1 s v 4 r 2 s v r m a x 2 100 s v s a t k 2 100 s v where eq 3 is for hammock and eq 4 is for mangrove rmaxi denotes the maximum water uptake rate of each plant mm day 1 satk1 denotes the salinity when the water uptake rate of hammock declines to half of the maximum psu and 100 satk2 denotes the salinity when the water uptake rate of mangrove declines to half of the maximum psu the actual fluid mass for plant transpiration is determined by porosity and water saturation 5 q pla q pl ε s w the coupling was achieved by embedding manham into sutra as multiple subroutines each performing a different function reading manham input files calculating biomass changes and generating precipitation and tide boundary conditions etc we developed a 3d coupled hydro vegetation model based on mantra to simultaneously simulate mangrove competition and groundwater dynamics under different climatic and hydrological scenarios major modifications to the original mantra model include 2d to 3d conversion fishnet to irregular mesh conversion and a boundary condition reading method upgrade the modifications were mainly the manham modules embedded in sutra after modification the source codes were compiled using microsoft visual studio 2019 and the resulting executable file was run using modelmuse a graphical user interface for sutra winston 2019 more details of the governing equations coupling and modifications can be found in the model documentation provided as supplementary material 2 2 study site selection analyzing the literature on exotic mangroves in southern china sonneratia was reported in at least 26 mangrove stands across four coastal provinces see fig 1 caption for the literature search method more than half of the mangrove stands with sonneratia are in guangdong province and pearl river estuary is a hotspot for exotic mangrove presence fig 1b unlike other mangrove species that are highly salt tolerant sonneratia spp prefer less saline environments rahman et al 2020 fig 1b shows the average summer surface seawater salinity distribution in the south china sea from 2005 to 2012 pearl river estuary has a lower salinity than the rest of southern china s coastline because pearl river the third longest and second largest river in china discharges large amounts of freshwater into the estuary although exotic mangroves may have been planted in pearl river estuary the low salinity in this area could explain why sonneratia is mainly distributed in pearl river outlets our study site mai po located in a semi enclosed bay inner deep bay in the northwest of the hong kong special administrative region sar has the lowest salinity in southern china and is hypothesized to be the most likely invaded by sonneratia fig 2 considering that sonneratia prefers to live in low salinity conditions areas with higher salinity should be impervious to invasion if areas with low salinity can resist invasion mai po is the largest mangrove forest in pearl river estuary with more than 300 ha of mangrove plants mai po is among the few mangrove swamps that have not had sonneratia planted for reforestation nor been invaded by s alterniflora which reduces external interferences for the purpose of our study moreover in the context of global climate change pearl river estuary is projected to experience continuous sea level rise yang chui 2017 therefore establishing the relationship between the living environment and native exotic mangrove competition and predicting the potential invasion risks of exotic mangroves are particularly important in this region of southern china the dominant species of natural mangroves kandelia obovata accounts for 62 of the total area of mai po jia et al 2014 exotic mangroves are mainly found at the river outlets or inland pockets where salinity is low and light is strong tang 2009 in other words exotic and native mangrove distributions may differ with salinity and light the tides around mai po are mixed semi diurnal and the mean tidal range is 1 4 m the annual average rainfall is approximately 1400 mm and the precipitation is mainly concentrated from april to september the seawater salinity is nearly fresh 3 psu in the wet season from late spring to summer and relatively saline 23 psu in winter early spring during the dry season the groundwater is less saline in the vicinity of four major drainage channels and rivers and tidal creeks in the mangrove swamp 2 3 datasets to calibrate and validate the groundwater part of the model groundwater piezometric head and salinity were recorded at 0 2 m below the ground surface at five locations gw1 5 in the mangrove forest from january 3 to december 31 2018 fig 2 the data were aggregated to daily averages and divided into two parts jan jun and jul dec for model calibration and validation respectively when a day had missing values or abnormal data the day was eliminated from comparison the groundwater data collection details can be found in luo et al 2020 native mangrove biomass was estimated by allometric equations using tree heights and diameters at breast heights measured in situ at the locations shown in fig 2 the total biomass in a sampling plot divided by the plot area is regarded as the above ground biomass g m 2 for the plot central point above ground biomass in terms of carbon g c m 2 is derived following the assumption that the mangrove tree with an average 35 of organic carbon lee 1990 the unit mass of organic carbon per unit area is a typical expression for biomass of forest also called biomass density exotic mangrove biomass was also estimated by allometric equations using data from multiple sources more details such as the allometric equations are provided in supplementary material text s2 and table s1 the natural topography of mai po was derived from a contour map chan 2009 using the kriging tool in arcgis 10 2 fig 3 a the elevations are generally flat with a decreasing trend from land to sea the surface seawater salinity distribution of the south china sea in fig 1b was generated using the kriging tool in arcgis 10 2 based on the average summer surface salinity data from 2005 to 2012 of the world ocean atlas 1 4 grid provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration boyer et al 2018 zweng et al 2019 to adapt the changing mangrove area different mangrove domains were used for the simulation every year the mangrove extent used for the vegetation domain was derived from landsat tm etm images using the supervised maximum likelihood method the mangrove extent from 2000 to 2011 was provided by luo and chui 2020 and the extent from 2012 to 2018 was derived in this study fig 2 shows the mangrove domains of 2000 and 2018 compared to the domain in 2000 the domain in 2018 has extended in the seaward direction and the mangroves at the outlet of shan pui river were pruned the mangrove areas in other years are shown in figure s4 supplementary material the daily evaporation and precipitation from 1980 to 2018 and the hourly tidal elevation were provided by the hong kong observatory hko 2020 the maximum tidal elevation was set as the daily tidal range tidal elevation and precipitation data were recorded at tsim bei tsui fig 2 the tidal datum was then transformed from chart datum to hong kong mean sea level evaporation data were recorded at king s park meteorological station in kowloon hong kong the monthly seawater salinity from 1986 to 2018 recorded at dm1 shown in fig 2 was provided by the environmental protection department of the hong kong sar hkepd 2020 and averaged over the years hourly seawater conductivity and temperature were recorded at the gw5 surface in 2018 and converted to salinity according to the method of rice et al 2012 linear interpolation was performed for the missing salinity values at low tides and the daily mean of all salinity data was calculated the river stage per minute from 2005 to 2018 was provided by the drainage service department of the hong kong sar hkdsd 2020 and aggregated into daily maximum values because the time ranges of the river data were not consistent with that of our study multiyear averages were used the average daily stage of shan pui river and kam tin river from 2008 to 2018 was 0 9 m msl and that of shenzhen river from 2005 to 2018 was 1 2 m msl the average daily stage of the drainage channel was assumed to be 0 m msl as it is predominantly tidally dominated 2 4 model configuration the simulation build up was mainly completed in modelmuse the timestep is 1 day and the entire simulation period is 39 years 1980 2018 first a mature native mangrove forest and natural groundwater condition were established by simulating the years 1980 to 1999 then simulations were performed for the years 2000 to 2018 to validate the model s performance in simulating the groundwater dynamics and vegetation distribution as shown in fig 2 the groundwater simulation domain consists of the entire mangrove forest and the outside mudflat which is used to mitigate the boundary effect from the mangrove forest margin there are 46 057 irregularly meshed elements to balance the simulation accuracy and efficiency finer mesh spacing is used along the mangrove forest margin and four major rivers and coarser mesh spacing is used for the outside mudflat fig 3b the domain is 3d and the natural topography is imposed on the simulation domain two distinct units are used in the vertical direction the finer discretized silt and clay unit for the surface layer to 1 2 m below the surface layer and the coarser discretized silty sand and gravel unit for the left 10 m cedd 2017 frost 1992 langford et al 1989 the permeability of the active root zone top 20 cm is set to three orders of magnitude higher than the underlying silt and clay zone because animal burrows and humus largely increase the permeability of upper mangrove soils mazda ikeda 2006 the hydrostatic pressure distribution in the domain on the first day of 1980 was used as the initial condition the time from 1980 to 2017 served as a warm up period to ensure that a dynamic quasi steady condition was attained tides are applied daily over the land surface that is low enough to be affected the boundary conditions for salinity concentrations are set as multidecadal monthly averages where tides exist and as 0 kg of salt per kg of water otherwise rainfall infiltration is applied daily over the land surface with an infiltration rate of 30 due to 70 runoff loss twilley chen 1998 evaporation is only applied on the mudflat because the mangrove forest was assumed to have a dense canopy which inhibits evaporation teh et al 2015 transpiration is characterized by the water uptake of plants and is affected by groundwater salinity the river boundaries correspond to the tidal boundary unless the tidal height cannot be higher than the river bottom at that time the river boundaries are set as a multidecadal average stage with a salinity of 0 kg of salt per kg of water following the usual method xia li 2012 the seaward vertical boundary located at the middle line of a river is assumed to be a no flow boundary due to symmetry fig 2 and fig 3a and the boundary on the bottom of the domain is also assumed to be no flow hydrostatic pressure is applied on the inland vertical boundary as a groundwater specified pressure beginning in 2018 seawater salinity observations were used to replace the previous multidecadal monthly averages as the boundary conditions for salinity concentration groundwater observations in 2018 were used to validate the model s performance in simulating the groundwater hydrodynamics in mai po vegetation simulation and validation were also performed as the higher exotic mangrove dominates the canopy over the lower native mangrove the former is given an advantage in light use to outcompete the latter in lower salinity the mangrove biomass simulation is divided into two periods in the first period from 1980 to 1999 exotic mangroves were not included because sonneratia spp were first documented in mai po in 2000 afcd 2011 in the whole vegetation domain the biomass of native mangroves was set as 1 g c m 2 this period was used to establish a mature native mangrove forest exotic mangroves 1 g c m 2 were introduced into the vegetation domain at the beginning of 2000 the second period ended in 2018 when the model s performance in simulating the biomass of native and exotic mangroves had been validated the above mentioned boundary conditions precipitation tides rivers and evaporation correspond to the term qp in the fluid mass balance equation eq 1 which represents the external additions extractions of fluid mass transpiration corresponds to the term qpla changes in these terms drive the changes in pressure and concentration with time on the left of the equation details of the mantra parameter settings such as those required by the equations in section 2 1 are provided as supplementary material table s2 and table s3 2 5 scenario design after the simulation of 2018 scenario experiments were performed to investigate the potential impacts of sea level rise because the vertical accretion of mangrove soil is expected to keep pace with sea level rise kirwan megonigal 2013 lovelock et al 2015 and there is no clear pattern linking mangrove type to the soil accretion rate mcivor et al 2013 it was assumed that the mangrove soils surrounding the two species are capable of keeping pace with future sea level rise thus the vegetation domain would remain the same as that of 2018 six simulation scenarios were developed to investigate the possible long term impacts of climate change induced sea level rise on the distribution of exotic mangroves table 1 two sea level rise scenarios with a sea level rise of 0 5 m and 1 m respectively were developed based on the 2018 conditions as well as a base case with model settings identical to the former two scenarios but without sea level rise for comparison the distribution when new mangroves are allowed to grow in the pruned region at shan pui river was also simulated the surface water dynamics i e tidal elevation and seawater salinity under future sea level rise were derived from the results of a surface water model the environmental fluid dynamic code yang chui 2017 2021 based on the projections reported in huang et al 2004 and nicholls and cazenave 2010 pearl river estuary faces a sea level rise rate of approximately 1 cm per year while the global average rate is about 0 5 cm per year ipcc 2001 yang chui 2017 therefore in this study sea level rise rates of 0 5 and 1 cm per year were adopted corresponding respectively to 0 5 m and 1 m sea level rises in the next 100 years sea level rises of 0 5 m and 1 m were set at the sea s open boundary south china sea and the average changes in tidal elevation and seawater salinity near mai po were used for scenario experiments the tidal elevation seawater salinity in mai po are expected to rise by 0 29 m 3 psu and 0 83 m 7 psu for sea level rise scenarios of 0 5 m and 1 m respectively together with sea level rise scenarios a base case without sea level rise was also performed for comparison the simulation was extended another 20 years to determine whether the exotic biomass would reach a stable state after 100 years without sea level rise in this study sea level evolution was not taken into account because of uncertainty regarding external seawater salinity changes with sea level rise therefore the sea level rise of 0 5 m and 1 m conditions and other boundary conditions i e precipitation evaporation and river stage were applied repeatedly over 120 years 3 results 3 1 model validation we validated the groundwater simulations using data from 2018 and the vegetation simulations using data from 2005 2010 and 2018 a process of trial and error was used to validate the coupled vegetation and groundwater simulation the simulated and observed results are compared in fig 4 the simulated piezometric head and salinity showed good agreement with the observed data in both dry and wet seasons the mean error root mean square error and correlation coefficient are reported in the table 2 based on comparisons at a daily timescale for a whole year all correlation coefficients for piezometric head were larger than 0 85 with p values less than 0 001 confirming the good performance of the model in simulating groundwater pressure variations in mai po the simulated groundwater salinity distribution is shown in fig 4c as expected the salinity was lower in regions near rivers than in other places seasonal salinity changes were also well captured fig 4d the simulated distributions of exotic and native mangroves used for validation are shown in fig 5 a during the simulation period the simulated exotic mangroves were mainly distributed around river outlets especially next to the largest river shenzhen river until 2010 many vacant spaces without exotic mangroves remained and native mangrove biomass was highest the simulated native mangrove forest exhibited an increasing then decreasing trend from the inland area to the forest fringe the native biomass at the forest fringe was lowest because those mangroves were newly recruited and youngest the simulated exotic mangrove biomass was validated using historical observations in 2005 1 305 mature sonneratia spp individuals were recorded constituting an average biomass of 6 0 g c m 2 tang 2009 in 2010 3 678 mature individuals were recorded with an average biomass of 15 2 g c m 2 wan et al 2020 seedlings and saplings smaller than 1 5 m in height were omitted from the calculation because their biomass is smaller than that of mature mangroves as shown in fig 5b the average simulated biomass of exotic mangroves increased gradually from 2000 plateaued after 2010 and finally decreased in 2015 the decline was due to pruning at the outlet of shan pui river the simulated results agree well with the historical exotic mangrove biomass observations the simulated native mangrove biomass was validated using in situ measurements at three 10 m 10 m plots in 2018 the general trend of the simulations was similar to that of the observations which peaked in the middle of the forest and reached a minimum at the forest fringe fig 5b the comparisons between the model simulations and observations verify the good performance of the model in simulating plant competition 3 2 predicted exotic mangrove distribution the biomass of 2018 was used as the initial biomass for the sea level rise scenario experiments fig 6 in 2018 exotic mangroves were mainly distributed at the river outlets especially the shenzhen river outlet where salinity is relatively low as shown in fig 6 for the base case no sea level rise simulation the biomass density of exotic mangroves will reach nearly 1500 g c m 2 at the river outlets after 120 years other places in the mangrove forest will also see more exotic mangroves in the 0 5 m sea level rise scenario the biomass density of the exotic mangroves will increase around the river outlets however exotic mangroves will not be seen elsewhere in the mangrove forest in the 1 m sea level rise scenario exotic mangroves will not be observed in other parts of the forest and their biomass density at river outlets will be lower than in the 0 5 m scenario the average biomass density across the vegetation domain is shown in fig 7 after 120 years under the same environmental conditions as in 2018 the average biomass density of both native and exotic mangroves will increase but the increase of native mangroves will be much greater the exotic mangrove biomass is expected to represent only 1 of the native mangrove biomass after approximately 50 years from 2018 the native mangrove biomass is expected to gradually decline it is possible that the exotic mangroves will invade the mangrove forest and replace the native mangroves discussed in sec 4 2 however after 50 years in the sea level rise scenarios the average biomass of native mangroves will not decline but will level off the native biomass density under the 0 5 m sea level rise scenario is expected to exceed that under the 1 m sea level rise scenario when sea level rises by 0 5 m the average biomass density of exotic mangroves will first increase and then decrease before increasing again after about 50 years eventually reaching 25 of the predicted biomass in the base case scenario when sea level rises by 1 m the average biomass density of exotic mangroves is expected to continuously decline over 120 years eventually reaching zero for comparison we also simulated the distribution when new mangroves are allowed to grow in the pruned region at shan pui river in the base case the distribution of exotic mangroves is expected to be similar except that exotic mangroves will be more densely distributed in the unpruned areas fig 6 in the 0 5 and 1 m sea level scenarios the distributions are expected to be similar in the pruned and unpruned domains as shown in the right column of fig 7 the average biomass density of exotic mangroves is also expected to be similar in the pruned and unpruned conditions the greatest difference was observed in the 0 5 m sea level rise scenarios where unlike the decreasing then increasing trend in the pruned domain the average biomass density of exotic mangroves in the unpruned domain is expected to continuously increase fig 7f 4 discussion 4 1 possible positive effects of sea level rise on subtropical mangrove ecosystems our findings suggest that sea level rise may benefit native mangrove growth and inhibit exotic mangrove growth in the absence of sea level rise exotic mangroves may continue to grow and expand in the existing mangrove forest disrupting the growth of native mangroves the invasion may occur not only in vulnerable areas i e river outlets but also inside the mangrove forest however as sea level rises exotic mangrove growth is expected to be inhibited by the increased salinity meanwhile different sea level rise scenarios produced different effects on the growth of native mangroves compared with the 0 5 m sea level rise scenario the growth of native mangroves was more adversely affected in the 1 m sea level rise scenario although native mangroves are more salt tolerant than exotic mangroves their growth may still be limited in high salt environments these findings suggest that the most basic nature of mangrove invasion can only be assessed through a combination of coastal environmental change and plant adaptation to the local environment salinity increases induced by moderate sea level rise may not necessarily threaten coastal wetlands such as mangrove forests the salt sensitive nature of exotic mangroves may cause drastic population declines in southern china as sea level rises studies have shown that exotic mangrove sonneratia spp prefer low saline environments rahman et al 2020 tang 2009 consistent with our simulation results in fig 7e and 7f an increase in exotic mangrove biomass was observed mainly during the wet season when salinity was low as our study site is in the region with the lowest salinity in southern china we can reasonably infer that exotic mangroves in southern china may dramatically decline with a 1 m sea level rise if sea level rises by 0 5 m the disappearance of exotic mangroves in non vulnerable areas away from river outlets will facilitate the control of exotic species notably although exotic biomass is small compared to native mangrove biomass the simulation results varied considerably under different sea level rise scenarios confirming the ability of modified mantra to simulate the mangrove interspecies competition especially in the absence of sea level rise we saw a decline in the native biomass after approximately 50 years of simulation this was attributed to the increase in exotic mangroves meanwhile in teh et al 2015 mangroves can even take over the entire habitat that was previously occupied by hammock given suitable conditions e g storm surge here therefore the difference between the magnitudes of native and exotic mangrove biomass is not considered as an exceptional factor affecting modeling results 4 2 self reinforcing feedback between groundwater salinity and mangrove growth the most important mechanism driving the model is the self reinforcing feedback relationship between the mangroves and subsurface salinity at each location these interactions create favorable conditions for the current mangrove type teh et al 2015 for example groundwater salinity increases during the dry season when there is less freshwater input as salinity increases exotic mangroves reduce transpiration thereby reducing water uptake from the subsurface and limiting further salinity increase however even when salinity increases during the dry season native mangroves can maintain normal transpiration as a result the groundwater salinity around native mangroves will continue to increase in this way each mangrove type tends to maintain dominance in its current location through self reinforcing feedback rietkerk et al 2004 sternberg et al 2007 our results show that in the absence of sea level rise the growth rate of exotic mangroves will decrease first and then increase initially the biomass density of both native and exotic mangroves is expected to increase and then stabilize due to self reinforcing feedback fig 7a and 7c however when native mangrove growth reaches a plateau exotic mangroves will undergo a relatively rapid growth increase until reaching a plateau due to self reinforcing feedback the biomass density of native mangroves will decline due to the increase in exotic mangroves it is reasonable to suspect that when the native mangrove population declines to a critical level the biomass of exotic mangroves may increase due to the decreased subsurface salinity thus the presence of a relatively large exotic mangrove population may increase ecosystem instability in the case of moderate sea level rise 0 5 m subsurface salinity will increase due to the simultaneous effects of native mangrove feedback and sea level rise leading to a decline in exotic mangrove growth exotic mangrove growth is expected to increase when native mangrove growth reaches a plateau but in this scenario the population of exotic mangroves would not be sufficient to offset the established positive self reinforcing feedback of native mangroves fig 7a and 7e as a result native mangroves are expected to resist the invasion of exotic mangroves under moderate sea level rise the population of native mangroves will increase due to modest increases in salinity compared with the scenario without sea level rise 4 3 effects of human activities on exotic species invasion in coastal regions whether rising sea levels will help eliminate exotic mangroves in southern china also depends on human intervention this phenomenon was most pronounced in the moderate sea level rise scenario in contrast to the biomass decline in the pruned vegetation domain the results in the unpruned domain showed that exotic mangrove biomass is expected to increase as salinity increases due to the simultaneous effects of native mangrove feedback and sea level rise fig 7d and 7f this predicted change was observed when pruning in a small area at the outlet of the shan pui river was stopped suggesting that there is a need for continuous monitoring and effective management of exotic mangroves however monitoring and management are expected to improve with sea level rise as exotic mangrove growth will be concentrated in low salinity areas fig 6 which will have little impact on native mangrove growth our results indicated that the invasion risk of the exotic mangrove sonneratia in southern china is low under sea level rise scenarios however these results are likely genus specific and may not be true for exotic species in other regions although coastal environments are inhospitable to many species an increasing number of exotic species are appearing on coastlines around the world due to human activity in an age of globalization human mediated mangrove dispersal further facilitates the spread of exotic mangroves and induces interspecies competition between exotic and native mangroves fourqurean et al 2010 as mentioned earlier three main species invade mangrove forests namely s alterniflora sonneratia spp and r mangle which were all introduced by humans for species with invasive potential human intervention measures should be taken to mitigate the loss of biodiversity and valuable coastal wetlands exotic species with low invasion risks can be carefully used for restoration because their traits i e salt tolerance anaerobic condition tolerance high reproduction and rapid growth are suitable for ecological restoration ren et al 2009 such approaches will be particularly useful for restoring the valuable tropical and subtropical regions where coastal wetlands serve as large carbon pools 4 4 limitations and future research despite the progress in understanding interactions between groundwater and mangroves through numerical modeling this study has some shortcomings the performance of the coupled model was validated using observations confirming its ability to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in vegetation composition and groundwater dynamics under varying climate and external hydrology conditions however the model can be further validated and improved by using more extensive and higher quality data in other regions and habitats such as tropical forests our study site is located in a semi enclosed bay so changes in tidal elevation and salinity due to sea level rise are determined by multiple environmental factors including sea level rise precipitation river flow wind and coastline shape the application of this model to open sea coastal wetlands to examine the direct effects of sea level rise especially the impact of different sea level rise rates is worth investigating moreover as a pioneer in examining the feedback between mangrove and groundwater dynamics we focused only on the above ground biomass carbon stocks and ignored those in the subsurface i e below ground biomass and soil which account for a much higher proportion than the above ground carbon stocks alongi 2014 hamilton friess 2018 future studies that incorporate subsurface carbon stocks into the modified mantra model are needed to improve carbon stock estimation at a finer spatiotemporal scale besides we assumed that the soil accretion rates of the two mangrove species will keep pace with the sea level rise rate because no clear pattern has shown that the soil accretion rate is associated with mangrove type kirwan megonigal 2013 lovelock et al 2015 mcivor et al 2013 however future studies incorporating various biotic and abiotic factors may be needed to better understand the interactions between soil accretion mangrove type and sea level rise in addition the representation of vegetation in the modified mantra relies on empirical estimation future efforts to improve the model should focus on the mechanistic explanation of plant behavior in varying external environments for example the model should clearly describe the allocation of water and biomass absorbed from the soil to the different parts of the tree berger et al 2008 peters et al 2020 5 conclusion our study showed that ecohydrological simulations of the spatiotemporal variations in groundwater and vegetation competition are helpful for understanding the potential invasion risks of exotic species and identifying areas vulnerable to invasion we demonstrated that in future sea level rise scenarios the invasion risks of exotic mangroves sonneratia spp in southern china are low we do not discount the negative effects of sea level rise on coastal wetlands but hope to provide a new perspective beyond the negative impacts the competition between halophytic and glycophytic vegetation is typical of many coastal areas around the world therefore we believe that the model presented in this study will have implications for conservation and restoration beyond our area of focus our model after essential calibration and validation can be applied to simulate and predict plant community transformations

3002,the use of environmental flow e flow regimes has been widely implemented to improve fish habitat quality in river restoration efforts however e flow designs focusing only on one key life stage e g spawning without considering potential bottlenecks in other stages e g hatching can result in little to no improvement especially when targeting the restoration of fish with drifting eggs few e flow assessments are available that closely link the spatial temporal dependence of the hydrodynamic effect of drifting eggs on hatching habitats moreover an understanding of how to allocate e flows to achieve the best possible outcomes for biological diversity conservation is still lacking in this study a new framework was developed to assess e flows aiming to satisfy the requirements of multiple fish species with different spawning patterns concerning streamflow requirements during spawning and hatching periods in this framework the final weighted usable area fwua was proposed by linking the spawning demand to the hydrodynamic effect of drifting eggs to assess habitat quality for fish that produce drifting eggs and water temperature was used to guide when and how to shift from fixed to moving protection targets in allocating e flows here we used the xiangjiaba reservoir located in the lower jinsha river as a case study to design e flows for the conservation of multiple fish species with different spawning patterns which was beneficial for increasing the probability of restoration success by testing scenarios with an absence of drifting passage the ecological base flow considering only spawning habitat appears to be lower than that considering both quality of spawning habitat and hatching passage the ecological benefits fwua generated from the ecological base flow identified by traditional models represent only 64 91 of our framework and are thus anticipated to have cascading deviant effects on ecological patterns and processes in riverine ecosystems this underlying difference in fwua generated due to different ecological base flows determined from traditional models and our framework however has been overshadowed in previous research we highlight that the highest fish population density recovery potential will be reached at only certain ratios for both sets of habitat benefits this work provides a tool that can help managers evaluate e flows and

achieved for e flow management with fish as conservation targets an increasingly popular approach is the building block method bbm uktag 2013 which combines the ecological base flow ecohydrological signals and flow event timings as individual blocks to create e flows hough et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b the ecological base flow which is the centerpiece of the bbm zhang et al 2021 determines the ecohydrological signals and flow event timings can be stacked on the correct baseline to avoid cascade deviant effects on ecological patterns in riverine ecosystems quadroni et al 2017 more model applications focusing on e flow design can be found in the literature e g brown and pasternack 2009 chen and olden 2017 kuriqi et al 2019 li et al 2015 tharme 2003 yang et al 2019 in practice however the implementation of e flows still faces the following major challenges 1 the need to improve the capacity to correctly evaluate the ecological base flow to improve the success of river restoration arthington et al 2018 and 2 the lack of a standardized protocol to guide the allocation of e flows for multiple fish species to protect species diversity pander et al 2019 fish species can be roughly divided into those that produce drifting adhesive or demersal eggs according to their spawning properties liu et al 2021 yin 1993 during early life stages spawning activities the number of spawned eggs and hatching survivorship the survival rate of spawned eggs often dictate the strength of subsequent cohorts zhao et al 2018 and these factors are considered to create the strongest bottlenecks in the recruitment of fish populations mills and mann 1985 schiemer et al 2002 thus spawning habitats which possess the environmental requirements needed for fish spawning yin 1993 and hatching habitats which include various substrates that support the hatching needs of adhesive eggs yin 1993 and drift corridors that provide a place for drifting eggs to float in order to hatch lechner et al 2016 together determine the population strength embke et al 2019 warren et al 2015 yang et al 2021 previous e flow research has primarily underscored the high vulnerability of freshwater fish species to changes in the quality of spawning habitat arthington et al 2010 boavida et al 2018 chen et al 2020 li et al 2019 reeder et al 2021 yi et al 2010a yi et al 2010b however the impacts of hatching habitats on freshwater fish recruitment have not yet been comprehensively linked to e flow design especially for broadcast spawners that produce drifting eggs nagel et al 2021 for instance nagel et al 2021 through field monitoring results in the river inn highlighted that spatio temporal information on drift patterns provides essential basis for directing future discharge and river management plans in large alpine rivers however more research on how to link the distribution of drift paths in large rivers with future discharges from hydropower plants in regulated rivers to provide valuable drifting passage is needed yang et al 2019 designed an e flow for fish species that produce drifting eggs but they only focused on spawning requirements and disregarded the ability of the ecological base flow to meet the hatching demand of drifting eggs weng et al 2021 yi et al 2010a zhao et al 2018 and zhang et al 2019a simply used the lower limit of the floating velocity in ecological base flow calculation models to design e flows ignoring the spatial temporal dependence of hydrodynamic effects on drifting eggs this lack of assessment is in sharp contrast with the many studies that have assessed the potential hydropower and climate change impacts on spawning success fish species that produce adhesive eggs usually scatter eggs over a variety of substrates e g gravel bedrock cobble boulder sand pebbles and aquatic weed etc gillespie et al 2020 weng et al 2021 flow dynamics e g flow velocity and water depth and sorting of the stream bed e g interstitial conditions strongly govern the deposition patterns of these eggs and dominate their hatching success by controlling conditions such as oxygen supply and water exchange duerregger et al 2018 nagel et al 2020 pander et al 2015 when considering the hatching habitat requirements the ecological base flows for these fish species can be directly determined by inputting fish substrate type preferences tang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018c into aquatic habitat suitability models hsms that rely on the suitability index si e g water velocity depth and substrate which is one of the most widely used representative methods to assess habitat quality belgiorno et al 2013 bovee 1986 parasiewicz 2001 yi et al 2017 drifting eggs are not affected by the substrate type but they do require the lowest water velocity vl to allow the eggs to remain drifting for a certain period of time to ensure successful incubation and prevent the risk of hypoxia heer et al 2021 lechner et al 2014 yin 1993 thus the flow regime is a more important filter for fish species that produce drifting eggs compared to those that produce adhesive eggs however current hsms have difficulty providing sufficient quantitative information about the drift trajectories and times of floating eggs which are important variables that affect the development of fish populations that produce drifting eggs zeng et al 2019 therefore due to the general dominance of spawning habitats and an insufficient consideration of hatching habitats hsm assessment results are highly questionable for determining ecological base flows in practice to protect fish in early life stages the ecological base flows determined by traditional assessment models contribute to spawning activities but may also act as important mortality agents because low velocity vl zones in rivers create hidden barriers to drifting eggs which results in independent hydrological units from which eggs cannot escape harvey 1987 reichard and jurajda 2004 and the potential underestimation of species losses induced by hydropower operation brown et al 2013 schinegger et al 2016 this phenomenon explains why many recent studies have reported a low density of drifting eggs downstream of spawning grounds despite the implementation of e flows to promote fish spawning chen and li 2015 ren et al 2020b xu et al 2020 fewer studies have attempted to link the responses of drifting eggs to the flow dynamics in ecological base flow calculations and this linkage is urgently needed for the reconstruction of communities of fish that produce drifting eggs an assessment method is needed to enable the ecological base flow to promote fish spawning while improving the survival rates of drifting eggs to help fish survive vulnerable bottlenecks the most common approach in the study of hatching protection is the use of agent based models abms garcia et al 2013 kočovský et al 2021 zhu et al 2018 heer et al 2020 in which drifting eggs are represented as passive particles abms map egg drift trajectories based on the lagrangian method and enable a spatially explicit expression of the hatching states of floating eggs however abms are not often linked to e flows if the status of an invisible barrier in the drifting passage is characterized by a hatching habitat connectivity metric with the help of abms the ecological base flow is determined by identifying the optimum ratio of the quality of the spawning habitat to hatching habitat which seems to resolve the aforementioned bottlenecks however this ratio has not been frequently identified as an important factor in evaluating habitat quality or designing e flow release strategies thus the question remains as to whether the drifting passage should be linked to fish habitat assessments to more accurately determine ecological base flows and design e flows additionally researchers have emphasized that compared to the protection of individual aquatic species multiobjective fish species protection strategies allow ecosystems to have a broader ecological response to the implementation of e flows yang et al 2019 however few approaches are available to guide when and how the shift from fixed to moving ecological targets from fixed fish species conservation targets to variable multiobjective fish species conservation targets should occur and how nonflow environmental factors should be considered to allocate e flows to achieve the best possible outcomes horne et al 2017 king et al 2016 poff 2018 this challenge poses difficulties in setting targets for the protection of ecological base flows and in the timing of stacking blocks mismatches in flow hydrology and water temperature signals can lead to stream restoration failures for example the e flow of kemano reservoir in canada has been released for nearly 30 years although salmon have been protected populations of white sturgeon a native species have been greatly reduced due to mismatched water flow and temperature regimes and this species is now endangered bradford 2022 in addition the conservation of multiple fish species with different spawning patterns including different spawning periods and egg types further exacerbates this challenge traditional assessment frameworks cannot accurately differentiate the ecological water demands of different target fish with different spawning patterns in different periods resulting in a mismatch between supply and demand for instance weng et al 2021 and yang et al 2019 divided multiobjective fish into two separate groups fish that produce adhesive eggs and fish that produce drifting eggs and determined separate ecological base flows for the targets this method ignored the timing of the emergence of different combinations of target fish e g different combinations of fish with different spawning patterns during the same period which led to the release of excessive or inadequate e flows from dams thereby further intensifying the contradiction between the demand for environmental water and economic hydropower interests the lack of a consensus framework for quantifying e flows that accounts for the needs of multiple fish species with different spawning patterns has made conservation of riverine biological diversity difficult which limits how well e flows can be used for various ecological restoration applications to improve the restoration success for multiple fish species with different spawning patterns there is an urgent need to develop a new e flow assessment framework to address the above challenges pander et al 2019 the specific objectives of this paper are 1 to link the spawning needs of fish species and the hydrodynamics of drifting eggs to propose new metrics for ecological base flow calculations to establish a link between habitat connectivity and e flow assessments 2 to demonstrate the reliance of current e flow practices on habitat connectivity by combining a two dimensional ecological hierarchy model and correlation analysis to answer the question of whether drifting passage needs to be linked to fish habitat assessment and 3 to describe two hydropower plans in the lower jinsha river china to provide guidance on when and how to shift from fixed to moving ecological targets by incorporating water temperatures and highlight exemplary scenarios of e flow management with better reliability when considering multiple fish species with different spawning patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 e flow evaluation framework considering multiple fish species the framework presented in this paper is built upon existing knowledge concerning e flow management the spatial temporal dependence of the hydrodynamic effects of drifting eggs and the ecohydrology literature the mechanistic framework can be conceptualized as the integration of a river hydrodynamic model a reservoir water temperature model a habitat model for fish with adhesive eggs a habitat model for fish with drifting eggs an ecological base flow calculation and an ecohydrological characteristic assessment method the integrated framework is illustrated in fig 1 the modelling process of the assessment framework can be summarized as follows 1 a depth averaged 2d hydrodynamic model is established to predict the flow field based on external forcing obtained according to release discharge schemes in river management 2 a reservoir water temperature model is developed to obtain water temperature regimes under different scenarios to set conservation targets for ecological base flows 3 habitat model based on habitat suitability index hsi is established for fish with adhesive eggs and habitat model based on abm and hsi is developed for fish with drifting eggs 4 the habitat model for fish with adhesive eggs is embedded into the depth averaged 2d hydrodynamic model to predict the habitat quality required by fish that produce adhesive eggs 5 the habitat model for fish with drifting eggs is coupled with 2d hydrodynamics model to assess the habitat quality required by fish that produce drifting eggs 6 the habitat quality of fish with adhesive eggs and fish that produce drifting eggs is linked to the ecological base flow calculation methods to determine the ecological base flow in different spawning periods and or incubation periods 7 ecohydrological characteristics are obtained by an ecohydrological characteristic assessment method 8 an e flow is shaped by stacking ecohydrological characteristics and water temperature regimes with ecological base flows 2 1 1 river hydrodynamic model hydraulic information is typically predicted by numerical modeling to capture the natural variability of fish habitats reeder et al 2021 in comparison to one dimensional 1d modeling due to its limited ability to provide detailed flow and topographic information and 3d modeling due to its poor calculation efficiency high resolution 2d vertically averaged hydraulic modeling has become increasingly favored for the evaluation of fish habitat as it offers a pragmatic compromise between computational efficiency and good spatial representation fabris et al 2017 jowett and duncan 2012 the mike 21 numerical model which divides each river segment into smaller computationally flexible cells in the horizontal plane including the hydrodynamics ecological laboratory eco lab and abm has been extensively applied for rivers worldwide belgiorno et al 2013 islam et al 2018 xin et al 2020 zeng et al 2019 here a depth averaged 2d numerical model of the study reach was developed using unstructured triangular computational grids to calculate the flow velocity and water depth downstream of the xjb dam providing key habitat factor information for the assessment of spawning habitats for fish species with disparate spawning habits the hydrodynamic component of mike 21 is based on the two dimensional incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations of mass and momentum conservation formulated in a horizontal cartesian coordinate system detailed information on the mike 21 modeling system can be seen in zhang et al 2021 2 1 2 reservoir water temperature model determination of the timing and quantity of water requirements can be river specific and species dependent millidine et al 2012 a time delay in the eigenvalues of downstream rivers influenced by reservoirs often affects the recognition of water temperature signals by fish zhang et al 2018a which plays a decisive role in the release timing of e flow this is particularly true when considering multiple fish species as different species are adapted to different temperature ranges providing key node signals that is various time points corresponding to the time varying e flow curves that indicate when the ecological base flows and matching ecohydrological features required by different target fishes are provided for e flow composition for these reasons we need to determine when a reservoir is suitable for spawning according to the temperature requirements of the target fish species it is worth noting that water temperature regimes downstream of dams are dramatically affected by reservoir operations he et al 2017 li et al 2021 especially in large reservoirs with strong regulation capacity to simulate thermal stratification and the daily released water temperature we built a laterally averaged two dimensional water temperature model using rectangular computational grids for the xiangjiaba xjb reservoir based on the well accepted ce qual w2 platform the ce qual w2 model ignores temperature characteristics in the lateral direction which is particularly suitable for large reservoirs in mountainous rivers whose shape is narrow long and deep in width length and depth respectively all of these characteristics apply to the xjb reservoir detailed information on the ce qual w2 modeling system is described in appendix a 2 1 3 abm for drifting egg floating simulation the movement of agents in the abm resulting from the sum of several independent movement vectors consisting of the motion direction and speed can be passive or active zeng et al 2019 the motion processes of drifting eggs in this study were represented by agent eggs passive lagrange particles to accurately calculate the position x y z of an individual egg at any time the states of drifting eggs were predicted with a lagrangian particle movement model driven by a hydrodynamic model quan et al 2021 the lagrangian particle movement model solves the langevin equation illustrated as eq 1 which considers a dispersive component resulting from random processes including molecular and turbulence diffusion in water with a random walk numerical algorithm naves et al 2019 the drifting egg floating simulation model is defined by the superposition of two groups of motion vectors in the model where the horizontal movement direction and speed of the eggs are defined as the horizontal flow direction and speed respectively and the vertical movement is determined by the minimum flow velocity required to keep the drifting eggs floating below which the vertical settling speed of the eggs is defined as 0 0075 m s murphy and jackson 2013 wan et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 1 d x t a t x t d t b t x t ζ t d t where d x t is the vector difference between the position xt yt zt of the particle at time t and the position xt 1 yt 1 zt 1 at time t 1 in which xi yi zi is the lagrangian vector coordinate of the particle at time i dt is the time step a t x t is the drift term representing the combined effects of current and wind drag which cause particle advection ζ t is a random number that obeys the standard normal distribution and b t x t is the diffusion term representing both molecular and turbulent dispersion which is described as 2 b t x t 2 d t d l where d l is the dispersion coefficient 2 1 4 habitat suitability index at present hsms that combine hydraulic variables with the si to predict how fish habitats will respond to changes in stream flow are a particularly useful technique that have gained popularity in various habitat assessment studies yi et al 2017 in this study the suitability curve method yi and zhang 2019 was used to relate hydraulic variables with si the suitability curve is a continuous and univariate curve the si values of the target species vary between 0 unsuitable and 1 optimal and the intermediate values represent a suitable value based on a specified hydraulic variable booker and acreman 2007 aquatic organisms do not select the velocity water depth or substrate independently but depend on suitable combinations of these variables wen et al 2021 yi et al 2017 si values can be combined using the geometric mean method to define the habitat suitability index hsi the hsi approaches zero if any of the si values incorporated in the geometric mean are zero thereby providing a more conservative estimate of habitat suitability the hsi is expressed as 3 hsi s i v s i d s i s 3 where s i v s i d and s i s are the suitability values of the water velocity depth and substrate respectively 2 1 5 habitat model for fish spawning with adhesive eggs based on hsi in the assessment of habitat quality habitat availability the concept of the weighted usable area wua m2 bovee 1982 is used as a metric to characterize habitat quality for spawning fish with adhesive eggs this metric is assumed to have a proportional relationship with the number of species yi et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a the wua is calculated by multiplying the hsi value of each computational cell by the relevant cell area and aggregating all values for the entire study area bovee 1982 in the same river reach the wua value corresponding to a definite discharge q is certain the wua can be computed for a specific discharge q scenario based on the following equation 4 wua i 1 n h s i i a i where hs i i is the hsi of the ith cell n is the total number of cells within the wetted area of the stream and a i is the area of the ith cell 2 1 6 habitat model for fish that produce drifting eggs based on abm and hsi the habitat quality for fish that produce drifting eggs in each spawning season is given by the combined effect of the spawning process i e how many eggs are laid during spawning and the drifting egg hatching process i e how many eggs are able to float for a sufficient amount of time to hatch successfully or escape from the control reach from spawning to hatching the spawning process is defined as the recruitment of eggs from adult individuals which can also be assessed by the habitat model described in section 2 1 4 drifting passage represents the link between the spawning of eggs and egg survival the connectivity of which can be assessed on the basis of the survival of spawned eggs spawned egg survival can be described with the index r h which represents the survival rate of drifting eggs supported by the abm simulation results in the following form 5 r h n h n t 100 where n h is the total number of eggs that hatch successfully remain in suspension during flow george et al 2015 or successfully escape from the control reach under specific flow conditions and n t is the total number of particles released in the spawning habitats compared with research conducted by zeng et al 2019 in which only 100 eggs were released in a large reservoir a total of 1000 eggs were released to more accurately grasp the trajectories of fish eggs in this study moreover the egg release locations were in the farthest upstream spawning grounds with large hsi values in this paper the index final wua fwua which is defined by eq 6 as the geometric multiplication of individual processes to compute the combined effect of the two processes by multiplying wua for spawning by the r h value during hatching at a specific discharge was applied to estimate the final habitat conditions for fish that produce drifting eggs allowing interspecies comparisons of habitat quality during the spawning seasons this value provides a more comprehensive estimate of habitat quality than other methods by assuming that good habitat conditions can compensate for unfavorable habitat conditions due to the interaction between two processes allowing the fwua index to approach zero if any of the values in the key processes incorporated into the equation are zero 6 fwua w u a r h remarkably the wua is not the actual living area of the target species spawned eggs but is only an indicator yi et al 2017 assumed to be proportional to the number of species or spawned eggs zhang et al 2019a therefore the fwua is not the actual living area but is only an indicator for evaluating habitat quality for fish that produce drifting eggs during both spawning and hatching periods it is assumed that a proportional relationship between the fwua and the number of eggs surviving incubation from spawning to hatching exists 2 1 7 ecological base flow calculation the instream flow incremental methodology ifim based on hsms has been applied most frequently to determine the ecological base flow for fish spawning worldwide stalnaker et al 1995 yi et al 2017 different water temperatures will trigger different kinds of fish spawning behaviors and spawning activities may occur in one or more target fish species during the same spawning period thus the ecological base flow should be determined in different periods divided in accordance with the critical temperature requirements of the target species a general schematic diagram of the ecological base flow calculation based time interval is provided in fig 2 for each individual fish species spawning the current velocity and water depth of each computational cell computed from the river hydrodynamic model can change resulting in a change in the wua for different discharge q m3 s scenarios therefore providing rating curves of the wua for target spawning fish species then the flow value corresponding to the inflection point of the wua q curve is regarded as the ecological base flow for each fish species spawning with adhesive eggs for each individual fish species producing drifting eggs the rating curve for the fwua q can also be obtained from different q scenarios with abm results the ecological base flow for each specific fish species was ultimately derived from the discharge corresponding to the peak fwua value for multiple fish species in the same spawning season the period during which fish species 2 and fish species 3 spawned simultaneously is shown in fig 2 to account for variation in the wetted area with q and to prevent the absolute dominance of a single fish species e g the habitat quality of different species may vary by different orders of magnitude at the same time the normalized area na defined as ranging between 0 and 1 is derived as follows 7 n a s q i 1 n l 1 n wua q i l wua m a x l 8 n a d q i 1 m k 1 m fwua q i k fwua m a x k 9 n a sd q i 1 n m l 1 n wua q i l wua m a x l k 1 m fwua q i k fwua m a x k where n a s q i n a d q i and n a sd q i are the normalized area in the ith q scenario for multiple fish species spawning with adhesive eggs multiple fish species producing drifting eggs and both types of species during the same spawning period respectively n and m are the total number of fish species spawning with adhesive eggs and producing drifting eggs respectively wua q i l and fwua q i k are the habitat quality of the lth species for fish spawning with adhesive eggs and of the kth species for fish producing drifting eggs in the ith q scenario respectively and wua m a x l and fwua m a x k are the maximum habitat quality for the lth and kth fish species in the river for fish spawning with adhesive eggs and fish producing drifting eggs respectively as such by matching specific q scenarios to n a s q i n a d q i and n a sd q i estimates we obtained specific na q curves for the multiple fish species that spawn adhesive eggs only drifting eggs only and both types during the same spawning period finally the flow corresponding to na peaks was utilized as the ecological base flow for multiple fish species during a specific spawning period except in the case of n a s q i in which the inflection point of the n a s q i curve was regarded as the ecological base flow 2 1 8 determination of e flows considering multiple target fish species studies have shown that seasonal flow processes with specific ecohydrological signals play an important role in ecological functions poff et al 2010 poff and zimmerman 2010 especially for fish for which spawning requires stimulation from the rise and fall of the water liu et al 2011 yi et al 2010a in this study we quantitatively identified ecohydrological indicators including the rise rate fall rate rise duration fall duration and cycle of water fluctuations which were used together to describe the rise and fall processes of e flow during the fish spawning period in accordance with our previous study zhang et al 2018a 2 2 case study the framework was applied to the jinsha river the jinsha river is the headwater of the yangtze river wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b which has a total length of 3 464 km according to the characteristics of channel topography e g elevation differences hydrological and hydrodynamic characteristics e g flow and velocity and the amount of suspended sediments transported dong and wang 2015 the jinsha river can be divided into three segments using the three reach segmentation method dong and wang 2015 the upper reach from yushu to shigu middle reach from shigu to panzhihua and lower reach from panzhihua to yibin li et al 2018 covering a watershed area of approximately 473 200 km2 wang et al 2015 the upper reach has a plateau climate while a subtropical climate is dominant in the middle and lower reaches zhang et al 2019a the elevation difference of the jinsha river is 5 142 m its high and concentrated flow makes the jinsha river the largest hydropower production region in china li et al 2018 the development of a total of 25 hydropower stations along the mainstream of jinsha river from upstream to downstream is planned known as 25 levels of cascade hydropower stations in particular four mega reservoirs wudongde wdd baihetan bht xiluodu xld and xiangjiaba xjb lying on the lower reach of the jinsha river with a total installed capacity of 44 800 mw twice the capacity of the three gorges reservoir have attracted widespread attention owing to their high ability to regulate stream flows and positive effect in terms of promoting rapid socioeconomic development in western china the lower jinsha river has a rich variety of freshwater fishes serves as a critical habitat for rare freshwater fishes and is an important supplemental channel of fish recruitment for the yangtze river the xjb reservoir is the last cascade in the lower reaches of the jinsha river however the mode of power generation operation in the xjb reservoir will modify the hydrodynamic conditions necessary for the reproduction of many native fish downstream of the reservoir which could lead to habitat loss for native fish thus limiting the replenishment of fish resources in the jinsha river to the yangtze river to a certain extent in response to such challenges numerous efforts have been implemented by the central people s government of the people s republic of china and the ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china to develop conservation policies and management strategies to promote fish population recovery such as establishing the national nature reserve of rare and endemic fish and fish breeding and release stations nevertheless knowing how to support biological diversity and protect suitable habitats for multiple fish species in the reserve especially disparate spawning habits to fundamentally cope with hydropower development is of great concern to regulation agencies as a key principle for maintaining river biodiversity and ecosystem health sustaining adequate e flows can potentially restore fish habitats zhao et al 2017 in this paper the reach extending from the xjb dam site to the outlet of the jinsha river with a length of 32 km was chosen as a case study fig 3 this reach encompasses a nearly 30 km core area of the reserve and hosts typical endangered fish with different spawning habits such as acipenser dabryanus a dabryanus myxocyprinus asiaticus m asiaticus coreius guichenoti c guichenoti and hypophthalmichthys molitrix h molitrix whose populations have declined dramatically in recent years and whose endangerment levels are determined by the national forestry and grassland administration and ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china the hengjiang river is an important tributary of the right bank occurring approximately 3 5 km downstream of the dam the average annual flow aaf of the mainstream is 4570 m3 s whereas that of the hengjiang river is 294 m3 s 2 3 target fish species selection according to fish field investigations 2006 2018 conducted by the china three gorges corporation ctgc 2019 a total of 136 species of fish were identified in the study river reach including 4 nationally key protected species 13 provincially key protected and endangered species and 49 endemic species the fish can be divided into two main groups according to their spawning habits fish spawning with adhesive eggs and fish producing drifting eggs they exhibit different habitat preferences that differ greatly with their different spawning types indicating that the selection of target species should include all spawning types among them a dabryanus and m asiaticus which spawn adhesive eggs are both listed on the international union for conservation of nature s iucn red list of threatened species and are legally protected in china they belong to the national top level and second level protection classes of protected animals respectively guo et al 2021a zhou et al 2020 in addition c guichenoti and h molitrix which both spawn drifting eggs belong to the national second level protection class and near endangered class of species listed on the iucn red list of threatened species emerging data from many years of field sampling showed that the resources for these fish species have greatly declined in the study river due to their endangered status and different oviposition habits we thus selected these four fish species as suitable candidates to assess the e flow required for the national natural reserve controlled by the xjb reservoir which has crucial spawning grounds the spawning seasons of a dabryanus and m asiaticus usually span from march to the end of april in the study river reach while the spawning seasons of h molitrix and c guichenoti are from may to june and from april and june respectively spawning in all these fish species requires a critical temperature and suitable physical habitat additionally spawning in c guichenoti and h molitrix needs to be accompanied by suitable rising or falling of water flows information regarding the requirements for spawning in the target fish species is provided in table 1 2 4 scenario design to assess the impacts of cascade reservoirs in the lower jinsha river on the water temperature regime two hypothetical scenarios were developed in the present study according to the hydropower development plan of the jinsha river table 2 2 5 model setup and data collection two categories of general data terrain and hydrological data are required for modeling hydrodynamics in rivers while both inflow and outflow data together with meteorological data such as cloud cover wind velocity wind direction air temperature and dew point temperature data are required for the reservoir water temperature model in this study detailed bathymetry data including those from the xld reservoir the xjb reservoir and the river downstream of the xjb reservoir were obtained using a real time kinematic rtk gps consisting of the mobile mapper 10 gis gps receiver and the spectra precision sp60 gnss receiver trimble inc usa in 2018 according to the national standard of the people s republic of china ch t 2009 2010 by assuming a reference station at a known point and transmitting radio signals a roving station that receives radio signals and combines them with gps signals was used to obtain the x y z coordinates the daily discharge data for the hengjiang hydrometric station 2011 2020 and the water level data for the yibin hydrometric station 2011 2020 obtained from the three gorges corporation were used as the tributary input and mainstream output boundaries of the 2d river hydrodynamic model respectively the daily meteorological data obtained from the yongshan meteorological station and suijiang meteorological station provided by the china meteorological data service center were used daily time series data for the inflow rate of the xld reservoir and xjb reservoir for 2014 were collected from the three gorges corporation the study river reach was discretized into 49 564 computational flexible elements in the horizontal plane in the 2d river hydrodynamic model thermal stratification is common in deep reservoirs thus we stratified the xjb and xld reservoir models into 72 and 134 vertical computational layers respectively with a thickness of 2 m based on previous experience of modeling thermal stratification in deep water bodies he et al 2017 nonslip wall conditions were applied to wall surfaces in all models moreover for the scenario assessment the natural water temperature baseline without any reservoir construction at the xjb dam site was determined with reference to the method by zhao 2021 the detailed calculation method is described in appendix a the baseline of the xjb dam site was finally calculated according to the annual average daily water temperature at pingshan hydrometric station located 11 0 km upstream of the xjb dam site 2004 2011 following the daily temperature increase rate km along the river between the huatan hydrometric station located 350 5 km upstream of xjb dam site 2004 2011 and pingshan hydrometric station the boundaries of the reservoir temperature model for inflow discharge inflow water temperature and operating water level of all the scenarios were obtained from the environmental impact assessment report of the xjb hydropower station on the lower jinsha river which was reviewed by the ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china in addition the si curves of water depth and velocity for a dabryanus and m asiaticus during the spawning season were derived using the frequency analysis method fam proposed by liu et al 2018 while the si curves for c guichenoti and h molitrix were obtained from the latest works of zhang et al 2018a and dai et al 2021 respectively the si curves for the spawning habitats of all target fish species are shown in fig a1 furthermore the daily discharge of the pingshan hydrometric station from 1968 to 1987 with little human impact according to the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china was used to extract ecohydrological characteristics for c guichenoti and h molitrix during the spawning period in the lower jinsha river the 2d hydrodynamic model was calibrated using velocity and water level measurements the flow velocity data were obtained directly from field monitoring by means of a propeller current meter ls25 3a measurement range 0 04 10 0 m s accuracy 0 01 m s at the xjb hydrometric station section measurements were taken at 0 6 of the depth to obtain a depth averaged reading hough et al 2019 according to the national standard of the people s republic of china gb 50179 2015 water level data were collected using an rtk gps unit with an accuracy of 0 02 m at xjb hydrometric station section we used field monitoring data on water velocities in 2017 and water levels in 2016 at the xjb hydrological station downstream of the dam to validate the model parameters for the parameters that were difficult to measure directly some were set to the empirical values used in the literature wan et al 2020 and key parameters were initially set within a suitable range and later the values were adjusted for local areas to obtain a good match between the modeled and measured results we initially set manning s coefficient values with a homogeneous roughness across the entire reach to a typical value of 0 03 in addition the model time step was specified as a constant 60 s to ensure a stable and quick run time two practical model evaluation statistics including the root mean square error rmse and relative rmse rrmse were adopted in this study michael baker inc 2013 we used vertical temperature distributions and water level data in the xld reservoir and xjb reservoir to calibrate the reservoir water temperature model parameters the measured temperatures along the vertical direction in the xld reservoir 1 0 km before the dam and xjb reservoir 1 0 km section 1 and 32 0 km section 2 before the dam in 2014 were obtained from the most recent studies conducted by xie et al 2016 and long et al 2018 respectively and the measured water levels of xld reservoir and xjb reservoir in 2014 were obtained from the three gorges corporation to verify the reservoir water temperature model hydrological inflow temperature huatan hydrometric station and meteorological data obtained from january 1 2014 to december 31 2014 were used to drive the numerical model the values of calibrated parameters were initially specified from default values including the solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer longitudinal eddy diffusivity longitudinal eddy viscosity wind sheltering coefficient extinction for pure water and manning s roughness coefficient and they were further adjusted to achieve close agreement between the simulated and measured water temperature profiles and reservoir water levels the mean absolute error mae and rmse were used to quantify bias and goodness of fit ma et al 2015 the performance of the aquatic habitat model was tested by comparing habitat quality patch predictions with surveyed spawning locations mapped in the natural reserve along our study reach in addition fish eggs were transported to the downstream reach of the study area as c guichenoti and h molitrix produce drifting eggs therefore the performance of the habitat model for fish that produce drifting eggs was tested by comparing the fwua index with data on the daily number of drifting eggs in the yibin sampling section which is located in the outflow section using pearson correlation analysis mekonnen et al 2021 collection of the drifting eggs of h molitrix was conducted during the spawning season in the yibin sampling section in 2018 two groups and the jiangjin sampling section in 2008 and 2014 2017 five groups which occur downstream of the study area the numbers of eggs in the yibin section in 2008 and 2014 2017 were estimated based on the proportion of eggs in the study area in comparison to those in the jiangjin section wei 2012 the daily number of eggs of h molitrix was estimated using the method described by xu et al 2015 3 results 3 1 hydroenvironmental model validation 3 1 1 validation of the river hydrodynamic model the comparison of predicted water levels and velocities with measured data is plotted in fig 4 overall the predictions agree reasonably well with the observed results the minimum and maximum velocities of the measured results were 1 06 m s and 4 21 m s respectively and the average velocity among all measured points was 2 73 m s the flow velocity from the simulation results varied from 0 99 m s to 4 22 m s and the average velocity was 2 74 m s the low and high velocities were all well reproduced the rmse and rrmse of velocity between the simulated and monitored values were 0 08 m s and 2 55 respectively which meets the requirements of accurate operation of the model and has high reliability liao et al 2022 tang et al 2018 in addition the rmse and rrmse of the water level were 0 25 m and 2 62 respectively the overall trend of the simulated water level was basically the same as that of the measured water level and the variation in water level was accurately reproduced therefore the established hydrodynamic model had a good calculation accuracy and could be used for subsequent research tan et al 2021 xu et al 2017 the final calibration showed that the majority of the river had a manning s coefficient value of 0 03 while patches of the riverbed had roughnesses ranging from 0 023 to 0 045 3 1 2 validation of the reservoir water temperature model fig a2 compares the calculated and field monitored reservoir water levels at the xld and xjb reservoirs in 2014 the rmse and rrmse between the simulated and monitored values were 0 23 m and 0 40 for xld and 0 11 m and 1 23 for xjb respectively implying a good fit of the calculated water levels the comparisons of the observed and modeled temperature distributions are shown in fig 5 in which the mae and rmse values in the 9 validation scenarios are all smaller than 1 0 this indicates that the model simulated vertical temperature distributions were in good accordance with the observed data he et al 2017 he et al 2019 wang et al 2020 and that the model can accurately simulate the reservoir water temperatures associated with cascade hydropower the final calibrated parameters for the reservoir water temperature model are listed in table a1 3 1 3 validation of the habitat assessment models a comparison of the model simulated spawning habitat patches and spawning locations of all the target fish species showed that all were located within the model predicted high quality patches where the hsi was larger than 0 8 as shown in fig 6 the model results exhibited in fig 7 show that the fwua values were in good accordance with the daily numbers of drifting eggs with a pearson correlation value of 0 9669 p 0 05 suggesting that the assessment model could accurately indicate the habitat quality for fish with drifting eggs because biomass data for c guichenoti are lacking the habitat model for c guichenoti could not be verified however the buoyancy velocity and vertical settling velocity required for c guichenoti eggs were consistent with those for h molitrix zeng et al 2019 these are the only two key parameters used to determine the incubation state in our habitat model therefore the validated model can be applied to assess the two target fish species 3 2 water temperature changes caused by cascade reservoirs the predicted released water temperature changes after cascade reservoir construction under different joint operation scenarios are exhibited in fig 8 the plots for scenarios 1 and 2 in comparison to the baseline suggest that the water temperature in the two typical scenarios is altered dramatically after the reservoirs are put into operation significantly presenting a hysteresis effect delay of the time node satisfying the characteristic temperature and flattening effects the difference between the highest and lowest temperature in a year with greater values indicating a greater effect where the degree of temperature changes significantly depends on the scale of cascade reservoir development specifically the temperatures of released water were significantly lower than the water temperatures at baseline from the latter part of february to august and from march to early september in scenarios 1 and 2 lasting 184 and 170 days respectively showing that the delays in the target spawning times of these fishes will be further exacerbated with the scale of cascade hydropower development the temperature difference of maximum and minimum discharged water during the year with values of 9 2 and 6 8 respectively were lower than the baseline with a value of 10 9 indicating that a larger scale of cascade hydropower was associated with a stronger flattening effect it can be seen in fig 8a that the maximum temperature drops were 3 9 and 4 6 occurring in april and that the maximum temperature increases occurred in january with values of 3 5 and 5 4 under scenarios 1 and 2 respectively compared to the water temperatures at baseline indicating that the effects of warm and cold water increase with the scale of cascade dam development the release of water from the xjb dam under the two typical scenarios was expected to negatively affect downstream fish habitats due to its lower water temperature during the beginning of the spawning season spawning in m asiaticus a dabryanus c guichenoti and h molitrix occurs when the water temperature ranges from 14 to 22 16 to 19 17 to 26 4 and 18 to 27 during the spawning season respectively the results from habitat modeling showed that the discharge temperature did not rise to 14 until march 25 in scenario 1 which was delayed by approximately 30 days compared to the baseline in contrast the minimum temperature of the released water throughout the entire year in scenario 2 with a value of 15 3 was higher than the temperature required for m asiaticus due to the cumulative effect of high temperature water in cascade hydropower development which supported m asiaticus spawning as long as it was associated with appropriate flow conditions the water temperatures in scenario 1 which reached 16 17 and 18 were postponed for 33 32 and 33 days compared to the baseline for a dabryanus c guichenoti and h molitrix respectively whereas the corresponding discharged water temperature delay times were 42 48 and 52 days under scenario 2 in addition there were no noticeable changes in the number of days to attain the suitable spawning water temperature ranges for all the target fish species in the two scenarios although the number of days with a suitable temperature for c guichenoti spawning increased by 1 and 13 days in scenarios 1 and 2 respectively compared to the baseline these analyses suggest that the reservoirs in the lower jinsha river greatly imposed significant impacts on the water temperature regime during the target fish spawning time except in the case of m asiaticus spawning under scenario 2 according to the duration of suitable spawning water temperatures in the modeling results and considering the original water temperature rhythm in the baseline the key time nodes for the ecological base flow calculation were identified and are listed in table 3 3 3 habitat modeling results 3 3 1 habitat assessment results for fish with different spawning patterns fig 9 displays the relationships between wua and q for target fish species that spawn adhesive eggs and between fwua and q for fish that produce drifting eggs the trend of habitat quality versus discharge for fish that spawn adhesive eggs shows a predictable pattern that can be well described by a left skewed modal relationship whereby there is an increase in wua with discharge until it reaches a maximum after which it starts to decrease and eventually stabilizes at a level that varies with the target fish species at relatively high q values while the values for fwua increased with flow rapidly in the lower flow ranges this trend diminished until it reached a relatively high value from which point an increase in discharge resulted in habitat quality increasing up to a maximum value after which habitat quality decreased with an increase in q the rapid increase in habitat quality with q in the low discharge range became even more significant for h molitrix fig 9 shows lower habitat availabilities associated with low discharges for all target fish species with different spawning patterns when considering the ratio between the habitat quality occurring under low flow conditions 10 aaf and the maximum habitat quality provided by the river however the fwua values were 11 24 and 21 71 for h molitrix and c guichenoti respectively which were significantly lower than the spawning wua values for m asiaticus and a dabryanus which were 52 49 and 32 02 respectively this result largely indicates that the threat of low flow conditions to suitable habitats for fish that produce drifting eggs was higher than that for fish that spawn adhesive eggs fish species that produce drifting fish eggs are thus more sensitive to flow than fish that spawn adhesive eggs the values of discharge corresponding to the inflection point of the wua q curves were 2285 m3 s and 2513 5 m3 s for m asiaticus and a dabryanus respectively whereas the levels of discharge that maximized the fwua tended to be 2285 m3 s and 2513 5 m3 s for c guichenoti and h molitrix respectively as such discharges of 2285 m3 s 2513 5 m3 s 2285 m3 s and 2513 5 m3 s were defined as the ecological base flows for m asiaticus a dabryanus c guichenoti and h molitrix spawning respectively when considered as a single target 3 3 2 habitat assessment results for multiple fish species considered at once to associate thermal and hydrologic metrics and multiple stream fishes we identified different target fish species corresponding to different spawning periods table 4 under different scenarios based on the classification of the spawning period five independent na q curves for different fish species were derived table 5 we then modeled the process of na changing with q under five target scenarios to estimate the ecological base flow required in each spawning period considering multiple fish species fig 10 presents five na q curves for the spawning periods at the studied site overall the habitat quality for the fish species in the river was low under near dry flow conditions ranging from 0 1 to 0 6 regarding the change trends the nas1 value increased concurrently with the increase in q but this trend became less marked at a higher discharge of 2285 m3 s until it reached 2513 5 m3 s after which a decreasing trend was seen followed by an eventual plateau the change trends of nad1 nasd1 nasd2 and nasd3 were all consistent with that of the fwua with a rapid increase for na values associated with low discharge conditions the q corresponding to the optimal value of the na index in all the na curves was 2513 5 m3 s although the peak value of nasd1 and the inflection point of the nas1 curves were both 2285 m3 s suggesting that the ecological base flow was 2285 m3 s during the spawning period when considering a dabryanus and c guichenoti only and when considering m asiaticus and a dabryanus only while the ecological base flow in the other multitarget scenarios was 2513 5 m3 s 3 4 recommendations for e flow regimes when considering multiple fish species 3 4 1 ecohydrological characteristics of target fish species the ecohydrological characteristics of c guichenoti and h molitrix in the lower jinsha river were obtained using long time series of daily flow data from the pingshan hydrometric station more specifically as illustrated in fig a3 and a4 c guichenoti preferred flow rise rates dimensionless parameter of 0 01 0 10 for which the distribution index was greater than 0 9 in contrast h molitrix favored rise rates in the range of 0 025 0 100 we further found that the ideal flow fall rates dimensionless parameter required by c guichenoti were 0 01 0 03 although h molitrix has no requirements in terms of fall rates of flow during the spawning period the ideal fall rate in the natural rhythm of its life was 0 01 0 04 in addition the longest rise duration for c guichenoti and h molitrix reached 19 days and 17 days respectively whereas the longest fall duration reached 10 days and 12 days respectively both c guichenoti and h molitrix avoided habitats with long flow rise and fall durations and preferred rise durations of 1 2 days and 1 3 days and fall durations of 1 2 days and only 1 day respectively moreover the distribution index of the fluctuation of the water cycle for c guichenoti and h molitrix which was greater than 0 9 was 1 3 days for both species in general the ecohydrological characteristics of c guichenoti in the lower jinsha river agree well with those of individuals of this species inhabiting the yalong river as indicated in a recent study zhang et al 2018a the suitable ranges of ecohydrological characteristics are shown in table 6 3 4 2 recommendations for e flow regimes under different scenarios a time delay of water temperature signals often determines the starting time of the ecological flow regime released by a system providing appropriate flow at biologically more active periods to improve the resilience and resistance of ecosystems the e flow regimes in scenarios 1 and 2 were designed according to the pivotal ecological time nodes for the river system derived in section 3 2 as displayed in fig 11 the start time of ecological flow regime release in scenario 1 and scenario 2 was chosen as march 25 and march 1 respectively when a discharge value of 2285 m3 s was observed this is because of the limited cumulative impact of two stage reservoirs in scenario 1 which resulted in a delay of the date when 14 was reached and the sufficiently strong cumulative impact of cascade reservoirs in scenario 2 which resulted in the high temperature regime always having a temperature higher than 14 in winter considering the changes in the composition of the fish communities over time a flow of 2285 m3 s was maintained until april 28 and april 30 in scenarios 1 and 2 respectively subsequently the ecohydrological information on the ecological base flow was accumulated starting on april 29 in scenario 1 while a flow of 2513 5 m3 s needed to be released from may 1 to may 14 for a dabryanus under scenario 2 then the ecohydrological signals were superimposed onto the ecological base flow for which the suitable values of ecohydrological indices could be selected from table 6 to determine the flow regime consisting of the fluctuation to address the conflict between the e flow regime and the societal need for water resource conservation the rise rate and fall rates were both 0 01 0 03 when only c guichenoti spawning was considered april 29 may 6 in scenario 1 and may 15 may 23 in scenario 2 with a 2 day rise duration and 2 day fall duration forming a complete fluctuation in the water cycle to create slow processes of rising and falling at the beginning of the period when c guichenoti and h molitrix spawned simultaneously may 7 may 28 in scenario 1 and may 26 june 13 in scenario 2 the e flow regime consisted of fluctuations with rise and fall rates both in the range of 0 025 0 03 with a 2 day rise duration and a 1 day fall duration during the peak spawning period may 29 july 3 in scenario 1 and june 14 july 22 in scenario 2 two critical flood pulses in which the rise and fall rates were 0 05 0 10 and 0 005 0 01 with a 2 day rise duration and a 1 day fall duration respectively were constructed to support the occurrence of spawning peaks wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2018a the ecological flow regime in both scenarios ended with c guichenoti spawning alone july 4 july 28 in scenario 1 and july 23 august 13 in scenario 2 and consisted of a 2 day rise duration a 2 day fall duration and a range of 0 01 0 03 for both the rise rate and fall rate 4 discussion 4 1 does drifting passage need to be linked to fish habitat assessments by conducting field investigations in dam regulated rivers scientists have found that flow regimes influence the temporal and spatial availability of suitable habitats and thus often affect fish recruitment nagel et al 2021 pander et al 2021 which generally consists of two phases spawning and hatching pander et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 the combined modeling assessment framework presented in this study can be a powerful tool for evaluating the effects of dams reservoirs on these key habitats spawning and hatching providing a foundation for river managers to develop strategies to maintain or restore them previous studies including those in north america europe and china addressing habitat assessment or ecological flow regime designs have mainly underscored the protection of spawning habitats bergerot and cattanéo 2017 boavida et al 2018 dudley and platania 2007 zeng et al 2019 focusing on spawning demands with less emphasis on hatchery operations this is particularly true for the assessment of habitat for fish that produce drifting eggs as fish spawning coincides with the hatching of drifting eggs yin 1993 traditional assessment models have simply integrated floating velocity restrictions into the hsi model with preference curves and implicitly evaluated habitat quality or identified the ecological flow regime yi et al 2010b zhang et al 2019b yang et al 2019 overlooking the drift trajectory and drift time which are known to create strong bottlenecks for population development inaccurate coupling or insufficient consideration regarding spatial temporal quantitative relations between key factors and fish recruitment may inappropriately characterize a habitat assessment model as successful the model presented here is a multilevel coupling model implemented as an abm it spatially and temporally explicitly considers all ontogenetically relevant spawning and hatching processes using h molitrix as an example of a typical fish species that produces drifting eggs we tested the usability of this model to study the effects of coupling spawning habitat availability and drifting passage connectivity on the potential density of the fish population the model results clearly showed a strong correlation between habitat quality and the average daily numbers of drifting eggs indeed correlation analysis confirmed that the average daily numbers of drifting eggs were more related to fwua r2 0 9669 fig 7 than to the wua index recommended for use by previous studies not considering drifting passage r2 0 7695 fig 12 this difference in correlation was related to whether drifting passage was included in the evaluation which emphasizes the importance of considering drifting passage connectivity for the accurate evaluation of habitat quality in addition a more pronounced nonlinear relation between habitat quality fwua and q was observed due to the significant nonlinearity of the relationship between egg survival and q in contrast to the fwua q curve however the traditional wua q curve fig 13 showed that ecological base flow was optimal at 1142 5 m3 s and 1828 m3 s for c guichenoti and h molitrix respectively which are significantly lower than the values derived from the model presented here of 2285 m3 s and 2513 5 m3 s respectively as there was a strong dependence of population density on the hatching rate during the low flow period zeng et al 2019 liu et al 2021 this result further supports the hypothesis of the importance of drifting passage consideration in habitat assessment from a management and restoration point of view ecological base flow has high sensitivity to habitat assessment model performance yi et al 2014 and the ecological base flow considering only spawning habitat appears to be lower than that considering both spawning habitat quality and hatching passage quality the ecological benefits of the implementation of traditional models represent only 64 91 fwu a 1142 5 fwu a 2285 100 of the model examined herein because of their unique functional roles in the design of e flow regimes which are anticipated to have cascading deviant effects on ecological patterns and processes in riverine ecosystems olden and naiman 2010 such traditional models are often used to inform e flow assessments associated with future climate change and dam development this underlying difference in ecological benefits however has been overshadowed in previous research indicating that habitat assessment based solely upon spawning habitat is not an efficient solution for the ecological improvement of fish that produce drifting eggs despite its popularity as a measurable proxy for habitat quality we showed here that the modeled wua is actually a poor predictor of projected changes in habitat quality for fish that produce drifting eggs although the usual assessment of habitat quality relies on hsms our study further highlights relevant mechanisms wua based assessments overemphasize the role of spawning demands as the primary driver of habitat quality assessments in comparison to fwua based models do not account for the effects of flow dynamics on drifting egg behavior and neglect the role of the drifting time empirical analysis shows that although operating e flow according to an fwua based approach to create environmentally friendly flow regimes may reduce spawning habitat quality the benefits derived from habitat connectivity offset the forgone spawning benefits thereby increasing the total value of river flow for fish that produce drifting eggs thus drifting passage needs to be linked to fish habitat assessments to evaluate habitat quality and dam water release strategies for such fish species 4 2 building habitat protection resilience to hydropower development to date rather few habitat assessment models have used a spatially explicit approach that considers ontogenetically relevant spawning and hatching habitats although several scenario studies have accounted for the impact of hydrodynamic conditions on fish with drifting eggs none of the reviewed methodologies attempted to link the quality of available suitable habitats to the quality of drifting passage e g barros et al 2018 heer et al 2021 liu et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 the lack of such information was a rationale for this study and inspired us to develop an ecological model to fill this gap the framework presented in this paper builds on existing approaches while overcoming some key limitations for which the framework successfully integrates fish spawning demands the operation response of hatcheries and the linkages between the timing of released water and thermal metrics into the e flow assessment making it easy to identify the required ecological base flow in each period for different fish species it also allows us to assess habitat quality for fish with different spawning patterns and in particular identify the timing and magnitude of both peak and low discharges to achieve this possibility as a case study we effectively assessed the habitat quality of different fish species including m asiaticus a dabryanus c guichenoti h molitrix and their combinations and defined e flows in the xjb reservoir in the lower jinsha river using a model based evaluation framework that integrated habitat connectivity by linking egg drifting passage to habitat availability considered water temperature requirements simultaneously and used the na index as a habitat quality metric to facilitate the comparison of different external driving forces and the design of e flow considering different target fish species we included scenarios that divided cascade hydropower development into two scenario 1 and four levels scenario 2 following the latest cascade reservoir planning report both the spawning and hatchery habitats were protected in both scenarios via e flows by ensuring high intensity spawning events for the multiple fish species with impartial protection as well as by ensuring the successful survival of the eggs of fish that produce drifting eggs we believe that the e flows designed according to this framework allow us to better reach predefined restoration and management targets than those obtained via traditional frameworks e g reductions in protection problems associated with unfair strategies based on favoritism parka et al 2020 and high numbers of spawned eggs with a low hatching rate zhang et al 2018a which can be attributed to accurate ecological base flow assessment and effective time division protection for multiple species additionally our analytical framework allows the delineation of mechanisms among climate hydropower habitat fish connections by extensively examining their associations we thus encourage riverine ecologists and water managers to broaden their perspective regarding ecological base flows to include both fish spawning and drifting hatching with respect to rehabilitating the natural rhythm of river flow regimes furthermore the framework presented in this study can also be applied to other freshwater river systems globally to evaluate habitat quality for heavily managed fish species with different spawning patterns and to implement regulations of stream discharge in association with infrastructure with the aim of riverine conservation nevertheless we must be clear that the e flow regime evaluation system is not consistent for different fish species with varied spawning types the preferred habitats of target species can differ across a range of factors including terrain hydrological conditions the lowest critical floating velocity to maintain eggs in suspension egg settlement velocity and drifting time required for the successful incubation of drifting eggs garcia et al 2013 wan et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 the typical target fish along with the associated physical habitat preferences and biohydraulic traits of drifting eggs need to be adjusted and determined after sufficient research in the field and laboratory 4 3 reliability of the framework although e flows are the main restoration technique used to ameliorate the ecological effects of regulation in rivers their effectiveness has yet to be unanimously accepted growns 2016 in the past few decades long term flow experiments in regulated rivers have been conducted by scientists with the results showing that the effectiveness of e flows is not always positive but instead varies according to species and life history rolls 2021 bradford et al 2011 conducted a 13 year experiment in the regulated bridge river british columbia canada and found that the abundance of juvenile chinook salmon declined after an e flow release compared to that during the baseline period it was hypothesized that this decline may have been due to a lack of consideration of the impacts on spawning timing and emergence timing in the design of the e flow water temperatures higher than those during the natural period in water released from the reservoir in autumn accelerated the development of eggs and larvae could have caused earlier emergence and led to mortality due to high flow events elevated predation or insufficient resources olden and naiman 2010 a similar case regarding the mismatch between a species life history and water temperature can also be found in the lost creek dam rogue river u s a angilletta et al 2008 in our framework we linked the water temperature requirements of target fish spawning to e flow design to match the ecological base flow ecohydrological signals and timings required for fish life history with the required water temperature to enhance the success of restoration in addition theodoropoulos et al 2019 found that the biological resources of a regulated river located in western greece ecological base flow of 0 2 m3 s released were suboptimal by sampling this flow was calculated based on the hydrological method and was much lower than the ecological base flow 0 6 2 m3 s obtained by considering biological information theodoropoulos et al 2019 theodoropoulos et al 2020 inaccuracies in ecological base flows lead to deviations in the entire e flow which may affect the entire ecosystem the ecological base flow calculations in our framework fully consider the requirements of fish during critical bottleneck periods spawning and hatching and can capture drift trajectories that cannot be captured by hydrological methods providing a solid foundation for e flow design moreover bradford 2022 reviewed the effects of e flow management on fish habitats and fish populations at kenney dam completed in 1954 located on the nechako river in british columbia canada the results from monitoring studies showed that the e flow established for salmon conservation brought the salmon population to a state deemed acceptable however recruitment for the white sturgeon population acipenser transmontanus that inhabits the watershed failed flows and temperatures that do not match the requirement for white sturgeon in specific life stages have been hypothesized as contributing factors korman and walters 2000 hildebrand et al 2017 which highlights the importance of e flow design with multi target fish our framework can determine when and how to shift from fixed to moving protection targets in allocating e flows to protect multiple fish species the worldwide expansion of hydropower as also evident from our case study makes it necessary to better consider and mitigate its ecological impacts to shift the balance between the red and green aspects of hydropower dams and reservoirs geist 2021 from 2012 to 2018 11 ecological scheduling experiments targeting the natural reproduction of four major chinese carp fmcc species were conducted in the three gorges reservoir tgr xu et al 2020 and the range of the ecological base flow was 6200 14600 m3 s the investigation showed that the daily number of drifting eggs was 7 times higher after the e flow release chen and li 2015 xu et al 2020 used survey data to conclude that ecological base flow can affect the timing of spawning the higher the ecological base flow is the quicker the spawning response is and a smaller ecological base flow may not be sufficient to support the successful floating of eggs based on the early fish resources after the implementation of e flow the chinese sturgeon research institute found that the ecological base flow of the tgr should be set to 10000 m3 s to protect the fmcc xu et al 2020 and this value is larger than the value of 3000 m3 s proposed by yi et al 2010a without considering the drift trajectory of eggs our framework and conclusions support the experimental results of ecological scheduling to a certain extent that is the ecological base flow considering only the spawning habitat appears to be lower than that considering both the quality of the spawning habitat and the hatching passage from 2017 to 2019 four ecological scheduling experiments may 13 17 2017 may 20 25 2017 may 15 18 2018 and may 26 29 2019 targeting the natural reproduction of fmcc were conducted in the xjb reservoir dai et al 2021 the investigation showed that the drifting egg density was 1 3 times that before e flow release ren et al 2020b during the experiments the range of released e flow was 2400 4500 m3 s with an average value of 3221 m3 s dai et al 2021 which was similar to the e flow obtained from our framework e flows ranging from 2513 5 to 4399 7 m3 s with an average value of 3456 6 m3 s this confirms that the e flow designed by our framework is reliable 4 4 habitat restoration in response to climate change in recent decades the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including droughts and heatwaves are undergoing increases worldwide due to global warming berg and mccoll 2021 fischer et al 2021 fooladi et al 2021 smale et al 2019 várbíró et al 2020 xu et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 which has become a serious disaster that can cause irreversible harm to aquatic ecosystems this puts forward higher requirements for the development of reliable hsm research e g the accurate assessment of water demand and identification of the appropriate timing of released water to help establish climate change adaptation policies tsang et al 2021 the use of robust hsms has become a crucial simulation tool to improve the predictive accuracy of recently developed models that simulate the response of habitat quality to climate change morid et al 2020 in our framework hsms that evaluate fish spawning habitats could benefit from additional knowledge of the effects of flow dynamics on drifting egg behavior any observed variability in the fwua reflected the influence of external forced changes on the comprehensive habitat quality for fish that produce drifting eggs involving both spawning and hatching processes rather than spawning variables alone therefore the fwua can be used as a reliable indicator to guide habitat restoration for fish with drifting eggs and help river decision makers dam operators develop strategies with a focus on spawning and hatching habitat improvement to increase ecosystem resilience in the face of a changing climate morales marín et al 2019 allowing riverine systems to better cope with the increasingly encountered stress of drought due to global climate change parka et al 2020 won et al 2020 it can also facilitate the assessment and comparison of river restoration

high habitat quality in the context of a cost effectiveness analysis guo et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 making it easy to reconcile conflicts among stakeholders in addition our integrative model may

thermal regimes e g cooling outflow from reservoirs at appropriate times cheng et al 2022 pander et al 2021 allowing river systems to maintain create suitable habitats to better cope with habitat degradation disappearance due to droughts and heatwaves morid et al 2020 in addition to climate driven changes in hydrological regimes the impacts of climate change on the thermal characteristics in reservoirs add a new challenge to designing e flows since the input of external forcing including large scale climate drivers and hydrological conditions is easy to handle in our submodels such a framework is also applicable to the habitat assessment of global rivers under the impact of climate change such an application has potential for designing effective e flows to mediate the impact of expected temperature increases as has been done for selected streams using field investigated data e g terrain and reservoir operation constraints and assumed future temperature increase scenarios kim and choi 2021 wen et al 2018 indicating that our framework has strong transferability and is readily extensible this kind of long range current and future analysis can help focus efforts in identifying the potential impacts of climate change and could inform active decision making regarding water allocations to increase the chances of achieving sustainable resilient river systems over longer time scales 5 conclusions confronted with the conservation of endangered species diversity several new challenges are emerging in e flow practices globally and expectations of ecologists have been raised for efficient e flow interventions that can increase the probability of river restoration success here we developed an effective framework with the index of fwua to integrate rehabilitation needs in terms of ontogenetically critical spawning habitat availability closely coupled with the spatial temporal dependence of the hydrodynamic effect of drifting eggs using a hydrodynamic temperature abm approach for multiple fish species in river rehabilitation applications of the framework in the xjb reservoir with e flows were derived for the conservation of multiple fish species with different spawning patterns including m asiaticus a dabryanus c guichenoti h molitrix and their combinations in two hydropower plan scenarios and were found to be beneficial for increasing the probability of river restoration success moreover our study showed that the habitat quality of fish that produce drifting eggs strongly depends on drifting passage quality with only certain ratios of both habitat benefits achieving high recovery potential of fish population density with this predictive index the framework is suited to set quantitative benchmarks to assess river restoration success when facing hydropower development and climate change credit authorship contribution statement peng zhang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft qingyuan liu

3002,the use of environmental flow e flow regimes has been widely implemented to improve fish habitat quality in river restoration efforts however e flow designs focusing only on one key life stage e g spawning without considering potential bottlenecks in other stages e g hatching can result in little to no improvement especially when targeting the restoration of fish with drifting eggs few e flow assessments are available that closely link the spatial temporal dependence of the hydrodynamic effect of drifting eggs on hatching habitats moreover an understanding of how to allocate e flows to achieve the best possible outcomes for biological diversity conservation is still lacking in this study a new framework was developed to assess e flows aiming to satisfy the requirements of multiple fish species with different spawning patterns concerning streamflow requirements during spawning and hatching periods in this framework the final weighted usable area fwua was proposed by linking the spawning demand to the hydrodynamic effect of drifting eggs to assess habitat quality for fish that produce drifting eggs and water temperature was used to guide when and how to shift from fixed to moving protection targets in allocating e flows here we used the xiangjiaba reservoir located in the lower jinsha river as a case study to design e flows for the conservation of multiple fish species with different spawning patterns which was beneficial for increasing the probability of restoration success by testing scenarios with an absence of drifting passage the ecological base flow considering only spawning habitat appears to be lower than that considering both quality of spawning habitat and hatching passage the ecological benefits fwua generated from the ecological base flow identified by traditional models represent only 64 91 of our framework and are thus anticipated to have cascading deviant effects on ecological patterns and processes in riverine ecosystems this underlying difference in fwua generated due to different ecological base flows determined from traditional models and our framework however has been overshadowed in previous research we highlight that the highest fish population density recovery potential will be reached at only certain ratios for both sets of habitat benefits this work provides a tool that can help managers evaluate e flows and compare different river restoration scenarios to protect degraded rivers or develop strategies to build resilience to climate change keywords fish with drifting eggs drifting passage environmental

and naiman 2010 xu et al 2017 these fish species are thus an increasingly important consideration when defining dam related e flow prescriptions in recent decades significant advances have been achieved for e flow management with fish as conservation targets an increasingly popular approach is the building block method bbm uktag 2013 which combines the ecological base flow ecohydrological signals and flow event timings as individual blocks to create e flows hough et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b the ecological base flow which is the centerpiece of the bbm zhang et al 2021 determines the ecohydrological signals and flow event timings can be stacked on the correct baseline to avoid cascade deviant effects on ecological patterns in riverine ecosystems quadroni et al 2017 more model applications focusing on e flow design can be found in the literature e g brown and pasternack 2009 chen and olden 2017 kuriqi et al 2019 li et al 2015 tharme 2003 yang et al 2019 in practice however the implementation of e flows still faces the following major challenges 1 the need to improve the capacity to correctly evaluate the ecological base flow to improve the success of river restoration arthington et al 2018 and 2 the lack of a standardized protocol to guide the allocation of e flows for multiple fish species to protect species diversity pander et al 2019 fish species can be roughly divided into those that produce drifting adhesive or demersal eggs according to their spawning properties liu et al 2021 yin 1993 during early life stages spawning activities the number of spawned eggs and hatching survivorship the survival rate of spawned eggs often dictate the strength of subsequent cohorts zhao et al 2018 and these factors are considered to create the strongest bottlenecks in the recruitment of fish populations mills and mann 1985 schiemer et al 2002 thus spawning habitats which possess the environmental requirements needed for fish spawning yin 1993 and hatching habitats which include various substrates that support the hatching needs of adhesive eggs yin 1993 and drift corridors that provide a place for drifting eggs to float in order to hatch lechner et al 2016 together determine the population strength embke et al 2019 warren et al 2015 yang et al 2021 previous e flow research has primarily underscored the high vulnerability of freshwater fish species to changes in the quality of spawning habitat arthington et al 2010 boavida et al 2018 chen et al 2020 li et al 2019 reeder et al 2021 yi et al 2010a yi et al 2010b however the impacts of hatching habitats on freshwater fish recruitment have not yet been comprehensively linked to e flow design especially for broadcast spawners that produce drifting eggs nagel et al 2021 for instance nagel et al 2021 through field monitoring results in the river inn highlighted that spatio temporal information on drift patterns provides essential basis for directing future discharge and river management plans in large alpine rivers however more research on how to link the distribution of drift paths in large rivers with future discharges from hydropower plants in regulated rivers to provide valuable drifting passage is needed yang et al 2019 designed an e flow for fish species that produce drifting eggs but they only focused on spawning requirements and disregarded the ability of the ecological base flow to meet the hatching demand of drifting eggs weng et al 2021 yi et al 2010a zhao et al 2018 and zhang et al 2019a simply used the lower limit of the floating velocity in ecological base flow calculation models to design e flows ignoring the spatial temporal dependence of hydrodynamic effects on drifting eggs this lack of assessment is in sharp contrast with the many studies that have assessed the potential hydropower and climate change impacts on spawning success fish species that produce adhesive eggs usually scatter eggs over a variety of substrates e g gravel bedrock cobble boulder sand pebbles and aquatic weed etc gillespie et al 2020 weng et al 2021 flow dynamics e g flow velocity and water depth and sorting of the stream bed e g interstitial conditions strongly govern the deposition patterns of these eggs and dominate their hatching success by controlling conditions such as oxygen supply and water exchange duerregger et al 2018 nagel et al 2020 pander et al 2015 when considering the hatching habitat requirements the ecological base flows for these fish species can be directly determined by inputting fish substrate type preferences tang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018c into aquatic habitat suitability models hsms that rely on the suitability index si e g water velocity depth and substrate which is one of the most widely used representative methods to assess habitat quality belgiorno et al 2013 bovee 1986 parasiewicz 2001 yi et al 2017 drifting eggs are not affected by the substrate type but they do require the lowest water velocity vl to allow the eggs to remain drifting for a certain period of time to ensure successful incubation and prevent the risk of hypoxia heer et al 2021 lechner et al 2014 yin 1993 thus the flow regime is a more important filter for fish species that produce drifting eggs compared to those that produce adhesive eggs however current hsms have difficulty providing sufficient quantitative information about the drift trajectories and times of floating eggs which are important variables that affect the development of fish populations that produce drifting eggs zeng et al 2019 therefore due to the general dominance of spawning habitats and an insufficient consideration of hatching habitats hsm assessment results are highly questionable for determining ecological base flows in practice to protect fish in early life stages the ecological base flows determined by traditional assessment models contribute to spawning activities but may also act as important mortality agents because low velocity vl zones in rivers create hidden barriers to drifting eggs which results in independent hydrological units from which eggs cannot escape harvey 1987 reichard and jurajda 2004 and the potential underestimation of species losses induced by hydropower operation brown et al 2013 schinegger et al 2016 this phenomenon explains why many recent studies have reported a low density of drifting eggs downstream of spawning grounds despite the implementation of e flows to promote fish spawning chen and li 2015 ren et al 2020b xu et al 2020 fewer studies have attempted to link the responses of drifting eggs to the flow dynamics in ecological base flow calculations and this linkage is urgently needed for the reconstruction of communities of fish that produce drifting eggs an assessment method is needed to enable the ecological base flow to promote fish spawning while improving the survival rates of drifting eggs to help fish survive vulnerable bottlenecks the most common approach in the study of hatching protection is the use of agent based models abms garcia et al 2013 kočovský et al 2021 zhu et al 2018 heer et al 2020 in which drifting eggs are represented as passive particles abms map egg drift trajectories based on the lagrangian method and enable a spatially explicit expression of the hatching states of floating eggs however abms are not often linked to e flows if the status of an invisible barrier in the drifting passage is characterized by a hatching habitat connectivity metric with the help of abms the ecological base flow is determined by identifying the optimum ratio of the quality of the spawning habitat to hatching habitat which seems to resolve the aforementioned bottlenecks however this ratio has not been frequently identified as an important factor in evaluating habitat quality or designing e flow release strategies thus the question remains as to whether the drifting passage should be linked to fish habitat assessments to more accurately determine ecological base flows and design e flows additionally researchers have emphasized that compared to the protection of individual aquatic species multiobjective fish species protection strategies allow ecosystems to have a broader ecological response to the implementation of e flows yang et al 2019 however few approaches are available to guide when and how the shift from fixed to moving ecological targets from fixed fish species conservation targets to variable multiobjective fish species conservation targets should occur and how nonflow environmental factors should be considered to allocate e flows to achieve the best possible outcomes horne et al 2017 king et al 2016 poff 2018 this challenge poses difficulties in setting targets for the protection of ecological base flows and in the timing of stacking blocks mismatches in flow hydrology and water temperature signals can lead to stream restoration failures for example the e flow of kemano reservoir in canada has been released for nearly 30 years although salmon have been protected populations of white sturgeon a native species have been greatly reduced due to mismatched water flow and temperature regimes and this species is now endangered bradford 2022 in addition the conservation of multiple fish species with different spawning patterns including different spawning periods and egg types further exacerbates this challenge traditional assessment frameworks cannot accurately differentiate the ecological water demands of different target fish with different spawning patterns in different periods resulting in a mismatch between supply and demand for instance weng et al 2021 and yang et al 2019 divided multiobjective fish into two separate groups fish that produce adhesive eggs and fish that produce drifting eggs and determined separate ecological base flows for the targets this method ignored the timing of the emergence of different combinations of target fish e g different combinations of fish with different spawning patterns during the same period which led to the release of excessive or inadequate e flows from dams thereby further intensifying the contradiction between the demand for environmental water and economic hydropower interests the lack of a consensus framework for quantifying e flows that accounts for the needs of multiple fish species with different spawning patterns has made conservation of riverine biological diversity difficult which limits how well e flows can be used for various ecological restoration applications to improve the restoration success for multiple fish species with different spawning patterns there is an urgent need to develop a new e flow assessment framework to address the above challenges pander et al 2019 the specific objectives of this paper are 1 to link the spawning needs of fish species and the hydrodynamics of drifting eggs to propose new metrics for ecological base flow calculations to establish a link between habitat connectivity and e flow assessments 2 to demonstrate the reliance of current e flow practices on habitat connectivity by combining a two dimensional ecological hierarchy model and correlation analysis to answer the question of whether drifting passage needs to be linked to fish habitat assessment and 3 to describe two hydropower plans in the lower jinsha river china to provide guidance on when and how to shift from fixed to moving ecological targets by incorporating water temperatures and highlight exemplary scenarios of e flow management with better reliability when considering multiple fish species with different spawning patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 e flow evaluation framework considering multiple fish species the framework presented in this paper is built upon existing knowledge concerning e flow management the spatial temporal dependence of the hydrodynamic effects of drifting eggs and the ecohydrology literature the mechanistic framework can be conceptualized as the integration of a river hydrodynamic model a reservoir water temperature model a habitat model for fish with adhesive eggs a habitat model for fish with drifting eggs an ecological base flow calculation and an ecohydrological characteristic assessment method the integrated framework is illustrated in fig 1 the modelling process of the assessment framework can be summarized as follows 1 a depth averaged 2d hydrodynamic model is established to predict the flow field based on external forcing obtained according to release discharge schemes in river management 2 a reservoir water temperature model is developed to obtain water temperature regimes under different scenarios to set conservation targets for ecological base flows 3 habitat model based on habitat suitability index hsi is established for fish with adhesive eggs and habitat model based on abm and hsi is developed for fish with drifting eggs 4 the habitat model for fish with adhesive eggs is embedded into the depth averaged 2d hydrodynamic model to predict the habitat quality required by fish that produce adhesive eggs 5 the habitat model for fish with drifting eggs is coupled with 2d hydrodynamics model to assess the habitat quality required by fish that produce drifting eggs 6 the habitat quality of fish with adhesive eggs and fish that produce drifting eggs is linked to the ecological base flow calculation methods to determine the ecological base flow in different spawning periods and or incubation periods 7 ecohydrological characteristics are obtained by an ecohydrological characteristic assessment method 8 an e flow is shaped by stacking ecohydrological characteristics and water temperature regimes with ecological base flows 2 1 1 river hydrodynamic model hydraulic information is typically predicted by numerical modeling to capture the natural variability of fish habitats reeder et al 2021 in comparison to one dimensional 1d modeling due to its limited ability to provide detailed flow and topographic information and 3d modeling due to its poor calculation efficiency high resolution 2d vertically averaged hydraulic modeling has become increasingly favored for the evaluation of fish habitat as it offers a pragmatic compromise between computational efficiency and good spatial representation fabris et al 2017 jowett and duncan 2012 the mike 21 numerical model which divides each river segment into smaller computationally flexible cells in the horizontal plane including the hydrodynamics ecological laboratory eco lab and abm has been extensively applied for rivers worldwide belgiorno et al 2013 islam et al 2018 xin et al 2020 zeng et al 2019 here a depth averaged 2d numerical model of the study reach was developed using unstructured triangular computational grids to calculate the flow velocity and water depth downstream of the xjb dam providing key habitat factor information for the assessment of spawning habitats for fish species with disparate spawning habits the hydrodynamic component of mike 21 is based on the two dimensional incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations of mass and momentum conservation formulated in a horizontal cartesian coordinate system detailed information on the mike 21 modeling system can be seen in zhang et al 2021 2 1 2 reservoir water temperature model determination of the timing and quantity of water requirements can be river specific and species dependent millidine et al 2012 a time delay in the eigenvalues of downstream rivers influenced by reservoirs often affects the recognition of water temperature signals by fish zhang et al 2018a which plays a decisive role in the release timing of e flow this is particularly true when considering multiple fish species as different species are adapted to different temperature ranges providing key node signals that is various time points corresponding to the time varying e flow curves that indicate when the ecological base flows and matching ecohydrological features required by different target fishes are provided for e flow composition for these reasons we need to determine when a reservoir is suitable for spawning according to the temperature requirements of the target fish species it is worth noting that water temperature regimes downstream of dams are dramatically affected by reservoir operations he et al 2017 li et al 2021 especially in large reservoirs with strong regulation capacity to simulate thermal stratification and the daily released water temperature we built a laterally averaged two dimensional water temperature model using rectangular computational grids for the xiangjiaba xjb reservoir based on the well accepted ce qual w2 platform the ce qual w2 model ignores temperature characteristics in the lateral direction which is particularly suitable for large reservoirs in mountainous rivers whose shape is narrow long and deep in width length and depth respectively all of these characteristics apply to the xjb reservoir detailed information on the ce qual w2 modeling system is described in appendix a 2 1 3 abm for drifting egg floating simulation the movement of agents in the abm resulting from the sum of several independent movement vectors consisting of the motion direction and speed can be passive or active zeng et al 2019 the motion processes of drifting eggs in this study were represented by agent eggs passive lagrange particles to accurately calculate the position x y z of an individual egg at any time the states of drifting eggs were predicted with a lagrangian particle movement model driven by a hydrodynamic model quan et al 2021 the lagrangian particle movement model solves the langevin equation illustrated as eq 1 which considers a dispersive component resulting from random processes including molecular and turbulence diffusion in water with a random walk numerical algorithm naves et al 2019 the drifting egg floating simulation model is defined by the superposition of two groups of motion vectors in the model where the horizontal movement direction and speed of the eggs are defined as the horizontal flow direction and speed respectively and the vertical movement is determined by the minimum flow velocity required to keep the drifting eggs floating below which the vertical settling speed of the eggs is defined as 0 0075 m s murphy and jackson 2013 wan et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 1 d x t a t x t d t b t x t ζ t d t where d x t is the vector difference between the position xt yt zt of the particle at time t and the position xt 1 yt 1 zt 1 at time t 1 in which xi yi zi is the lagrangian vector coordinate of the particle at time i dt is the time step a t x t is the drift term representing the combined effects of current and wind drag which cause particle advection ζ t is a random number that obeys the standard normal distribution and b t x t is the diffusion term representing both molecular and turbulent dispersion which is described as 2 b t x t 2 d t d l where d l is the dispersion coefficient 2 1 4 habitat suitability index at present hsms that combine hydraulic variables with the si to predict how fish habitats will respond to changes in stream flow are a particularly useful technique that have gained popularity in various habitat assessment studies yi et al 2017 in this study the suitability curve method yi and zhang 2019 was used to relate hydraulic variables with si the suitability curve is a continuous and univariate curve the si values of the target species vary between 0 unsuitable and 1 optimal and the intermediate values represent a suitable value based on a specified hydraulic variable booker and acreman 2007 aquatic organisms do not select the velocity water depth or substrate independently but depend on suitable combinations of these variables wen et al 2021 yi et al 2017 si values can be combined using the geometric mean method to define the habitat suitability index hsi the hsi approaches zero if any of the si values incorporated in the geometric mean are zero thereby providing a more conservative estimate of habitat suitability the hsi is expressed as 3 hsi s i v s i d s i s 3 where s i v s i d and s i s are the suitability values of the water velocity depth and substrate respectively 2 1 5 habitat model for fish spawning with adhesive eggs based on hsi in the assessment of habitat quality habitat availability the concept of the weighted usable area wua m2 bovee 1982 is used as a metric to characterize habitat quality for spawning fish with adhesive eggs this metric is assumed to have a proportional relationship with the number of species yi et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a the wua is calculated by multiplying the hsi value of each computational cell by the relevant cell area and aggregating all values for the entire study area bovee 1982 in the same river reach the wua value corresponding to a definite discharge q is certain the wua can be computed for a specific discharge q scenario based on the following equation 4 wua i 1 n h s i i a i where hs i i is the hsi of the ith cell n is the total number of cells within the wetted area of the stream and a i is the area of the ith cell 2 1 6 habitat model for fish that produce drifting eggs based on abm and hsi the habitat quality for fish that produce drifting eggs in each spawning season is given by the combined effect of the spawning process i e how many eggs are laid during spawning and the drifting egg hatching process i e how many eggs are able to float for a sufficient amount of time to hatch successfully or escape from the control reach from spawning to hatching the spawning process is defined as the recruitment of eggs from adult individuals which can also be assessed by the habitat model described in section 2 1 4 drifting passage represents the link between the spawning of eggs and egg survival the connectivity of which can be assessed on the basis of the survival of spawned eggs spawned egg survival can be described with the index r h which represents the survival rate of drifting eggs supported by the abm simulation results in the following form 5 r h n h n t 100 where n h is the total number of eggs that hatch successfully remain in suspension during flow george et al 2015 or successfully escape from the control reach under specific flow conditions and n t is the total number of particles released in the spawning habitats compared with research conducted by zeng et al 2019 in which only 100 eggs were released in a large reservoir a total of 1000 eggs were released to more accurately grasp the trajectories of fish eggs in this study moreover the egg release locations were in the farthest upstream spawning grounds with large hsi values in this paper the index final wua fwua which is defined by eq 6 as the geometric multiplication of individual processes to compute the combined effect of the two processes by multiplying wua for spawning by the r h value during hatching at a specific discharge was applied to estimate the final habitat conditions for fish that produce drifting eggs allowing interspecies comparisons of habitat quality during the spawning seasons this value provides a more comprehensive estimate of habitat quality than other methods by assuming that good habitat conditions can compensate for unfavorable habitat conditions due to the interaction between two processes allowing the fwua index to approach zero if any of the values in the key processes incorporated into the equation are zero 6 fwua w u a r h remarkably the wua is not the actual living area of the target species spawned eggs but is only an indicator yi et al 2017 assumed to be proportional to the number of species or spawned eggs zhang et al 2019a therefore the fwua is not the actual living area but is only an indicator for evaluating habitat quality for fish that produce drifting eggs during both spawning and hatching periods it is assumed that a proportional relationship between the fwua and the number of eggs surviving incubation from spawning to hatching exists 2 1 7 ecological base flow calculation the instream flow incremental methodology ifim based on hsms has been applied most frequently to determine the ecological base flow for fish spawning worldwide stalnaker et al 1995 yi et al 2017 different water temperatures will trigger different kinds of fish spawning behaviors and spawning activities may occur in one or more target fish species during the same spawning period thus the ecological base flow should be determined in different periods divided in accordance with the critical temperature requirements of the target species a general schematic diagram of the ecological base flow calculation based time interval is provided in fig 2 for each individual fish species spawning the current velocity and water depth of each computational cell computed from the river hydrodynamic model can change resulting in a change in the wua for different discharge q m3 s scenarios therefore providing rating curves of the wua for target spawning fish species then the flow value corresponding to the inflection point of the wua q curve is regarded as the ecological base flow for each fish species spawning with adhesive eggs for each individual fish species producing drifting eggs the rating curve for the fwua q can also be obtained from different q scenarios with abm results the ecological base flow for each specific fish species was ultimately derived from the discharge corresponding to the peak fwua value for multiple fish species in the same spawning season the period during which fish species 2 and fish species 3 spawned simultaneously is shown in fig 2 to account for variation in the wetted area with q and to prevent the absolute dominance of a single fish species e g the habitat quality of different species may vary by different orders of magnitude at the same time the normalized area na defined as ranging between 0 and 1 is derived as follows 7 n a s q i 1 n l 1 n wua q i l wua m a x l 8 n a d q i 1 m k 1 m fwua q i k fwua m a x k 9 n a sd q i 1 n m l 1 n wua q i l wua m a x l k 1 m fwua q i k fwua m a x k where n a s q i n a d q i and n a sd q i are the normalized area in the ith q scenario for multiple fish species spawning with adhesive eggs multiple fish species producing drifting eggs and both types of species during the same spawning period respectively n and m are the total number of fish species spawning with adhesive eggs and producing drifting eggs respectively wua q i l and fwua q i k are the habitat quality of the lth species for fish spawning with adhesive eggs and of the kth species for fish producing drifting eggs in the ith q scenario respectively and wua m a x l and fwua m a x k are the maximum habitat quality for the lth and kth fish species in the river for fish spawning with adhesive eggs and fish producing drifting eggs respectively as such by matching specific q scenarios to n a s q i n a d q i and n a sd q i estimates we obtained specific na q curves for the multiple fish species that spawn adhesive eggs only drifting eggs only and both types during the same spawning period finally the flow corresponding to na peaks was utilized as the ecological base flow for multiple fish species during a specific spawning period except in the case of n a s q i in which the inflection point of the n a s q i curve was regarded as the ecological base flow 2 1 8 determination of e flows considering multiple target fish species studies have shown that seasonal flow processes with specific ecohydrological signals play an important role in ecological functions poff et al 2010 poff and zimmerman 2010 especially for fish for which spawning requires stimulation from the rise and fall of the water liu et al 2011 yi et al 2010a in this study we quantitatively identified ecohydrological indicators including the rise rate fall rate rise duration fall duration and cycle of water fluctuations which were used together to describe the rise and fall processes of e flow during the fish spawning period in accordance with our previous study zhang et al 2018a 2 2 case study the framework was applied to the jinsha river the jinsha river is the headwater of the yangtze river wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b which has a total length of 3 464 km according to the characteristics of channel topography e g elevation differences hydrological and hydrodynamic characteristics e g flow and velocity and the amount of suspended sediments transported dong and wang 2015 the jinsha river can be divided into three segments using the three reach segmentation method dong and wang 2015 the upper reach from yushu to shigu middle reach from shigu to panzhihua and lower reach from panzhihua to yibin li et al 2018 covering a watershed area of approximately 473 200 km2 wang et al 2015 the upper reach has a plateau climate while a subtropical climate is dominant in the middle and lower reaches zhang et al 2019a the elevation difference of the jinsha river is 5 142 m its high and concentrated flow makes the jinsha river the largest hydropower production region in china li et al 2018 the development of a total of 25 hydropower stations along the mainstream of jinsha river from upstream to downstream is planned known as 25 levels of cascade hydropower stations in particular four mega reservoirs wudongde wdd baihetan bht xiluodu xld and xiangjiaba xjb lying on the lower reach of the jinsha river with a total installed capacity of 44 800 mw twice the capacity of the three gorges reservoir have attracted widespread attention owing to their high ability to regulate stream flows and positive effect in terms of promoting rapid socioeconomic development in western china the lower jinsha river has a rich variety of freshwater fishes serves as a critical habitat for rare freshwater fishes and is an important supplemental channel of fish recruitment for the yangtze river the xjb reservoir is the last cascade in the lower reaches of the jinsha river however the mode of power generation operation in the xjb reservoir will modify the hydrodynamic conditions necessary for the reproduction of many native fish downstream of the reservoir which could lead to habitat loss for native fish thus limiting the replenishment of fish resources in the jinsha river to the yangtze river to a certain extent in response to such challenges numerous efforts have been implemented by the central people s government of the people s republic of china and the ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china to develop conservation policies and management strategies to promote fish population recovery such as establishing the national nature reserve of rare and endemic fish and fish breeding and release stations nevertheless knowing how to support biological diversity and protect suitable habitats for multiple fish species in the reserve especially disparate spawning habits to fundamentally cope with hydropower development is of great concern to regulation agencies as a key principle for maintaining river biodiversity and ecosystem health sustaining adequate e flows can potentially restore fish habitats zhao et al 2017 in this paper the reach extending from the xjb dam site to the outlet of the jinsha river with a length of 32 km was chosen as a case study fig 3 this reach encompasses a nearly 30 km core area of the reserve and hosts typical endangered fish with different spawning habits such as acipenser dabryanus a dabryanus myxocyprinus asiaticus m asiaticus coreius guichenoti c guichenoti and hypophthalmichthys molitrix h molitrix whose populations have declined dramatically in recent years and whose endangerment levels are determined by the national forestry and grassland administration and ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china the hengjiang river is an important tributary of the right bank occurring approximately 3 5 km downstream of the dam the average annual flow aaf of the mainstream is 4570 m3 s whereas that of the hengjiang river is 294 m3 s 2 3 target fish species selection according to fish field investigations 2006 2018 conducted by the china three gorges corporation ctgc 2019 a total of 136 species of fish were identified in the study river reach including 4 nationally key protected species 13 provincially key protected and endangered species and 49 endemic species the fish can be divided into two main groups according to their spawning habits fish spawning with adhesive eggs and fish producing drifting eggs they exhibit different habitat preferences that differ greatly with their different spawning types indicating that the selection of target species should include all spawning types among them a dabryanus and m asiaticus which spawn adhesive eggs are both listed on the international union for conservation of nature s iucn red list of threatened species and are legally protected in china they belong to the national top level and second level protection classes of protected animals respectively guo et al 2021a zhou et al 2020 in addition c guichenoti and h molitrix which both spawn drifting eggs belong to the national second level protection class and near endangered class of species listed on the iucn red list of threatened species emerging data from many years of field sampling showed that the resources for these fish species have greatly declined in the study river due to their endangered status and different oviposition habits we thus selected these four fish species as suitable candidates to assess the e flow required for the national natural reserve controlled by the xjb reservoir which has crucial spawning grounds the spawning seasons of a dabryanus and m asiaticus usually span from march to the end of april in the study river reach while the spawning seasons of h molitrix and c guichenoti are from may to june and from april and june respectively spawning in all these fish species requires a critical temperature and suitable physical habitat additionally spawning in c guichenoti and h molitrix needs to be accompanied by suitable rising or falling of water flows information regarding the requirements for spawning in the target fish species is provided in table 1 2 4 scenario design to assess the impacts of cascade reservoirs in the lower jinsha river on the water temperature regime two hypothetical scenarios were developed in the present study according to the hydropower development plan of the jinsha river table 2 2 5 model setup and data collection two categories of general data terrain and hydrological data are required for modeling hydrodynamics in rivers while both inflow and outflow data together with meteorological data such as cloud cover wind velocity wind direction air temperature and dew point temperature data are required for the reservoir water temperature model in this study detailed bathymetry data including those from the xld reservoir the xjb reservoir and the river downstream of the xjb reservoir were obtained using a real time kinematic rtk gps consisting of the mobile mapper 10 gis gps receiver and the spectra precision sp60 gnss receiver trimble inc usa in 2018 according to the national standard of the people s republic of china ch t 2009 2010 by assuming a reference station at a known point and transmitting radio signals a roving station that receives radio signals and combines them with gps signals was used to obtain the x y z coordinates the daily discharge data for the hengjiang hydrometric station 2011 2020 and the water level data for the yibin hydrometric station 2011 2020 obtained from the three gorges corporation were used as the tributary input and mainstream output boundaries of the 2d river hydrodynamic model respectively the daily meteorological data obtained from the yongshan meteorological station and suijiang meteorological station provided by the china meteorological data service center were used daily time series data for the inflow rate of the xld reservoir and xjb reservoir for 2014 were collected from the three gorges corporation the study river reach was discretized into 49 564 computational flexible elements in the horizontal plane in the 2d river hydrodynamic model thermal stratification is common in deep reservoirs thus we stratified the xjb and xld reservoir models into 72 and 134 vertical computational layers respectively with a thickness of 2 m based on previous experience of modeling thermal stratification in deep water bodies he et al 2017 nonslip wall conditions were applied to wall surfaces in all models moreover for the scenario assessment the natural water temperature baseline without any reservoir construction at the xjb dam site was determined with reference to the method by zhao 2021 the detailed calculation method is described in appendix a the baseline of the xjb dam site was finally calculated according to the annual average daily water temperature at pingshan hydrometric station located 11 0 km upstream of the xjb dam site 2004 2011 following the daily temperature increase rate km along the river between the huatan hydrometric station located 350 5 km upstream of xjb dam site 2004 2011 and pingshan hydrometric station the boundaries of the reservoir temperature model for inflow discharge inflow water temperature and operating water level of all the scenarios were obtained from the environmental impact assessment report of the xjb hydropower station on the lower jinsha river which was reviewed by the ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china in addition the si curves of water depth and velocity for a dabryanus and m asiaticus during the spawning season were derived using the frequency analysis method fam proposed by liu et al 2018 while the si curves for c guichenoti and h molitrix were obtained from the latest works of zhang et al 2018a and dai et al 2021 respectively the si curves for the spawning habitats of all target fish species are shown in fig a1 furthermore the daily discharge of the pingshan hydrometric station from 1968 to 1987 with little human impact according to the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china was used to extract ecohydrological characteristics for c guichenoti and h molitrix during the spawning period in the lower jinsha river the 2d hydrodynamic model was calibrated using velocity and water level measurements the flow velocity data were obtained directly from field monitoring by means of a propeller current meter ls25 3a measurement range 0 04 10 0 m s accuracy 0 01 m s at the xjb hydrometric station section measurements were taken at 0 6 of the depth to obtain a depth averaged reading hough et al 2019 according to the national standard of the people s republic of china gb 50179 2015 water level data were collected using an rtk gps unit with an accuracy of 0 02 m at xjb hydrometric station section we used field monitoring data on water velocities in 2017 and water levels in 2016 at the xjb hydrological station downstream of the dam to validate the model parameters for the parameters that were difficult to measure directly some were set to the empirical values used in the literature wan et al 2020 and key parameters were initially set within a suitable range and later the values were adjusted for local areas to obtain a good match between the modeled and measured results we initially set manning s coefficient values with a homogeneous roughness across the entire reach to a typical value of 0 03 in addition the model time step was specified as a constant 60 s to ensure a stable and quick run time two practical model evaluation statistics including the root mean square error rmse and relative rmse rrmse were adopted in this study michael baker inc 2013 we used vertical temperature distributions and water level data in the xld reservoir and xjb reservoir to calibrate the reservoir water temperature model parameters the measured temperatures along the vertical direction in the xld reservoir 1 0 km before the dam and xjb reservoir 1 0 km section 1 and 32 0 km section 2 before the dam in 2014 were obtained from the most recent studies conducted by xie et al 2016 and long et al 2018 respectively and the measured water levels of xld reservoir and xjb reservoir in 2014 were obtained from the three gorges corporation to verify the reservoir water temperature model hydrological inflow temperature huatan hydrometric station and meteorological data obtained from january 1 2014 to december 31 2014 were used to drive the numerical model the values of calibrated parameters were initially specified from default values including the solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer longitudinal eddy diffusivity longitudinal eddy viscosity wind sheltering coefficient extinction for pure water and manning s roughness coefficient and they were further adjusted to achieve close agreement between the simulated and measured water temperature profiles and reservoir water levels the mean absolute error mae and rmse were used to quantify bias and goodness of fit ma et al 2015 the performance of the aquatic habitat model was tested by comparing habitat quality patch predictions with surveyed spawning locations mapped in the natural reserve along our study reach in addition fish eggs were transported to the downstream reach of the study area as c guichenoti and h molitrix produce drifting eggs therefore the performance of the habitat model for fish that produce drifting eggs was tested by comparing the fwua index with data on the daily number of drifting eggs in the yibin sampling section which is located in the outflow section using pearson correlation analysis mekonnen et al 2021 collection of the drifting eggs of h molitrix was conducted during the spawning season in the yibin sampling section in 2018 two groups and the jiangjin sampling section in 2008 and 2014 2017 five groups which occur downstream of the study area the numbers of eggs in the yibin section in 2008 and 2014 2017 were estimated based on the proportion of eggs in the study area in comparison to those in the jiangjin section wei 2012 the daily number of eggs of h molitrix was estimated using the method described by xu et al 2015 3 results 3 1 hydroenvironmental model validation 3 1 1 validation of the river hydrodynamic model the comparison of predicted water levels and velocities with measured data is plotted in fig 4 overall the predictions agree reasonably well with the observed results the minimum and maximum velocities of the measured results were 1 06 m s and 4 21 m s respectively and the average velocity among all measured points was 2 73 m s the flow velocity from the simulation results varied from 0 99 m s to 4 22 m s and the average velocity was 2 74 m s the low and high velocities were all well reproduced the rmse and rrmse of velocity between the simulated and monitored values were 0 08 m s and 2 55 respectively which meets the requirements of accurate operation of the model and has high reliability liao et al 2022 tang et al 2018 in addition the rmse and rrmse of the water level were 0 25 m and 2 62 respectively the overall trend of the simulated water level was basically the same as that of the measured water level and the variation in water level was accurately reproduced therefore the established hydrodynamic model had a good calculation accuracy and could be used for subsequent research tan et al 2021 xu et al 2017 the final calibration showed that the majority of the river had a manning s coefficient value of 0 03 while patches of the riverbed had roughnesses ranging from 0 023 to 0 045 3 1 2 validation of the reservoir water temperature model fig a2 compares the calculated and field monitored reservoir water levels at the xld and xjb reservoirs in 2014 the rmse and rrmse between the simulated and monitored values were 0 23 m and 0 40 for xld and 0 11 m and 1 23 for xjb respectively implying a good fit of the calculated water levels the comparisons of the observed and modeled temperature distributions are shown in fig 5 in which the mae and rmse values in the 9 validation scenarios are all smaller than 1 0 this indicates that the model simulated vertical temperature distributions were in good accordance with the observed data he et al 2017 he et al 2019 wang et al 2020 and that the model can accurately simulate the reservoir water temperatures associated with cascade hydropower the final calibrated parameters for the reservoir water temperature model are listed in table a1 3 1 3 validation of the habitat assessment models a comparison of the model simulated spawning habitat patches and spawning locations of all the target fish species showed that all were located within the model predicted high quality patches where the hsi was larger than 0 8 as shown in fig 6 the model results exhibited in fig 7 show that the fwua values were in good accordance with the daily numbers of drifting eggs with a pearson correlation value of 0 9669 p 0 05 suggesting that the assessment model could accurately indicate the habitat quality for fish with drifting eggs because biomass data for c guichenoti are lacking the habitat model for c guichenoti could not be verified however the buoyancy velocity and vertical settling velocity required for c guichenoti eggs were consistent with those for h molitrix zeng et al 2019 these are the only two key parameters used to determine the incubation state in our habitat model therefore the validated model can be applied to assess the two target fish species 3 2 water temperature changes caused by cascade reservoirs the predicted released water temperature changes after cascade reservoir construction under different joint operation scenarios are exhibited in fig 8 the plots for scenarios 1 and 2 in comparison to the baseline suggest that the water temperature in the two typical scenarios is altered dramatically after the reservoirs are put into operation significantly presenting a hysteresis effect delay of the time node satisfying the characteristic temperature and flattening effects the difference between the highest and lowest temperature in a year with greater values indicating a greater effect where the degree of temperature changes significantly depends on the scale of cascade reservoir development specifically the temperatures of released water were significantly lower than the water temperatures at baseline from the latter part of february to august and from march to early september in scenarios 1 and 2 lasting 184 and 170 days respectively showing that the delays in the target spawning times of these fishes will be further exacerbated with the scale of cascade hydropower development the temperature difference of maximum and minimum discharged water during the year with values of 9 2 and 6 8 respectively were lower than the baseline with a value of 10 9 indicating that a larger scale of cascade hydropower was associated with a stronger flattening effect it can be seen in fig 8a that the maximum temperature drops were 3 9 and 4 6 occurring in april and that the maximum temperature increases occurred in january with values of 3 5 and 5 4 under scenarios 1 and 2 respectively compared to the water temperatures at baseline indicating that the effects of warm and cold water increase with the scale of cascade dam development the release of water from the xjb dam under the two typical scenarios was expected to negatively affect downstream fish habitats due to its lower water temperature during the beginning of the spawning season spawning in m asiaticus a dabryanus c guichenoti and h molitrix occurs when the water temperature ranges from 14 to 22 16 to 19 17 to 26 4 and 18 to 27 during the spawning season respectively the results from habitat modeling showed that the discharge temperature did not rise to 14 until march 25 in scenario 1 which was delayed by approximately 30 days compared to the baseline in contrast the minimum temperature of the released water throughout the entire year in scenario 2 with a value of 15 3 was higher than the temperature required for m asiaticus due to the cumulative effect of high temperature water in cascade hydropower development which supported m asiaticus spawning as long as it was associated with appropriate flow conditions the water temperatures in scenario 1 which reached 16 17 and 18 were postponed for 33 32 and 33 days compared to the baseline for a dabryanus c guichenoti and h molitrix respectively whereas the corresponding discharged water temperature delay times were 42 48 and 52 days under scenario 2 in addition there were no noticeable changes in the number of days to attain the suitable spawning water temperature ranges for all the target fish species in the two scenarios although the number of days with a suitable temperature for c guichenoti spawning increased by 1 and 13 days in scenarios 1 and 2 respectively compared to the baseline these analyses suggest that the reservoirs in the lower jinsha river greatly imposed significant impacts on the water temperature regime during the target fish spawning time except in the case of m asiaticus spawning under scenario 2 according to the duration of suitable spawning water temperatures in the modeling results and considering the original water temperature rhythm in the baseline the key time nodes for the ecological base flow calculation were identified and are listed in table 3 3 3 habitat modeling results 3 3 1 habitat assessment results for fish with different spawning patterns fig 9 displays the relationships between wua and q for target fish species that spawn adhesive eggs and between fwua and q for fish that produce drifting eggs the trend of habitat quality versus discharge for fish that spawn adhesive eggs shows a predictable pattern that can be well described by a left skewed modal relationship whereby there is an increase in wua with discharge until it reaches a maximum after which it starts to decrease and eventually stabilizes at a level that varies with the target fish species at relatively high q values while the values for fwua increased with flow rapidly in the lower flow ranges this trend diminished until it reached a relatively high value from which point an increase in discharge resulted in habitat quality increasing up to a maximum value after which habitat quality decreased with an increase in q the rapid increase in habitat quality with q in the low discharge range became even more significant for h molitrix fig 9 shows lower habitat availabilities associated with low discharges for all target fish species with different spawning patterns when considering the ratio between the habitat quality occurring under low flow conditions 10 aaf and the maximum habitat quality provided by the river however the fwua values were 11 24 and 21 71 for h molitrix and c guichenoti respectively which were significantly lower than the spawning wua values for m asiaticus and a dabryanus which were 52 49 and 32 02 respectively this result largely indicates that the threat of low flow conditions to suitable habitats for fish that produce drifting eggs was higher than that for fish that spawn adhesive eggs fish species that produce drifting fish eggs are thus more sensitive to flow than fish that spawn adhesive eggs the values of discharge corresponding to the inflection point of the wua q curves were 2285 m3 s and 2513 5 m3 s for m asiaticus and a dabryanus respectively whereas the levels of discharge that maximized the fwua tended to be 2285 m3 s and 2513 5 m3 s for c guichenoti and h molitrix respectively as such discharges of 2285 m3 s 2513 5 m3 s 2285 m3 s and 2513 5 m3 s were defined as the ecological base flows for m asiaticus a dabryanus c guichenoti and h molitrix spawning respectively when considered as a single target 3 3 2 habitat assessment results for multiple fish species considered at once to associate thermal and hydrologic metrics and multiple stream fishes we identified different target fish species corresponding to different spawning periods table 4 under different scenarios based on the classification of the spawning period five independent na q curves for different fish species were derived table 5 we then modeled the process of na changing with q under five target scenarios to estimate the ecological base flow required in each spawning period considering multiple fish species fig 10 presents five na q curves for the spawning periods at the studied site overall the habitat quality for the fish species in the river was low under near dry flow conditions ranging from 0 1 to 0 6 regarding the change trends the nas1 value increased concurrently with the increase in q but this trend became less marked at a higher discharge of 2285 m3 s until it reached 2513 5 m3 s after which a decreasing trend was seen followed by an eventual plateau the change trends of nad1 nasd1 nasd2 and nasd3 were all consistent with that of the fwua with a rapid increase for na values associated with low discharge conditions the q corresponding to the optimal value of the na index in all the na curves was 2513 5 m3 s although the peak value of nasd1 and the inflection point of the nas1 curves were both 2285 m3 s suggesting that the ecological base flow was 2285 m3 s during the spawning period when considering a dabryanus and c guichenoti only and when considering m asiaticus and a dabryanus only while the ecological base flow in the other multitarget scenarios was 2513 5 m3 s 3 4 recommendations for e flow regimes when considering multiple fish species 3 4 1 ecohydrological characteristics of target fish species the ecohydrological characteristics of c guichenoti and h molitrix in the lower jinsha river were obtained using long time series of daily flow data from the pingshan hydrometric station more specifically as illustrated in fig a3 and a4 c guichenoti preferred flow rise rates dimensionless parameter of 0 01 0 10 for which the distribution index was greater than 0 9 in contrast h molitrix favored rise rates in the range of 0 025 0 100 we further found that the ideal flow fall rates dimensionless parameter required by c guichenoti were 0 01 0 03 although h molitrix has no requirements in terms of fall rates of flow during the spawning period the ideal fall rate in the natural rhythm of its life was 0 01 0 04 in addition the longest rise duration for c guichenoti and h molitrix reached 19 days and 17 days respectively whereas the longest fall duration reached 10 days and 12 days respectively both c guichenoti and h molitrix avoided habitats with long flow rise and fall durations and preferred rise durations of 1 2 days and 1 3 days and fall durations of 1 2 days and only 1 day respectively moreover the distribution index of the fluctuation of the water cycle for c guichenoti and h molitrix which was greater than 0 9 was 1 3 days for both species in general the ecohydrological characteristics of c guichenoti in the lower jinsha river agree well with those of individuals of this species inhabiting the yalong river as indicated in a recent study zhang et al 2018a the suitable ranges of ecohydrological characteristics are shown in table 6 3 4 2 recommendations for e flow regimes under different scenarios a time delay of water temperature signals often determines the starting time of the ecological flow regime released by a system providing appropriate flow at biologically more active periods to improve the resilience and resistance of ecosystems the e flow regimes in scenarios 1 and 2 were designed according to the pivotal ecological time nodes for the river system derived in section 3 2 as displayed in fig 11 the start time of ecological flow regime release in scenario 1 and scenario 2 was chosen as march 25 and march 1 respectively when a discharge value of 2285 m3 s was observed this is because of the limited cumulative impact of two stage reservoirs in scenario 1 which resulted in a delay of the date when 14 was reached and the sufficiently strong cumulative impact of cascade reservoirs in scenario 2 which resulted in the high temperature regime always having a temperature higher than 14 in winter considering the changes in the composition of the fish communities over time a flow of 2285 m3 s was maintained until april 28 and april 30 in scenarios 1 and 2 respectively subsequently the ecohydrological information on the ecological base flow was accumulated starting on april 29 in scenario 1 while a flow of 2513 5 m3 s needed to be released from may 1 to may 14 for a dabryanus under scenario 2 then the ecohydrological signals were superimposed onto the ecological base flow for which the suitable values of ecohydrological indices could be selected from table 6 to determine the flow regime consisting of the fluctuation to address the conflict between the e flow regime and the societal need for water resource conservation the rise rate and fall rates were both 0 01 0 03 when only c guichenoti spawning was considered april 29 may 6 in scenario 1 and may 15 may 23 in scenario 2 with a 2 day rise duration and 2 day fall duration forming a complete fluctuation in the water cycle to create slow processes of rising and falling at the beginning of the period when c guichenoti and h molitrix spawned simultaneously may 7 may 28 in scenario 1 and may 26 june 13 in scenario 2 the e flow regime consisted of fluctuations with rise and fall rates both in the range of 0 025 0 03 with a 2 day rise duration and a 1 day fall duration during the peak spawning period may 29 july 3 in scenario 1 and june 14 july 22 in scenario 2 two critical flood pulses in which the rise and fall rates were 0 05 0 10 and 0 005 0 01 with a 2 day rise duration and a 1 day fall duration respectively were constructed to support the occurrence of spawning peaks wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2018a the ecological flow regime in both scenarios ended with c guichenoti spawning alone july 4 july 28 in scenario 1 and july 23 august 13 in scenario 2 and consisted of a 2 day rise duration a 2 day fall duration and a range of 0 01 0 03 for both the rise rate and fall rate 4 discussion 4 1 does drifting passage need to be linked to fish habitat assessments by conducting field investigations in dam regulated rivers scientists have found that flow regimes influence the temporal and spatial availability of suitable habitats and thus often affect fish recruitment nagel et al 2021 pander et al 2021 which generally consists of two phases spawning and hatching pander et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 the combined modeling assessment framework presented in this study can be a powerful tool for evaluating the effects of dams reservoirs on these key habitats spawning and hatching providing a foundation for river managers to develop strategies to maintain or restore them previous studies including those in north america europe and china addressing habitat assessment or ecological flow regime designs have mainly underscored the protection of spawning habitats bergerot and cattanéo 2017 boavida et al 2018 dudley and platania 2007 zeng et al 2019 focusing on spawning demands with less emphasis on hatchery operations this is particularly true for the assessment of habitat for fish that produce drifting eggs as fish spawning coincides with the hatching of drifting eggs yin 1993 traditional assessment models have simply integrated floating velocity restrictions into the hsi model with preference curves and implicitly evaluated habitat quality or identified the ecological flow regime yi et al 2010b zhang et al 2019b yang et al 2019 overlooking the drift trajectory and drift time which are known to create strong bottlenecks for population development inaccurate coupling or insufficient consideration regarding spatial temporal quantitative relations between key factors and fish recruitment may inappropriately characterize a habitat assessment model as successful the model presented here is a multilevel coupling model implemented as an abm it spatially and temporally explicitly considers all ontogenetically relevant spawning and hatching processes using h molitrix as an example of a typical fish species that produces drifting eggs we tested the usability of this model to study the effects of coupling spawning habitat availability and drifting passage connectivity on the potential density of the fish population the model results clearly showed a strong correlation between habitat quality and the average daily numbers of drifting eggs indeed correlation analysis confirmed that the average daily numbers of drifting eggs were more related to fwua r2 0 9669 fig 7 than to the wua index recommended for use by previous studies not considering drifting passage r2 0 7695 fig 12 this difference in correlation was related to whether drifting passage was included in the evaluation which emphasizes the importance of considering drifting passage connectivity for the accurate evaluation of habitat quality in addition a more pronounced nonlinear relation between habitat quality fwua and q was observed due to the significant nonlinearity of the relationship between egg survival and q in contrast to the fwua q curve however the traditional wua q curve fig 13 showed that ecological base flow was optimal at 1142 5 m3 s and 1828 m3 s for c guichenoti and h molitrix respectively which are significantly lower than the values derived from the model presented here of 2285 m3 s and 2513 5 m3 s respectively as there was a strong dependence of population density on the hatching rate during the low flow period zeng et al 2019 liu et al 2021 this result further supports the hypothesis of the importance of drifting passage consideration in habitat assessment from a management and restoration point of view ecological base flow has high sensitivity to habitat assessment model performance yi et al 2014 and the ecological base flow considering only spawning habitat appears to be lower than that considering both spawning habitat quality and hatching passage quality the ecological benefits of the implementation of traditional models represent only 64 91 fwu a 1142 5 fwu a 2285 100 of the model examined herein because of their unique functional roles in the design of e flow regimes which are anticipated to have cascading deviant effects on ecological patterns and processes in riverine ecosystems olden and naiman 2010 such traditional models are often used to inform e flow assessments associated with future climate change and dam development this underlying difference in ecological benefits however has been overshadowed in previous research indicating that habitat assessment based solely upon spawning habitat is not an efficient solution for the ecological improvement of fish that produce drifting eggs despite its popularity as a measurable proxy for habitat quality we showed here that the modeled wua is actually a poor predictor of projected changes in habitat quality for fish that produce drifting eggs although the usual assessment of habitat quality relies on hsms our study further highlights relevant mechanisms wua based assessments overemphasize the role of spawning demands as the primary driver of habitat quality assessments in comparison to fwua based models do not account for the effects of flow dynamics on drifting egg behavior and neglect the role of the drifting time empirical analysis shows that although operating e flow according to an fwua based approach to create environmentally friendly flow regimes may reduce spawning habitat quality the benefits derived from habitat connectivity offset the forgone spawning benefits thereby increasing the total value of river flow for fish that produce drifting eggs thus drifting passage needs to be linked to fish habitat assessments to evaluate habitat quality and dam water release strategies for such fish species 4 2 building habitat protection resilience to hydropower development to date rather few habitat assessment models have used a spatially explicit approach that considers ontogenetically relevant spawning and hatching habitats although several scenario studies have accounted for the impact of hydrodynamic conditions on fish with drifting eggs none of the reviewed methodologies attempted to link the quality of available suitable habitats to the quality of drifting passage e g barros et al 2018 heer et al 2021 liu et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 the lack of such information was a rationale for this study and inspired us to develop an ecological model to fill this gap the framework presented in this paper builds on existing approaches while overcoming some key limitations for which the framework successfully integrates fish spawning demands the operation response of hatcheries and the linkages between the timing of released water and thermal metrics into the e flow assessment making it easy to identify the required ecological base flow in each period for different fish species it also allows us to assess habitat quality for fish with different spawning patterns and in particular identify the timing and magnitude of both peak and low discharges to achieve this possibility as a case study we effectively assessed the habitat quality of different fish species including m asiaticus a dabryanus c guichenoti h molitrix and their combinations and defined e flows in the xjb reservoir in the lower jinsha river using a model based evaluation framework that integrated habitat connectivity by linking egg drifting passage to habitat availability considered water temperature requirements simultaneously and used the na index as a habitat quality metric to facilitate the comparison of different external driving forces and the design of e flow considering different target fish species we included scenarios that divided cascade hydropower development into two scenario 1 and four levels scenario 2 following the latest cascade reservoir planning report both the spawning and hatchery habitats were protected in both scenarios via e flows by ensuring high intensity spawning events for the multiple fish species with impartial protection as well as by ensuring the successful survival of the eggs of fish that produce drifting eggs we believe that the e flows designed according to this framework allow us to better reach predefined restoration and management targets than those obtained via traditional frameworks e g reductions in protection problems associated with unfair strategies based on favoritism parka et al 2020 and high numbers of spawned eggs with a low hatching rate zhang et al 2018a which can be attributed to accurate ecological base flow assessment and effective time division protection for multiple species additionally our analytical framework allows the delineation of mechanisms among climate hydropower habitat fish connections by extensively examining their associations we thus encourage riverine ecologists and water managers to broaden their perspective regarding ecological base flows to include both fish spawning and drifting hatching with respect to rehabilitating the natural rhythm of river flow regimes furthermore the framework presented in this study can also be applied to other freshwater river systems globally to evaluate habitat quality for heavily managed fish species with different spawning patterns and to implement regulations of stream discharge in association with infrastructure with the aim of riverine conservation nevertheless we must be clear that the e flow regime evaluation system is not consistent for different fish species with varied spawning types the preferred habitats of target species can differ across a range of factors including terrain hydrological conditions the lowest critical floating velocity to maintain eggs in suspension egg settlement velocity and drifting time required for the successful incubation of drifting eggs garcia et al 2013 wan et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 the typical target fish along with the associated physical habitat preferences and biohydraulic traits of drifting eggs need to be adjusted and determined after sufficient research in the field and laboratory 4 3 reliability of the framework although e flows are the main restoration technique used to ameliorate the ecological effects of regulation in rivers their effectiveness has yet to be unanimously accepted growns 2016 in the past few decades long term flow experiments in regulated rivers have been conducted by scientists with the results showing that the effectiveness of e flows is not always positive but instead varies according to species and life history rolls 2021 bradford et al 2011 conducted a 13 year experiment in the regulated bridge river british columbia canada and found that the abundance of juvenile chinook salmon declined after an e flow release compared to that during the baseline period it was hypothesized that this decline may have been due to a lack of consideration of the impacts on spawning timing and emergence timing in the design of the e flow water temperatures higher than those during the natural period in water released from the reservoir in autumn accelerated the development of eggs and larvae could have caused earlier emergence and led to mortality due to high flow events elevated predation or insufficient resources olden and naiman 2010 a similar case regarding the mismatch between a species life history and water temperature can also be found in the lost creek dam rogue river u s a angilletta et al 2008 in our framework we linked the water temperature requirements of target fish spawning to e flow design to match the ecological base flow ecohydrological signals and timings required for fish life history with the required water temperature to enhance the success of restoration in addition theodoropoulos et al 2019 found that the biological resources of a regulated river located in western greece ecological base flow of 0 2 m3 s released were suboptimal by sampling this flow was calculated based on the hydrological method and was much lower than the ecological base flow 0 6 2 m3 s obtained by considering biological information theodoropoulos et al 2019 theodoropoulos et al 2020 inaccuracies in ecological base flows lead to deviations in the entire e flow which may affect the entire ecosystem the ecological base flow calculations in our framework fully consider the requirements of fish during critical bottleneck periods spawning and hatching and can capture drift trajectories that cannot be captured by hydrological methods providing a solid foundation for e flow design moreover bradford 2022 reviewed the effects of e flow management on fish habitats and fish populations at kenney dam completed in 1954 located on the nechako river in british columbia canada the results from monitoring studies showed that the e flow established for salmon conservation brought the salmon population to a state deemed acceptable however recruitment for the white sturgeon population acipenser transmontanus that inhabits the watershed failed flows and temperatures that do not match the requirement for white sturgeon in specific life stages have been hypothesized as contributing factors korman and walters 2000 hildebrand et al 2017 which highlights the importance of e flow design with multi target fish our framework can determine when and how to shift from fixed to moving protection targets in allocating e flows to protect multiple fish species the worldwide expansion of hydropower as also evident from our case study makes it necessary to better consider and mitigate its ecological impacts to shift the balance between the red and green aspects of hydropower dams and reservoirs geist 2021 from 2012 to 2018 11 ecological scheduling experiments targeting the natural reproduction of four major chinese carp fmcc species were conducted in the three gorges reservoir tgr xu et al 2020 and the range of the ecological base flow was 6200 14600 m3 s the investigation showed that the daily number of drifting eggs was 7 times higher after the e flow release chen and li 2015 xu et al 2020 used survey data to conclude that ecological base flow can affect the timing of spawning the higher the ecological base flow is the quicker the spawning response is and a smaller ecological base flow may not be sufficient to support the successful floating of eggs based on the early fish resources after the implementation of e flow the chinese sturgeon research institute found that the ecological base flow of the tgr should be set to 10000 m3 s to protect the fmcc xu et al 2020 and this value is larger than the value of 3000 m3 s proposed by yi et al 2010a without considering the drift trajectory of eggs our framework and conclusions support the experimental results of ecological scheduling to a certain extent that is the ecological base flow considering only the spawning habitat appears to be lower than that considering both the quality of the spawning habitat and the hatching passage from 2017 to 2019 four ecological scheduling experiments may 13 17 2017 may 20 25 2017 may 15 18 2018 and may 26 29 2019 targeting the natural reproduction of fmcc were conducted in the xjb reservoir dai et al 2021 the investigation showed that the drifting egg density was 1 3 times that before e flow release ren et al 2020b during the experiments the range of released e flow was 2400 4500 m3 s with an average value of 3221 m3 s dai et al 2021 which was similar to the e flow obtained from our framework e flows ranging from 2513 5 to 4399 7 m3 s with an average value of 3456 6 m3 s this confirms that the e flow designed by our framework is reliable 4 4 habitat restoration in response to climate change in recent decades the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including droughts and heatwaves are undergoing increases worldwide due to global warming berg and mccoll 2021 fischer et al 2021 fooladi et al 2021 smale et al 2019 várbíró et al 2020 xu et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 which has become a serious disaster that can cause irreversible harm to aquatic ecosystems this puts forward higher requirements for the development of reliable hsm research e g the accurate assessment of water demand and identification of the appropriate timing of released water to help establish climate change adaptation policies tsang et al 2021 the use of robust hsms has become a crucial simulation tool to improve the predictive accuracy of recently developed models that simulate the response of habitat quality to climate change morid et al 2020 in our framework hsms that evaluate fish spawning habitats could benefit from additional knowledge of the effects of flow dynamics on drifting egg behavior any observed variability in the fwua reflected the influence of external forced changes on the comprehensive habitat quality for fish that produce drifting eggs involving both spawning and hatching processes rather than spawning variables alone therefore the fwua can be used as a reliable indicator to guide habitat restoration for fish with drifting eggs and help river decision makers dam operators develop strategies with a focus on spawning and hatching habitat improvement to increase ecosystem resilience in the face of a changing climate morales marín et al 2019 allowing riverine systems to better cope with the increasingly encountered stress of drought due to global climate change parka et al 2020 won et al 2020 it can also facilitate the assessment and comparison of river restoration

high habitat quality in the context of a cost effectiveness analysis guo et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 making it easy to reconcile conflicts among stakeholders in addition our integrative model may

degradation disappearance due to droughts and heatwaves morid et al 2020 in addition to climate driven changes in hydrological regimes the impacts of climate change on the thermal characteristics in reservoirs add a new challenge to designing e flows since the input of external forcing including large scale climate drivers and hydrological conditions is easy to handle in our submodels such a framework is also applicable to the habitat assessment of global rivers under the impact of climate change such an application has potential for designing effective e flows to mediate the impact of expected temperature increases as has been done for selected streams using field investigated data e g terrain and reservoir operation constraints and assumed future temperature increase scenarios kim and choi 2021 wen et al 2018 indicating that our framework has strong transferability and is readily extensible this kind of long range current and future analysis can help focus efforts in identifying the potential impacts of climate change and could inform active decision making regarding water allocations to increase the chances of achieving sustainable resilient river systems over longer time scales 5 conclusions confronted with the conservation of endangered species diversity several new challenges are emerging in e flow practices globally and expectations of ecologists have been raised for efficient e flow interventions that can increase the probability of river restoration success here we developed an effective framework with the index of fwua to integrate rehabilitation needs in terms of ontogenetically critical spawning habitat availability closely coupled with the spatial temporal dependence of the hydrodynamic effect of drifting eggs using a hydrodynamic temperature abm approach for multiple fish species in river rehabilitation applications of the framework in the xjb reservoir with e flows were derived for the conservation of multiple fish species with different spawning patterns including m asiaticus a dabryanus c guichenoti h molitrix and their combinations in two hydropower plan scenarios and were found to be beneficial for increasing the probability of river restoration success moreover our study showed that the habitat quality of fish that produce drifting eggs strongly depends on drifting passage quality with only certain ratios of both habitat benefits achieving high recovery potential of fish population density with this predictive index the framework is suited to set quantitative benchmarks to assess river restoration success when facing hydropower development and climate change credit authorship contribution statement peng zhang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft qingyuan liu

3003,in this study for the first time the changes in relevant hydraulic parameters e g hydraulic conductivity effective porosity and dispersivity induced by the introduction of graphene in a calcareous sandy soil and a siliciclastic riverine soil were monitored and modelled via leaching column experiments column experiments were also run with traditional soil improvers compost biochar and zeolite to compare the changes induced by graphene versus well studied soil improvers constant pressure head tests were used to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of each column while leaching experiments were run to estimate porosity and specific retention and for each treatment three replicates were done columns were then run in saturated conditions via a low flow peristaltic pump and monitored for electrical conductivity temperature and chloride cxtfit 2 0 was employed to inversely model the column experiments and retrieve parameters like effective porosity longitudinal dispersivity bulk thermal diffusivity and thermal retardation factor results highlighted small changes of hydraulic conductivity porosity and effective porosity induced by graphene addition as well as by the other soil improvers for both soils a marked increase nearly 20 of specific retention values was instead recorded in the amended columns with respect to control ones chloride breakthrough curves modelling showed that graphene doubled dispersivity in the calcareous sandy soil 5 82 1 4 cm compared to the control 2 6 0 29 cm while it halved dispersivity in the siliciclastic riverine soil 0 31 0 05 cm with respect to the control 0 65 0 06 cm thermal retardation factors were decreased by graphene by approximately 20 for both soils the model fitting via tds derived from the electrical conductivity monitoring produced unreliable dispersivity values in most of the experiments due to the nonconservative nature of this parameter compared to chloride the results highlight that graphene affected dispersivity but did not significantly alter other physical parameters relevant for solutes transport in sandy soils in comparison to classical improvers thus future studies should focus on the graphene s effects on nutrients and agrochemicals leaching in unsaturated flow conditions keywords column experiment solute transport soil improver breakthrough curve dispersivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hydraulic properties of a soil are strongly influenced by its texture and structure which also determine the soil porosity lai and ren 2016 soil porosity and pore size distribution is very dynamic and can be altered by anthropogenic activities such as the addition of organic and inorganic improvers to the soil badorreck et al 2012 indeed the application of these materials to soils can have a large impact upon their hydraulic and solute transport parameters igalavithana et al 2017 abel et al 2013 the application of biochar on sandy soils for example can improve pore size distribution increasing the number of meso and micro pores and decreasing the number of macropores dokoohaki et al 2017 which in turn change the soil hydraulic conductivity ibrahim and horton 2021 on the other hand compost application in sandy soils characterized by low organic matter content can have a positive impact on soil fertility and on soil properties shiralipour et al 1992 compost addition can also alter soil hydro physical properties changing size form number and distribution of soil pores fischer and glaser 2012 and can improve soil water retention gonzalez and cooperband 2002 likewise the addition of zeolites in sandy soils can improve the soil water content and change the pore size distribution reducing the number of large pores and increasing the number of small pores ibrahim and alghamdi 2021 given the ability of these materials to alter soil hydro physical properties it is essential to test new materials such as the engineered carbonaceous material ecm in controlled laboratory conditions to foresee improvements or drawbacks of their potential application to the soil in the open field graphene for example is an ecm designed as bidimensional carbon atoms monolayers novoselov 2011 with peculiar and very promising properties facure et al 2020 which has found application in different fields like medicine with drug delivery and tumor therapy song et al 2020 or electronics within optoelectronic devices and transistors kusmartsev et al 2015 and desalination membranes mortazavi et al 2020 among many other emerging fields the graphene manufacturing industry has seen a dramatic expansion over the last decade tabish et al 2018 and it is expected to further increase via non expensive production methods rabia et al 2020 the massive use of graphene in various compartments of the hi tech global economy will likely create large graphene based wastes da costa and hussain 2020 thus there is a strong push to find new ways to introduce such new wastes into the circular and sustainable economy korhonen et al 2018 to assess graphene s potential to be introduced in a circular and green economy chain graphene was tested as soil improver due to its good adsorption capacity and thus its potential to retain nutrients goodwin et al 2018 in fact graphene based materials like hybrid foam of graphene and carbon nanotubes have been proved to be effective in organic compounds removal from water dong et al 2012 as well as reduced graphene oxide coated cotton sun et al 2014 or functionalized graphene aerogels wang et al 2020 moreover graphene has remarkable hydrophobic and oleophilic properties so that it is used in treatment plants to remove organic pollutants from wastewater thakur and kandasubramanian 2019 while the use of graphene mixed in sandy layers or walls in agricultural landscapes to retain organic agrochemicals like pesticides was demonstrated in laboratory batch experiments gupta et al 2012 still little is known on possible variations of the hydraulic properties induced by graphene incorporation into soils and subsoils he et al 2017 for instance sandy soils are known for their low water holding capacity associated with a low fertility reichert et al 2016 being usually poor in organic matter and nutrients el naggar et al 2015 thus the application of soil improvers organic and inorganic can increase their water retention capacity abel et al 2013 nakhli et al 2017 and alter their physical properties like hydraulic conductivity dispersivity or effective porosity fetter et al 2018 sudicky 1986 although many studies have focused on the effects of compost biochar and zeolite on the physical properties of soils basso et al 2013 colombani et al 2014 siedt et al 2020 studies on graphene effects on porous media are rare and often focused on the graphene oxide mobility rather than on the changes induced in the porous medium properties chen et al 2018 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2016 beyond the peculiar characteristics of graphene listed above what distinguishes graphene from the other materials of this study is the extreme difference in bulk density graphene has an extremely low bulk density iqbal and abdala 2013 and this could guarantee similar performance to other materials but with the use of a significantly lower amount in addition the decrease in the dry bulk density of a soil can change the shape and the distribution of the soil pores increasing the number of small pores and decreasing that of large pores resulting in a reduction of the hydraulic conductivity assouline 2006 assouline 2005 in view of the lack of studies on graphene impact on soil hydraulic and transport parameters in this study traditional soil improvers compost biochar and natural zeolite and an innovative one graphene were tested and compared using both a calcareous sandy soil and a siliciclastic riverine soil specifically the aim of the study was to quantify the variations of the hydraulic properties of sandy soils induced by the addition of graphene in saturated soil column experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study materials a calcareous sandy soil hereinafter referred to as α and a siliciclastic riverine soil hereinafter referred to as β were selected for this study table 1 the grain size was determined via wet and dry sieving methods the calcareous soil α was a coarse sandy soil while the siliciclastic soil β was a medium fine sandy soil both soils had low soil organic carbon soc percentage α 0 55 β 0 48 the soil improvers were purchased from commercial manufacturers and their raw composition is reported in table 2 as described in the technical sheet provided by each manufacturer compost was a cow manure vermicompost with a medium sandy texture with a soc of 36 7 and a dry bulk density dbd of 0 7 g cm3 zeolite was a mix of clinoptilolite and mordenite 67 5 and 32 5 respectively with a clayey texture very low soc 0

production of hydrocarbons cleaning filter high soc 99 0 and extremely low dbd 0 01 g cm3 the mixtures of the calcareous soil α with graphene compost biochar and zeolite have been named αg αc αb and αz respectively while the mixture of the siliciclastic soil β with graphene compost biochar and zeolite have been named βg βc βb and βz respectively 2 2 experimental design experiments on soil columns were performed in saturated regime since they are typically used to reproduce subsoils and aquifer conditions lewis and sjöstrom 2010 in addition the use of saturated columns is the most accredited method for calculating saturated hydraulic conductivity and other physical parameters younes et al 2017 in this study a comparison among different treatments was performed thus the column experiments were carried out under the same flow regime transparent acrylic columns 50 cm height and 5 cm internal diameter were employed to run the tracer breakthrough curve btc experiments fig 1 high density polyethylene chambers were installed in both column s inlet and outlet to uniform the flux and to prevent washing of finer grains the chambers contain a hdpe pierced disc and a 50 µm nitex mesh in contact with the soil the column s filling was done via 1 2 cm soil additions and each addition was packed with a teflon piston before the next one was placed on top the packed columns were completely saturated with distilled water and flushed via a peristaltic pump for at least 100 pore volumes water needed to completely saturate the column s pore space to eliminate unwanted contaminants and attain saturated conditions the flow direction was upward to prevent the formation of trapped gas bubbles each column was weighted before and after each experiment to check the column saturation degree never finding any appreciable difference effluents were drained from the columns via a 2 mm internal diameter tube through a flow cell equipped with a temperature and ec probe for continuous monitoring the probe was calibrated using standard solutions at the beginning and at the end of each tracer test the effluent drained under gravity into conical flasks placed below the base of the columns to preserve saturation and decrease the risk of air bubbles formation samples were taken from the conical flasks at constant time intervals and filtered with a 0 45 µm polypropylene filter constant pressure head tests were used to calculate the hydraulic conductivity k of each column two controls and eight amended columns an additional experiment was set up to quantify the soil specific water retention sr and the porosity θ using small columns of 10 cm height and 5 cm internal diameter replicated three times the materials and the design of these smaller columns were the same for the 50 cm columns but they were entirely filled with the mixture of the soils α and β and the improvers fig 1 the 10 cm columns were fully saturated from below and then let drain under atmospheric pressure for 48 h to reach the field capacity 2 3 analysis online parameters on the leaching solutions were determined with a ltc m10 c80 solinst level logger which has a platinum resistance temperature detector with a resolution of 0 003 c and an accuracy of 0 05 c a 4 electrode platinum conductivity cell for ec measurements with a resolution of 0 1 µs cm and an accuracy of 15 µs cm and an internal datalogger to store the acquired data the ltc m10 c80 was placed in a conical polypropylene cell 115 mm of height and 30 mm of diameter placed next to the column s outflow and set to record every 1 s to obtain an almost continuous btc the ec µs cm data were converted into total dissolved solids tds with standard conversion factors american public health association apha 2017 chloride cl was determined by an ion chromatography ics 1000 dionex equipped with an isocratic dual pump at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min using an ionpac as14a 4x250 mm column equipped with a pre column and an asrs ultra 4 mm self suppressor with 9 mm sodium carbonate eluent an as 40 dionex autosampler was employed to run the analysis quality control qc samples were run every ten samples the detection limit was 50 μg l for cl the liquid phase used to run the btc experiments was deionized water ec 15 2 µs cm ph 6 8 0 01 orp 150 10 mv which can be considered a good proxy of rainwater comparison of the aforementioned parameters between control only soil and the mixtures soil improver were done with statistical multiple sample comparison one way anova computed with statgraphics v 18 2 4 transport models to quantify the dispersive solute transport in the packed columns the transport behaviour of a conservative tracer cl was simulated using cxtfit 2 1 toride et al 1999 a one dimensional solute transport model included in the graphical user interface stanmod van genuchten et al 2012 the transport behaviour of solutes and heat were described using the classical form of the advection dispersion equation ade with linear retardation eq 1 1 c t d 2 c x 2 v c x r c 2 r 1 ρ b k d θ e where c ml 3 denotes solute concentrations as a function of distance l and time t t d l2t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient v lt 1 is the average porewater velocity θe l3l 3 is the effective porosity r is the linear retardation factor ρb ml 3 is the dry bulk density and k d l3m 1 is the solid liquid distribution coefficient the effective porosity θe was calculated via the formula 3 θ e q s v where qs lt 1 is the specific flow rate which is the volumetric flow divided by the area of the column measured at the column outlet the dispersion coefficient d l2t 1 provides a measure of solute spreading and can be extrapolated by 4 d v λ l d m where λl l is the longitudinal dispersivity and dm l2t 1 is the effective diffusion coefficient of the solute in porewater which for sandy soils is approximately 1 2 10 5 cm2 s latrille and zoia 2011 thus λl can be obtained knowing d and v the ade was solved by the code cxtfit 2 1 in estimation mode to fit observed cl concentrations the inverse problem is solved in cxtfit 2 1 by minimizing an objective function that consists of the sum of the squared differences between observed and fitted concentrations the objective function is minimized using a nonlinear least squares inversion method to constrain the estimates of the upper and lower parameter values the inverse model output provides useful model performance parameters like the coefficient of determination r2 from the regression of observed and calculated values as well as the standard error coefficient among observed and calculated values the same was done with the temperature following the analogy between solute and heat transport in which the thermal diffusivity coefficient can be estimated and then subtracted to the mechanical dispersion coefficient to derive the dispersivity values this can be done under the assumption of constant fluid density and viscosity which is considered to be valid when the maximum temperature difference across the simulation domain is 15 c ma and zheng 2010 in the heat transport model thermal equilibrium between fluid and solid acts as retardation factor i and causes the temperature front to move slower than the average linear flow velocity a linear sorption isotherm is used as for solutes in which the thermal retardation rt is given by 5 r t 1 ρ b k dt θ e where kdt l3m 1 is the thermal distribution coefficient defined as 6 k dt c s c f ρ f where ρf ml 3 is the density of the fluid cs l2t 2θ 1 and cf l2t 2θ 1 are the specific heat capacity of the solid and the fluid respectively the bulk thermal diffusivity dt l2t 1 which is equivalent to dm in equation 4 is defined as 7 d t λ b θ e c f ρ f with 8 λ b θ e λ f 1 θ e λ s where λb mlt 3θ 1 is the bulk thermal conductivity defined by λf and λs mlt 3θ 1 which are the thermal conductivities of the fluid and solid phases respectively alternatively dt can be quantified experimentally via equation 4 once λl has been determined with an independent btc with a solute tracer like cl 3 results 3 1 changes in soil properties induced by graphene and other soil improvers hydraulic conductivity k did not vary appreciably among different treatments fig 2 for both soils α and β k values showed relatively large standard deviation values since k is a parameter easily influenced by the arrangement of the pore space which can be relatively different among columns replicates filled via dry packing technique lewis and sjöstrom 2010 despite this limitation k values showed an average value of approximately 4 10 4 m s which is typical for sandy soils cronican and gribb 2004 domenico and schwartz 1990 θ values were higher for the calcareous soil α 0 35 0 02 than for the siliciclastic soil β 0 30 0 01 showing typical values for sandy soils heath 1983 in general θ was not affected by the addition of improvers at the rates here employed with no significant differences among treatments and controls sr plots indicate a marked increase of the mean sr values for all the improvers respect to both controls α and β in the calcareous soil α the increase in sr due to the addition of the improvers was more evident the most significant difference from the α control was found for the column amended with compost αc followed by the ones amended with biochar graphene and zeolite αβ αg and αz respectively for the siliciclastic soil β the column amended with graphene βg showed the biggest increase in sr followed by the ones amended with zeolite compost and biochar βz βc and βb respectively moreover the addition of the improvers increased the variability of sr in all columns with respect to both soils α and β with compost and zeolite showing the widest ranges large error bars it should be stressed that the different sr values found in this additional experiment would be hardly noticeable in the long column experiments designed to quantify the changes in hydraulic properties of the whole soil column 3 2 modelling of the chloride breakthrough curves the main difference among the α and β columns as regard the modelled cl btcs is the spreading of the centre of mass which is much more pronounced in all the α columns respect to the β columns fig 4 this was likely due to the heterogeneous grain size distribution of the α soil respect to β soil denoted by a higher cu table 1 which increased the mechanical dispersion in α indeed because the solutes move in the pore spaces the curve s spreading is related to the size distribution of the pores and to their connectivity as well as to the tortuosity gerke and van genuchten 1993 mahmoodlu et al 2021 conversely the transport processes in the β columns were advection dominated with self sharpening btcs resembling a plug flow injection in any case the visual match between the calculated and observed concentrations in all the btcs was satisfactory as also pointed out by the elevated r2 reported in table 3 just the αb model showed a less satisfactory fit due to early tailing of the observed cl concentrations respect of the modelled ones also highlighted by a relatively high standard error of the estimate for both longitudinal dispersivity λl and effective porosity θe this was due to local changes in k induced by the high cu value of biochar table 1 λl in αg was nearly doubled compared to its control α while in βg it was halved compared to its control β thus in well sorted soils as β the effect of graphene was to decrease the btcs spreading while in poorly sorted soil as α the effect was the opposite graphene had the maximum impact on λl respect to the classical soil improvers despite the small amount employed respect to the others table 2 in βb the heterogeneous grain size distribution of biochar table 1 had the effect of increasing λl in the well sorted β matrix θe remains mostly unaltered in the amended columns respect to their controls only in αc and αb an increase was recorded while βb showed a decrease in θe 3 3 modelling of the tds breakthrough curves the tds values were also employed to estimate λl and θe table 4 via a simpler approach compared to the cl btcs but the values did not agree with the ones retrieved using cl or the model fit was unsatisfactory due to cation exchange reactions that induced tailing of the tds btcs as already demonstrated both in laboratory mastrocicco et al 2011 and field experiments mccarter and price 2017 for instance fig 5 shows that for βb and βc columns the bulging observed in the falling limb of the tds btcs was not perfectly captured from modelled btcs fitted with observed tds data the obtained λl were consistently higher than the ones found using cl especially for αb and βb since inorganic ashes in biochar once hydrated release a large quantity of carbonates in solution alessandrino et al 2022 the release of carbonates increased the ionic strength which in turn changed the electrical conductivity making it a non conservative tracer for this reason the tracer test was altered by the dissolution of carbonates in α and especially in αb where the long tail of the btc produced an overestimation of λl also characterized by a relatively high standard error of the estimate this behaviour became clear in the β columns where βb compared to the other columns had a pronounced curve tailing due to carbonates dissolution from biochar θe values were in general consistent with the ones retrieved using cl besides this parameter was less affected than λl with a general reduction of 10 in comparison to the btcs calibrated versus cl concentrations 3 4 modelling of the temperature breakthrough curves the set up of this experiment was in local thermal equilibrium lte so all the issues related to the local thermal nonequilibrium ltne were negligible gossler et al 2020 fig 6 shows the modelled and observed temperature btcs in α and β controls and in the columns amended with the different improvers r2 reported in table 5 shows that model fit in all the btcs was excellent and significant given with low standard error of estimates the difference in the spreading of the centre of mass among the α and β temperature btcs was not as elevated as for the cl btcs graphene addition showed contrasting behaviour also in heat transport processes in fact while the αg btc was similar in shape to the control the βg btc was self sharpening as highlighted by a very low value of dt on the other hand biochar addition led to an increase in dt for the column αb as testified by the evident spreading of the αb btc the rt values retrieved via inverse modelling table 5 highlight that graphene slightly increased the heat transfer capacity in both porous matrices with a rt decrease of approximately 20 compared to the control columns α and β all the other rt values were substantially similar to the controls except for βb which exhibited a slightly lower rt 4 discussion in the two sandy soils α and β tested in this study there were no significant changes in parameters driving the water leaching rate like k and θ due to the addition of the different soil improvers the only exception was represented by biochar addition that increased k values for both soils however due to the large standard deviation the increase was not statistically significant fig 2 the recent literature points to a decrease of k when biochar is added to sandy soils esmaeelnejad et al 2017 because of the bimodal particle size distribution in the sand biochar mixture resulting in denser packing and increased tortuosity liu et al 2016 this happens especially when biochar is grinded and in high proportion with respect to the soil while k is not affected when biochar is added with the same amount used in this study zhang et al 2016 concerning graphene s addition which is the main focus of this study it could be derived that sandy soils amended with graphene should not experience clogging at the specific packing and application rates used in this study despite the very fine texture of this improver table 1 this was also confirmed by the fact that θ values have not changed compared to those of the controls for both α and β soils fig 3 it should be stressed that only a fifth of each column was filled with the mixture of improvers and α or β soils while the remaining four fifths were filled with pure α or β soil fig 1 this experimental arrangement reduced the impact of the improvers over the soil column in eventually changing both k and θ but it also provided a more realistic estimate of the real impact over the upper portion of the soil first 50 cm where agricultural practices are more intense and crops roots generally develop with the highest density de león gonzález et al 2007 on the other hand additional experiments using small columns 10 cm length entirely filled with improvers and soils mixtures showed a slight but statistically relevant increase of sr in the amended columns compared to the controls α and β fig 3 this behaviour can be considered positive since sandy soils benefit from an increase in sr that could help to increase the water content in particular the results highlight that graphene αg and βg in fig 3 can effectively increase the capacity of sandy soils to retain the porewater even if the quantity used respect to other improvers is very small table 2 to quantify the eventual variation of the dispersive solute transport parameters in the amended columns respect to the control ones α and β the btcs of chloride tds and temperature were modelled and compared the results showed that the classical soil improvers compost biochar and zeolites did not significantly alter the soil hydraulic parameters except for biochar that largely affected θe in both αb and βb columns with a marked increase in αb and a marked decrease in βb table 3 and 4 thus the interconnected pore space increased with the addition of biochar in the α matrix since both biochar and α were poorly sorted esmaeelnejad et al 2017 conversely biochar addition to β decreased the retention time in the column this behaviour was likely due to the different cu values of the two media on the other hand mechanical dispersion was affected by graphene in a contrasting way diminishing or augmenting solutes mixing depending on the grain size distribution of the porous matrix tables 3 and 4 in fact in the poorly sorted α column graphene introduction increased the mixing of solutes and thus λl given that λl is directly proportional to cu xu and eckstein 1997 conversely in the well sorted β column graphene incorporation decreased solute s mixing which in turn diminished λl since in soils characterized by cu 2 the median grain size is directly proportional to λl xu and eckstein 1997 thus the decrease of the soil median grain size induced by graphene incorporation led to a λl decrease as regard the model of the chloride btc the fitting was slightly better in the β column than in α column due to its higher homogeneity moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 a better fit would have been achieved via dual domain physical non equilibrium model instead of ade liu and kitanidis 2012 but applying the general principle of parsimony in numerical modelling ade still satisfactorily captured the btcs behaviour in the different columns moreover considering the transport parameter θe which affects the velocity of the solutes centre of mass this was relatively unaffected by graphene in both αg and βg columns while biochar largely affected θe in both αb and βb columns with a marked increase in αb and a marked decrease in βb the results were significant given the low standard error of the estimates for both columns table 3 the use of ec values converted into tds concentrations to monitor the btcs is very attractive because of the low analytical cost the online continuous monitoring capability and the sporadic need of calibration nevertheless the use of such a simple procedure in complex matrices like the ones here employed produced btcs with average travel times similar to the ones retrieved for the chloride btcs but with larger spreading around the centre of mass this allowed to retrieve θe values similar to the ones of the chloride btcs but λl values larger than the ones obtained via the chloride btcs in any case this study shows that it is not prudent to use ec or tds values to calibrate solute transport models in sandy soils despite their low cost and continuous acquisition via electrochemical dataloggers or at least some concomitant multi tracer btcs should be run using also nonreactive species to quantify the eventual bias related to continuous ec or tds monitoring the analysis of the thermal btcs showed that graphene behaved differently from the classical soil improvers here tested decreasing the rt values with respect to control columns again this is particularly interesting given the low amount of graphene used in the mixed layer 10 cm and this is related to the very high λs of graphene prasher 2010 it could be noticed that the difference of dt values among α and β control columns was not negligible table 5 this was likely due to the higher λs of quartz which was the predominant mineral phase in the siliciclastic soil β respect to calcite and dolomite minerals dominating the calcareous soil α clauser and huenges 1995 despite the different type of minerals present in α and β graphene was capable to accelerate the heat transport even if a low amount was employed compared to the other soil improvers table 2 but to quantify whether this aspect could be relevant in environmental conditions further studies should be completed using different amounts of graphene variable flow velocities and heat inputs this study highlights that graphene could be reused as improver in sandy soils at the rate of 30 kg ha without significantly impact on both k and θ while increasing sr these results are relevant from an environmental perspective since the recycling of graphene as soil improver need to be assessed before its eventual employment in the environment as recently emphasised via batch experiments alessandrino et al 2022 it is still difficult to predict graphene positive adverse effects in environment systems he et al 2017 so study like this can represent small steps that added together will pave the way for new knowledge on the effects of this material on soils for example graphene is not cytotoxic unlike graphene oxide ahmed and rodrigues 2013 chen et al 2015 nevertheless graphene could promote plant flowering but also interfere with n fixation in leguminosae wang et al 2017 for this reason the characterization of graphene is essential to discriminate whether such engineered nanomaterial could be potentially reused and recycled within a green economy chain in addition it has been proven that graphene application to soil could increase short time microbial enzyme activity and bacterial biomass which in turn increase the pollutants removal rate ren et al 2015 moreover if graphene would be used to construct reactive walls or layers their efficiency for the retention of organic pollutants would be retained zhao et al 2018 and this could be a starting point for future experiments another interesting aspect is the role of organic matter in the migration of graphene in the soil organic matter indeed can be used as an adsorption transport carrier for graphene reducing its dispersion in the environment chen et al 2019 despite some potential positive aspects graphene can have negative effects on the growth of some plants of agricultural interest such as tomato red spinach and lettuce begum et al 2011 thus there is the need to further investigate the fate and transport of graphene in the environment from a multidisciplinary point of view 5 conclusions in this study graphene addition to calcareous and siliciclastic sandy soils was monitored modelled and compared to the addition of other improvers compost biochar and zeolite via saturated column experiments to assess the eventual changes in the hydraulic parameters while hydraulic conductivity porosity and effective porosity were relatively unaffected by graphene and classical soil improvers given the large proportion of pristine soils in the experimental set up specific retention longitudinal dispersivity and thermal retardation were highly altered by the introduction of graphene graphene s addition led to an increase in specific retention which in turn increases the capacity of sandy soils to retain the porewater in the poorly sorted calcareous soil longitudinal dispersivity doubled respect to control while in the well sorted siliciclastic soil it halved despite the very low amount of graphene employed also thermal retardation was affected by graphene with a reduction of approximately 20 in both soil columns allowing a faster heat transfer in the subsurface based on these results future studies should investigate the role of graphene on leaching water quality in both saturated and unsaturated soils credit authorship

3003,in this study for the first time the changes in relevant hydraulic parameters e g hydraulic conductivity effective porosity and dispersivity induced by the introduction of graphene in a calcareous sandy soil and a siliciclastic riverine soil were monitored and modelled via leaching column experiments column experiments were also run with traditional soil improvers compost biochar and zeolite to compare the changes induced by graphene versus well studied soil improvers constant pressure head tests were used to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of each column while leaching experiments were run to estimate porosity and specific retention and for each treatment three replicates were done columns were then run in saturated conditions via a low flow peristaltic pump and monitored for electrical conductivity temperature and chloride cxtfit 2 0 was employed to inversely model the column experiments and retrieve parameters like effective porosity longitudinal dispersivity bulk thermal diffusivity and thermal retardation factor results highlighted small changes of hydraulic conductivity porosity and effective porosity induced by graphene addition as well as by the other soil improvers for both soils a marked increase nearly 20 of specific retention values was instead recorded in the amended columns with respect to control ones chloride breakthrough curves modelling showed that graphene doubled dispersivity in the calcareous sandy soil 5 82 1 4 cm compared to the control 2 6 0 29 cm while it halved dispersivity in the siliciclastic riverine soil 0 31 0 05 cm with respect to the control 0 65 0 06 cm thermal retardation factors were decreased by graphene by approximately 20 for both soils the model fitting via tds derived from the electrical conductivity monitoring produced unreliable dispersivity values in most of the experiments due to the nonconservative nature of this parameter compared to chloride the results highlight that graphene affected dispersivity but did not significantly alter other physical parameters relevant for solutes transport in sandy soils in comparison to classical improvers thus future studies should focus on the graphene s effects on nutrients and agrochemicals leaching in unsaturated flow conditions keywords column experiment solute transport soil improver breakthrough curve dispersivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hydraulic properties of a soil are strongly influenced by its texture and structure which also determine the soil porosity lai and ren 2016 soil porosity and pore size distribution is very dynamic and can be altered by anthropogenic activities such as the addition of organic and inorganic improvers to the soil badorreck et al 2012 indeed the application of these materials to soils can have a large impact upon their hydraulic and solute transport parameters igalavithana et al 2017 abel et al 2013 the application of biochar on sandy soils for example can improve pore size distribution increasing the number of meso and micro pores and decreasing the number of macropores dokoohaki et al 2017 which in turn change the soil hydraulic conductivity ibrahim and horton 2021 on the other hand compost application in sandy soils characterized by low organic matter content can have a positive impact on soil fertility and on soil properties shiralipour et al 1992 compost addition can also alter soil hydro physical properties changing size form number and distribution of soil pores fischer and glaser 2012 and can improve soil water retention gonzalez and cooperband 2002 likewise the addition of zeolites in sandy soils can improve the soil water content and change the pore size distribution reducing the number of large pores and increasing the number of small pores ibrahim and alghamdi 2021 given the ability of these materials to alter soil hydro physical properties it is essential to test new materials such as the engineered carbonaceous material ecm in controlled laboratory conditions to foresee improvements or drawbacks of their potential application to the soil in the open field graphene for example is an ecm designed as bidimensional carbon atoms monolayers novoselov 2011 with peculiar and very promising properties facure et al 2020 which has found application in different fields like medicine with drug delivery and tumor therapy song et al 2020 or electronics within optoelectronic devices and transistors kusmartsev et al 2015 and desalination membranes mortazavi et al 2020 among many other emerging fields the graphene manufacturing industry has seen a dramatic expansion over the last decade tabish et al 2018 and it is expected to further increase via non expensive production methods rabia et al 2020 the massive use of graphene in various compartments of the hi tech global economy will likely create large graphene based wastes da costa and hussain 2020 thus there is a strong push to find new ways to introduce such new wastes into the circular and sustainable economy korhonen et al 2018 to assess graphene s potential to be introduced in a circular and green economy chain graphene was tested as soil improver due to its good adsorption capacity and thus its potential to retain nutrients goodwin et al 2018 in fact graphene based materials like hybrid foam of graphene and carbon nanotubes have been proved to be effective in organic compounds removal from water dong et al 2012 as well as reduced graphene oxide coated cotton sun et al 2014 or functionalized graphene aerogels wang et al 2020 moreover graphene has remarkable hydrophobic and oleophilic properties so that it is used in treatment plants to remove organic pollutants from wastewater thakur and kandasubramanian 2019 while the use of graphene mixed in sandy layers or walls in agricultural landscapes to retain organic agrochemicals like pesticides was demonstrated in laboratory batch experiments gupta et al 2012 still little is known on possible variations of the hydraulic properties induced by graphene incorporation into soils and subsoils he et al 2017 for instance sandy soils are known for their low water holding capacity associated with a low fertility reichert et al 2016 being usually poor in organic matter and nutrients el naggar et al 2015 thus the application of soil improvers organic and inorganic can increase their water retention capacity abel et al 2013 nakhli et al 2017 and alter their physical properties like hydraulic conductivity dispersivity or effective porosity fetter et al 2018 sudicky 1986 although many studies have focused on the effects of compost biochar and zeolite on the physical properties of soils basso et al 2013 colombani et al 2014 siedt et al 2020 studies on graphene effects on porous media are rare and often focused on the graphene oxide mobility rather than on the changes induced in the porous medium properties chen et al 2018 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2016 beyond the peculiar characteristics of graphene listed above what distinguishes graphene from the other materials of this study is the extreme difference in bulk density graphene has an extremely low bulk density iqbal and abdala 2013 and this could guarantee similar performance to other materials but with the use of a significantly lower amount in addition the decrease in the dry bulk density of a soil can change the shape and the distribution of the soil pores increasing the number of small pores and decreasing that of large pores resulting in a reduction of the hydraulic conductivity assouline 2006 assouline 2005 in view of the lack of studies on graphene impact on soil hydraulic and transport parameters in this study traditional soil improvers compost biochar and natural zeolite and an innovative one graphene were tested and compared using both a calcareous sandy soil and a siliciclastic riverine soil specifically the aim of the study was to quantify the variations of the hydraulic properties of sandy soils induced by the addition of graphene in saturated soil column experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study materials a calcareous sandy soil hereinafter referred to as α and a siliciclastic riverine soil hereinafter referred to as β were selected for this study table 1 the grain size was determined via wet and dry sieving methods the calcareous soil α was a coarse sandy soil while the siliciclastic soil β was a medium fine sandy soil both soils had low soil organic carbon soc percentage α 0 55 β 0 48 the soil improvers were purchased from commercial manufacturers and their raw composition is reported in table 2 as described in the technical sheet provided by each manufacturer compost was a cow manure vermicompost with a medium sandy texture with a soc of 36 7 and a dry bulk density dbd of 0 7 g cm3 zeolite was a mix of clinoptilolite and mordenite 67 5 and 32 5 respectively with a clayey texture very low soc 0

production of hydrocarbons cleaning filter high soc 99 0 and extremely low dbd 0 01 g cm3 the mixtures of the calcareous soil α with graphene compost biochar and zeolite have been named αg αc αb and αz respectively while the mixture of the siliciclastic soil β with graphene compost biochar and zeolite have been named βg βc βb and βz respectively 2 2 experimental design experiments on soil columns were performed in saturated regime since they are typically used to reproduce subsoils and aquifer conditions lewis and sjöstrom 2010 in addition the use of saturated columns is the most accredited method for calculating saturated hydraulic conductivity and other physical parameters younes et al 2017 in this study a comparison among different treatments was performed thus the column experiments were carried out under the same flow regime transparent acrylic columns 50 cm height and 5 cm internal diameter were employed to run the tracer breakthrough curve btc experiments fig 1 high density polyethylene chambers were installed in both column s inlet and outlet to uniform the flux and to prevent washing of finer grains the chambers contain a hdpe pierced disc and a 50 µm nitex mesh in contact with the soil the column s filling was done via 1 2 cm soil additions and each addition was packed with a teflon piston before the next one was placed on top the packed columns were completely saturated with distilled water and flushed via a peristaltic pump for at least 100 pore volumes water needed to completely saturate the column s pore space to eliminate unwanted contaminants and attain saturated conditions the flow direction was upward to prevent the formation of trapped gas bubbles each column was weighted before and after each experiment to check the column saturation degree never finding any appreciable difference effluents were drained from the columns via a 2 mm internal diameter tube through a flow cell equipped with a temperature and ec probe for continuous monitoring the probe was calibrated using standard solutions at the beginning and at the end of each tracer test the effluent drained under gravity into conical flasks placed below the base of the columns to preserve saturation and decrease the risk of air bubbles formation samples were taken from the conical flasks at constant time intervals and filtered with a 0 45 µm polypropylene filter constant pressure head tests were used to calculate the hydraulic conductivity k of each column two controls and eight amended columns an additional experiment was set up to quantify the soil specific water retention sr and the porosity θ using small columns of 10 cm height and 5 cm internal diameter replicated three times the materials and the design of these smaller columns were the same for the 50 cm columns but they were entirely filled with the mixture of the soils α and β and the improvers fig 1 the 10 cm columns were fully saturated from below and then let drain under atmospheric pressure for 48 h to reach the field capacity 2 3 analysis online parameters on the leaching solutions were determined with a ltc m10 c80 solinst level logger which has a platinum resistance temperature detector with a resolution of 0 003 c and an accuracy of 0 05 c a 4 electrode platinum conductivity cell for ec measurements with a resolution of 0 1 µs cm and an accuracy of 15 µs cm and an internal datalogger to store the acquired data the ltc m10 c80 was placed in a conical polypropylene cell 115 mm of height and 30 mm of diameter placed next to the column s outflow and set to record every 1 s to obtain an almost continuous btc the ec µs cm data were converted into total dissolved solids tds with standard conversion factors american public health association apha 2017 chloride cl was determined by an ion chromatography ics 1000 dionex equipped with an isocratic dual pump at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min using an ionpac as14a 4x250 mm column equipped with a pre column and an asrs ultra 4 mm self suppressor with 9 mm sodium carbonate eluent an as 40 dionex autosampler was employed to run the analysis quality control qc samples were run every ten samples the detection limit was 50 μg l for cl the liquid phase used to run the btc experiments was deionized water ec 15 2 µs cm ph 6 8 0 01 orp 150 10 mv which can be considered a good proxy of rainwater comparison of the aforementioned parameters between control only soil and the mixtures soil improver were done with statistical multiple sample comparison one way anova computed with statgraphics v 18 2 4 transport models to quantify the dispersive solute transport in the packed columns the transport behaviour of a conservative tracer cl was simulated using cxtfit 2 1 toride et al 1999 a one dimensional solute transport model included in the graphical user interface stanmod van genuchten et al 2012 the transport behaviour of solutes and heat were described using the classical form of the advection dispersion equation ade with linear retardation eq 1 1 c t d 2 c x 2 v c x r c 2 r 1 ρ b k d θ e where c ml 3 denotes solute concentrations as a function of distance l and time t t d l2t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient v lt 1 is the average porewater velocity θe l3l 3 is the effective porosity r is the linear retardation factor ρb ml 3 is the dry bulk density and k d l3m 1 is the solid liquid distribution coefficient the effective porosity θe was calculated via the formula 3 θ e q s v where qs lt 1 is the specific flow rate which is the volumetric flow divided by the area of the column measured at the column outlet the dispersion coefficient d l2t 1 provides a measure of solute spreading and can be extrapolated by 4 d v λ l d m where λl l is the longitudinal dispersivity and dm l2t 1 is the effective diffusion coefficient of the solute in porewater which for sandy soils is approximately 1 2 10 5 cm2 s latrille and zoia 2011 thus λl can be obtained knowing d and v the ade was solved by the code cxtfit 2 1 in estimation mode to fit observed cl concentrations the inverse problem is solved in cxtfit 2 1 by minimizing an objective function that consists of the sum of the squared differences between observed and fitted concentrations the objective function is minimized using a nonlinear least squares inversion method to constrain the estimates of the upper and lower parameter values the inverse model output provides useful model performance parameters like the coefficient of determination r2 from the regression of observed and calculated values as well as the standard error coefficient among observed and calculated values the same was done with the temperature following the analogy between solute and heat transport in which the thermal diffusivity coefficient can be estimated and then subtracted to the mechanical dispersion coefficient to derive the dispersivity values this can be done under the assumption of constant fluid density and viscosity which is considered to be valid when the maximum temperature difference across the simulation domain is 15 c ma and zheng 2010 in the heat transport model thermal equilibrium between fluid and solid acts as retardation factor i and causes the temperature front to move slower than the average linear flow velocity a linear sorption isotherm is used as for solutes in which the thermal retardation rt is given by 5 r t 1 ρ b k dt θ e where kdt l3m 1 is the thermal distribution coefficient defined as 6 k dt c s c f ρ f where ρf ml 3 is the density of the fluid cs l2t 2θ 1 and cf l2t 2θ 1 are the specific heat capacity of the solid and the fluid respectively the bulk thermal diffusivity dt l2t 1 which is equivalent to dm in equation 4 is defined as 7 d t λ b θ e c f ρ f with 8 λ b θ e λ f 1 θ e λ s where λb mlt 3θ 1 is the bulk thermal conductivity defined by λf and λs mlt 3θ 1 which are the thermal conductivities of the fluid and solid phases respectively alternatively dt can be quantified experimentally via equation 4 once λl has been determined with an independent btc with a solute tracer like cl 3 results 3 1 changes in soil properties induced by graphene and other soil improvers hydraulic conductivity k did not vary appreciably among different treatments fig 2 for both soils α and β k values showed relatively large standard deviation values since k is a parameter easily influenced by the arrangement of the pore space which can be relatively different among columns replicates filled via dry packing technique lewis and sjöstrom 2010 despite this limitation k values showed an average value of approximately 4 10 4 m s which is typical for sandy soils cronican and gribb 2004 domenico and schwartz 1990 θ values were higher for the calcareous soil α 0 35 0 02 than for the siliciclastic soil β 0 30 0 01 showing typical values for sandy soils heath 1983 in general θ was not affected by the addition of improvers at the rates here employed with no significant differences among treatments and controls sr plots indicate a marked increase of the mean sr values for all the improvers respect to both controls α and β in the calcareous soil α the increase in sr due to the addition of the improvers was more evident the most significant difference from the α control was found for the column amended with compost αc followed by the ones amended with biochar graphene and zeolite αβ αg and αz respectively for the siliciclastic soil β the column amended with graphene βg showed the biggest increase in sr followed by the ones amended with zeolite compost and biochar βz βc and βb respectively moreover the addition of the improvers increased the variability of sr in all columns with respect to both soils α and β with compost and zeolite showing the widest ranges large error bars it should be stressed that the different sr values found in this additional experiment would be hardly noticeable in the long column experiments designed to quantify the changes in hydraulic properties of the whole soil column 3 2 modelling of the chloride breakthrough curves the main difference among the α and β columns as regard the modelled cl btcs is the spreading of the centre of mass which is much more pronounced in all the α columns respect to the β columns fig 4 this was likely due to the heterogeneous grain size distribution of the α soil respect to β soil denoted by a higher cu table 1 which increased the mechanical dispersion in α indeed because the solutes move in the pore spaces the curve s spreading is related to the size distribution of the pores and to their connectivity as well as to the tortuosity gerke and van genuchten 1993 mahmoodlu et al 2021 conversely the transport processes in the β columns were advection dominated with self sharpening btcs resembling a plug flow injection in any case the visual match between the calculated and observed concentrations in all the btcs was satisfactory as also pointed out by the elevated r2 reported in table 3 just the αb model showed a less satisfactory fit due to early tailing of the observed cl concentrations respect of the modelled ones also highlighted by a relatively high standard error of the estimate for both longitudinal dispersivity λl and effective porosity θe this was due to local changes in k induced by the high cu value of biochar table 1 λl in αg was nearly doubled compared to its control α while in βg it was halved compared to its control β thus in well sorted soils as β the effect of graphene was to decrease the btcs spreading while in poorly sorted soil as α the effect was the opposite graphene had the maximum impact on λl respect to the classical soil improvers despite the small amount employed respect to the others table 2 in βb the heterogeneous grain size distribution of biochar table 1 had the effect of increasing λl in the well sorted β matrix θe remains mostly unaltered in the amended columns respect to their controls only in αc and αb an increase was recorded while βb showed a decrease in θe 3 3 modelling of the tds breakthrough curves the tds values were also employed to estimate λl and θe table 4 via a simpler approach compared to the cl btcs but the values did not agree with the ones retrieved using cl or the model fit was unsatisfactory due to cation exchange reactions that induced tailing of the tds btcs as already demonstrated both in laboratory mastrocicco et al 2011 and field experiments mccarter and price 2017 for instance fig 5 shows that for βb and βc columns the bulging observed in the falling limb of the tds btcs was not perfectly captured from modelled btcs fitted with observed tds data the obtained λl were consistently higher than the ones found using cl especially for αb and βb since inorganic ashes in biochar once hydrated release a large quantity of carbonates in solution alessandrino et al 2022 the release of carbonates increased the ionic strength which in turn changed the electrical conductivity making it a non conservative tracer for this reason the tracer test was altered by the dissolution of carbonates in α and especially in αb where the long tail of the btc produced an overestimation of λl also characterized by a relatively high standard error of the estimate this behaviour became clear in the β columns where βb compared to the other columns had a pronounced curve tailing due to carbonates dissolution from biochar θe values were in general consistent with the ones retrieved using cl besides this parameter was less affected than λl with a general reduction of 10 in comparison to the btcs calibrated versus cl concentrations 3 4 modelling of the temperature breakthrough curves the set up of this experiment was in local thermal equilibrium lte so all the issues related to the local thermal nonequilibrium ltne were negligible gossler et al 2020 fig 6 shows the modelled and observed temperature btcs in α and β controls and in the columns amended with the different improvers r2 reported in table 5 shows that model fit in all the btcs was excellent and significant given with low standard error of estimates the difference in the spreading of the centre of mass among the α and β temperature btcs was not as elevated as for the cl btcs graphene addition showed contrasting behaviour also in heat transport processes in fact while the αg btc was similar in shape to the control the βg btc was self sharpening as highlighted by a very low value of dt on the other hand biochar addition led to an increase in dt for the column αb as testified by the evident spreading of the αb btc the rt values retrieved via inverse modelling table 5 highlight that graphene slightly increased the heat transfer capacity in both porous matrices with a rt decrease of approximately 20 compared to the control columns α and β all the other rt values were substantially similar to the controls except for βb which exhibited a slightly lower rt 4 discussion in the two sandy soils α and β tested in this study there were no significant changes in parameters driving the water leaching rate like k and θ due to the addition of the different soil improvers the only exception was represented by biochar addition that increased k values for both soils however due to the large standard deviation the increase was not statistically significant fig 2 the recent literature points to a decrease of k when biochar is added to sandy soils esmaeelnejad et al 2017 because of the bimodal particle size distribution in the sand biochar mixture resulting in denser packing and increased tortuosity liu et al 2016 this happens especially when biochar is grinded and in high proportion with respect to the soil while k is not affected when biochar is added with the same amount used in this study zhang et al 2016 concerning graphene s addition which is the main focus of this study it could be derived that sandy soils amended with graphene should not experience clogging at the specific packing and application rates used in this study despite the very fine texture of this improver table 1 this was also confirmed by the fact that θ values have not changed compared to those of the controls for both α and β soils fig 3 it should be stressed that only a fifth of each column was filled with the mixture of improvers and α or β soils while the remaining four fifths were filled with pure α or β soil fig 1 this experimental arrangement reduced the impact of the improvers over the soil column in eventually changing both k and θ but it also provided a more realistic estimate of the real impact over the upper portion of the soil first 50 cm where agricultural practices are more intense and crops roots generally develop with the highest density de león gonzález et al 2007 on the other hand additional experiments using small columns 10 cm length entirely filled with improvers and soils mixtures showed a slight but statistically relevant increase of sr in the amended columns compared to the controls α and β fig 3 this behaviour can be considered positive since sandy soils benefit from an increase in sr that could help to increase the water content in particular the results highlight that graphene αg and βg in fig 3 can effectively increase the capacity of sandy soils to retain the porewater even if the quantity used respect to other improvers is very small table 2 to quantify the eventual variation of the dispersive solute transport parameters in the amended columns respect to the control ones α and β the btcs of chloride tds and temperature were modelled and compared the results showed that the classical soil improvers compost biochar and zeolites did not significantly alter the soil hydraulic parameters except for biochar that largely affected θe in both αb and βb columns with a marked increase in αb and a marked decrease in βb table 3 and 4 thus the interconnected pore space increased with the addition of biochar in the α matrix since both biochar and α were poorly sorted esmaeelnejad et al 2017 conversely biochar addition to β decreased the retention time in the column this behaviour was likely due to the different cu values of the two media on the other hand mechanical dispersion was affected by graphene in a contrasting way diminishing or augmenting solutes mixing depending on the grain size distribution of the porous matrix tables 3 and 4 in fact in the poorly sorted α column graphene introduction increased the mixing of solutes and thus λl given that λl is directly proportional to cu xu and eckstein 1997 conversely in the well sorted β column graphene incorporation decreased solute s mixing which in turn diminished λl since in soils characterized by cu 2 the median grain size is directly proportional to λl xu and eckstein 1997 thus the decrease of the soil median grain size induced by graphene incorporation led to a λl decrease as regard the model of the chloride btc the fitting was slightly better in the β column than in α column due to its higher homogeneity moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 a better fit would have been achieved via dual domain physical non equilibrium model instead of ade liu and kitanidis 2012 but applying the general principle of parsimony in numerical modelling ade still satisfactorily captured the btcs behaviour in the different columns moreover considering the transport parameter θe which affects the velocity of the solutes centre of mass this was relatively unaffected by graphene in both αg and βg columns while biochar largely affected θe in both αb and βb columns with a marked increase in αb and a marked decrease in βb the results were significant given the low standard error of the estimates for both columns table 3 the use of ec values converted into tds concentrations to monitor the btcs is very attractive because of the low analytical cost the online continuous monitoring capability and the sporadic need of calibration nevertheless the use of such a simple procedure in complex matrices like the ones here employed produced btcs with average travel times similar to the ones retrieved for the chloride btcs but with larger spreading around the centre of mass this allowed to retrieve θe values similar to the ones of the chloride btcs but λl values larger than the ones obtained via the chloride btcs in any case this study shows that it is not prudent to use ec or tds values to calibrate solute transport models in sandy soils despite their low cost and continuous acquisition via electrochemical dataloggers or at least some concomitant multi tracer btcs should be run using also nonreactive species to quantify the eventual bias related to continuous ec or tds monitoring the analysis of the thermal btcs showed that graphene behaved differently from the classical soil improvers here tested decreasing the rt values with respect to control columns again this is particularly interesting given the low amount of graphene used in the mixed layer 10 cm and this is related to the very high λs of graphene prasher 2010 it could be noticed that the difference of dt values among α and β control columns was not negligible table 5 this was likely due to the higher λs of quartz which was the predominant mineral phase in the siliciclastic soil β respect to calcite and dolomite minerals dominating the calcareous soil α clauser and huenges 1995 despite the different type of minerals present in α and β graphene was capable to accelerate the heat transport even if a low amount was employed compared to the other soil improvers table 2 but to quantify whether this aspect could be relevant in environmental conditions further studies should be completed using different amounts of graphene variable flow velocities and heat inputs this study highlights that graphene could be reused as improver in sandy soils at the rate of 30 kg ha without significantly impact on both k and θ while increasing sr these results are relevant from an environmental perspective since the recycling of graphene as soil improver need to be assessed before its eventual employment in the environment as recently emphasised via batch experiments alessandrino et al 2022 it is still difficult to predict graphene positive adverse effects in environment systems he et al 2017 so study like this can represent small steps that added together will pave the way for new knowledge on the effects of this material on soils for example graphene is not cytotoxic unlike graphene oxide ahmed and rodrigues 2013 chen et al 2015 nevertheless graphene could promote plant flowering but also interfere with n fixation in leguminosae wang et al 2017 for this reason the characterization of graphene is essential to discriminate whether such engineered nanomaterial could be potentially reused and recycled within a green economy chain in addition it has been proven that graphene application to soil could increase short time microbial enzyme activity and bacterial biomass which in turn increase the pollutants removal rate ren et al 2015 moreover if graphene would be used to construct reactive walls or layers their efficiency for the retention of organic pollutants would be retained zhao et al 2018 and this could be a starting point for future experiments another interesting aspect is the role of organic matter in the migration of graphene in the soil organic matter indeed can be used as an adsorption transport carrier for graphene reducing its dispersion in the environment chen et al 2019 despite some potential positive aspects graphene can have negative effects on the growth of some plants of agricultural interest such as tomato red spinach and lettuce begum et al 2011 thus there is the need to further investigate the fate and transport of graphene in the environment from a multidisciplinary point of view 5 conclusions in this study graphene addition to calcareous and siliciclastic sandy soils was monitored modelled and compared to the addition of other improvers compost biochar and zeolite via saturated column experiments to assess the eventual changes in the hydraulic parameters while hydraulic conductivity porosity and effective porosity were relatively unaffected by graphene and classical soil improvers given the large proportion of pristine soils in the experimental set up specific retention longitudinal dispersivity and thermal retardation were highly altered by the introduction of graphene graphene s addition led to an increase in specific retention which in turn increases the capacity of sandy soils to retain the porewater in the poorly sorted calcareous soil longitudinal dispersivity doubled respect to control while in the well sorted siliciclastic soil it halved despite the very low amount of graphene employed also thermal retardation was affected by graphene with a reduction of approximately 20 in both soil columns allowing a faster heat transfer in the subsurface based on these results future studies should investigate the role of graphene on leaching water quality in both saturated and unsaturated soils credit authorship

3004,the sticking efficiency α is a vital parameter to predict the transport and deposition of colloids in porous media the value of α depends on various factors such as the interaction energy between colloids and the solid water interface swi kinetic energy fluctuations of diffusing colloids and the hydrodynamics of the flow field in the pore structure however α is usually assumed to be spatially constant and fitted from experimental data in this study a theoretical method is proposed to predict the distribution of the sticking efficiency at pore scale α t using a pore network model pnm and the macroscale sticking efficiency of the whole porous media α m by means of upscaling a pnm is established to simulate the pore structure of porous media and to obtain the flow field and energy and torque balances are calculated throughout the spatial pore structure to determine the distribution of α t under different physiochemical conditions the value of α m is determined through breakthrough curves provided by the pnm under favorable and unfavorable conditions results show the distribution of α t is sensitive to various factors including colloid characteristics pore surface features geochemical environment and hydrodynamic conditions colloid characteristics like colloid surface zeta potential geochemical environment such as solution ionic strength and pore surface characteristics including nanoscale roughness and especially charge heterogeneity have a controlling influence on α t for nanoparticles 100 nm due to their impact on interaction energies hydrodynamic conditions played an increasingly important and eventually dominant role in determining α t for larger colloids by changing the sticking of weakly associated colloids e g at secondary minima when hydrodynamic torques are weak the influence of colloid size on α t can be non monotonic due to the combined influence of interaction energy and hydrodynamic torques as a result higher values of α m occurred for smaller colloid sizes lower flow velocities larger pore sizes and in the presence of microscopic roughness the method proposed by this study can be used to predict the sticking efficiency under

medium is needed for many industrial and environmental applications molnar et al 2015 one of the most commonly used prediction methods is colloid filtration theory cft yao et al 1971 elimelech 1994 logan et al 1995 tufenkji and elimelech 2004a long and hilpert 2009 ma et al 2011 nelson and ginn 2011 cft divides the colloid deposition process into two steps 1 colloid mass transfer to the swi occurs by diffusion interception and sedimentation and then 2 colloids attach to the swi shen et al 2019 the fraction of colloids contacting the swi in step 1 is described by the collector efficiency η which can be determined by the solution of transport equations in simplified pore geometries various correlation equations have been developed from simulation output for ease of calculation of η yao et al 1971 all colloids near the swi are assumed to attach at the swi under favourable conditions when there is no repulsion between colloids and the swi and thus a perfect sink boundary condition is employed to predict η molnar et al 2015 when repulsion occurs between colloids and the swi e g unfavourable conditions only a fraction of colloids that strike the swi will be deposited johnson et al 2018 the sticking efficiency α is used in step 2 of cft to describe this fraction yao et al 1971 tufenkji and elimelech 2004a the parameter α is usually obtained by fitting breakthrough curves btcs in column tests although several theoretical methods have been developed to predict α from interaction energies and hydrodynamic conditions bradford and torkzaban 2015 chang et al 2017 vanness et al 2019 the surface of the swi is assumed to be smooth and chemically homogeneous in traditional cft but all natural surfaces exhibit surface roughness and charge heterogeneity drelich and wang 2011 huang et al 2012 surface roughness and charge heterogeneity have been reported to significantly influence the value of α in both experimental and simulation results duffadar and davis 2008 shen et al 2019 shen et al 2011 find that roughness on natural sand and glass beads can lead to more colloid attachment bradford and torkzaban 2013 show that roughness and charge heterogeneity can reduce the magnitude of the interaction energy between colloids and the swi in comparison with homogeneous conditions rasmuson et al 2017 show that surface roughness on the swi can decrease or even eliminate the gap between favourable and unfavourable attachment conditions due to its influence on attraction and hydrodynamic slip these previous works have improved our understanding of the effects of roughness and charge heterogeneity on α and colloid deposition at pore or representative element volume scales the transport and deposition of colloids in porous media is usually simulated by solving the convection dispersion equation cde and employing constant values of η and α in a first order deposition coefficient deshpande and shonnard 1999 mondal et al 2021 this approach assumes that the complex pore structure of porous media can be described using a single first order deposition coefficient to reflect the average behaviour long and hilpert 2009 reported the value of η can change in some range when considering the complex pore structure by the lattice boltzmann method lin et al 2021a show that surface roughness and charge heterogeneity in a pore network model pnm creates complicated distributions of η and α however the influence of geometry parameters of the pnm e g pore size distribution coordination number curvature number on the distribution and upscaling of α have not been examined to date the objectives of this study are to reveal how surface and geometry parameters can influence the sticking efficiency and to present a method for upscaling sticking efficiency from

transport and retention are simulated using pnms with a maximum coordination number of 26 raoof and hassanizadeh 2009 hu et al 2018 the porous medium structure is represented in the pnm using spherical pore bodies and cylindrical tube pore throats to represent large pore cavities and long narrow passages respectively the pore bodies are aligned on grid points and the pore throats are connected between the pore bodies an example of the geometry of the pnm is shown in fig 1 a several parameters are needed to establish a pnm zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 a normal distribution of pore body radii is assumed which is characterized by its mean μ pore l and standard deviation σ pore l each pore body can be connected up to 26 pore bodies in the pnm and the mean number of connections between pore bodies is set as the coordination number cn and then the pore throats are randomly generated in the model the radius of pore throats is determined by the radius of the two connected pore bodies which can be described by the curvature number n proposed by acharya et al 2004 these statistical parameters can be obtained by analyzing computed tomography scanning images of real porous media or sphere pack structure by the discrete element method gao et al 2012 after these four parameters are determined the length of the grid element is determined by iterative computation to obtain a target porosity θ flow distribution is a crucial factor which can influence the transport and deposition behavior of solute or colloids in porous media brian and berkowitz 2006 anna et al 2013 in this study constant pressure boundaries are set at the left and right boundaries of the pnm then the flux of each pore throat is solved using the hagen poiseuille equation to meet the equivalent darcy flow u m lt 1 raoof and hassanizadeh 2012 more details about the pnm can be found in our previous work hu et al 2018 lin et al 2021b lin et al 2021a lin et al 2022 an example of the pore throat velocity u t lt 1 distribution in the pnm is shown in fig 1b 2 2 colloid transport and retention in the pnm colloid transport happens in pore bodies and pore throats both the pore body and the pore throats are fully mixed systems so each of them can only have one colloid liquid and solid concentration at any moment raoof et al 2010 the distributions of the pore scale sticking efficiency α t and the macroscale sticking efficiency α m are calculated based on the geometry of the pnm only factors that influence surface deposition e g collection and sticking are discussed in this study other processes including blocking straining and bridging are discussed in our previous work lin et al 2021a b 2 2 1 pore scale colloid transport and retention the attachment of colloids is assumed to happen in the pore throats of the pnm seetha et al 2017 a pore throat ij connects two pore bodies i and j the mass balance of the pore throat ij is expressed as 1 v ij d c ij dt q ij c j q ij c ij v ij k att ij c ij where v ij l3 is the volume of the pore throat c ij ncl 3 where nc is the dimension for the number of the colloids and c j ncl 3 is the liquid concentration of colloids in the pore throat and its downstream pore body j q ij l3t 1 is the flow flux in the pore throat and k att ij is the attachment coefficient of the pore throat which is calculated by the following equation lin et al 2021a 2 k att ij η t ij α t ij u t ij l t ij where η t ij is the collector efficiency of the pore throat α t ij is the sticking efficiency of the pore throat u t ij lt 1 is the mean flow velocity in the pore throat and l t ij l is the length of the pore throat the collector efficiency η t is determined from the finite element solution of the convective diffusion equation with gravity under favorable conditions lin et al 2021a the sticking efficiency α t ij is calculated using a probability analysis method reported in our previous work bradford and torkzaban 2015 lin et al 2021a distributions of nanoscale charge heterogeneity ch nanoscale roughness nr and microscale roughness mr are considered on the swi in this method nr and ch can influence the interaction energy between colloids and the swi nr refers to pillars on the swi with a height of zero to h r l ch refers to regions on the swi with a positive zeta potential of zero to ζ ml2t 3i 1 whereas other portions of the swi have a negative charge ζ ml2t 3i 1 nr and ch are both assumed to obey binomial distributions with fractions p r and p on the entire swi respectively the size of the nr and ch is randomly generated between 100 nm2 to the size of the zone of influence duffadar and davis 2008 random distributions of mr with a height of zero to h r l are also generated which alter the lever arms in the torque balance calculation the interaction energy is calculated between a colloid and a particular location on the swi with known ch and nr properties and the energy barrier and primary and secondary minima are determined bradford and torkzaban 2013 an energy balance is conducted using the interaction energy parameters and the maxwellian distribution function to representation brownian diffusion shen et al 2007 the energy balance determines the probability of colloid interaction with a minimum in the presence of random fluctuations in kinetic energy due to diffusion a torque balance between the applied hydrodynamic and resisting adhesive torques is calculated to determine the conditions for colloid retention and release at a particular location bradford et al 2011 over 1000 monte carlo simulations are conducted for each pore throat to determine mean value of sticking efficiency in primary and secondary minima α t1 and α t2 and then the total sticking efficiency of colloids in this pore throat α t is calculated as α t1 α t2 parameters outlined in table 1 are employed to investigate the influence of colloid and environmental factors including colloids size r c l colloid surface potential ζ c ml2t 3i 1 fraction and height of nr p r h r fraction and positive zeta potential of ch p ζ microscopic roughness height h r ionic strength is pore throat size r t l and average pore

lengths l t l radii r t l and velocities u t lt 1 e g fig 1 the value of α t is determined for each pore throat section 2 2 1 and the distribution of α t in the pnm can be obtained the influence of geometry parameters flow conditions colloid size and microscopic roughness on the distribution of α t is subsequently analyzed under the typical surface and chemical condition p r p 0 1 h r 50 nm ζ 5 mv θ 0 39 n 0 5 c n 8 is 10 mm the scenarios of these simulations are shown in table 2 by solving eq 1 and other governing equations the btc in the pnm can be calculated a 3 pore volume pv pulse of colloids with an initial concentration c 0 ncl 3 is injected from the left boundary of the pnm and the effluent concentration c eff ncl 3 at the right boundary is calculated at different time points

k att pnm under favorable conditions is obtained by setting α t equal to 1 for every pore throat fig 2 shows a flowchart illustrating the methods used to determine α t and α m 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of environmental factors on α t the pore scale sticking efficiency α t is influenced by the properties of the swi fig 3 a and b demonstrate the influence of nr p r and h r on α t for colloids with different sizes the value of α t decreases with the colloid size under different nr conditions because the applied hydrodynamic torque and the height of the energy barrier increase with r c an increase in p r or h r also leads to an increase in α t although values of h r larger than 50 nm only have a limited impact due to alteration of the interaction energy profiles bradford and torkzaban 2013 the value of α t is large for colloids smaller than 100 nm due to the low energy barrier which can be further reduced or eliminated by nr conversely the value of α t is almost zero for colloids larger than 1 μm because nr decreases the resisting adhesive torque to levels that are less than the applied hydrodynamic torque proportional to the cube of r c duffadar and davis 2008 the relative influence of nr on α t is higher for medium size colloids r c 100 nm to 1 μm mainly because the applied hydrodynamic torque is limited and then the influence of nr on the energy barrier can be exhibited fig 3c and d show the influence of ch on α t higher values of p and ζ tend to produce larger values of α t because they create a deeper energy minimum and a lower energy barrier bradford and torkzaban 2013 however when ζ is larger than 10 mv the increase of α t is diminished because favorable conditions no energy barrier are already achieved the influence of ch on α t is more pronounced than that of nr especially for larger colloids because of their deeper minima lin et al 2021a nr mainly changes the energy balance by influencing the distance between colloids and swi when the colloid size is large the influence of nr is not pronounced however ch influences the energy balance by changing the charge distribution which is very significant for both small and large colloids similar to the influence of nr the effect of ch on α t is more significant for medium size colloids due to diminished hydrodynamic effects the combined influence of ch nr fig 3e is very similar to that shown for only ch fig 3c this observation indicates that ch is more important in determining α t than nr fig 3a for the considered conditions the influence of mr can be determined by comparing fig 3e and f note that the existence of mr can lead to an increase in α t especially for colloids larger than 100 nm this is because mr mainly influences the torque balance by altering the lever arms burdick et al 2005 the deposition is principally controlled by the energy balance for colloids smaller than 100 nm whereas for larger colloids the influence of hydrodynamic forces on the torque balance is more pronounced it is interesting to note that mr exhibits a non monotonic influence on α t with increasing r c values of α t tend to increase when r c 100 nm reach a maximum when r c is close to h r 5000 nm in this case and then decrease with further increases in r c which is because the applied hydrodynamic torque is zero when r c h r the value of α t is also influenced by other parameters such as the negative zeta potential of the colloid ζ c fig 4 a the solution ionic strength is fig 4b the pore throat size r t fig 4c and the pore throat mean velocity u t fig 4d both ζ c and is influence the interaction energy between colloids and the swi decreasing ζ c fig 4a and increasing is fig 4b both result in an increase of α t because of a reduction in the energy barrier changes in r t and u t only affect α t by altering the hydrodynamics in the torque balance consequently fig 4c and d show that r t and u t influences values of α t for colloids larger than 100 nm the hydrodynamic shear that acts on a colloid near the swi increases with increasing colloid size and pore throat velocity and decreasing pore throat diameter bradford et al 2011 similar to mr increasing r c produces a non monotonic dependency on α t when r c 100 nm and for larger r t fig 4c or lower u t fig 4d the initial increase in α t with r c reflects the increasing influence of the secondary minimum whereas subsequent decreases in α t with r c occur because of the dominant role of hydrodynamics 3 2 distribution of α t in the pore structure each pnm can contain thousands of pore throats which have a different geometry and velocity the value of α t can therefore be different for each pore throat in a pnm and this leads to a distribution of α t figs 5 8 show the influence of flow velocity colloid size microscopic roughness and mean and standard deviation of pore body radii in the pnm the distribution of α t is complicated and exhibits several peak values lin et al 2021a these results theoretically explain the empirical models and experimental observations of distribution of deposition rates tufenkji and elimelech 2004b 2005 and may create the need for colloid retention models with multiple kinetic sites schijven et al 2002 schijven and simunek 2002 leij et al 2016 in addition the distribution of α t1 is narrower than that of α t2 in the pnm figs 5 8 show that the distribution of α t1 usually has one peak value but that of α t2 usually has two peaks this implies that α t2 is more sensitive to changes in the flow geometry and flow velocity below we illustrate factors that influence the distribution of α t 3 2 1 influence of flow velocity the influence of macroscale flow velocity u m on the distribution of α t is shown in fig 5 results show that increasing u m leads to a decrease in the α t distribution and that changes in u m mainly influence the distribution of α t2 the distribution of α t becomes narrower with higher u m and α t2 is almost zero however with a small secondary peak when u m 10 4 m s this implies that colloid deposition is mainly controlled by the primary minima when that the flow velocity is high 3 2 2 influence of colloid size the colloid size can also influence the distribution of α t fig 6 fig 6a c show the results when h r 0 and mr is ignored the distribution of α t moves to the left as r c increases but changes in α t1 and α t2 are complicated when r c is 50 nm colloids interact in a primary minimum in some pore throats and α t2 is almost zero so the distribution of α t almost overlaps with that of α t1 this is because hydrodynamic forces are relatively weak for smaller colloids and deposition is mainly controlled by the energy balance as r c increases from 50 to 500 nm the value of α t1 decreases due to an increase in the energy barrier and hydrodynamic torque however the value of α t2 increases for medium size colloids 50 to 500 nm because of increases in the secondary energy minimum and the combined roles of the energy and torque balances when r c is 5000 nm the value of α t1 further declines higher energy barrier and the value of α t2 is almost zero higher hydrodynamic forces over the secondary minimum fig 6d f show the results when mr is considered and h r 5000 nm the influence of mr on the distribution of α t can be determined by comparing fig 6a and d fig 6b and e and fig 6c and f mr can influence the sticking process by decreasing the hydrodynamic torques burdick et al 2005 bradford and torkzaban 2015 the influence of mr is not significant for the small 50 nm colloids fig 6a and d because the applied hydrodynamic torque is very small in contrast mr changes the distribution of α t for medium fig 6b and e and large fig 6c and f colloids by influencing the value of α t2 note that the distribution of α t1 is not changed by mr fig 6b and e imply that the existence of mr can increase the value α t2 of 500 nm colloids but that the width of the distribution of α t2 does not change much for 5000 nm colloids the existence of mr can convert the α t2 distribution from zero to a very wide distribution 3 2 3 influence of pore structure fig 7 shows the influence of the mean pore radius on the distribution of α t the standard deviation of the pore radius is zero in these simulations so the size of pore bodies and pore throats are constant in the pnm although r t does not change in these pnms the value of α t still has a wide distribution due to the difference in pore throat velocity according to the three subfigures shown in fig 7 the mean value of α t increases with μ pore this is due to the decrease of hydrodynamic shear with μ pore when the equivalent darcy flow is the same fig 4c similarly bradford et al 2011 show that the applied torque decreases with the grain size whereas the adhesive torque is not influenced by the grain size a larger grain size usually leads to larger pore size in porous media in addition the distribution of α t1 changes little with μ pore but the distribution of α t2 becomes wider and increases with an increase in μ pore this implies that the change of μ pore mainly influences the distribution of α t by affecting α t2 which is more easily influenced by changes in the flow field when μ pore is small the value of α t2 is almost zero and colloids mainly interact with the primary minima whereas when μ pore increases more and more colloids start to interact with a secondary minimum furthermore the distribution of α 2 has two peak values for example in fig 7c the main peak value of α t2 is between 0 and 0 2 and a secondary peak value occurs at around 0 35 the main α t2 peak is controlled by the torque balance which is influenced by μ pore whereas the secondary α t2 peak is due to low velocity areas in the pnm that are mainly controlled by the energy balance e g pore throats perpendicular to the direction of seepage the influence of the pore size distribution is represented by changing σ pore in fig 8 results show that changing σ pore does not have a large influence on α t as σ pore increases from 0 to 100 μm when μ pore is 333 μm the distribution of α t only slightly moves to the right due to minor increases in α t2 this provides further justifications of setting σ pore 0 in fig 7 3 3 btcs and macroscale sticking efficiency α m fig 9 shows breakthrough curves from pnms under various velocities colloid sizes microscopic roughness and pore network conditions favorable and unfavorable attachment conditions are presented to clearly identify the influence of mass transfer and α t respectively in fig 9a higher values of u m lead to more breakthroughs under both favorable and unfavorable attachment conditions higher breakthrough concentrations occur with increasing u m under favorable conditions because higher velocity leads to a lower collector efficiency and also shorter residence time lin et al 2021a lin et al 2021b differences in favorable and unfavorable conditions are more pronounced at lower velocities because the applied hydrodynamic torque is sufficiently small to allow some colloid attachment in secondary minima the effect of colloid size on btcs is shown in fig 9b effluent concentrations are highest for r c 500 nm intermediate for r c 50 nm and lowest for r c 5000 nm under both favorable and unfavorable conditions because of differences in η t in particular values of η t are dominated by diffusion and sedimentation when r c 50 nm and r c 5000 nm respectively but are smaller at the intermediate value of r c 500 nm similar results are predicted by conventional filtration theory tufenkji and elimelech 2004a nelson and ginn 2005 btcs exhibit the same trends with r c under favorable and unfavorable conditions and this suggests the dominance of η t over α t under the considered conditions fig 9c shows that the existence of mr can further decrease the breakthrough concentration especially for larger colloids however effluent concentrations are also influenced by differences in the distribution of α t that changes with r c and other physicochemical conditions figs 3 8 fig 9d shows the influence of μ pore on the btcs results show that an increase in μ pore leads to an increase in c eff under favorable conditions since the collection efficiency decreases with increasing μ pore however fig 7 indicates that α t increases with μ pore consequently the value of c eff under unfavorable conditions is highest when μ pore 333 μm intermediate when μ pore 1665 μm and lowest when μ pore 66 6 μm this can explain why some colloids can sometimes have higher mobility in a finer than a coarser porous media when the surface conditions of the swi are the same lin and hu 2022 fig 9e shows the effect of σ pore on the btcs note σ pore has a relatively minor influence on c eff under both favorable and unfavorable conditions however a slight increase in c eff is observed with increasing σ pore under favorable conditions and this implies a decrease in η t although the impact of σ pore on surface deposition is not significant compared to other factors σ pore can still influence the diffusion of colloids and other mechanisms of retention such as hydrodynamic bridging and straining syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2012 kasel et al 2013 equation 3 is used to determine α m for the results shown in fig 9 and results are summarized in table 3 the method reported in this work can account for the influence of chemical interactions hydrodynamics and the complex pore structure of porous media on colloids attachment the predicted value of α m can be used in continuum model simulations because it reflects the combined effects of thousands of pore bodies and pore throats in the pnm 4 conclusion a pore network model is used in conjunction with energy and torque balances to determine pore scale distributions of sticking efficiencies α t α t1 and α t2 and the macroscale sticking efficiency α m under different physiochemical conditions in porous media the influence factors including colloid characteristics pore surface features geochemical environment and hydrodynamic conditions on the pore scale and macroscale sticking efficiency are discussed based on the numerical results the pore scale sticking efficiency α t depends on factors that influence the interaction energy between colloids and the solid water interface including solution and solid phase chemistry nanoscale roughness and charge heterogeneity and the colloid size moreover factors that influence hydrodynamic conditions such as the flow velocity the pore structure the colloid size and the presence of microscopic roughness can also strongly influence and control the distribution of α t when the colloid size is larger than around 100 nm an increase in microscopic roughness pore throat radius and a decrease in pore throat velocity can lead to an increase in α t because of the decrease in the hydrodynamic torque when hydrodynamic torques are weak high microscopic roughness large pore throat radius and low pore throat velocity the influence of colloid size on α t can be non monotonic due to the combined effect of the interaction energy and hydrodynamic torque at macroscale the distribution of α t and the corresponding macroscale α m are provided by the pnm the distribution of α t can be multimodal with a narrow one peak distribution of α t1 and a wide multimodal distribution of α t2 hydrodynamic torques can change the α t distribution mainly by altering the distribution of α t2 the macroscale sticking efficiency α m corresponds to the distributed α t is subsequently calculated from pore network model breakthrough curves under favorable and unfavorable conditions under different colloid collector flow and pore structure conditions results show that smaller colloid sizes lower flow velocities larger pore sizes and the existence of microscopic roughness lead to higher α m the standard deviation of the pore size did not have a significant influence on α m but can impact the breakthrough time of the colloids results from this study are critically important because conventional colloid filtration theory assumes that the sticking efficiency is controlled by colloid interactions with the solid water interface and neglects the role of torque balances and pore structure the proposed pnm approach allows one to rigorously test the validity of this assumption and demonstrates that this hypothesis is violated for colloids larger than 100 nm the method proposed by this study can predict the distribution of α t and the macroscale sticking efficiency α m under different physiochemical conditions and is therefore an important method to study the transport and retention behavior of colloids in porous media

3004,the sticking efficiency α is a vital parameter to predict the transport and deposition of colloids in porous media the value of α depends on various factors such as the interaction energy between colloids and the solid water interface swi kinetic energy fluctuations of diffusing colloids and the hydrodynamics of the flow field in the pore structure however α is usually assumed to be spatially constant and fitted from experimental data in this study a theoretical method is proposed to predict the distribution of the sticking efficiency at pore scale α t using a pore network model pnm and the macroscale sticking efficiency of the whole porous media α m by means of upscaling a pnm is established to simulate the pore structure of porous media and to obtain the flow field and energy and torque balances are calculated throughout the spatial pore structure to determine the distribution of α t under different physiochemical conditions the value of α m is determined through breakthrough curves provided by the pnm under favorable and unfavorable conditions results show the distribution of α t is sensitive to various factors including colloid characteristics pore surface features geochemical environment and hydrodynamic conditions colloid characteristics like colloid surface zeta potential geochemical environment such as solution ionic strength and pore surface characteristics including nanoscale roughness and especially charge heterogeneity have a controlling influence on α t for nanoparticles 100 nm due to their impact on interaction energies hydrodynamic conditions played an increasingly important and eventually dominant role in determining α t for larger colloids by changing the sticking of weakly associated colloids e g at secondary minima when hydrodynamic torques are weak the influence of colloid size on α t can be non monotonic due to the combined influence of interaction energy and hydrodynamic torques as a result higher values of α m occurred for smaller colloid sizes lower flow velocities larger pore sizes and in the presence of microscopic roughness the method proposed by this study can be used to predict the sticking efficiency under

logan et al 1995 tufenkji and elimelech 2004a long and hilpert 2009 ma et al 2011 nelson and ginn 2011 cft divides the colloid deposition process into two steps 1 colloid mass transfer to the swi occurs by diffusion interception and sedimentation and then 2 colloids attach to the swi shen et al 2019 the fraction of colloids contacting the swi in step 1 is described by the collector efficiency η which can be determined by the solution of transport equations in simplified pore geometries various correlation equations have been developed from simulation output for ease of calculation of η yao et al 1971 all colloids near the swi are assumed to attach at the swi under favourable conditions when there is no repulsion between colloids and the swi and thus a perfect sink boundary condition is employed to predict η molnar et al 2015 when repulsion occurs between colloids and the swi e g unfavourable conditions only a fraction of colloids that strike the swi will be deposited johnson et al 2018 the sticking efficiency α is used in step 2 of cft to describe this fraction yao et al 1971 tufenkji and elimelech 2004a the parameter α is usually obtained by fitting breakthrough curves btcs in column tests although several theoretical methods have been developed to predict α from interaction energies and hydrodynamic conditions bradford and torkzaban 2015 chang et al 2017 vanness et al 2019 the surface of the swi is assumed to be smooth and chemically homogeneous in traditional cft but all natural surfaces exhibit surface roughness and charge heterogeneity drelich and wang 2011 huang et al 2012 surface roughness and charge heterogeneity have been reported to significantly influence the value of α in both experimental and simulation results duffadar and davis 2008 shen et al 2019 shen et al 2011 find that roughness on natural sand and glass beads can lead to more colloid attachment bradford and torkzaban 2013 show that roughness and charge heterogeneity can reduce the magnitude of the interaction energy between colloids and the swi in comparison with homogeneous conditions rasmuson et al 2017 show that surface roughness on the swi can decrease or even eliminate the gap between favourable and unfavourable attachment conditions due to its influence on attraction and hydrodynamic slip these previous works have improved our understanding of the effects of roughness and charge heterogeneity on α and colloid deposition at pore or representative element volume scales the transport and deposition of colloids in porous media is usually simulated by solving the convection dispersion equation cde and employing constant values of η and α in a first order deposition coefficient deshpande and shonnard 1999 mondal et al 2021 this approach assumes that the complex pore structure of porous media can be described using a single first order deposition coefficient to reflect the average behaviour long and hilpert 2009 reported the value of η can change in some range

efficiency α t is discussed based on numerical simulation of pnm an upscaling method for the macroscale sticking efficiency α m is provided 2 methods 2 1 pore network model in this study colloid transport and retention are simulated using pnms with a maximum coordination number of 26 raoof and hassanizadeh 2009 hu et al 2018 the porous medium structure is represented in the pnm using spherical pore bodies and cylindrical tube pore throats to represent large pore cavities and long narrow passages respectively the pore bodies are aligned on grid points and the pore throats are connected between the pore bodies an example of the geometry of the pnm is shown in fig 1 a several parameters are needed to establish a pnm zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 a normal distribution of pore body radii is assumed which is characterized by its mean μ pore l and standard deviation σ pore l each pore body can be connected up to 26 pore bodies in the pnm and the mean number of connections between pore bodies is set as the coordination number cn and then the pore throats are randomly generated in the model the radius of pore throats is determined by the radius of the two connected pore bodies which can be described by the curvature number n proposed by acharya et al 2004 these statistical parameters can be obtained by analyzing computed tomography scanning images of real porous media or sphere pack structure by the discrete element method gao et al 2012 after these four parameters are determined the length of the grid element is determined by iterative computation to obtain a target porosity θ flow distribution is a crucial factor which can influence the transport and deposition behavior of solute or colloids in porous media brian and berkowitz 2006 anna et al 2013 in this study constant pressure boundaries are set at the left and right boundaries of the pnm then the flux of each pore throat is solved using the hagen poiseuille equation to meet the equivalent darcy flow u m lt 1 raoof and hassanizadeh 2012 more details about the pnm can be found in our previous work hu et al 2018 lin et al 2021b lin et al 2021a lin et al 2022 an example of the pore throat velocity u t lt 1 distribution in the pnm is shown in fig 1b 2 2 colloid transport and retention in the pnm colloid transport happens in pore bodies and pore throats both the pore body and the pore throats are fully mixed systems so each of them can only have one colloid liquid and solid concentration at any moment raoof et al 2010 the distributions of the pore scale sticking efficiency α t and the macroscale sticking efficiency α m are calculated based on the geometry of the pnm only factors that influence surface deposition e g collection and sticking are discussed in this study other processes including blocking straining and bridging are discussed in our previous work lin et al 2021a b 2 2 1 pore scale colloid transport and retention the attachment of colloids is assumed to happen in the pore throats of the pnm seetha et al 2017 a pore throat ij connects two pore bodies i and j the mass balance of the pore throat ij is expressed as 1 v ij d c ij dt q ij c j q ij c ij v ij k att ij c ij where v ij l3 is the volume of the pore throat c ij ncl 3 where nc is the dimension for the number of the colloids and c j ncl 3 is the liquid concentration of colloids in the pore throat and its downstream pore body j q ij l3t 1 is the flow flux in the pore throat and k att ij is the attachment coefficient of the pore throat which is calculated by the following equation lin et al 2021a 2 k att ij η t ij α t ij u t ij l t ij where η t ij is the collector efficiency of the pore throat α t ij is the sticking efficiency of the pore throat u t ij lt 1 is the mean flow velocity in the pore throat and l t ij l is the length of the pore throat the collector efficiency η t is determined from the finite element solution of the convective diffusion equation with gravity under favorable conditions lin et al 2021a the sticking efficiency α t ij is calculated using a probability analysis method reported in our previous work bradford and torkzaban 2015 lin et al 2021a distributions of nanoscale charge heterogeneity ch nanoscale roughness nr and microscale roughness mr are considered on the swi in this method nr and ch can influence the interaction energy between colloids and the swi nr refers to pillars on the swi with a height of zero to h r l ch refers to regions on the swi with a positive zeta potential of zero to ζ ml2t 3i 1 whereas other portions of the swi have a negative charge ζ ml2t 3i 1 nr and ch are both assumed to obey binomial distributions with fractions p r and p on the entire swi respectively the size of the nr and ch is randomly generated between 100 nm2 to the size of the zone of influence duffadar and davis 2008 random distributions of mr with a height of zero to h r l are also generated which alter the lever arms in the torque balance calculation the interaction energy is calculated between a colloid and a particular location on the swi with known ch and nr properties and the energy barrier and primary and secondary minima are determined bradford and torkzaban 2013 an energy balance is conducted using the interaction energy parameters and the maxwellian distribution function to representation brownian diffusion shen et al 2007 the energy balance determines the probability of colloid interaction with a minimum in the presence of random fluctuations in kinetic energy due to diffusion a torque balance between the applied hydrodynamic and resisting adhesive torques is calculated to determine the conditions for colloid retention and release at a particular location bradford et al 2011 over 1000 monte carlo simulations are conducted for each pore throat to determine mean value of sticking efficiency in primary and secondary minima α t1 and α t2 and then the total sticking efficiency of colloids in this pore throat α t is calculated as α t1 α t2 parameters outlined in table 1 are employed to investigate the influence of colloid and environmental factors including colloids size r c l colloid surface

lengths l t l radii r t l and velocities u t lt 1 e g fig 1 the value of α t is determined for each pore throat section 2 2 1 and the distribution of α t in the pnm can be obtained the influence of geometry parameters flow conditions colloid size and microscopic roughness on the distribution of α t is subsequently analyzed under the typical surface and chemical condition p r p 0 1 h r 50 nm ζ 5 mv θ 0 39 n 0 5 c n 8 is 10 mm the scenarios of these simulations are shown in table 2 by solving eq 1 and other governing equations the btc in the pnm can be calculated a 3 pore volume pv pulse of colloids with an initial concentration c 0 ncl 3 is injected from the left boundary of the pnm and the effluent concentration c eff ncl 3 at the right boundary is calculated at different time points in simulations the macroscale attachment coefficient k att pnm can be determined from the model mass balance as yao et al 1971 3 k att pnm u m l m θ ln c eff c 0 where l m l is the length of the pnm domain in the mean flow direction the macroscale sticking efficiency α m for the pnm is subsequently determined as 4 α m k att pnm under unfavorable condition k att pnm under favorable condition where k att pnm under favorable conditions is obtained by setting α t equal to 1 for every pore throat fig 2 shows a flowchart illustrating the methods used to determine α t and α m 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of environmental factors on α t the pore scale sticking efficiency α t is influenced by the properties of the swi fig 3 a and b demonstrate the influence of nr p r and h r on α t for colloids with different sizes the value of α t decreases with the colloid size under different nr conditions because the applied hydrodynamic torque and the height of the energy barrier increase with r c an increase in p r or h r also leads to an increase in α t although values of h r larger than 50 nm only have a limited impact due to alteration of the interaction energy profiles bradford and torkzaban 2013 the value of α t is large for colloids smaller than 100 nm due to the low energy barrier which can be further reduced or eliminated by nr conversely the value of α t is almost zero for colloids larger than 1 μm because nr decreases the resisting adhesive torque to levels that are less than the applied hydrodynamic torque proportional to the cube of r c duffadar and davis 2008 the relative influence of nr on α t is higher for medium size colloids r c 100 nm to 1 μm mainly because the applied hydrodynamic torque is limited and then the influence of nr on the energy barrier can be exhibited fig 3c and d show the influence of ch on α t higher values of p and ζ tend to produce larger values of α t because they create a deeper energy minimum and a lower energy barrier bradford and torkzaban 2013 however when ζ is larger than 10 mv the increase of α t is diminished because favorable conditions no energy barrier are already achieved the influence of ch on α t is more pronounced than that of nr especially for larger colloids because of their deeper minima lin et al 2021a nr mainly changes the energy balance by influencing the distance between colloids and swi when the colloid size is large the influence of nr is not pronounced however ch influences the energy balance by changing the charge distribution which is very significant for both small and large colloids similar to the influence of nr the effect of ch on α t is more significant for medium size colloids due to diminished hydrodynamic effects the combined influence of ch nr fig 3e is very similar to that shown for only ch fig 3c this observation indicates that ch is more important in determining α t than nr fig 3a for the considered conditions the influence of mr can be determined by comparing fig 3e and f note that the existence of mr can lead to an increase in α t especially for colloids larger than 100 nm this is because mr mainly influences the torque balance by altering the lever arms burdick et al 2005 the deposition is principally controlled by the energy balance for colloids smaller than 100 nm whereas for larger colloids the influence of hydrodynamic forces on the torque balance is more pronounced it is interesting to note that mr exhibits a non monotonic influence on α t with increasing r c values of α t tend to increase when r c 100 nm reach a maximum when r c is close to h r 5000 nm in this case and then decrease with further increases in r c which is because the applied hydrodynamic torque is zero when r c h r the value of α t is also influenced by other parameters such as the negative zeta potential of the colloid ζ c fig 4 a the solution ionic strength is fig 4b the pore throat size r t fig 4c and the pore throat mean velocity u t fig 4d both ζ c and is influence the interaction energy between colloids and the swi decreasing ζ c fig 4a and increasing is fig 4b both result in an increase of α t because of a reduction in the energy barrier changes in r t and u t only affect α t by altering the hydrodynamics in the torque balance consequently fig 4c and d show that r t and u t influences values of α t for colloids larger than 100 nm the hydrodynamic shear that acts on a colloid near the swi increases with increasing colloid size and pore throat velocity and decreasing pore throat diameter bradford et al 2011 similar to mr increasing r c produces a non monotonic dependency on α t when r c 100 nm and for larger r t fig 4c or lower u t fig 4d the initial increase in α t with r c reflects the increasing influence of the secondary minimum whereas subsequent decreases in α t with r c occur because of the dominant role of hydrodynamics 3 2 distribution of α t in the pore structure each pnm can contain thousands of pore throats which have a different geometry and velocity the value of α t can therefore be different for each pore throat in a pnm and this leads to a distribution of α t figs 5 8 show the influence of flow velocity colloid size microscopic roughness and mean and standard deviation of pore body radii in the pnm the distribution of α t is complicated and exhibits several peak values lin et al 2021a these results theoretically explain the empirical models and experimental observations of distribution of deposition rates tufenkji and elimelech 2004b 2005 and may create the need for colloid retention models with multiple kinetic sites schijven et al 2002 schijven and simunek 2002 leij et al 2016 in addition the distribution of α t1 is narrower than that of α t2 in the pnm figs 5 8 show that the distribution of α t1 usually has one peak value but that of α t2 usually has two peaks this implies that α t2 is more sensitive to changes in the flow geometry and flow velocity below we illustrate factors that influence the distribution of α t 3 2 1 influence of flow velocity the influence of macroscale flow velocity u m on the distribution of α t is shown in fig 5 results show that increasing u m leads to a decrease in the α t distribution and that changes in u m mainly influence the distribution of α t2 the distribution of α t becomes narrower with higher u m and α t2 is almost zero however with a small secondary peak when u m 10 4 m s this implies that colloid deposition is mainly controlled by the primary minima when that the flow velocity is high 3 2 2 influence of colloid size the colloid size can also influence the distribution of α t fig 6 fig 6a c show the results when h r 0 and mr is ignored the distribution of α t moves to the left as r c increases but changes in α t1 and α t2 are complicated when r c is 50 nm colloids interact in a primary minimum in some pore throats and α t2 is almost zero so the distribution of α t almost overlaps with that of α t1 this is because hydrodynamic forces are relatively weak for smaller colloids and deposition is mainly controlled by the energy balance as r c increases from 50 to 500 nm the value of α t1 decreases due to an increase in the energy barrier and hydrodynamic torque however the value of α t2 increases for medium size colloids 50 to 500 nm because of increases in the secondary energy minimum and the combined roles of the energy and torque balances when r c is 5000 nm the value of α t1 further declines higher energy barrier and the value of α t2 is almost zero higher hydrodynamic forces over the secondary minimum fig 6d f show the results when mr is considered and h r 5000 nm the influence of mr on the distribution of α t can be determined by comparing fig 6a and d fig 6b and e and fig 6c and f mr can influence the sticking process by decreasing the hydrodynamic torques burdick et al 2005 bradford and torkzaban 2015 the influence of mr is not significant for the small 50 nm colloids fig 6a and d because the applied hydrodynamic torque is very small in contrast mr changes the distribution of α t for medium fig 6b and e and large fig 6c and f colloids by influencing the value of α t2 note that the distribution of α t1 is not changed by mr fig 6b and e imply that the existence of mr can increase the value α t2 of 500 nm colloids but that the width of the distribution of α t2 does not change much for 5000 nm colloids the existence of mr can convert the α t2 distribution from zero to a very wide distribution 3 2 3 influence of pore structure fig 7 shows the influence of the mean pore radius on the distribution of α t the standard deviation of the pore radius is zero in these simulations so the size of pore bodies and pore throats are constant in the pnm although r t does not change in these pnms the value of α t still has a wide distribution due to the difference in pore throat velocity according to the three subfigures shown in fig 7 the mean value of α t increases with μ pore this is due to the decrease of hydrodynamic shear with μ pore when the equivalent darcy flow is the same fig 4c similarly bradford et al 2011 show that the applied torque decreases with the grain size whereas the adhesive torque is not influenced by the grain size a larger grain size usually leads to larger pore size in porous media in addition the distribution of α t1 changes little with μ pore but the distribution of α t2 becomes wider and increases with an increase in μ pore this implies that the change of μ pore mainly influences the distribution of α t by affecting α t2 which is more easily influenced by changes in the flow field when μ pore is small the value of α t2 is almost zero and colloids mainly interact with the primary minima whereas when μ pore increases more and more colloids start to interact with a secondary minimum furthermore the distribution of α 2 has two peak values for example in fig 7c the main peak value of α t2 is between 0 and 0 2 and a secondary peak value occurs at around 0 35 the main α t2 peak is controlled by the torque balance which is influenced by μ pore whereas the secondary α t2 peak is due to low velocity areas in the pnm that are mainly controlled by the energy balance e g pore throats perpendicular to the direction of seepage the influence of the pore size distribution is represented by changing σ pore in fig 8 results show that changing σ pore does not have a large influence on α t as σ pore increases from 0 to 100 μm when μ pore is 333 μm the distribution of α t only slightly moves to the right due to minor increases in α t2 this provides further justifications of setting σ pore 0 in fig 7 3 3 btcs and macroscale sticking efficiency α m fig 9 shows breakthrough curves from pnms under various velocities colloid sizes microscopic roughness and pore network conditions favorable and unfavorable attachment conditions are presented to clearly identify the influence of mass transfer and α t respectively in fig 9a higher values of u m lead to more breakthroughs under both favorable and unfavorable attachment conditions higher breakthrough concentrations occur with increasing u m under favorable conditions because higher velocity leads to a lower collector efficiency and also shorter residence time lin et al 2021a lin et al 2021b differences in favorable and unfavorable conditions are more pronounced at lower velocities because the applied hydrodynamic torque is sufficiently small to allow some colloid attachment in secondary minima the effect of colloid size on btcs is shown in fig 9b effluent concentrations are highest for r c 500 nm intermediate for r c 50 nm and lowest for r c 5000 nm under both favorable and unfavorable conditions because of differences in η t in particular values of η t are dominated by diffusion and sedimentation when r c 50 nm and r c 5000 nm respectively but are smaller at the intermediate value of r c 500 nm similar results are predicted by conventional filtration theory tufenkji and elimelech 2004a nelson and ginn 2005 btcs exhibit the same trends with r c under favorable and unfavorable conditions and this suggests the dominance of η t over α t under the considered conditions fig 9c shows that the existence of mr can further decrease the breakthrough concentration especially for larger colloids however effluent concentrations are also influenced by differences in the distribution of α t that changes with r c and other physicochemical conditions figs 3 8 fig 9d shows the influence of μ pore on the btcs results show that an increase in μ pore leads to an increase in c eff under favorable conditions since the collection efficiency decreases with increasing μ pore however fig 7 indicates that α t increases with μ pore consequently the value of c eff under unfavorable conditions is highest when μ pore 333 μm intermediate when μ pore 1665 μm and lowest when μ pore 66 6 μm this can explain why some colloids can sometimes have higher mobility in a finer than a coarser porous media when the surface conditions of the swi are the same lin and hu 2022 fig 9e shows the effect of σ pore on the btcs note σ pore has a relatively minor influence on c eff under both favorable and unfavorable conditions however a slight increase in c eff is observed with increasing σ pore under favorable conditions and this implies a decrease in η t although the impact of σ pore on surface deposition is not significant compared to other factors σ pore can still influence the diffusion of colloids and other mechanisms of retention such as hydrodynamic bridging and straining syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2012 kasel et al 2013 equation 3 is used to determine α m for the results shown in fig 9 and results are summarized in table 3 the method reported in this work can account for the influence of chemical interactions hydrodynamics and the complex pore structure of porous media on colloids attachment the predicted value of α m can be used in continuum model simulations because it reflects the combined effects of thousands of pore bodies and pore throats in the pnm 4 conclusion a pore network model is used in conjunction with energy and torque balances to determine pore scale distributions of sticking efficiencies α t α t1 and α t2 and the macroscale sticking efficiency α m under different physiochemical conditions in porous media the influence factors including colloid characteristics pore surface features geochemical environment and hydrodynamic conditions on the pore scale and macroscale sticking efficiency are discussed based on the numerical results the pore scale sticking efficiency α t depends on factors that influence the interaction energy between colloids and the solid water interface including solution and solid phase chemistry nanoscale roughness and charge heterogeneity and the colloid size moreover factors that influence hydrodynamic conditions such as the flow velocity the pore structure the colloid size and the presence of microscopic roughness can also strongly influence and control the distribution of α t when the colloid size is larger than around 100 nm an increase in microscopic roughness pore throat radius and a decrease in pore throat velocity can lead to an increase in α t because of the decrease in the hydrodynamic torque when hydrodynamic torques are weak high microscopic roughness large pore throat radius and low pore throat velocity the influence of colloid size on α t can be non monotonic due to the combined effect of the interaction energy and hydrodynamic torque at macroscale the distribution of α t and the corresponding macroscale α m are provided by the pnm the distribution of α t can be multimodal with a narrow one peak distribution of α t1 and a wide multimodal distribution of α t2 hydrodynamic torques can change the α t distribution mainly by altering the distribution of α t2 the macroscale sticking efficiency α m corresponds to the distributed α t is subsequently calculated from pore network model breakthrough curves under favorable and unfavorable conditions under different colloid collector flow and pore structure conditions results show that smaller colloid sizes lower flow velocities larger pore sizes and the existence of microscopic roughness lead to higher α m the standard deviation of the pore size did not have a significant influence on α m but can impact the breakthrough time of the colloids results from this study are critically important because conventional colloid filtration theory assumes that the sticking efficiency is controlled by colloid interactions with the solid water interface and neglects the role of torque balances and pore structure the proposed pnm approach allows one to rigorously test the validity of this assumption and demonstrates that this hypothesis is violated for colloids larger than 100 nm the method proposed by this study can predict the distribution of α t and the macroscale sticking efficiency α m under different physiochemical conditions and is therefore an important method to study the transport and retention behavior of colloids in porous media
