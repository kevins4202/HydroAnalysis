12710,in this study leachate from municipal solid waste msw transfer station was treated in a pilot scale anaerobic biofilm digester abd system under 30 25 20 and 10 day hrt the maximum cod concentration entering the reactor was 46 944 mg l and the reactor was under full operation for 163 days the results showed that cod removal efficiency was above 95 throughout the operation and measurement of the average daily biogas production yielded a value of 25 1 m3 day with a composition of 57 12 methane and 26 6 carbon dioxide in comparison to the monod and modified stover kincannon msk models the second order grau model presented the best fit as a substrate removal kinetic model for this abd system with its r2 0 999 while the msk model for gas generation was proven to be a better fit than the van der meer and heertjes model in predicting the amount of biogas and methane gas produced from leachate treatment via a pilot scale abd keywords anaerobic biofilm digester leachate kinetic substrate removal biogas data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the main cause of the environmental problem that relates to generated leachate at municipal solid waste msw disposal facilities especially in developing countries is the lack of proper treatment technologies for example in malaysia the sequencing batch reactor sbr has been used as the main leachate treatment system at sanitary landfills and transfer stations 1 however this reactor has been deemed unfit for use in 90 of msw disposal facilities around the country due to its high cost and vast land use in these msw facilities that do not use sbr an integrated system of anaerobic pond and facultative lagoons has been installed just like in indonesia nevertheless these facilities have shown inefficiency with long residence time slow degradation rate and pungent odour release 2 3 it is a known fact that biological processes aerobic and anaerobic are the best options in treating wastewater with high organic content however the use of an aerobic system as the main treatment technology in developing countries is not sustainable and is too costly due to the high usage of electrical power for aeration and the price of disposal of hazardous sludge 1 4 in contrast to the problematic conventional anaerobic digestion reactors anaerobic digesters with granules e g up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor or biofilm technologies e g anaerobic filter af and anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor anmbbr have shown high work performance in treating various types of industrial wastewaters such as those from the textile 5 6 and chemical industries 7 beside palm oil mill effluent pome 2 uasb reactors employ sludge granules which are colonies of several classes of microbes that take part in the bioconversion these microbial cells collect and form the sludge granules without the support carriers 8 uasb reactor is known to be inefficient in treating wastewater with colloidal particles because these substances thwart microbial activity causing the sludge to become fluffier and de granulate into flocs and washed out of the reactor together with the microbes attached onto it 9 this situation was proven previously by hawkes et al 10 whose research showed the treatment of ice cream wastewater using uasb reactor gave the poorest performance approximately 50 total cod removal at an organic loading rate olr of 2 kg cod m 3d 1 compared to the af around 67 total cod removal at an olr of 6 kg cod m 3d 1 since successful granulation was not achieved by uasb while in anaerobic digesters with biofilm technology such as af and anmbbr the microbes are fixed in biofilms on plastic carriers inside the reactor 11 microbial cells grow and poliferate within the biofilm but when the thickness of the biofilm increases past a certain value the film becomes detached from the carrier surface and sloughed out to be swapped by fresh cells and henceforth the biofilm thickness stays constant throughout the operation of the bioreactor there is no need for sludge recycle since the microbial cells stay attached to the support carriers and do not leave the bioreactor 8 that s why in contrast to uasb these biofilm reactors have displayed great work performance in treating high lipid and colloidal wastewaters such as dairy wastewater 12 ice cream wastewater 10 and compost leachate 13 with high organic pollutant removal and long biomass retention inside the digester in asean countries other than singapore and brunei more than 50 of solid wastes collected consist of organic and food waste 14 15 making the contents of generated leachate high in colloidal particles fat oil and protein the use of anaerobic biofilm digesters in treating leachate from msw facilities is not widely reported even in laboratory scale studies furthermore the performance shown by a laboratory scale treatment system is quite hard to compare with a commercial scale system due to the wide gap of differences in condition most laboratory scale systems could be set up with default optimum conditions while commercial systems mostly depend on the surrounding environment e g on the monsoon season and on draught hence conducting a pilot scale study would be better as its design and operation conditions would be almost like a commercial scale system to gain a clear understanding kinetic models could be used to control and predict a system s operation performance and to optimize the system design from the pilot scale to the commercial scale 5 16 in anaerobic digestion kinetic models simulate substrate removal kinetics and biogas production 17 the kinetics of substrate removal is studied along with some key measures including substrate utilization rate biomass growth rate and kinetic coefficients a system s work performance biomass production or substrate removal depends on a substrate s contents and a reactor s conditions ph temperature and dissolved oxygen 18 among the models used for substrate degradation and biogas production kinetics monod second order grau sog modified stover kincannon msk and van der meeer and heertjes vdmh seem to be extensively used due to their simplified mathematical equations other than that these kinetic models involve only a few of parameters as variables used to determine the kinetic constants which are easy to monitor and measure especially on a commercial scale 19 in this study a pilot scale anaerobic biofilm digester abd system was operated for the treatment of leachate from an msw transfer station in malaysia under 30 25 20 and 10 day hydraulic retention time hrt this paper presents the evaluation of kinetic studies which involved three different models monod sog and msk for substrate removal kinetics additionally in order to check the kinetic constants of biogas production msk for gas generation and vdmh models were used 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale abd system set up a pilot scale abd system was constructed in an open environment at the biogas site of universiti kebangsaan malaysia ukm bangi malaysia under the hot and humid weather that lasts throughout the year this treatment system consisted of a pilot scale abd with a working volume of 5 95 m3 and a biogas bioscrubber in this paper the discussions will only involve abd no data on the biogas bioscrubber is presented as presented in fig 1 the abd was divided into two parts abd a and abd b with only a 1 ft opening interconnecting both parts to prevent feed mix up with the discharged effluent throughout operation the obtained results had shown a pattern indicating abd a acted more as a digester while abd b behaved similarly like a clarifier 20 each part of abd was filled with 5000 units of 3 dimensional 3 d high density polyethylene hdpe media for biofilm attachment fig 2 shows the dimensions and characteristics of the 3 d hdpe media provided by envirosource sdn bhd to make sure that the plastic media stayed inside the abd the inlets and outlets were fitted with stainless steel screens with an opening diameter of 1 5 cm 2 2 substrate and operations of abd leachate collected from the municipal solid waste transfer station of kuala lumpur mswtskl malaysia was sieved for impurities plastic glasses etc before being sent to ukm 13 times throughout the operations with each supply analysed for leachate characterization as shown in table 1 this transfer station s leachate had high organic contents with a total volatile fatty acids tvfas value of 10 049 1306 mg hoac l which caused its ph to be low in value 4 28 0 19 the leachate also showed high concentrations of soluble chemical oxygen demand cod and 5 day biological oxygen demand bod5 whose values were 38 204 2796 and 27 816 5314 respectively the nitrogen content of the leachate is represented by total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn which is the sum of the amount of free ammonia nitrogen fan and organic nitrogen 21 which showed values of 504 71 mg nh3 n l and 446 62 mg nh3 n l for tkn and fan respectively see table 1 since nitrogen content is not biodegraded in an anaerobic system its concentration needs to be observed during an operation to prevent the accumulation of ammonia beyond the threshold toxicity value of 3000 mg nh3 n l 22 23 the start up for the abd was performed by feeding the substrate mswtskl s leachate into a seeded digester at a rate of 30 l day for the first week and 60 l day during the next 3 weeks without ph amendment to allow the biomass to acclimatize to the leachate s complex characteristics 24 after start up the abd was run for subsequent hrts of 30 25 20 and 10 day for 163 days based on the operational conditions such as organic loading rate olr cycles and sampling days as shown in table 2 to attain steady state conditions the abd was run for 2 or 3 cycles except for the 25 day hrt which was not done due to a technical glitch the leachate was fed daily into the abd by amending the flow rates of the feed based on hrts the influent s cod concentration was almost constant 38 204 2796 mg l which explained why when the hrt was decreased olr increased effluents were collected at sampling points a and b refer to fig 1 to measure several parameters for monitoring purposes these effluents were collected into hdpe bottles and stored according to epa guidelines 25 for biogas monitoring biogas composition was measured using a portable biogas analyser every morning before the abd was fed with the leachate then due to the inconsistent measurements caused by the low pressure of the biogas a fixed thermal mass flow metre was installed to measure biogas volume beginning on 25 day hrt operation and onwards the flow metre sensor was retained in its default setting composition values of 68 methane ch4 30 carbon dioxide co2 and 2 gas nitrogen n2 which were based on the average maximum ch4 values measured during the 30 day hrt 2 3 analytical methods the ph and temperature of substrates were determined using test probes while bod5 suspended solids total suspended solid tss and volatile suspended solid vss alkalinity and fan were assessed in accordance with the standard method for the examination of water and wastewater 26 for measurements of cod and tvfas the samples were first filtered using 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate filter paper before being analysed using the reactor digestion method hach cod high range dr 6000 spectrophotometer and the esterification method hach method 8196 dr 6000 spectrophotometer respectively for total chemical oxygen demand tcod the same method for cod was used only that the sample was not filtered all the laboratory analyses were commenced in duplicate at a room temperature of 25 2 c and the resulting values were presented in the basic statistical evaluation of average and standard deviation 3 kinetic models kinetic evaluations are very important for industrial reactor design as the results obtained from experimental studies on a laboratory or pilot scale can be applied in the estimation of treatment efficiency of an industrial scale reactor under the same operational conditions for this paper various kinetic models such as monod msk and sog were utilized using cod removal data throughout operations to determine substrate removal kinetic parameters in addition msk for gas generation and vdmh kinetic models were used to determine the rates of total biogas and ch4 gas production 13 27 31 the data attained from operating the abd in a steady state with various concentrations of feed substrate were used to determine the kinetic coefficients of all models involved 3 1 substrate removal kinetics 3 1 1 monod equation for a pilot scale abd without biomass recycling the rate of change of the biomass dx dt and the substrate ds dt in the system can be expressed using eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 dx dt q x 0 v q x e v x μ k d 2 ds dt q s 0 v qs v μx y where x0 x and xe mg vss l are biomass concentrations in the influent inside the digester and in the effluent respectively q l day is the influent rate based on hrt v l is the digester volume μ day 1 is specific growth rate kd day 1 is the decay rate constant s0 and s mg cod l are influent and effluent substrate concentrations respectively and y mg vss mg cod is the yield coefficient the ratio of the total biomass in the digester to the biomass wasted per given time is called solid retention time srt θ day as represented in eq 3 while the relationship between μ day 1 and the rate limiting substrate concentration ks mg l is expressed by the monod equation see eq 4 if it is assumed that the biomass concentration in the influent x0 is negligible at steady state dx dt 0 ds dt 0 eq 5 and 6 below can be obtained by substituting eq 3 and 4 into eq 1 and 2 3 θ day vx q x e 4 μ μ max s k s s 5 μ 1 θ k d 6 sμ max s k s 1 θ k d the kinetic parameters y mg vss mg cod kd day 1 μmax day 1 and ks

steady state conditions 7 s 0 s θx 1 y 1 θ k d y 8 θ 1 θ k d k s μ max 1 s 1 μ max 9 s mg cod l k s k d 1 θ μ max 1 θ k d 3 1 2 msk model the msk model is mathematically expressed as follows 10 ds dt q v s 0 s 11 ds dt u max q s 0 v k b q s 0 v 12 v q s 0 s k b u max v q s 0 1 u max where ds dt mg l day is substrate removal rate q l day is influent flow rate v l is the digester s volume s0 mg cod

equation will be modified to eq 16 where a equals s 0 k 2 s x and b is a constant greater than unity while e is expressed as s 0 s s 0 16 θ e a bθ the values of the kinetic constants a and b dimensionless can be obtained from eq 16 by plotting a graph of θ e against θ while the substrate concentration in the effluent can be calculated by substituting eq 15 into eq 17 17 s s 0 1 θ bθ a 3 2 biogas and methane production kinetics 3 2 1 msk model for gas production as with substrate removal biogas production rates can be mathematically modelled based on the msk model the total gas and ch4 production rates are influenced by cod removal and olr as shown in eq 18 and 19 32 33 18 1 g g b g max 1 olr 1 g max 19 1 m m b m max 1 olr 1 m max where g ml l day and m ml l day are specific production rates for biogas and ch4 gas respectively based on the formula q gas v t g max ml l day and m max ml l day are the maximum specific production rates for biogas and ch4 gas respectively while g b and m b are ratio constants of biogas and ch4 gas production respectively 3 2 2 vdmh model the vdmh model is used to determine ch4 production rate 34 which is related to the kinetics constant of vdmh ksg the influent flow rate and cod removal efficiency as shown in eq 20 20 v m k sg q s 0 s where v m l ch4 day is ch4 production rate and q l day is the influent flowrate based on hrts while s 0 and s are the influent s and effluent s cod respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 reactor performance 4 1 1 reactor conditions after a short and successful start up period the abd was operated at different hrts and olrs refer to table 2 throughout the operations both of its parts abd a and the abd b were assessed in terms of temperature ph alkalinity tvfas and vss refer to table 3 in order to determine whether the abd was operating in a stable condition based on the results the abd operated in a mesophilic condition at temperatures of 28 c to 41 c and its ph was within the optimal range of 7 0 to 7 8 throughout the operation 22 in this study the alkalinity measured for abd a ranged from 13 795 1252 to 15 369 1618 mg caco3 l while abd b showed alkalinity values of 6562 260 to 7524 2442 mg caco3 l these values are higher compared to the range of 2000 to 4000 mg caco3 l for the generally stable anaerobic digestion process 26 but also seem to be common for the high rate anaerobic digester as described in previous research 35 36 the higher alkalinity value the greater buffering capacity possessed by abd making it able to receive a high concentration of tvfas 10 049 1306 mg hoac l from the leachate refer to table 1 since vss correlates to the concentration of biomass in wastewater samples 26 37 this matter explains the low values of tvfa detected in abd a and abd b effluents refer to table 3 vfa also identified as the readily biodegradable cod rbcod fraction is food for biomass in the methanogenesis process which converts it to ch4 gas 38 39 these optimal conditions maintained throughout 163 days of operations indicate that the abd was stable other than that the concentration of fan amassed inside the abd did not exceed the toxic limitation onset of 3000 mg nh3 n l 22 with values ranging from 898 107 to 1053 72 mg nh3 n l refer to table 3 throughout the process of abd operations 4 1 2 cod removal and biogas production during 30 day hrt abd operated in a mean olr of 1 27 0 12 g cod l day with an average cod concentration of 38 543 2752 mg l of leachate refer to table 4 as the results presented in table 4 show in order to evaluate cod removal efficiency in higher olr the hrt was reduced from 30 days to 10 days with a final input olr of 3 58 1 39 g cod l day in that condition the increase in cod removal efficiency of abd was 97 1 during the 30 day hrt and 98 for the rest of the lower hrts 25 days till 10 days refer to table 4 compared with the results of other studies such as that which reported anaerobic membrane bioreactors experience problems with high and low influent concentrations 40 and that which reported that the anaerobic migrating blanket reactor showed a low cod removal efficiency 85 and below 13 anaerobic digesters with biofilm and granular technologies have seemingly shown constant and great increases in cod removal performance with more than 95 efficiency throughout most operations 41 43 furthermore for the relationship between biogas production volume and compositions and olr refer to table 4 the results indicate that in the subsequent olrs of 1 27 0 12 g cod l day 30 day hrt and 1 62 0 19 g cod l day 25 day hrt the ch4 composition in the generated biogas increased from 56 11 to 59 11 biogas volume which was measured starting on 25 day hrt displayed a slight decrease from 26 1 m3 to 24 1 m3 during 20 day hrt the ch4 percentage for 20 day hrt also went down to 54 11 as listed in table 4 the values of tcod cod and pcod of leachate for 25 day hrt and 20 day hrt are similar therefore the biogas production decline shown on the 20 day hrt might have been affected by the use of feed substrate for biomass growth as revealed by the increased vss inside abd a refer to table 3 from 19 908 3456 mg l during 25 day hrt to 24 328 3689 mg l 20 day hrt hence directing feed substrate consumption away from biogas generation 44 during 10 day hrt the olr value doubled from 1 80 0 14 g cod l day 20 day hrt to 3 58 1 39 g cod l day instead of a decrease the biogas volume stayed constant at 24 1 m3 and ch4 composition went up to 62 13 to justify this observation it can be said that methane producing bacteria might be the majority group residing inside abd amid the decrease of vss value from 24 328 3689 mg l 20 day hrt to 20 679 4370 mg l 10 day hrt refer to table 3 the higher cod value of leachate during 10 day hrt refer to table 4 might contain organic acids readily consumed by these methane producing bacteria which explains the higher percentage of ch4 composition during 10 day hrt 4 2 determination of kinetic coefficients for substrate removal models 4 2 1 monod model the biomass growth rate graph was plotted refer to fig 3 a based on eq 7 to obtain the value of yield coefficient y and the decay rate constant kd for the monod kinetic model which was determined through the calculation of gradient value 1 y and axial intercept k d y which are 0 203 g vss g cod and 0 002 days 1 respectively with a regression coefficient r2 0 7723 the values of maximum specific growth rate μmax and the rate limiting substrate concentration ks for the monod model were determined by plotting a linear graph based on eq 8 where ks as well as μmax were obtained from the results of calculating the gradient k s μ max and the axial intercept 1 μ max as shown in fig 3 b and are valued at 3 g cod l and 0 182 day 1 respectively with r2 0 1734 the values of y 0 203 g vss g cod and kd 0 002 day 1 obtained from the pilot scale abd system for the monod model are in the range of values indicated by the high performance anaerobic digestive systems refer to table 5 a treating various types of high concentration industrial substrates 7 45 rakmi et al 49 stated that a kinetic study on the anaerobic digestion of substrates with low digestibility produced a lower μmax value but a higher ks value than the effluent value as shown by the results of this present study where the abd effluent cod concentration range value is 764 to 1235 mg cod l refer to table 4 which is much lower than the ks value of 3000 mg cod l the presence of a high lipid content in mswtskl leachate as shown by fig 4 affects the digestibility rate of this complex substrate which can be seen in the particulate cod value pcod of the leachate itself and the corresponding increase in pcod concentration in the abd abd a system with the increase in hrt refer to table 4 the decrease in the pcod of abd a from 80 906 6701 mg cod l 30 day hrt to 59 340 5318 mg cod l 25 day hrt was due to the sludge removal process after 30 day hrt operation which is done to keep abd in good condition to receive increasing leachate inputs in the subsequent hrts operation in addition the low kd and μmax values are also influenced by the high biomass concentrations and low sludge production rates in anaerobic digestive systems 50 whose results in this abd system study can be seen when srt shows a high value refer to table 4 thus signifying effective role of the biofilm portion on process stability via biomass retention which allows the system to cope with changes in olr of mswtskl leachate for an optimal treatment process 4 2 2 msk model based on eq 12 a linear graph of v q s 0 s against v q s 0 is plotted and the value of the gradient k b u max and axial intercept 1 u max is matched to the value of the gradient and the axial intercept of the equation shown in fig 3 c r2 0 9997 y 1 0308 0 0024 to determine the values of saturation value constant kb and maximum utilization rate constant umax for cod removal in the abd which are 430 and 417 g cod l day respectively in a previous study conducted by senturk et al 31 who used a mesophilic anaerobic contact reactor system in treating food processing wastewater the umax value for cod removal was 22 925 g tcod l day meanwhile in a study conducted by ebrahimi et al 13 which involved compost leachate treatment using an anaerobic migrating blanket reactor showed a higher value of umax 172 4 g cod l day compared to umax obtained from pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by anaerobic hybrid reactor 30 which had a value of 108 69 g cod l day a comparison with the results of previous studies refer to table 5 a above show that abd produces a higher umax value of 417 g cod l day influent characteristics treatment system configuration the community of microorganisms involved and organic as well as hydraulic loads are among factors influencing the differences in kinetic parameter values between systems 5 27 when the umax 417 g cod l day was found to be higher in value than the maximum olr 3 58 1 39 g cod l day it showed that the pilot scale abd system was still able to receive substrate samples with a high concentration however if the umax and kb of the treatment system were to give similar values this situation would suggest that a continuous increase in olr can lead to a decline in the work performance of the treatment system 31 46 4 2 3 sog model the kinetic parameters of the sog model namely a b and the second order substrate removal rate constant k2 s were determined from eq 15 and eq 16 the values of a and b are taken from the values of the axial intercept and the gradient respectively of the equation shown in fig 3 d y 1 0199 0 8553 r2 0 9995 namely 0 886 no dimension and 1 02 no dimension moreover k2 s is calculated from equation a s 0 k 2 s x and gives a value of 4 04 1 16 days 1 based on the cod degradation result the value of k2 s depends on the influent concentration s0 and the biomass concentration x in the reactor tank 5 27 this proved to be true in a study conducted by ozturk et al 47 in which the treatment of young leachate from a sanitary landfill using a uasb system presented a high k2 s value of 38 5 days 1 refer to table 5 a compared to the abd system the cod concentration of the leachate from the abd system study 37 4 2 1 g cod l was higher than that of the ozturk et al 47 study sample 9 0 25 3 g cod l however due to the high concentration of biomass in abd the resulting k2 s value is lower than that found by ozturk et al 47 the results are similar to those from monod and msk kinetic analysis sog kinetic analysis also proved that the high biomass concentration in abd enabled it to receive higher cod concentrations of leachate than the existing ones 4 2 4 evaluation of substrate removal kinetic models the value of the regression coefficient r2 shown on each linear graph plot for all three models refer to fig 3 b 3 c and 3 d is high for msk r2 0 9997 and sog r2 0 9995 compared to that of the monod model r2 0 1734 in summary the msk and sog kinetic models are more suitable for use than the monod kinetic model in describing the work performance of the pilot scale abd system that treats leachate kinetic model such as monod involves the observed values of active biomass in treatment systems 31 46 sampling for active biomass in pilot and industrial scale biofilm and granular treatment systems is very complicated to perform accurately and only depends on the vss values observed from a treatment system effluent therefore msk and sog kinetic models are preferred because they use baseline parameter values observed during the monitoring process for the calculation of kinetic parameter values 13 29 31 to test the validity of the kinetic model used the predicted effluent cod concentration codp was calculated based on the equations published by the three kinetic models involved namely eq 9 for the monod model eq 13 for the msk model and eq 17 for the sog model subsequently the codp values of the kinetic models were compared with the observed effluent cod concentrations measured cod codm 13 27 in the pilot scale abd system by plotting a linear graph as shown in fig 5 the linear graph of codp versus codm for the sog kinetic model shows higher regression coefficient values r2 0 0479 compared to those of the monod r2 0 0223 and msk r2 0 0291 models to confirm these results the mean values and standard deviations of codp for these three models please refer to table 6 a are compared with the values of codm 32 the results show that the codp value for the sog kinetic model is more similar to the codm value compared to other kinetic models with its minimum and maximum codp closer in values to the minimum and maximum codm in the pilot scale abd system 4 3 determination of kinetic coefficients in biogas production models 4 3 1 msk model for gas production based on eq 18 as well as a plot of a linear graph of 1 g against 1 olr the value of the gradient g b g max and the axial intercept 1 g max is matched to the value of the gradient and axial intercept of the equation shown in fig 6 a r2 0 1996 y 0 00004 0 0003 to determine the values of the ratio constant of biogas gb and the maximum specific production rate for biogas gmax which are 0 13 no dimensions and 3333 ml l day respectively for ch4 generation eq 19 is matched to the plot equation of a linear graph of 1 m against 1 olr as shown in fig 6 b r2 0 1996 y 0 00006 0 0004 where a matching of the gradient value m b m max and the axial intercept 1 m max yields a ratio constant of ch4 mb 0 15 no dimension and a maximum specific production rate for ch4 mmax of 2500 ml l day the values of gmax 3333 ml l day and mmax 2500 ml l day obtained from this research are higher than those found by kuscu and sponza 32 who treated synthetic wastewater using an anaerobic migrating blanket reactor system which yielded a value of gmax of 1666 7 ml l day and an mmax of 476 2 ml l day however a comparison with the gmax and mmax values found by ebrahimi et al 13 gmax 35 714 ml l day mmax 12 195 ml l day and wang et al 48 gmax 26 800 ml l day mmax 17 500 ml l day refer table 5 b where each treated leachate of composting and carbohydrate containing wastewater shows treatment of mswtskl s leachate using this pilot scale abd system results in low biogas and ch4 generation rates the difference in gmax and mmax values shown by these studies reveals that high influent cod concentrations refer to table 5 b play an important role in producing an encouraging rate of biogas and ch4 generation furthermore treatment system configuration is key as shown in the research by wang et al 48 who used microbial electrolysis cells mecs to increase the rate of biogas generation by accelerating the rate of vfa degradation 4 3 2 vdmh model eq 20 is used to determine the value of the kinetic constant ksg in the vdmh model ksg is calculated by matching it with the value of the gradient of the equation obtained from a plot of the linear graph of vm against q s0 s as shown in fig 6 c r2 0 1851 y 0 0609 17 602 the ksg value of the vdmh model for this abd system is 0 0609 l ch4 g cod a comparison of ksg values was made please refer to table 5 b the study conducted by wang et al 48 showed a ksg value 3 times higher than that of the abd system study which had a value of 0 1836 l ch4 g cod as described in the msk model for gas generation above system configuration plays a role in the production of high constant values the study conducted by ebrahimi et al 13 and kuscu and sponza 32 found ksg values of 0 0473 l ch4 g cod and 0 0947 l ch4 g cod respectively however the ksg results found by the studies of ebrahimi et al 13 kuscu and sponza 32 and wang et al 48 are not described further as the r2 value shown by the vdmh linear graph plot is lower than that of the msk model plotted for comparison of ch4 generation values in those studies 4 3 3 model testing biogas and ch4 generation from this present study was measured using two kinetic models of biogas production namely msk for gas generation and vdmh which showed low r2 values of 0 1996 and 0 1851 respectively to test the validity of the kinetic models of biogas production used the predicted volume of biogas and ch4 were calculated based on eq 18 and eq 19 for the msk model and eq 20 for the vdmh model the results of the predicted volume calculation as well as the observation results are plotted into a linear graph of the predicted gas production rate against the measured gas production rate as shown in fig 6 d biogas generation for the msk model fig 6 e ch4 generation for the msk model and fig 6 f ch4 generation for the vdmh model the plot results show that the r2 graph of the predicted ch4 production rate against the measured ch4 production rate for the msk model is higher than that of the vdmh model a comparison of the average minimum and maximum values of biogas and ch4 also shows that the predicted production rates produced by the msk model are close to the measured values refer to table 6 b 5 conclusion the pilot scale abd system was stable throughout its operation and showed optimal average values for the monitored parameters such as ph 7 53 0 14 total volatile fatty acid 79 66 mg hoac l alkalinity 10 919 1556 mg caco3 l and a non toxic value for accumulated fan 960 106 mg nh3 n l the system also showed great performance with average cod removal efficiency of 98 1 and the average daily biogas production of 25 1 m3 day with a composition of 57 12 ch4 and 26 6 co2 this showcase of high performance is due to the biofilm technology leading to long srt which is 156 135 145 and 72 days for 30 day 25 day 20 day and 10 day hrts respectively as for kinetic studies the results of the substrate removal kinetic analysis show that the sog model is more suitable for use than the monod and msk models in predicting the work performance of the abd system in treating mswtskl leachate for the same operating conditions but at different scales while the msk kinetic model for gas production shows results of kinetic analysis that are close to the values of the measured biogas and ch4 production rates than the vdmh model shows declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

12710,in this study leachate from municipal solid waste msw transfer station was treated in a pilot scale anaerobic biofilm digester abd system under 30 25 20 and 10 day hrt the maximum cod concentration entering the reactor was 46 944 mg l and the reactor was under full operation for 163 days the results showed that cod removal efficiency was above 95 throughout the operation and measurement of the average daily biogas production yielded a value of 25 1 m3 day with a composition of 57 12 methane and 26 6 carbon dioxide in comparison to the monod and modified stover kincannon msk models the second order grau model presented the best fit as a substrate removal kinetic model for this abd system with its r2 0 999 while the msk model for gas generation was proven to be a better fit than the van der meer and heertjes model in predicting the amount of biogas and methane gas produced from leachate treatment via a pilot scale abd keywords anaerobic biofilm digester leachate kinetic substrate removal biogas data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the main cause of the environmental problem that relates to generated leachate at municipal solid waste msw disposal facilities especially in developing countries is the lack of proper treatment technologies for example in malaysia the sequencing batch reactor sbr has been used as the main leachate treatment system at sanitary landfills and transfer stations 1 however this reactor has been deemed unfit for use in 90 of msw disposal facilities around the country due to its high cost and vast land use in these msw facilities that do not use sbr an integrated system of anaerobic pond and facultative lagoons has been installed just like in indonesia nevertheless these facilities have shown inefficiency with long residence time slow degradation rate and pungent odour release 2 3 it is a known fact that biological processes aerobic and anaerobic are the best options in treating wastewater with high organic content however the use of an aerobic system as the main treatment technology in developing countries is not sustainable and is too costly due to the high usage of electrical power for aeration and the price of disposal of hazardous sludge 1 4 in contrast to the problematic conventional anaerobic digestion reactors anaerobic digesters with granules e g up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor or biofilm technologies e g anaerobic filter af and anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor anmbbr have shown high work performance in treating various types of industrial wastewaters such as those from the textile 5 6 and chemical industries 7 beside palm oil mill effluent pome 2 uasb reactors employ sludge granules which are colonies of several classes of microbes that take part in the bioconversion these microbial cells collect and form the sludge granules without the support carriers 8 uasb reactor is known to be inefficient in treating wastewater with colloidal particles because these substances thwart microbial activity causing the sludge to become fluffier and de granulate into flocs and washed out of the reactor together with the microbes attached onto it 9 this situation was proven previously by hawkes et al 10 whose research showed the treatment of ice cream wastewater using uasb reactor gave the poorest performance approximately 50 total cod removal at an organic loading rate olr of 2 kg cod m 3d 1 compared to the af around 67 total cod removal at an olr of 6 kg cod m 3d 1 since successful granulation was not achieved by uasb while in anaerobic digesters with biofilm technology such as af and anmbbr the microbes are fixed in biofilms on plastic carriers inside the reactor 11 microbial cells grow and poliferate within the biofilm but when the thickness of the biofilm increases past a certain value the film becomes detached from the carrier surface and sloughed out to be swapped by fresh cells and henceforth the biofilm thickness stays constant throughout the operation of the bioreactor there is no need for sludge recycle since the microbial cells stay attached to the support carriers and do not leave the bioreactor 8 that s why in contrast to uasb these biofilm reactors have displayed great work performance in treating high lipid and colloidal wastewaters such as dairy wastewater 12 ice cream wastewater 10 and compost leachate 13 with high organic pollutant removal and long biomass retention inside the digester in asean countries other than singapore and brunei more than 50 of solid wastes collected consist of organic and food waste 14 15 making the contents of generated leachate high in colloidal particles fat oil and protein the use of anaerobic biofilm digesters in treating leachate from msw facilities is not widely reported even in laboratory scale studies furthermore the performance shown by a laboratory scale treatment system is quite hard to compare with a commercial scale system due to the wide gap of differences in condition most laboratory scale systems could be set up with default optimum conditions while commercial systems mostly depend on the surrounding environment e g on the monsoon season and on draught hence conducting a pilot scale study would be better as its design and operation conditions would be almost like a commercial scale system to gain a clear understanding kinetic models could be used to control and predict a system s operation performance and to optimize the system design from the pilot scale to the commercial scale 5 16 in anaerobic digestion kinetic models simulate substrate removal kinetics and biogas production 17 the kinetics of substrate removal is studied along with some key measures including substrate utilization rate biomass growth rate and kinetic coefficients a system s work performance biomass production or substrate removal depends on a substrate s contents and a reactor s conditions ph temperature and dissolved oxygen 18 among the models used for substrate degradation and biogas production kinetics monod second order grau sog modified stover kincannon msk and van der meeer and heertjes vdmh seem to be extensively used due to their simplified mathematical equations other than that these kinetic models involve only a few of parameters as variables used to determine the kinetic constants which are easy to monitor and measure especially on a commercial scale 19 in this study a pilot scale anaerobic biofilm digester abd system was operated for the treatment of leachate from an msw transfer station in malaysia under 30 25 20 and 10 day hydraulic retention time hrt this paper presents the evaluation of kinetic studies which involved three different models monod sog and msk for substrate removal kinetics additionally in order to check the kinetic constants of biogas production msk for gas generation and vdmh models were used 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale abd system set up a pilot scale abd system was constructed in an open environment at the biogas site of universiti kebangsaan malaysia ukm bangi malaysia under the hot and humid weather that lasts throughout the year this treatment system consisted of a pilot scale abd with a working volume of 5 95 m3 and a biogas bioscrubber in this paper the discussions will only involve abd no data on the biogas bioscrubber is presented as presented in fig 1 the abd was divided into two parts abd a and abd b with only a 1 ft opening interconnecting both parts to prevent feed mix up with the discharged effluent throughout operation the obtained results had shown a pattern indicating abd a acted more as a digester while abd b behaved similarly like a clarifier 20 each part of abd was filled with 5000 units of 3 dimensional 3 d high density polyethylene hdpe media for biofilm attachment fig 2 shows the dimensions and characteristics of the 3 d hdpe media provided by envirosource sdn bhd to make sure that the plastic media stayed inside the abd the inlets and outlets were fitted with stainless steel screens with an opening diameter of 1 5 cm 2 2 substrate and operations of abd leachate collected from the municipal solid waste transfer station of kuala lumpur mswtskl malaysia was sieved for impurities plastic glasses etc before being sent to ukm 13 times throughout the operations with each supply analysed for leachate characterization as shown in table 1 this transfer station s leachate had high organic contents with a total volatile fatty acids tvfas value of 10 049 1306 mg hoac l which caused its ph to be low in value 4 28 0 19 the leachate also showed high concentrations of soluble chemical oxygen demand cod and 5 day biological oxygen demand bod5 whose values were 38 204 2796 and 27 816 5314 respectively the nitrogen content of the leachate is represented by total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn which is the sum of the amount of free ammonia nitrogen fan and organic nitrogen 21 which showed values of 504 71 mg nh3 n l and 446 62 mg nh3 n l for tkn and fan respectively see table 1 since nitrogen content is not biodegraded in an anaerobic system its concentration needs to be observed during an operation to prevent the accumulation of ammonia beyond the threshold toxicity value of 3000 mg nh3 n l 22 23 the start up for the abd was performed by feeding the substrate mswtskl s leachate into a seeded digester at a rate of 30 l day for the first week and 60 l day during the next 3 weeks without ph amendment to allow the biomass to acclimatize to the leachate s complex characteristics 24 after start up the abd was run for subsequent hrts of 30 25 20 and 10 day for 163 days based on the operational conditions such as organic loading rate olr cycles and sampling days as shown in table 2 to attain steady state conditions the abd was run for 2 or 3 cycles except for the 25 day hrt which was not done due to a technical glitch the leachate was fed daily into the abd by amending the flow rates of the feed based on hrts the influent s cod concentration was almost constant 38 204 2796 mg l which explained why when the hrt was decreased olr increased effluents were collected at sampling points a and b refer to fig 1 to measure several parameters for monitoring purposes these effluents were collected into hdpe bottles and stored according to epa guidelines 25 for biogas monitoring biogas composition was measured using a portable biogas analyser every morning before the abd was fed with the leachate then due to the inconsistent measurements caused by the low pressure of the biogas a fixed thermal mass flow metre was installed to measure biogas volume beginning on 25 day hrt operation and onwards the flow metre sensor was retained in its default setting composition values of 68 methane ch4 30 carbon dioxide co2 and 2 gas nitrogen n2 which were based on the average maximum ch4 values measured during the 30 day hrt 2 3 analytical methods the ph and temperature of substrates were determined using test probes while bod5 suspended solids total suspended solid tss and volatile suspended solid vss alkalinity and fan were assessed in accordance with the standard method for the examination of water and wastewater 26 for measurements of cod and tvfas the samples were first filtered using 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate filter paper before being analysed using the reactor digestion method hach cod high range dr 6000 spectrophotometer and the esterification method hach method 8196 dr 6000 spectrophotometer respectively for total chemical oxygen demand tcod the same method for cod was used only that the sample was not filtered all the laboratory analyses were commenced in duplicate at a room temperature of 25 2 c and the resulting values were presented in the basic statistical evaluation of average and standard deviation 3 kinetic models kinetic evaluations are very important for industrial reactor design as the results obtained from experimental studies on a laboratory or pilot scale can be applied in the estimation of treatment efficiency of an industrial scale reactor under the same operational conditions for this paper various kinetic models such as monod msk and sog were utilized using cod removal data throughout operations to determine substrate removal kinetic parameters in addition msk for gas generation and vdmh kinetic models were used to determine the rates of total biogas and ch4 gas production 13 27 31 the data attained from operating the abd in a steady state with various concentrations of feed substrate were used to determine the kinetic coefficients of all models involved 3 1 substrate removal kinetics 3 1 1 monod equation for a pilot scale abd without biomass recycling the rate of change of the biomass dx dt and the substrate ds dt in the system can be expressed using eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 dx dt q x 0 v q x e v x μ k d 2 ds dt q s 0 v qs v μx y where x0 x and xe mg vss l are biomass concentrations in the influent inside the digester and in the effluent respectively q l day is the influent rate based on hrt v l is the digester volume μ day 1 is specific growth rate kd day 1 is the decay rate constant s0 and s mg cod l are influent and effluent substrate concentrations respectively and y mg vss mg cod is the yield coefficient the ratio of the total biomass in the digester to the biomass wasted per given time is called solid retention time srt θ day as represented in eq 3 while the relationship between μ day 1 and the rate limiting substrate concentration ks mg l is expressed by the monod equation see eq 4 if it is assumed that the biomass concentration in the influent x0 is negligible at steady state dx dt 0 ds dt 0 eq 5 and 6 below can be obtained by substituting eq 3 and 4 into eq 1 and 2 3 θ day vx q x e 4 μ μ max s k s s 5 μ 1 θ k d 6 sμ max s k s 1 θ k d the kinetic parameters y mg vss mg cod kd day 1 μmax day 1 and ks

dimensionless can be obtained from eq 16 by plotting a graph of θ e against θ while the substrate concentration in the effluent can be calculated by substituting eq 15 into eq 17 17 s s 0 1 θ bθ a 3 2 biogas and methane production kinetics 3 2 1 msk model for gas production as with substrate removal biogas production rates can be mathematically modelled based on the msk model the total gas and ch4 production rates are influenced by cod removal and olr as shown in eq 18 and 19 32 33 18 1 g g b g max 1 olr 1 g max 19 1 m m b m max 1 olr 1 m max where g ml l day and m ml l day are specific production rates for biogas and ch4 gas respectively based on the formula q gas v t g max ml l day and m max ml l day are the maximum specific production rates for biogas and ch4 gas respectively while g b and m b are ratio constants of biogas and ch4 gas production respectively 3 2 2 vdmh model the vdmh model is used to determine ch4 production rate 34 which is related to the kinetics constant of vdmh ksg the influent flow rate and cod removal efficiency as shown in eq 20 20 v m k sg q s 0 s where v m l ch4 day is ch4 production rate and q l day is the influent flowrate based on hrts while s 0 and s are the influent s and effluent s cod respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 reactor performance 4 1 1 reactor conditions after a short and successful start up period the abd was operated at different hrts and olrs refer to table 2 throughout the operations both of its parts abd a and the abd b were assessed in terms of temperature ph alkalinity tvfas and vss refer to table 3 in order to determine whether the abd was operating in a stable condition based on the results the abd operated in a mesophilic condition at temperatures of 28 c to 41 c and its ph was within the optimal range of 7 0 to 7 8 throughout the operation 22 in this study the alkalinity measured for abd a ranged from 13 795 1252 to 15 369 1618 mg caco3 l while abd b showed alkalinity values of 6562 260 to 7524 2442 mg caco3 l these values are higher compared to the range of 2000 to 4000 mg caco3 l for the generally stable anaerobic digestion process 26 but also seem to be common for the high rate anaerobic digester as described in previous research 35 36 the higher alkalinity value the greater buffering capacity possessed by abd making it able to receive a high concentration of tvfas 10 049 1306 mg hoac l from the leachate refer to table 1 since vss correlates to the concentration of biomass in wastewater samples 26 37 this matter explains the low values of tvfa detected in abd a and abd b effluents refer to table 3 vfa also identified as the readily biodegradable cod rbcod fraction is food for biomass in the methanogenesis process which converts it to ch4 gas 38 39 these optimal conditions maintained throughout 163 days of operations indicate that the abd was stable other than that the concentration of fan amassed inside the abd did not exceed the toxic limitation onset of 3000 mg nh3 n l 22 with values ranging from 898 107 to 1053 72 mg nh3 n l refer to table 3 throughout the process of abd operations 4 1 2 cod removal and biogas production during 30 day hrt abd operated in a mean olr of 1 27 0 12 g cod l day with an average cod concentration of 38 543 2752 mg l of leachate refer to table 4 as the results presented in table 4 show in order to evaluate cod removal efficiency in higher olr the hrt was reduced from 30 days to 10 days with a final input olr of 3 58 1 39 g cod l day in that condition the increase in cod removal efficiency of abd was 97 1 during the 30 day hrt and 98 for the rest of the lower hrts 25 days till 10 days refer to table 4 compared with the results of other studies such as that which reported anaerobic membrane bioreactors experience problems with high and low influent concentrations 40 and that which reported that the anaerobic migrating blanket reactor showed a low cod removal efficiency 85 and below 13 anaerobic digesters with biofilm and granular technologies have seemingly shown constant and great increases in cod removal performance with more than 95 efficiency throughout most operations 41 43 furthermore for the relationship between biogas production volume and compositions and olr refer to table 4 the results indicate that in the subsequent olrs of 1 27 0 12 g cod l day 30 day hrt and 1 62 0 19 g cod l day 25 day hrt the ch4 composition in the generated biogas increased from 56 11 to 59 11 biogas volume which was measured starting on 25 day hrt displayed a slight decrease from 26 1 m3 to 24 1 m3 during 20 day hrt the ch4 percentage for 20 day hrt also went down to 54 11 as listed in table 4 the values of tcod cod and pcod of leachate for 25 day hrt and 20 day hrt are similar therefore the biogas production decline shown on the 20 day hrt might have been affected by the use of feed substrate for biomass growth as revealed by the increased vss inside abd a refer to table 3 from 19 908 3456 mg l during 25 day hrt to 24 328 3689 mg l 20 day hrt hence directing feed substrate consumption away from biogas generation 44 during 10 day hrt the olr value doubled from 1 80 0 14 g cod l day 20 day hrt to 3 58 1 39 g cod l day instead of a decrease the biogas volume stayed constant at 24 1 m3 and ch4 composition went up to 62 13 to justify this observation it can be said that methane producing bacteria might be the majority group residing inside abd amid the decrease of vss value from 24 328 3689 mg l 20 day hrt to 20 679 4370 mg l 10 day hrt refer to table 3 the higher cod value of leachate during 10 day hrt refer to table 4 might contain organic acids readily consumed by these methane producing bacteria which explains the higher percentage of ch4 composition during 10 day hrt 4 2 determination of kinetic coefficients for substrate removal models 4 2 1 monod model the biomass growth rate graph was plotted refer to fig 3 a based on eq 7 to obtain the value of yield coefficient y and the decay rate constant kd for the monod kinetic model which was determined through the calculation of gradient value 1 y and axial intercept k d y which are 0 203 g vss g cod and 0 002 days 1 respectively with a regression coefficient r2 0 7723 the values of maximum specific growth rate μmax and the rate limiting substrate concentration ks for the monod model were determined by plotting a linear graph based on eq 8 where ks as well as μmax were obtained from the results of calculating the gradient k s μ max and the axial intercept 1 μ max as shown in fig 3 b and are valued at 3 g cod l and 0 182 day 1 respectively with r2 0 1734 the values of y 0 203 g vss g cod and kd 0 002 day 1 obtained from the pilot scale abd system for the monod model are in the range of values indicated by the high performance anaerobic digestive systems refer to table 5 a treating various types of high concentration industrial substrates 7 45 rakmi et al 49 stated that a kinetic study on the anaerobic digestion of substrates with low digestibility produced a lower μmax value but a higher ks value than the effluent value as shown by the results of this present study where the abd effluent cod concentration range value is 764 to 1235 mg cod l refer to table 4 which is much lower than the ks value of 3000 mg cod l the presence of a high lipid content in mswtskl leachate as shown by fig 4 affects the digestibility rate of this complex substrate which can be seen in the particulate cod value pcod of the leachate itself and the corresponding increase in pcod concentration in the abd abd a system with the increase in hrt refer to table 4 the decrease in the pcod of abd a from 80 906 6701 mg cod l 30 day hrt to 59 340 5318 mg cod l 25 day hrt was due to the sludge removal process after 30 day hrt operation which is done to keep abd in good condition to receive increasing leachate inputs in the subsequent hrts operation in addition the low kd and μmax values are also influenced by the high biomass concentrations and low sludge production rates in anaerobic digestive systems 50 whose results in this abd system study can be seen when srt shows a high value refer to table 4 thus signifying effective role of the biofilm portion on process stability via biomass retention which allows the system to cope with changes in olr of mswtskl leachate for an optimal treatment process 4 2 2 msk model based on eq 12 a linear graph of v q s 0 s against v q s 0 is plotted and the value of the gradient k b u max and axial intercept 1 u max is matched to the value of the gradient and the axial intercept of the equation shown in fig 3 c r2 0 9997 y 1 0308 0 0024 to determine the values of saturation value constant kb and maximum utilization rate constant umax for cod removal in the abd which are 430 and 417 g cod l day respectively in a previous study conducted by senturk et al 31 who used a mesophilic anaerobic contact reactor system in treating food processing wastewater the umax value for cod removal was 22 925 g tcod l day meanwhile in a study conducted by ebrahimi et al 13 which involved compost leachate treatment using an anaerobic migrating blanket reactor showed a higher value of umax 172 4 g cod l day compared to umax obtained from pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by anaerobic hybrid reactor 30 which had a value of 108 69 g cod l day a comparison with the results of previous studies refer to table 5 a above show that abd produces a higher umax value of 417 g cod l day influent characteristics treatment system configuration the community of microorganisms involved and organic as well as hydraulic loads are among factors influencing the differences in kinetic parameter values between systems 5 27 when the umax 417 g cod l day was found to be higher in value than the maximum olr 3 58 1 39 g cod l day it showed that the pilot scale abd system was still able to receive substrate samples with a high concentration however if the umax and kb of the treatment system were to give similar values this situation would suggest that a continuous increase in olr can lead to a decline in the work performance of the treatment system 31 46 4 2 3 sog model the kinetic parameters of the sog model namely a b and the second order substrate removal rate constant k2 s were determined from eq 15 and eq 16 the values of a and b are taken from the values of the axial intercept and the gradient respectively of the equation shown in fig 3 d y 1 0199 0 8553 r2 0 9995 namely 0 886 no dimension and 1 02 no dimension moreover k2 s is calculated from equation a s 0 k 2 s x and gives a value of 4 04 1 16 days 1 based on the cod degradation result the value of k2 s depends on the influent concentration s0 and the biomass concentration x in the reactor tank 5 27 this proved to be true in a study conducted by ozturk et al 47 in which the treatment of young leachate from a sanitary landfill using a uasb system presented a high k2 s value of 38 5 days 1 refer to table 5 a compared to the abd system the cod concentration of the leachate from the abd system study 37 4 2 1 g cod l was higher than that of the ozturk et al 47 study sample 9 0 25 3 g cod l however due to the high concentration of biomass in abd the resulting k2 s value is lower than that found by ozturk et al 47 the results are similar to those from monod and msk kinetic analysis sog kinetic analysis also proved that the high biomass concentration in abd enabled it to receive higher cod concentrations of leachate than the existing ones 4 2 4 evaluation of substrate removal kinetic models the value of the regression coefficient r2 shown on each linear graph plot for all three models refer to fig 3 b 3 c and 3 d is high for msk r2 0 9997 and sog r2 0 9995 compared to that of the monod model r2 0 1734 in summary the msk and sog kinetic models are more suitable for use than the monod kinetic model in describing the work performance of the pilot scale abd system that treats leachate kinetic model such as monod involves the observed values of active biomass in treatment systems 31 46 sampling for active biomass in pilot and industrial scale biofilm and granular treatment systems is very complicated to perform accurately and only depends on the vss values observed from a treatment system effluent therefore msk and sog kinetic models are preferred because they use baseline parameter values observed during the monitoring process for the calculation of kinetic parameter values 13 29 31 to test the validity of the kinetic model used the predicted effluent cod concentration codp was calculated based on the equations published by the three kinetic models involved namely eq 9 for the monod model eq 13 for the msk model and eq 17 for the sog model subsequently the codp values of the kinetic models were compared with the observed effluent cod concentrations measured cod codm 13 27 in the pilot scale abd system by plotting a linear graph as shown in fig 5 the linear graph of codp versus codm for the sog kinetic model shows higher regression coefficient values r2 0 0479 compared to those of the monod r2 0 0223 and msk r2 0 0291 models to confirm these results the mean values and standard deviations of codp for these three models please refer to table 6 a are compared with the values of codm 32 the results show that the codp value for the sog kinetic model is more similar to the codm value compared to other kinetic models with its minimum and maximum codp closer in values to the minimum and maximum codm in the pilot scale abd system 4 3 determination of kinetic coefficients in biogas production models 4 3 1 msk model for gas production based on eq 18 as well as a plot of a linear graph of 1 g against 1 olr the value of the gradient g b g max and the axial intercept 1 g max is matched to the value of the gradient and axial intercept of the equation shown in fig 6 a r2 0 1996 y 0 00004 0 0003 to determine the values of the ratio constant of biogas gb and the maximum specific production rate for biogas gmax which are 0 13 no dimensions and 3333 ml l day respectively for ch4 generation eq 19 is matched to the plot equation of a linear graph of 1 m against 1 olr as shown in fig 6 b r2 0 1996 y 0 00006 0 0004 where a matching of the gradient value m b m max and the axial intercept 1 m max yields a ratio constant of ch4 mb 0 15 no dimension and a maximum specific production rate for ch4 mmax of 2500 ml l day the values of gmax 3333 ml l day and mmax 2500 ml l day obtained from this research are higher than those found by kuscu and sponza 32 who treated synthetic wastewater using an anaerobic migrating blanket reactor system which yielded a value of gmax of 1666 7 ml l day and an mmax of 476 2 ml l day however a comparison with the gmax and mmax values found by ebrahimi et al 13 gmax 35 714 ml l day mmax 12 195 ml l day and wang et al 48 gmax 26 800 ml l day mmax 17 500 ml l day refer table 5 b where each treated leachate of composting and carbohydrate containing wastewater shows treatment of mswtskl s leachate using this pilot scale abd system results in low biogas and ch4 generation rates the difference in gmax and mmax values shown by these studies reveals that high influent cod concentrations refer to table 5 b play an important role in producing an encouraging rate of biogas and ch4 generation furthermore treatment system configuration is key as shown in the research by wang et al 48 who used microbial electrolysis cells mecs to increase the rate of biogas generation by accelerating the rate of vfa degradation 4 3 2 vdmh model eq 20 is used to determine the value of the kinetic constant ksg in the vdmh model ksg is calculated by matching it with the value of the gradient of the equation obtained from a plot of the linear graph of vm against q s0 s as shown in fig 6 c r2 0 1851 y 0 0609 17 602 the ksg value of the vdmh model for this abd system is 0 0609 l ch4 g cod a comparison of ksg values was made please refer to table 5 b the study conducted by wang et al 48 showed a ksg value 3 times higher than that of the abd system study which had a value of 0 1836 l ch4 g cod as described in the msk model for gas generation above system configuration plays a role in the production of high constant values the study conducted by ebrahimi et al 13 and kuscu and sponza 32 found ksg values of 0 0473 l ch4 g cod and 0 0947 l ch4 g cod respectively however the ksg results found by the studies of ebrahimi et al 13 kuscu and sponza 32 and wang et al 48 are not described further as the r2 value shown by the vdmh linear graph plot is lower than that of the msk model plotted for comparison of ch4 generation values in those studies 4 3 3 model testing biogas and ch4 generation from this present study was measured using two kinetic models of biogas production namely msk for gas generation and vdmh which showed low r2 values of 0 1996 and 0 1851 respectively to test the validity of the kinetic models of biogas production used the predicted volume of biogas and ch4 were calculated based on eq 18 and eq 19 for the msk model and eq 20 for the vdmh model the results of the predicted volume calculation as well as the observation results are plotted into a linear graph of the predicted gas production rate against the measured gas production rate as shown in fig 6 d biogas generation for the msk model fig 6 e ch4 generation for the msk model and fig 6 f ch4 generation for the vdmh model the plot results show that the r2 graph of the predicted ch4 production rate against the measured ch4 production rate for the msk model is higher than that of the vdmh model a comparison of the average minimum and maximum values of biogas and ch4 also shows that the predicted production rates produced by the msk model are close to the measured values refer to table 6 b 5 conclusion the pilot scale abd system was stable throughout its operation and showed optimal average values for the monitored parameters such as ph 7 53 0 14 total volatile fatty acid 79 66 mg hoac l alkalinity 10 919 1556 mg caco3 l and a non toxic value for accumulated fan 960 106 mg nh3 n l the system also showed great performance with average cod removal efficiency of 98 1 and the average daily biogas production of 25 1 m3 day with a composition of 57 12 ch4 and 26 6 co2 this showcase of high performance is due to the biofilm technology leading to long srt which is 156 135 145 and 72 days for 30 day 25 day 20 day and 10 day hrts respectively as for kinetic studies the results of the substrate removal kinetic analysis show that the sog model is more suitable for use than the monod and msk models in predicting the work performance of the abd system in treating mswtskl leachate for the same operating conditions but at different scales while the msk kinetic model for gas production shows results of kinetic analysis that are close to the values of the measured biogas and ch4 production rates than the vdmh model shows declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

12711,magnetic porous materials have been of interest for oil water separation due to their efficient ease of separation this work presented a facile approach for preparing a magnetic polyurethane foam puf modified with pretreated cellulose decafluorobiphenyl mcf the prepared materials were characterized using several techniques they showed high oil water separation for a variety of oils and chemical solvents more significantly the absorbed oil was easily retrieved by squeezing after several absorbing squeezing cycles the modified puf maintained a high magnetic responsivity due to the addition of fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles and still exhibited a significant oil absorption capacity mcf s oil absorption capacity separation efficiency oil flux and reusability were evaluated the results reveal that the prepared material has a high absorption capacity which varies between 9 and 32 times its own weight excellent separation efficiency 97 68 and high flux which reaches 48 750 lm 2h 1 for n hexane and high reusability 50 times in oil water separation the magnetic mcf foam could be reused through a simple squeeze treatment the oil water separation performance of mcf is excellent in complex environments including acidic solutions ph 2 basic solutions ph 12 and simulated seawater this makes it a very promising material for the aforementioned purposes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hydrophobic polymer magnetic separation water treatment nanotechnology engineering environment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the release of oily wastewater and industrial bio pollutants has increased significantly with the ongoing industrial development causing severe ramifications for environmental and societal wellness and growth 1 several industrial activities such as oil refining oil storage and transportation produce enormous amounts of oily effluents during the production process 2 4 and cause water pollution operational and managerial inefficiency is to blame for this this primarily leads to consequences such as endangering drinking water and groundwater resources endangering human health causing air pollution affecting agricultural production and destroying the natural environment 5 6 the oil films on the water s surface can harm aquatic systems by reducing dissolved oxygen and hindering the rehydration process the treatment of oily wastewater and industrial organic pollutants is an extraordinarily difficult task 7 8 as a result oil water separation has garnered a lot of attention 9 14 many methods have been used for carrying this out including combustion 15 gravity separation 16 flotation 17 18 adsorption 19 and filtering 20 however these approaches frequently have drawbacks such as limited separation efficiency non recyclability high cost and secondary pollutants in addition mechanical collection bioremediation flocculation and adsorption are some of the traditional oil water separation methods 21 even though a wide range of processes have been developed to separate oil water mixtures ensuring high oil flux and separation efficiency remains a major challenge these processes also have poor selectivity and complicated operating procedures 22 which hinder the development of these separation techniques as a result methods that uses economical and environment friendly precursors which incorporate a simple fabrication technique for complex substrates while providing high flux excellent separation efficiency and robust performance still remain to be found 23 certain 3d porous materials with hydrophobic and oil absorption capability have been used for oil water separation 24 28 hydrophobic 3d composites have also been utilized for decades to successfully separate oil water mixtures or absorb different solvents from water carbon graphene based aerogels 29 30 silicone sponges 31 polyurethane sponges 32 biomass derived materials 33 cellulose chitosan based aerogels 34 35 and other cellulose based materials cellulose g paa and cellulose g pam 36 have been widely developed for removing different oils from water among them polyurethane foam puf is a porous and hydrophilic polymer with high porosity light weight strong elasticity and high cost effective for large scale production making it more suitable for sorption filtration and separation to make the original puf possess unique wetting properties numerous substances with various properties have been introduced to it to modify its surface properties and structure fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles nps are one such substance a type of spinel ferrite with stable magnetic permeability and super paramagnetism it is an easy and inexpensive preparation method 37 40 in this study we attempted to use fe3o4 magnetic nps in the modification of the original puf to create a hydrophobic and magnetic material for oil water separation thus the modified polyurethane foam mcf was easily retrieved from the surface of the water using a magnet cellulose was used in the synthesis due to its fine porous properties such as low density high porosity superior oil absorption capacity and oil water selectivity moreover it is abundant in nature renewable biocompatible and surface functionalizable 41 43 the least polarizable groups such as fluorinated groups are frequently used to prepare low surface energy materials 44 46 due to their low surface energy and strong thermal and chemical stability a variety of fluorinated polymers have been used for making hydrophobic materials 47 48 therefore we used decafluorobiphenyl because it has exhibited great potential for achieving a relatively high fluorine content and thus more hydrophobicity 49 the prepared mcf was tested for magnetism oil absorption capacity hydrophobicity reusability separation efficiency and oil flux the magnetic property of the mcf allows easy separation of the foam from the mixture using a magnetic rod mcf has also shown high capacities separation efficiencies and high flux values for different oils and organic solvents even after 50 cycles mcf retained a significant oil capacity moreover it was tested for floating oil on water surfaces with ph of 2 7 and 12 and simulated seawater it demonstrated an excellent oil capacity here as well thus proving its efficiency in complex water environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the commercial polyurethane foam puf was obtained from the market the fe3o4 nps were purchased from fluka and used as received ethanol 98 cellulose ce decafluorobiphenyl df acetic acid aa sodium hydroxide naoh methylene blue mb n hexane toluene isooctane and heptane were obtained from sigma aldrich for further investigation commercial olive oil and lubricating oil were also used for testing the materials purchased from the local market distillation water was obtained from an in house built distillation unit all the chemicals and reagents used were of an analytical grade without any further purification 2 2 preparation of mcf for the preparation of the pretreated cellulose about 10 g of cellulose and 1 g of naoh were added to 200 ml water and stirred for 24 h then filtered and dried at room temperature for 24 h and labelled pretreated cellulose under ultrasonic conditions the puf pieces were cleaned in ethanol for approximately 10 min and dried in the oven at 60 c then 1 g of fe3o4 nps was dispersed under ultrasonication in the mixture to attain a fe3o4 puf mixture the foam was then collected and dried to attain the magnetic foam pretreated cellulose 2 g was entirely dissolved in 200 ml of 1 v v aa solution through stirring the magnetic foam was introduced into this solution and kept under mixing and stirring for 12 h after that 1 g of decafluorobiphenyl was added in order to attain the hydrophobicity on the foam the system was kept under stirring at an ambient temperature for 12 h following repeated squeezing drying and mixing until the modification was homogeneously dispersed the mcf pieces were transferred to a clean oven and dried at 60 c to obtain magnetic cellulose modified polyurethane foam mcf fig 1 2 3 instruments and characterization various characterization techniques were used to examine mcf and original puf the morphology of the samples surfaces was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem tescan lyra 3 dual beam tescan supplied with energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx oxford instruments which were obtained at a voltage of 20 kv before analyzing the samples thin layers of gold were sputtered into the materials to provide electrical conductivity a fourier transform infrared spectrometer smart itr nicolet is10 with wavenumbers ranging from 400 to 4000 cm 1 was used to collect functional groups data of mcf and the original puf a contact angle meter attension theta optical tensiometer biolin scientific finland was used to measure the water contact angle wca using a 5 μl purified water droplet the contact angle was measured at three different areas of the magnetic puf and the mean values were considered 2 4 tests to evaluate mcf for oil water separation 2 4 1 absorption capacity of mcf the absorption capacity q of mcf was tested using five different types of oils and organic solvents toluene isooctane n hexane olive oil and lubricating oil it was calculated using a weight ratio for a total of 50 cycles 1 q m si m 0 m 0 1 i 50 where m si refers to the weight of mcf after immersion in the oil water mixture for 10 s and m 0 refers to the weight of mcf before the absorption the m si was determined immediately after it was removed from the oil water mixture 2 4 2 separation efficiency of mcf the separation efficiency is an essential factor in evaluating the separation capacity of mcf in an oil water mixture it can be determined using eq 2 2 e m m 0 100 where m 0 and m are the weights of the corresponding oil in the oil water mixture before and after separation 2 4 3 flux test of mcf the oil flux was determined by measuring the time required for an assured volume of oil to permeate through mcf the flux value f was computed by eq 3 3 f v at where v is the volume of liquid that flows through the material in a definite time t and a is the mcf s active contact area 2 4 4 recoverability of mcf mcf s superior mechanical properties such as high recoverability provided it with a desirable performance eq 4 was used to calculate the recoverability of mcf as follows 50 4 recoverability h h 0 100 where h and h0 represent the final height of mcf after and before the recoverability test respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the surface morphologies of the puf before and after modification at different magnifications are shown in fig 2 the highly porous interconnected 3d structure of mcf was maintained after modification ensuring its excellent absorption capability fig 2 a c the unmodified puf surface was found to be clearly smooth and spotless fig 2 a b in the low magnification fig 2 a and high magnification fig 2 b sem images there were no noticeable microscale spots scattered on the surfaces the sem images indicate that mcf s surface has random roughness and shows tiny spots of nps scattered on it after modification fig 2 c d mcf is hydrophobic due to its rough micro nanoscale features and low surface free energy therefore this foam is able to continuously effectively and quickly extract oil or organic solvents from water energy dispersive x ray spectrometry edx was used to determine the chemical composition of the surfaces of the unmodified puf and mcf fig 2 e f three peaks relating to the elements c o and al can be seen in the spectra of the original puf fig 2 e since the atomic percent of al is very low it was obscured and a new peak relating to fe appeared indicating that it completely covered the puf s surface fig 2 f from this the peaks of fe can be seen clearly comparing the edx results for the puf before and after modification the weight percentage of the grafted fe is 28 4 which shows an excellent grafting of fe3o4 nps on the surface and hence resulting in a certain magnetism of the puf fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was used to identify the chemical structure of the puf coating to show the existence of magnetic fe3o4 nps in it fig 3 the two peaks at 3653 and 3277 cm 1 are ascribed to the stretching vibration of nh and the stretching vibration of oh respectively the ch stretching vibration is indicated by the two peaks at 2976 and 2891 cm 1 while the peak at 1702 cm 1 is ascribed to the co stretching vibration the peaks corresponding to the cn stretching vibration are seen at 1641 and 1536 cm 1 on the other hand the two peaks at 1455 and 1383 cm 1 are ascribed to the ch bending vibration 51 the cn and co bending vibrations are observed from the peaks 1233 and 1086 cm 1 respectively moreover the spectrum of mcf exhibited significant peaks at 961 and 813 cm 1 which can be attributed to the benzene ring bending vibration the peaks corresponding to the feo stretching vibration of fe3o4 nps are seen at 598 and 473 cm 1 which indicate that they were successfully dispersed in puf 52 and hence hydrophobic mcf was obtained 3 2 magnetic property of mcf easy separation of the foam from the mixture is made possible by mcf s magnetic property in the batch mode the foam was immersed in the mixture and removed using a magnet fig 1 the experiments shown in fig 5a d were conducted using this concept the magnetic property of the prepared mcf is important in a practical application and even a potential possible application circumstance where for example oil spills from ships in the ports the magnetic property of the foam is essential to oil water separation it allows easy to control and remove the foam after separation 3 3 wetting properties of mcf a contact angle measurement was used to investigate the wetting properties of mcf as shown in fig 4 a after magnetic and chemical modification with fe3o4 nps the water droplets deposited on mcf s surface formed a sphere it also showed a highly hydrophobic behavior with a water contact angle wca of 143 fig 4 d in contrast the wca of the original puf was 80 fig 4 c in light of this the impact of magnetic loading on the wca was investigated compared to the absence of fe3o4 nps the findings revealed that mcf retained higher hydrophobicity when the fe3o4 was loaded table 1 as a result it was assumed that mcf s high hydrophobicity was attributed to the collaboration between the surface chemical compositions and hierarchical structure that also resulted in high efficacy while absorbing oil components conversely the oil droplets here n hexane were dropped on the mcf surface and were totally absorbed demonstrating its superoleophilic property fig 4 b e this can be explained due to the formation of the wenzel state which is a fully wetting interface that results in absorption after using for 50 times in oil water separation the hydrophobicity of mcf was maintained with a contact angle of 117 fig 4 f 3 4 evaluation of mcf for oil water separation using the prepared mcf the oil and water were easily separated in three testing modes the absorption procedures that were used to extract the oils and organic solvents from the water surfaces include simple squeezing technique fig 5 a d gravity driven separation fig 5 f and pump assisted separation fig 7 in the simple squeezing technique the mcfs were immersed in oil water mixtures for 10 s to get the foam saturated with the oil then a magnet rode was used to separate the foam after that weighted immediately to prevent the evaporation of solvents or oils fig 5 b it was used to recover the absorbed oil moreover no water was detected as shown by the separate layer in the squeezed liquid fig 5 c after each 10 cycles mcf was washed with ethanol and dried in an oven at 40 c for reuse the absorption capacity q of mcf was tested using five different types of oils and organic solvents toluene isooctane n hexane olive oil and lubricating oil it was calculated using eq 1 for a total of 50 cycles with the increasing cycle number denoted as i the absorption capacities of mcf for the oils and organic solvents are shown in fig 6 a depending on the density and viscosity of the liquid mcf s absorption capacity varies between 9 and 32 times its own weight fig 6 b after using mcf for 50 times the oils and organic solvents were easily extracted and no water was detected in the extracted oils moreover after 50 cycles of mechanical squeezing for mcf it showed an excellent hydrophobicity and continued floating while the original puf directly sank into the water fig 5 e 3 5 testing the efficacy of mcf under flow system in the gravity driven separation technique the oil passed through the material pores under the gravitational force while the separated pure water remained on the surface fig 5 f to further investigate the continuous collection or removal of large amounts of oil and organic contaminants from water a peristaltic pump assisted oil water separation apparatus was used fig 7 from this it was proved that the elasticity porosity and strong adhesion of mcf s coating contributed to its high absorption capability and excellent recyclability 3 6 oil water separation by mcf in complex environments four types of water were prepared to study the oil water separation effectiveness in a more complex media neutral water ph 7 acidic water ph 2 simulated seawater and basic water ph 12 the absorption capacity of mcf to lubricating oil in seawater was extremely similar to its capacity in neutral water ph 7 it is likewise similar to the capacity of mcf towards lubricating oil in acidic water ph 2 and higher than of basic water ph 12 fig 6 c this might be because the basic water had a significant impact on the sample s hydrophobicity 3 7 separation efficiency of mcf the separation efficiency was evaluated using eq 2 to assess the separation capacity of mcf in an oil water mixture for mcf separation efficiencies of 98 31 98 87 99 93 97 80 and 97 68 were obtained for toluene isooctane n hexane olive oil and lubricating oil respectively fig 6 d 3 8 high flux of mcf the oil flux was determined using eq 3 by measuring the time required for an assured volume of oil to permeate through mcf the prepared mcf displayed a good flux of 48 750 31 527 32 058 21 471 21 037 lm 2h 1 for n hexane toluene isooctane olive oil and lubricating oil respectively these flux values are significantly higher than those reported in the literature a comparison between the n hexane flux of mcf and hydrophobic materials reported in the literature is provided in table 2 this can be explained by the large pores of mcf which seems to be the determining factor that resulted in such a high flux in addition to its superoleophilicity mcf allowed a rapid oil passage because of the microscaled dimension of its porous structure on the other hand its strong hydrophobicity prevented the water phase from forming during the separating process the oil became trapped between the pores increasing the resistance of water to mcf as a result mcf made it possible to separate oil and water mixtures quickly 3 9 recoverability of mcf with its superior mechanical properties such as high recoverability mcf had an excellent performance eq 4 was employed to determine the percent recoverability of mcf the prepared mcf possessed a remarkable recoverability of 98 5 after removing the loading fig 8 the highly compressed sample quickly recovered its original height after recovery oil water separation was carried out and no significant change in oil absorption capacity was noticed following 50 times of utilizing mcf in oil water separation a recoverability test was also carried out and the recoverability was found to be 97 20 the results revealed good mechanical properties and chemical stability of the prepared foams 4 conclusion water pollution is a severe threat to the ecosystem s long term sustainability it affects marine and human life in both direct and indirect ways the oil and organic spills from industries and unintended incidents which occur during the offshore movement of oil from one location to another are major sources of water pollution efforts have been made to develop materials that can efficiently and cost effectively deal with this type of pollution in this work a facile method for the preparation of magnetic puf modified with pretreated ce df mcf was introduced to address this the magnetic and hydrophobic mcf has excellent oil water separation properties the wca of mcf was 143 which is very high compared to the original puf ftir edx and sem were used to study the functionalized groups and the surface morphology of mcf and the original puf the prepared mcf allowed the fast passage of oil while completely preventing water from passing through during the dynamic separation of oil water mixtures moreover during the n hexane water separation it offered a high flux of 48 750 lm 2h 1 it also performed well in more complex environments including acidic media and simulated seawater the addition of fe3o4 nps ce and df to the skeleton surface of a puf increases its magnetic and hydrophobic properties and its oil absorption capacity the reusability of mcf for oil absorption shows that its absorption capacity remains significant even after 50 absorbing squeezing cycles the excellent performance indicates that the prepared mcf is a valuable material for oil and water separation because of its high absorption capacity and the dynamic separation with high flux and separation efficiency in complex environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

unmodified puf surface was found to be clearly smooth and spotless fig 2 a b in the low magnification fig 2 a and high magnification fig 2 b sem images there were no noticeable microscale spots scattered on the surfaces the sem images indicate that mcf s surface has random roughness and shows tiny spots of nps scattered on it after modification fig 2 c d mcf is hydrophobic due to its rough micro nanoscale features and low surface free energy therefore this foam is able to continuously effectively and quickly extract oil or organic solvents from water energy dispersive x ray spectrometry edx was used to determine the chemical composition of the surfaces of the unmodified puf and mcf fig 2 e f three peaks relating to the elements c o and al can be seen in the spectra of the original puf fig 2 e since the atomic percent of al is very low it was obscured and a new peak relating to fe appeared indicating that it completely covered the puf s surface fig 2 f from this the peaks of fe can be seen clearly comparing the edx results for the puf before and after modification the weight percentage of the grafted fe is 28 4 which shows an excellent grafting of fe3o4 nps on the surface and hence resulting in a certain magnetism of the puf fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was used to identify the chemical structure of the puf coating to show the existence of magnetic fe3o4 nps in it fig 3 the two peaks at 3653 and 3277 cm 1 are ascribed to the stretching vibration of nh and the stretching vibration of oh respectively the ch stretching vibration is indicated by the two peaks at 2976 and 2891 cm 1 while the peak at 1702 cm 1 is ascribed to the co stretching vibration the peaks corresponding to the cn stretching vibration are seen at 1641 and 1536 cm 1 on the other hand the two peaks at 1455 and 1383 cm 1 are ascribed to the ch bending vibration 51 the cn and co bending vibrations are observed from the peaks 1233 and 1086 cm 1 respectively moreover the spectrum of mcf exhibited significant peaks at 961 and 813 cm 1 which can be attributed to the benzene ring bending vibration the peaks corresponding to the feo stretching vibration of fe3o4 nps are seen at 598 and 473 cm 1 which indicate that they were successfully dispersed in puf 52 and hence hydrophobic mcf was obtained 3 2 magnetic property of mcf easy separation of the foam from the mixture is made possible by mcf s magnetic property in the batch mode the foam was immersed in the mixture and removed using a magnet fig 1 the experiments shown in fig 5a d were conducted using this concept the magnetic property of the prepared mcf is important in a practical application and even a potential possible application circumstance where for example oil spills from ships in the ports the magnetic property of the foam is essential to oil water separation it allows easy to control and remove the foam after separation 3 3 wetting properties of mcf a contact angle measurement was used to investigate the wetting properties of mcf as shown in fig 4 a after magnetic and chemical modification with fe3o4 nps the water droplets deposited on mcf s surface formed a sphere it also showed a highly hydrophobic behavior with a water contact angle wca of 143 fig 4 d in contrast the wca of the original puf was 80 fig 4 c in light of this the impact of magnetic loading on the wca was investigated compared to the absence of fe3o4 nps the findings revealed that mcf retained higher hydrophobicity when the fe3o4 was loaded table 1 as a result it was assumed that mcf s high hydrophobicity was attributed to the collaboration between the surface chemical compositions and hierarchical structure that also resulted in high efficacy while absorbing oil components conversely the oil droplets here n hexane were dropped on the mcf surface and were totally absorbed demonstrating its superoleophilic property fig 4 b e this can be explained due to the formation of the wenzel state which is a fully wetting interface that results in absorption after using for 50 times in oil water separation the hydrophobicity of mcf was maintained with a contact angle of 117 fig 4 f 3 4 evaluation of mcf for oil water separation using the prepared mcf the oil and water were easily separated in three testing modes the absorption procedures that were used to extract the oils and organic solvents from the water surfaces include simple squeezing technique fig 5 a d gravity driven separation fig 5 f and pump assisted separation fig 7 in the simple squeezing technique the mcfs were immersed in oil water mixtures for 10 s to get the foam saturated with the oil then a magnet rode was used to separate the foam after that weighted immediately to prevent the evaporation of solvents or oils fig 5 b it was used to recover the absorbed oil moreover no water was detected as shown by the separate layer in the squeezed liquid fig 5 c after each 10 cycles mcf was washed with ethanol and dried in an oven at 40 c for reuse the absorption capacity q of mcf was tested using five different types of oils and organic solvents toluene isooctane n hexane olive oil and lubricating oil it was calculated using eq 1 for a total of 50 cycles with the increasing cycle number denoted as i the absorption capacities of mcf for the oils and organic solvents are shown in fig 6 a depending on the density and viscosity of the liquid mcf s absorption capacity varies between 9 and 32 times its own weight fig 6 b after using mcf for 50 times the oils and organic solvents were easily extracted and no water was detected in the extracted oils moreover after 50 cycles of mechanical squeezing for mcf it showed an excellent hydrophobicity and continued floating while the original puf directly sank into the water fig 5 e 3 5 testing the efficacy of mcf under flow system in the gravity driven separation technique the oil passed through the material pores under the gravitational force while the separated pure water remained on the surface fig 5 f to further investigate the continuous collection or removal of large amounts of oil and organic contaminants from water a peristaltic pump assisted oil water separation apparatus was used fig 7 from this it was proved that the elasticity porosity and strong adhesion of mcf s coating contributed to its high absorption capability and excellent recyclability 3 6 oil water separation by mcf in complex environments four types of water were prepared to study the oil water separation effectiveness in a more complex media neutral water ph 7 acidic water ph 2 simulated seawater and basic water ph 12 the absorption capacity of mcf to lubricating oil in seawater was extremely similar to its capacity in neutral water ph 7 it is likewise similar to the capacity of mcf towards lubricating oil in acidic water ph 2 and higher than of basic water ph 12 fig 6 c this might be because the basic water had a significant impact on the sample s hydrophobicity 3 7 separation efficiency of mcf the separation efficiency was evaluated using eq 2 to assess the separation capacity of mcf in an oil water mixture for mcf separation efficiencies of 98 31 98 87 99 93 97 80 and 97 68 were obtained for toluene isooctane n hexane olive oil and lubricating oil respectively fig 6 d 3 8 high flux of mcf the oil flux was determined using eq 3 by measuring the time required for an assured volume of oil to permeate through mcf the prepared mcf displayed a good flux of 48 750 31 527 32 058 21 471 21 037 lm 2h 1 for n hexane toluene isooctane olive oil and lubricating oil respectively these flux values are significantly higher than those reported in the literature a comparison between the n hexane flux of mcf and hydrophobic materials reported in the literature is provided in table 2 this can be explained by the large pores of mcf which seems to be the determining factor that resulted in such a high flux in addition to its superoleophilicity mcf allowed a rapid oil passage because of the microscaled dimension of its porous structure on the other hand its strong hydrophobicity prevented the water phase from forming during the separating process the oil became trapped between the pores increasing the resistance of water to mcf as a result mcf made it possible to separate oil and water mixtures quickly 3 9 recoverability of mcf with its superior mechanical properties such as high recoverability mcf had an excellent performance eq 4 was employed to determine the percent recoverability of mcf the prepared mcf possessed a remarkable recoverability of 98 5 after removing the loading fig 8 the highly compressed sample quickly recovered its original height after recovery oil water separation was carried out and no significant change in oil absorption capacity was noticed following 50 times of utilizing mcf in oil water separation a recoverability test was also carried out and the recoverability was found to be 97 20 the results revealed good mechanical properties and chemical stability of the prepared foams 4 conclusion water pollution is a severe threat to the ecosystem s long term sustainability it affects marine and human life in both direct and indirect ways the oil and organic spills from industries and unintended incidents which occur during the offshore movement of oil from one location to another are major sources of water pollution efforts have been made to develop materials that can efficiently and cost effectively deal with this type of pollution in this work a facile method for the preparation of magnetic puf modified with pretreated ce df mcf was introduced to address this the magnetic and hydrophobic mcf has excellent oil water separation properties the wca of mcf was 143 which is very high compared to the original puf ftir edx and sem were used to study the functionalized groups and the surface morphology of mcf and the original puf the prepared mcf allowed the fast passage of oil while completely preventing water from passing through during the dynamic separation of oil water mixtures moreover during the n hexane water separation it offered a high flux of 48 750 lm 2h 1 it also performed well in more complex environments including acidic media and simulated seawater the addition of fe3o4 nps ce and df to the skeleton surface of a puf increases its magnetic and hydrophobic properties and its oil absorption capacity the reusability of mcf for oil absorption shows that its absorption capacity remains significant even after 50 absorbing squeezing cycles the excellent performance indicates that the prepared mcf is a valuable material for oil and water separation because of its high absorption capacity and the dynamic separation with high flux and separation efficiency in complex environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

12712,slow sand filter ssf is reliable for its economical convenience but is limited by low no3 n removal effect and long start up time in this study the feasibilities of powdery poly butylene succinate pbs and polycaprolactone pcl as solid carbon sources for enhanced nitrogen removal in ssfs were investigated results suggested that the pbs with 200 mesh pbs200 was with better carbon release capacity than pcl with 200 mesh pcl200 during the start up phase ssf added pbs200 ssfpbs was found to achieve stable after 8 day adaptation and 94 2 no3 n and 78 9 tn would be removed though a relative longer start up time was required in ssfpbs than ssf added pcl200 ssfpcl the cost and the risk of secondary pollution caused by excessive cod was lower in ssfpbs analyses to biomass and extracellular polymeric substances eps revealed that the biofilm structure in ssfpbs was more stable which was because of higher biodiversity and biomass as well as higher proteins and lower co oco in eps for the study of optimizing the operating performance of ssfpbs quartz sand pbs200 24 1 the results suggested that 90 no3 n could be removed from municipal secondary effluent under the flow rate of 0 07 m h besides 33 cod was further removed by two stage filter system this study demonstrated that powdery pbs based ssf is a promising technique to eliminate nitrate nitrogen pollution graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords powdery solid carbon source slow sand filter extracellular polymeric substances microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen pollution increases the possibility of triggering health risks and the water source deterioration such as methemoglobinemia cancer and eutrophication 1 2 nitrogen discharged from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is the main threat to water environment 2 in china even if the effluent from wwtps can meet the discharge standards level a tn 15 in the discharge standards of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plants 3 there is still a big gap in nitrogen content between the secondary effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plant and surface water quality standards grade 5 tn 2 in the environmental quality standards for surface water 4 therefore it is particularly urgent to develop a new technology with a high denitrified efficiency for municipal secondary effluent treatment for nitrate removal the physical and chemical technologies have widely commercial utilization but are limited by high and other by products 5 hence biological methods are gradually developed slow sand filter ssf is one of the biological methods and reliable to treat wastewater for its stable operation easy management simple maintenance and low cost 6 7 but its application was restricted by non ideal denitrification effect which could be solved by adding carbon source 8 recently solid carbon source scs gradually replaces liquid carbon source due to its sustainable degradation to avoid secondary pollution 9 besides the reduction of dosing equipment helps to reduce operation cost of ssf 9 to date biodegradable polymers bdps have been commonly defined as an alternative scs which could be degraded to small carbon molecules by microorganism and be utilized by denitrifying bacteria to enhance denitrification process in nitrate containing wastewater treatment 9 normally bdps includes polycaprolactone pcl poly butylene succinate pbs poly 3 hydroxybutyric acid phb and polylactic acid pla 10 however the filter added phb is easy to be clogged and pla is with poor biodegradability 8 besides denitrification systems driven by pcl and pbs were with less financial burdens and discharged less cod reducing the possibility of accidental overdosage 11 therefore pbs and pcl are superior options to enhance the denitrification in ssf generally bdp is in shape of granular with the size of approximate 3 5 mm the granular bdp was unable to be used in ssf due to its requirement with regards to medium size 0 15 0 4 mm which limited the application of bdp to enhance denitrification process in ssf 8 obviously turning granular bdp into powder bdp can effectively solve the limitation of granular bdp application in ssf hence more attention should be close paid to powdery bdp used in ssf and a systematic exploration for its feasibility is necessary compared with granular bdp the advantages of powdery pcl for ssf were elucidated in prior work 8 it was proposed that powder pcl with 200 mesh pcl200 with larger specific surface area possessed the characteristic of quicker carbon release rate compared with granular pcl 8 ssf with pcl200 removed 95 no3 n and 80 tn when the system started up quickly within 3 days but the effluent cod level was up to about 284 4 mg l after ssf ran stable 8 however higher effluent cod would lead to pollution in natural water bodies 9 therefore another economical and biodegradable powdery bdp should be developed to further minimize the limitations occurred in ssfpcl previous studies indicated that pbs was less expensive and more stable carbon controlled release 12 the feasibility of powdery pbs for ssf remains unknown moreover pollutant removal in ssf mainly depends on biofilm in which bacteria attaches to filter media through hydraulic action 8 the analyses to biofilm extracellular polymeric substances eps and microbial community could explain the mechanism related to bdp strengthen denitrification in ssf 8 hence the further insights into powdery pbs applied for ssf deserved to be explored in addition the published study just verified the operation performance in ssfpcl during start up phase but the application potential for practical municipal secondary effluent treatment wasn t investigated this study would further optimize the operational performance of ssf driven by power bdp it was well known that optimum operating parameters could ensure effective pollution purification 13 16 proper dose of carbon source is another key factor affecting the effluent quality insufficient carbon source triggers incomplete denitrification process while excessive carbon source increases the operating cost and could result in secondary pollution 13 xiong et al 14 found that the no3 n removal efficiencies were improved from 82 26 to 99 92 as the dosage of polycaprolactone peanut shell increased from 5 to 40 g also the flow rate displayed a positive impact on operation performance in ssf 15 nakhla and farooq 16 also compared the nitrogen removal efficiencies in ssf under different flow rate and 67 5 of tn could be removed effectively under the speed of 8 l min what s more reduction of the risk for secondary pollution could be performed through installing reactors in series 17 thus it was crucial to explore the ways to achieve optimal performance in ssf with powdery pbs by precisely controlling dose flow rate and multistage operation in this study pcl200 and pbs with 200 mesh pbs200 were regarded as bdp in ssf to ensure the same specific surface area this study aimed to 1 assess the ssf operational performance enhanced by pcl200 and pbs200 at start up phase 2 comprehensively reveal the mechanism of powdery bdp strengthening biofilm formation in ssf by investigating the biomass characteristics of biofilm and microbial population structure and function 3 evaluate the method to achieve optimal purifying effect for municipal secondary effluent by varying dose flow rate and installing two stage filter system this study provides a new perspective for the application of ssf enhanced by powdery bdp and propose a promising technology for treating municipal secondary effluent 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operational strategies the experiment was operated in five ssf reactors and each was made of water inlet tank peristaltic pump and slow filter column the column was made by a cylindrical plastic bucket with a 5 l working volume in which inner diameter and height were 85 and 450 mm respectively the filter supporting bed 50 mm was filled with coarse and fine gravels quartz sand and pcl200 or pbs200 were filled to 300 mm as filter bed the overlying water depth was controlled at about 50 mm american solvay supplied pcl200 and pbs200 shaped in powdery with 200 mesh 74 μm in diameter and relative molecular mass of 80 000 g mol the characteristics of the filter media were presented in table s1 for the study of operational performance during the start up phase two sets of ssfs were with quartz sand pcl200 and quartz sand pbs200 both with 2 1 volume ratio respectively the seeded sludge was obtained from anaerobic zone of xi an no 4 sewage plant and the specific process to sludge inoculation was described in previous study 8 in order to accelerate the enrichment of microorganisms and the maturation of the biofilm the influent was prepared by the diluted supernatant from the primary settling tank of a sewage treatment plant xi an china and then adding nano3 and kh2po4 to certain concentrations the constituents and concentrations of influent were cod 40 90 mg l nh4 n 10 16 mg l no3 n 48 50 mg l tp 8 10 mg l and 0 1 ml l trace element solution the trace element solution comprised mg l fecl3 6h2o 3 75 mncl2 4h2o 3 h3bo4 3 75 ki 0 45 znso4 7h2o 3 cuso4 5h2o 0 75 edta 250 each ssf was operated at 0 03 m h to keep the overlying water depth maintain at 50 mm for the study of optimizing the operating performance of ssf three ssfs were set up and were only filled with quartz sand pbs200 with different volume ratio 5 1 12 1 24 1 ssfs were started up in the same way described above after three ssfs ran stable the influent was changed to simulated municipal secondary effluent which included ch3coona 30 mg l cod nh4cl 5 mg n l kno3 10 mg n l kh2po4 1 mg p l and 0 1 ml l trace element solution additionally each reactor was operated at 0 03 0 05 0 07 0 09 m h respectively after 60 days operation a normal ssf without bdp was installed behind the ssf quartz sand pbs200 24 1 during the whole process the ph value was maintained within the range of 7 1 7 9 by adding nahco3 and hcl the values of no3 n nh4 n no2 n tn ph cod were tested every day in a certain time 2 2 organic carbon release and adsorption experiment pcl200 and pbs200 1 3 6 g were put to six flasks 250 ml respectively in which 100 ml ultrapure water was placed three parallel experiments were set up the carbon release capacity was investigated by testing cod of water samples every day after testing the water in flasks was replaced two ssfs without inoculation were filled with pcl200 and pbs200 solid to liquid ratio 6 100 and operated at 0 03 m h ultrapure water flew into the filter column and the effluent cod was measured every day the adsorption tests were conducted in 500 ml sterilized conical flasks in which 30 mg pcl200 and pbs200 were added in 250 ml nitrate solution also 2 formaldehyde solution was added to each flask to inhibit interaction between microorganisms and carbon source 18 three parallel experiments were set up all conical flasks were sealed and placed on a shaker 25 c 75 r min the test was conducted for 11 days and the concentration of no3 n was measured every day 2 3 eps extraction and analysis eps was obtained in view of previous study 19 toc analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan was used to determine total eps polysaccharide ps and protein pn were measured referring phenol sulphuric acid method 20 and modified lowry method 21 in which glucose and bovine serum albumin bsa were designed as the standards the contents of pn and ps in eps were expressed by the unit of mg g vss and mg g vss the excitation emission matrix eem and fluorescence regional integration fri were used to reveal the differences on eps composition leading by different bdps the fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi shanghai was scanning at excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 220 420 nm 250 550 nm with 5 nm slit width and fluorescence spectrum could be divided to five regions which could be performed integration operations 8 besides the xps 250xi thermo usa installed with an al ka x ray source was conducted at 20 0 and 70 0 ev pass energy respectively the binding energy of c1s peak was fixed at 284 8 ev the peaks were analyzed by thromo avantage software 2 4 microbial community analysis genomic dna extraction was done according to mag bind soil dna kit preparation guide e z n atm omega biotek usa and purification and high throughput sequencing analysis illumina miseq sequencing was conducted by sangon biotech shanghai china using universal primers 338f 806r 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 targeting the regions of v3 v4 8 2 5 analytical methods the water samples were filtered by 0 45 μm filter membrane and were assessed according to the standard methods 22 ultraviolet spectrophotometer fp 6500 jasco japan was used to test the water quality no3 n nh4 n no2 n tn and cod the ph meter dhs 3d leici shanghai was to evaluate the ph value biomass at different depths of the filter 5 10 20 and 30 cm was measured in light of the phospholipid method 23 2 6 statistic analysis the data were analyzed by the software of the statistical product and service solutions spss the results were presented as arithmetic mean and one standard deviation significant differences were performed by analysis of variance anova based on p value to evaluate the differences in microbial genus and metabolic function between ssfs 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic carbon release and bdp adsorption tests the difference in capacity of releasing carbon by two bdps was shown in fig 1 a large amount of organic substances were released in the first 3 days under different solid liquid ratios which might derive from the small molecules dissolved from the surface of bdps 8 as water changed dissolved organic substances were gradually discharged and effluent cod level decreased to a stable level the maximum of carbon released from powdery pbs200 was 86 2 mg cod g l higher than that of granular pbs 7 37 mg cod g l 24 moreover the carbon from pbs200 6 100 80 mg cod l was still higher than that from pcl200 6 100 70 mg cod l until the cod concentration maintained stable it proved that pbs200 could provide more electron donors for the denitrification system meanwhile the average carbon release rates of powdery pcl200 were only about 1 mg cod g d but higher than that of granular pcl reported by previous work 11 two bdps release capacities were explored in ssfs 6 100 and the result was shown in fig 1c similarly effluent cod maintained at 152 3 mg l ssfpcl and 154 9 mg l ssfpbs after 5 day operation the carbon release rates were 1 27 mg cod g l d and 1 29 mg cod g l d for ssfpcl and ssfpbs respectively which were much lower than those in flasks 12 7 mg cod g l d 13 9 mg cod g l d that might have relation with the water flow in ssf although hydraulic action caused by water flow in ssf accelerated dissolution of small molecular carbon on the surface of bdp the concentration of organic carbon was finally diluted by larger volume water resulting for lower cod level in effluent therefore compared with the conventional granular bdp the powdery bdp with larger specific surface area could promote the release of organic carbon and the carbon release performance of pbs200 was better than that of pcl200 furthermore adsorption test was carried out to illustrate the physicochemical effect of bdp on no3 n removal there were no significant changes in no3 n concentration during the whole process whatever pcl200 or pbs200 fig s1 there was little difference in no3 n concentration before and after adsorption indicating that the adsorption effect of these two bdps on no3 n was not obvious and could be ignored in a conclusion pbs200 was an alternative bdp and released more organic carbon which was conducive to denitrification 3 2 operational performance at start up phase in ssf with powdery bdp in order to ensure sufficient carbon bdps with solid liquid ratio of 6 100 equivalent to the volume ratio 2 1 were added to filter columns the operational performance at start up phase in ssf was shown in fig 2 the cod concentration in ssfpbs was rapidly reduced to 69 2 mg l on the fourth day which was almost equivalent to that in influent demonstrating that microorganisms could consume carbon from pbs200 as soon as possible the lower effluent cod level in ssfpbs at the early stage proved the higher bioavailability of pbs200 after 15 days the effluent cod continued to rise indicating that bdp was still degraded after denitrification process ended and two processes were carried out independently by comparison the cod concentration in effluent 180 9 mg l in average from ssfpbs was lower than that from ssfpcl 261 3 mg l in average proving that the carbon from pbs200 was unlikely to be the burden of subsequent water treatment additionally pcl200 is 1 7 times more expensive than pbs200 hence pbs200 might be a better option due to its higher bioavailability lower economic burden and lower threat to water environment it was reported that the solid carbon source was firstly hydrolyzed by microbes to small molecular organic matter and those organic substances were further utilized by denitrifying microorganisms 9 fig 2a showed that effluent cod level in ssfpbs decreased sharply within 4 days demonstrating that pbs200 was degraded by microorganisms immediately while stable denitrification was achieved after 8 day operation in ssfpbs hence it was speculated that most carbon source from pbs200 degraded by microorganisms was utilized by heterotrophic bacteria rather than denitrifying bacteria within 4 days at the initial stage the carbon was released quickly and heterotrophic bacteria grew rapidly to form biofilm as microorganisms growing the rate of microbial growth was greater than that of carbon sources release thus leading to the non ideal denitrification performances in ssfpbs however competitive effect between heterotrophic bacteria and denitrifying bacteria for carbon was not occurred in ssfpcl the abundant dissolved organic carbon contributed to the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria and start up of denitrification in ssfpcl after two ssfs ran stable the average no3 n removal effects were both above 95 higher than that in denitrification system supported by straw 91 69 and wheatgrass 79 55 9 hence ssfpbs showed the same ability strengthening denitrification process as ssfpcl during the whole operation the accumulation of no2 n was only observed in ssfpbs at the initial stage and then completely removed after 14 days the result further indicated that a longer startup period of denitrification was required in ssfpbs moreover nh4 n removal efficiencies were kept at 19 7 28 8 in both two reactors fig 2d which might be caused by high concentrations of organic matter bacteria utilized organic substance to growth resulting in biofilm thicken then oxygen transportation was harder to achieve 8 fig 2e showed that the tn concentrations were below 20 mg l after systems stabilized and the tn was mainly composed of nh4 n at the early stage of operation bdp was rapidly decomposed into organic acids by enzymes 8 triggering ph value of effluent was slightly lower than that of influent in both ssfpbs and ssfpcl fig 2f with biofilm matured microorganisms used organic matter to accelerate the denitrifying process and produced oh leading ph rising in two systems 25 as the denitrification progress ph value eventually decreased it was proposed that microorganisms metabolized the alkali substances by respiration 11 3 3 physicochemical characteristics of biofilm in ssf 3 3 1 characteristics of biomass the characteristics of biofilm directly affect the purification for polluted water the stability of biofilm structure could be reflected by biomass generally the dissolved oxygen do is sufficient on the surface of the filter material as the depth of the filter layer increased the atmospheric reoxygenation capacity decreased and the do is utilized by microorganisms in the upper filler resulting in the decrease of the do 8 during the biofilm domestication process anaerobic bacteria including denitrifying bacteria gradually enriched in the filter material surface after 30 d cultivation the biomass at 5 10 20 30 cm in two columns were 13 58 102 7 88 102 7 05 102 6 73 102 nmol p g filler ssfpcl and 15 15 102 10 05 102 7 32 102 7 22 102 nmol p g filler ssfpbs respectively fig s2 obviously the biomass decreased along the direction of the water flow which could be attributed to consuming organic carbon and do in addition the biomass at each sampling port of ssfpbs was greater than that of ssfpcl illustrating that pbs200 was much easier to be utilized for heterotrophic bacteria growth the larger biomass in pbs200 would contribute to the stabilization of biofilm structure and operation of ssf 26 3 3 2 characteristics of eps eps was the backbone of biofilm determining the stability in ssf operation this study explored the composition and structure of biofilms supported by bdps the eem spectra and fluorescence intensity of eps were shown in fig 3a b three main peaks a b c were observed at excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 220 240 310 330 nm 220 240 340 360 nm and 220 290 280 360 nm corresponding to tyrosine aromatic aromatic and tryptophan like pn substances 27 it demonstrated that pn with the function of stabilizing biofilm structure was the main component of eps similar peak positions and fluorescence intensities were recorded indicating that different bdp only caused differences in component content rather than in composition by contrast the fluorescence intensities of all peaks were much stronger in ssfpcl based on previous study the ex em area could be divided into five parts including ex em of 220 250 200 330 nm region i 200 250 330 380 nm region ii 200 250 380 600 nm region iii 250 450 280 380 nm region iv and 250 450 380 600 nm region v 28 quantitative analysis of eem spectra could be achieved by fri 8 the p i n of region iv microbial metabolites accounted for the largest proportion in two epss with 41 04 and 47 72 for ssfpcl and ssfpbs respectively fig 3c it revealed that strong microbial metabolism process occurred in both two systems region v was assigned to humic acid like substances and the p i n was as high as 23 14 in ssfpbs which meant that the stronger microbial activity and lower mortality rate 29 pn is not only the key to microbial aggregation but also as the main component of enzymes related to bdps hydrolysis 30 the higher content of pn 61 from the eps in ssfpbs presented stronger microbial hydrolysis ability and stable operation in the reactor the chemical analysis results of eps components were given in fig 3d the total eps content were as high as 142 4 ssfpcl and 104 4 mg g vss ssfpbs it might be ascribed to that excessive organic carbon from bdps was transformed to eps by microbes 31 ps and pn are both vital components in biofilm contributing to improvement of biofilm adhesion strength 32 higher ps content and the proportion of pn 34 04 mg g vss 65 1 were presented in eps from ssfpbs than that 32 98 mg g vss 53 from ssfpcl it was speculated that microorganisms aggregated more stably in ssfpbs the element forms and function groups in ssf were determined by high resolution xps c 1 s spectra and the results were presented in fig 3e f and table 1 obviously element c accounted for 79 mostly existed in the form of co oco the peak at 287 4 ev posed negative effect on bioflocculation 33 accounted for 66 68 and 68 72 of eps the chemical bond at 284 8 ev c c h mostly presented in hydrophobic compounds such as ps amino acids and lipids which were associated with the function of aggregation and adhesion of bacteria 34 the third peak at 289 4 ev was due to o c oh and o c or predominantly from carboxylate and uronic acids and the element k from ki and kh2po4 in influent was also found at the position of 291 6 ev which was overlapped with carbon spectrum in conclusion the characteristics of biomass and eps clearly revealed that the biofilm in ssfpbs was more stable which was owing to higher content of biomass ps and pn and lower co oco in biofilm 3 3 3 microbial community structure the microorganisms were observed and analyzed through illumina miseq 97 795 and 71 567 valid bacterial sequences were identified with 97 similarity the bacterial phylotype richness levels could be estimated by chao ace estimator and simpson shannon diversity index 35 table s2 exhibited that the sample from ssfpbs biofilm was with higher out distribution 3917 larger ace 39722 and simpson 0 1 that meant that the microbes in ssfpbs were with characteristics of higher microbial diversity what s more the complex species composition was conducive to the stable operation in ssfpbs meanwhile the microorganisms were identified and classified through the level of phyla and genus fig 4a b proteobacteria ssfpcl 86 9 ssfpbs 78 1 were the dominant phyla in ssfs and widely existed in wwtps 36 the lipopolysaccharide on the surface of proteobacteria was beneficial to attach to carrier 37 besides proteobacteria was led to illustration that it played a remarkable role in denitrification for various wastewater treatment 38 bacteroidetes accounted for 9 23 ssfpbs and 7 09 ssfpcl were proved to facilitate the processes of biodegradability and utilization to scss 39 moreover 15 genera relative abundance 1 accounted for 77 76 of the total sample abundance in ssfpbs including acinetobacter 12 48 rhizobium 22 19 and simplicispira 9 79 while 13 bacterial genera accounted for 71 32 in ssfpcl mainly composed of variovorax 27 60 acidovorax 16 09 and terrimonas 5 23 the significant differences of relative abundances declared that bdp types could influence the bacterial community structures in genus level apart from the main genera thermomonas 2 99 2 51 simplicispira 9 79 3 09 pseudomonas 1 50 0 33 flavobacterium 2 28 0 12 acinetobacter 12 48 1 53 were confirmed to be denitrifier 40 which showed less abundant in biofilm from ssfpbs while some denitrifying groups were with relatively high abundance in ssfpbs such as acidovorax 2 64 16 08 hydrogenophaga 2 53 2 79 dokdonella 0 25 1 15 this suggested that the genera above were easier to adapt and to utilize pbs200 for growth in ssf besides acidovorax was also observed in denitrification systems supported by poly 3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyvalerate phbv 40 overall 34 46 and 27 58 denitrifying bacteria were detected in ssfpcl and ssfpbs respectively which might be the reason for longer lag time of denitrification in ssfpbs besides it can be inferred that more heterotrophic bacteria might existed in ssfpbs since the higher biomass and lower effluent cod level in ssfpbs fig 4c showed that 25 bacterial genera p 0 05 were detected within the 95 confidence interval the differences in abundance of rhizobium 22 19 0 36 and variovorax 2 31 27 62 in the two reactors were larger indicating that above bacteria have stronger specificity for carbon source adaptation for metabolism functions of cell cycle control cell division chromosome partitioning and nuclear structure the functional differences between two reactors were basically same fig 4d but the most significant difference in two ssfs was carbohydrate transport and metabolism of which the abundance was larger in ssfpcl this further proved that the microorganisms in ssfpcl had stronger ability to degrade bdps which might be the internal reason for higher cod residue and quicker start up of denitrification in ssfpcl whereas the stable operation in ssfpbs was due to higher microbial diversity and biomass in the biofilm the lower effluent cod concentration resulted from more heterotrophic bacteria in ssfpbs reducing the risk of secondary pollution caused by excessive organic substances discharged from wwtp 3 4 optimal control of ssf for municipal wwtp tail water treatment 3 4 1 the optimization at start up phase by regulating bdp dose the cost would be reduced by dosing properly and the optimum dosage volume ratio 5 1 12 1 24 1 of pbs200 in ssf at start up phase was discussed in fig 5 with the pbs200 dose decreasing the start up time was extended from 5 days to 20 days the effluent no3 n concentrations in ssfpbs were almost the same eventually and the removal efficiencies were all above 88 fig 5a while the biofilter added granular pcl only removed 73 7 no3 n from sewage plant secondary effluent 9 that further proved the feasibility of pbs200 in application to ssf also the cod concentrations in effluent eventually tended to 164 2 124 4 and 64 mg l which were higher than those in influent 65 1 mg l fig 5b in ssfpbs 24 1 the cod level of effluent was much closer to that of the influent indicating that the organic carbon released from pbs200 was almost fully utilized by microbes moreover as high as 46 nh4 n was removed in ssfpbs 24 1 and the tn removal efficiencies were all higher than 64 overall ssfpbs with the volume of 24 1 could not only achieve ideal denitrifying effect but reduce the risk of effluent cod polluting water bodies 3 4 2 the optimization for treating municipal wwtp tail water by regulating flow rate and bdp dosage the simulated municipal secondary effluent was passed through filter columns with quartz sand pbs200 volume ratios of 5 1 12 1 and 24 1 the desired purifying effect of ssf for municipal wwtp tail water was achieved by adjusting the dose and flow rate it can be seen in fig 6 that effluent no3 n level in each ssf was essentially same under the flow rate of 0 03 m h meanwhile organic substances in each reactor were sufficient to strengthen denitrifying process however the no3 n removal effect gradually decreased as the flow rate increased from 0 05 to 0 09 m h it could be explained by that high flow rate reduced the interaction time between the microorganisms and bdps therefore most of dissolved carbon was discharged rather than metabolized by heterotrophic bacteria this finding was consistent with previous research using newspaper as scs the nitrate removal rate dropped sharply when the flow rate was 0 8 m d 41 at each flow rate the ssfpbs 24 1 always maintained the lowest effluent cod level indicating that the volume ratio of 24 1 could effectively avoid the risk of secondary pollution obviously the effluent cod concentration began to decrease as the flow rate increased which was because of hydraulic shear force and dilution led by high flow rate it made microorganisms and the hydrolase fall off from biofilm surface as a result the bdp degradation was weakened causing a lower cod and high no3 n in effluent furthermore no matter how the dosage and flow rate were adjusted the nh4 n concentration was always maintained at around 4 0 mg l the mature biofilm slowed down the transmission of do which was a key factor restricting the conversion of nh4 n the effluent tn concentrations in ssfs were kept in the range of 3 67 6 05 mg l which was basically not affected by operational condition it could be ascribed to that tn was mainly composed of nh4 n 3 4 3 enhancing cod removal by two stage filter system for treating municipal wwtp tail water although effluent cod concentration in ssfpbs 24 1 was demonstrated to be the lowest when treating municipal wwtp tail water it was still in excess and easy to trigger second pollution therefore a normal ssf without bdp was connected behind the ssfpbs 24 1 when the flow rate increased from 0 03 to 0 07 m h the average effluent cod concentration in the second stage filter decreased from 69 7 to 42 4 mg l even lower than the effluent limit of class a standard of the sewage treatment plant 50 mg l fig 7 interestingly about 33 cod would be further removed in ssfs operated at different flow rates through installing ssf in series thus ssfpbs 24 1 connected with a normal ssf 0 07 m h was an effectively way to reduce excessive carbon from pbs200 to achieve wastewater reusing moreover there were two fluorescence peaks in effluent observed at ex em of 250 340 270 380 nm and 240 260 400 450 nm representing soluble microbial metabolites and fulvic acid like substances respectively fig 7b these two substances which were difficult to be biodegraded might be the reason why cod could not be removed totally in previous work 42 soluble microbial metabolites were also the main component in effluent from ssfpcl therefore the removal of these two substances needed a further discussion in order to combine the solid phase carbon source with the actual engineering project a pilot scale ssf should be established to further optimize the experimental conditions for municipal wwtp tail water in the future 4 conclusions a novel biodegradable powdery bdps was added into a ssf as external carbon source and biofilm carrier to achieve advanced nitrogen removal process it was found that ssfpbs quartz sand pbs200 2 1 could be quickly started 8 day and remove 94 2 no3 n with lower effluent cod concentration which was ascribed to stronger carbon release capacity of pbs200 and higher biodiversity and biomass of biofilm besides the analysis to eps showed that pbs200 was beneficial to increase the contents of ps and pn in biofilm of ssf resulting in a more stable structure of biofilm moreover the decreased dosage of pbs200 in ssf would delay the start up time but ideal denitrifying effect could also be achieved under the quartz sand pbs200 volume ratio of 24 1 when the ssfpbs 24 1 0 07 m h was used to treat municipal secondary effluent the effluent cod concentration was about 50 mg l and around 90 no3 n could be removed furthermore a two stage filter system was helpful to further remove 33 residual cod which could avoid the problem of excessive cod released from pbs200 this study provides a new insight into the feasibility of powdery bdps applying to ssf for treating tail water in wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12712,slow sand filter ssf is reliable for its economical convenience but is limited by low no3 n removal effect and long start up time in this study the feasibilities of powdery poly butylene succinate pbs and polycaprolactone pcl as solid carbon sources for enhanced nitrogen removal in ssfs were investigated results suggested that the pbs with 200 mesh pbs200 was with better carbon release capacity than pcl with 200 mesh pcl200 during the start up phase ssf added pbs200 ssfpbs was found to achieve stable after 8 day adaptation and 94 2 no3 n and 78 9 tn would be removed though a relative longer start up time was required in ssfpbs than ssf added pcl200 ssfpcl the cost and the risk of secondary pollution caused by excessive cod was lower in ssfpbs analyses to biomass and extracellular polymeric substances eps revealed that the biofilm structure in ssfpbs was more stable which was because of higher biodiversity and biomass as well as higher proteins and lower co oco in eps for the study of optimizing the operating performance of ssfpbs quartz sand pbs200 24 1 the results suggested that 90 no3 n could be removed from municipal secondary effluent under the flow rate of 0 07 m h besides 33 cod was further removed by two stage filter system this study demonstrated that powdery pbs based ssf is a promising technique to eliminate nitrate nitrogen pollution graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords powdery solid carbon source slow sand filter extracellular polymeric substances microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen pollution increases the possibility of triggering health risks and the water source deterioration such as methemoglobinemia cancer and eutrophication 1 2 nitrogen discharged from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is the main threat to water environment 2 in china even if the effluent from wwtps can meet the discharge standards level a tn 15 in the discharge standards of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plants 3 there is still a big gap in nitrogen content between the secondary effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plant and surface water quality standards grade 5 tn 2 in the environmental quality standards for surface water 4 therefore it is particularly urgent to develop a new technology with a high denitrified efficiency for municipal secondary effluent treatment for nitrate removal the physical and chemical technologies have widely commercial utilization but are limited by high and other by products 5 hence biological methods are gradually developed slow sand filter ssf is one of the biological methods and reliable to treat wastewater for its stable operation easy management simple maintenance and low cost 6 7 but its application was restricted by non ideal denitrification effect which could be solved by adding carbon source 8 recently solid carbon source scs gradually replaces liquid carbon source due to its sustainable degradation to avoid secondary pollution 9 besides the reduction of dosing equipment helps to reduce operation cost of ssf 9 to date biodegradable polymers bdps have been commonly defined as an alternative scs which could be degraded to small carbon molecules by microorganism and be utilized by denitrifying bacteria to enhance denitrification process in nitrate containing wastewater treatment 9 normally bdps includes polycaprolactone pcl poly butylene succinate pbs poly 3 hydroxybutyric acid phb and polylactic acid pla 10 however the filter added phb is easy to be clogged and pla is with poor biodegradability 8 besides denitrification systems driven by pcl and pbs were with less financial burdens and discharged less cod reducing the possibility of accidental overdosage 11 therefore pbs and pcl are superior options to enhance the denitrification in ssf generally bdp is in shape of granular with the size of approximate 3 5 mm the granular bdp was unable to be used in ssf due to its requirement with regards to medium size 0 15 0 4 mm which limited the application of bdp to enhance denitrification process in ssf 8 obviously turning granular bdp into powder bdp can effectively solve the limitation of granular bdp application in ssf hence more attention should be close paid to powdery bdp used in ssf and a systematic exploration for its feasibility is necessary compared with granular bdp the advantages of powdery pcl for ssf were elucidated in prior work 8 it was proposed that powder pcl with 200 mesh pcl200 with larger specific surface area possessed the characteristic of quicker carbon release rate compared with granular pcl 8 ssf with pcl200 removed 95 no3 n and 80 tn when the system started up quickly within 3 days but the effluent cod level was up to about 284 4 mg l after ssf ran stable 8 however higher effluent cod would lead to pollution in natural water bodies 9 therefore another economical and biodegradable powdery bdp should be developed to further minimize the limitations occurred in ssfpcl previous studies indicated that pbs was less expensive and more stable carbon controlled release 12 the feasibility of powdery pbs for ssf remains unknown moreover pollutant removal in ssf mainly depends on biofilm in which bacteria attaches to filter media through hydraulic action 8 the analyses to biofilm extracellular polymeric substances eps and microbial community could explain the mechanism related to bdp strengthen denitrification in ssf 8 hence the further insights into powdery pbs applied for ssf deserved to be explored in addition the published study just verified the operation performance in ssfpcl during start up phase but the application potential for practical municipal secondary effluent treatment wasn t investigated this study would further optimize the operational performance of ssf driven by power bdp it was well known that optimum operating parameters could ensure effective pollution purification 13 16 proper dose of carbon source is another key factor affecting the effluent quality insufficient carbon source triggers incomplete denitrification process while excessive carbon source increases the operating cost and could result in secondary pollution 13 xiong et al 14 found that the no3 n removal efficiencies were improved from 82 26 to 99 92 as the dosage of polycaprolactone peanut shell increased from 5 to 40 g also the flow rate displayed a positive impact on operation performance in ssf 15 nakhla and farooq 16 also compared the nitrogen removal efficiencies in ssf under different flow rate and 67 5 of tn could be removed effectively under the speed of 8 l min what s more reduction of the risk for secondary pollution could be performed through installing reactors in series 17 thus it was crucial to explore the ways to achieve optimal performance in ssf with powdery pbs by precisely controlling dose flow rate and multistage operation in this study pcl200 and pbs with 200 mesh pbs200 were regarded as bdp in ssf to ensure the same specific surface area this study aimed to 1 assess the ssf operational performance enhanced by pcl200 and pbs200 at start up phase 2 comprehensively reveal the mechanism of powdery bdp strengthening biofilm formation in ssf by investigating the biomass characteristics of biofilm and microbial population structure and function 3 evaluate the method to achieve optimal purifying effect for municipal secondary effluent by varying dose flow rate and installing two stage filter system this study provides a new perspective for the application of ssf enhanced by powdery bdp and propose a promising technology for treating municipal secondary effluent 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operational strategies the experiment was operated in five ssf reactors and each was made of water inlet tank peristaltic pump and slow filter column the column was made by a cylindrical plastic bucket with a 5 l working volume in which inner diameter and height were 85 and 450 mm respectively the filter supporting bed 50 mm was filled with coarse and fine gravels quartz sand and pcl200 or pbs200 were filled to 300 mm as filter bed the overlying water depth was controlled at about 50 mm american solvay supplied pcl200 and pbs200 shaped in powdery with 200 mesh 74 μm in diameter and relative molecular mass of 80 000 g mol the characteristics of the filter media were presented in table s1 for the study of operational performance during the start up phase two sets of ssfs were with quartz sand pcl200 and quartz sand pbs200 both with 2 1 volume ratio respectively the seeded sludge was obtained from anaerobic zone of xi an no 4 sewage plant and the specific process to sludge inoculation was described in previous study 8 in order to accelerate the enrichment of microorganisms and the maturation of the biofilm the influent was prepared by the diluted supernatant from the primary settling tank of a sewage treatment plant xi an china and then adding nano3 and kh2po4 to certain concentrations the constituents and concentrations of influent were cod 40 90 mg l nh4 n 10 16 mg l no3 n 48 50 mg l tp 8 10 mg l and 0 1 ml l trace element solution the trace element solution comprised mg l fecl3 6h2o 3 75 mncl2 4h2o 3 h3bo4 3 75 ki 0 45 znso4 7h2o 3 cuso4 5h2o 0 75 edta 250 each ssf was operated at 0 03 m h to keep the overlying water depth maintain at 50 mm for the study of optimizing the operating performance of ssf three ssfs were set up and were only filled with quartz sand pbs200 with different volume ratio 5 1 12 1 24 1 ssfs were started up in the same way described above after three ssfs ran stable the influent was changed to simulated municipal secondary effluent which included ch3coona 30 mg l cod nh4cl 5 mg n l kno3 10 mg n l kh2po4 1 mg p l and 0 1 ml l trace element solution additionally each reactor was operated at 0 03 0 05 0 07 0 09 m h respectively after 60 days operation a normal ssf without bdp was installed behind the ssf quartz sand pbs200 24 1 during the whole process the ph value was maintained within the range of 7 1 7 9 by adding nahco3 and hcl the values of no3 n nh4 n no2 n tn ph cod were tested every day in a certain time 2 2 organic carbon release and adsorption experiment pcl200 and pbs200 1 3 6 g were put to six flasks 250 ml respectively in which 100 ml ultrapure water was placed three parallel experiments were set up the carbon release capacity was investigated by testing cod of water samples every day after testing the water in flasks was replaced two ssfs without inoculation were filled with pcl200 and pbs200 solid to liquid ratio 6 100 and operated at 0 03 m h ultrapure water flew into the filter column and the effluent cod was measured every day the adsorption tests were conducted in 500 ml sterilized conical flasks in which 30 mg pcl200 and pbs200 were added in 250 ml nitrate solution also 2 formaldehyde solution was added to each flask to inhibit interaction between microorganisms and carbon source 18 three parallel experiments were set up all conical flasks were sealed and placed on a shaker 25 c 75 r min the test was conducted for 11 days and the concentration of no3 n was measured every day 2 3 eps extraction and analysis eps was obtained in view of previous study 19 toc analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan was used to determine total eps polysaccharide ps and protein pn were measured referring phenol sulphuric acid method 20 and modified lowry method 21 in which glucose and bovine serum albumin bsa were designed as the standards the contents of pn and ps in eps were expressed by the unit of mg g vss and mg g vss the excitation emission matrix eem and fluorescence regional integration fri were used to reveal the differences on eps composition leading by different bdps the fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi shanghai was scanning at excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 220 420 nm 250 550 nm with 5 nm slit width and fluorescence spectrum could be divided to five regions which could be performed integration operations 8 besides the xps 250xi thermo usa installed with an al ka x ray source was conducted at 20 0 and 70 0 ev pass energy respectively the binding energy of c1s peak was fixed at 284 8 ev the peaks were analyzed by thromo avantage software 2 4 microbial community analysis genomic dna extraction was done according to mag bind soil dna kit preparation guide e z n atm omega biotek usa and purification and high throughput sequencing analysis illumina miseq sequencing was conducted by sangon biotech shanghai china using universal primers 338f 806r 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 targeting the regions of v3 v4 8 2 5 analytical methods the water samples were filtered by 0 45 μm filter membrane and were assessed according to the standard methods 22 ultraviolet spectrophotometer fp 6500 jasco japan was used to test the water quality no3 n nh4 n no2 n tn and cod the ph meter dhs 3d leici shanghai was to evaluate the ph value biomass at different depths of the filter 5 10 20 and 30 cm was measured in light of the phospholipid method 23 2 6 statistic analysis the data were analyzed by the software of the statistical product and service solutions spss the results were presented as arithmetic mean and one standard deviation significant differences were performed by analysis of variance anova based on p value to evaluate the differences in microbial genus and metabolic function between ssfs 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic carbon release and bdp adsorption tests the difference in capacity of releasing carbon by two bdps was shown in fig 1 a large amount of organic substances were released in the first 3 days under different solid liquid ratios which might derive from the small molecules dissolved from the surface of bdps 8 as water changed dissolved organic substances were gradually discharged and effluent cod level decreased to a stable level the maximum of carbon released from powdery pbs200 was 86 2 mg cod g l higher than that of granular pbs 7 37 mg cod g l 24 moreover the carbon from pbs200 6 100 80 mg cod l was still higher than that from pcl200 6 100 70 mg cod l until the cod concentration maintained stable it proved that pbs200 could provide more electron donors for the denitrification system meanwhile the average carbon release rates of powdery pcl200 were only about 1 mg cod g d but higher than that of granular pcl reported by previous work 11 two bdps release capacities were explored in ssfs 6 100 and the result was shown in fig 1c similarly effluent cod maintained at 152 3 mg l ssfpcl and 154 9 mg l ssfpbs after 5 day operation the carbon release rates were 1 27 mg cod g l d and 1 29 mg cod g l d for ssfpcl and ssfpbs respectively which were much lower than those in flasks 12 7 mg cod g l d 13 9 mg cod g l d that might have relation with the water flow in ssf although hydraulic action caused by water flow in ssf accelerated dissolution of small molecular carbon on the surface of bdp the concentration of organic carbon was finally diluted by larger volume water resulting for lower cod level in effluent therefore compared with the conventional granular bdp the powdery bdp with larger specific surface area could promote the release of organic carbon and the carbon release performance of pbs200 was better than that of pcl200 furthermore adsorption test was carried out to illustrate the physicochemical effect of bdp on no3 n removal there were no significant changes in no3 n concentration during the whole process whatever pcl200 or pbs200 fig s1 there was little difference in no3 n concentration before and after adsorption indicating that the adsorption effect of these two bdps on no3 n was not obvious and could be ignored in a conclusion pbs200 was an alternative bdp and released more organic carbon which was conducive to denitrification 3 2 operational performance at start up phase in ssf with powdery bdp in order to ensure sufficient carbon bdps with solid liquid ratio of 6 100 equivalent to the volume ratio 2 1 were added to filter columns the operational performance at start up phase in ssf was shown in fig 2 the cod concentration in ssfpbs was rapidly reduced to 69 2 mg l on the fourth day which was almost equivalent to that in influent demonstrating that microorganisms could consume carbon from pbs200 as soon as possible the lower effluent cod level in ssfpbs at the early stage proved the higher bioavailability of pbs200 after 15 days the effluent cod continued to rise indicating that bdp was still degraded after denitrification process ended and two processes were carried out independently by comparison the cod concentration in effluent 180 9 mg l in average from ssfpbs was lower than that from ssfpcl 261 3 mg l in average proving that the carbon from pbs200 was unlikely to be the burden of subsequent water treatment additionally pcl200 is 1 7 times more expensive than pbs200 hence pbs200 might be a better option due to its higher bioavailability lower economic burden and lower threat to water environment it was reported that the solid carbon source was firstly hydrolyzed by microbes to small molecular organic matter and those organic substances were further utilized by denitrifying microorganisms 9 fig 2a showed that effluent cod level in ssfpbs decreased sharply within 4 days demonstrating that pbs200 was degraded by microorganisms immediately while stable denitrification was achieved after 8 day operation in ssfpbs hence it was speculated that most carbon source from pbs200 degraded by microorganisms was utilized by heterotrophic bacteria rather than denitrifying bacteria within 4 days at the initial stage the carbon was released quickly and heterotrophic bacteria grew rapidly to form biofilm as microorganisms growing the rate of microbial growth was greater than that of carbon sources release thus leading to the non ideal denitrification performances in ssfpbs however competitive effect between heterotrophic bacteria and denitrifying bacteria for carbon was not occurred in ssfpcl the abundant dissolved organic carbon contributed to the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria and start up of denitrification in ssfpcl after two ssfs ran stable the average no3 n removal effects were both above 95 higher than that in denitrification system supported by straw 91 69 and wheatgrass 79 55 9 hence ssfpbs showed the same ability strengthening denitrification process as ssfpcl during the whole operation the accumulation of no2 n was only observed in ssfpbs at the initial stage and then completely removed after 14 days the result further indicated that a longer startup period of denitrification was required in ssfpbs moreover nh4 n removal efficiencies were kept at 19 7 28 8 in both two reactors fig 2d which might be caused by high concentrations of organic matter bacteria utilized organic substance to growth resulting in biofilm thicken then oxygen transportation was harder to achieve 8 fig 2e showed that the tn concentrations were below 20 mg l after systems stabilized and the tn was mainly composed of nh4 n at the early stage of operation bdp was rapidly decomposed into organic acids by enzymes 8 triggering ph value of effluent was slightly lower than that of influent in both ssfpbs and ssfpcl fig 2f with biofilm matured microorganisms used organic matter to accelerate the denitrifying process and produced oh leading ph rising in two systems 25 as the denitrification progress ph value eventually decreased it was proposed that microorganisms metabolized the alkali substances by respiration 11 3 3 physicochemical characteristics of biofilm in ssf 3 3 1 characteristics of biomass the characteristics of biofilm directly affect the purification for polluted water the stability of biofilm structure could be reflected by biomass generally the dissolved oxygen do is sufficient on the surface of the filter material as the depth of the filter layer increased the atmospheric reoxygenation capacity decreased and the do is utilized by microorganisms in the upper filler resulting in the decrease of the do 8 during the biofilm domestication process anaerobic bacteria including denitrifying bacteria gradually enriched in the filter material surface after 30 d cultivation the biomass at 5 10 20 30 cm in two columns were 13 58 102 7 88 102 7 05 102 6 73 102 nmol p g filler ssfpcl and 15 15 102 10 05 102 7 32 102 7 22 102 nmol p g filler ssfpbs respectively fig s2 obviously the biomass decreased along the direction of the water flow which could be attributed to consuming organic carbon and do in addition the biomass at each sampling port of ssfpbs was greater than that of ssfpcl illustrating that pbs200 was much easier to be utilized for heterotrophic bacteria growth the larger biomass in pbs200 would contribute to the stabilization of biofilm structure and operation of ssf 26 3 3 2 characteristics of eps eps was the backbone of biofilm determining the stability in ssf operation this study explored the composition and structure of biofilms supported by bdps the eem spectra and fluorescence intensity of eps were shown in fig 3a b three main peaks a b c were observed at excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 220 240 310 330 nm 220 240 340 360 nm and 220 290 280 360 nm corresponding to tyrosine aromatic aromatic and tryptophan like pn substances 27 it demonstrated that pn with the function of stabilizing biofilm structure was the main component of eps similar peak positions and fluorescence intensities were recorded indicating that different bdp only caused differences in component content rather than in composition by contrast the fluorescence intensities of all peaks were much stronger in ssfpcl based on previous study the ex em area could be divided into five parts including ex em of 220 250 200 330 nm region i 200 250 330 380 nm region ii 200 250 380 600 nm region iii 250 450 280 380 nm region iv and 250 450 380 600 nm region v 28 quantitative analysis of eem spectra could be achieved by fri 8 the p i n of region iv microbial metabolites accounted for the largest proportion in two epss with 41 04 and 47 72 for ssfpcl and ssfpbs respectively fig 3c it revealed that strong microbial metabolism process occurred in both two systems region v was assigned to humic acid like substances and the p i n was as high as 23 14 in ssfpbs which meant that the stronger microbial activity and lower mortality rate 29 pn is not only the key to microbial aggregation but also as the main component of enzymes related to bdps hydrolysis 30 the higher content of pn 61 from the eps in ssfpbs presented stronger microbial hydrolysis ability and stable operation in the reactor the chemical analysis results of eps components were given in fig 3d the total eps content were as high as 142 4 ssfpcl and 104 4 mg g vss ssfpbs it might be ascribed to that excessive organic carbon from bdps was transformed to eps by microbes 31 ps and pn are both vital components in biofilm contributing to improvement of biofilm adhesion strength 32 higher ps content and the proportion of pn 34 04 mg g vss 65 1 were presented in eps from ssfpbs than that 32 98 mg g vss 53 from ssfpcl it was speculated that microorganisms aggregated more stably in ssfpbs the element forms and function groups in ssf were determined by high resolution xps c 1 s spectra and the results were presented in fig 3e f and table 1 obviously element c accounted for 79 mostly existed in the form of co oco the peak at 287 4 ev posed negative effect on bioflocculation 33 accounted for 66 68 and 68 72 of eps the chemical bond at 284 8 ev c c h mostly presented in hydrophobic compounds such as ps amino acids and lipids which were associated with the function of aggregation and adhesion of bacteria 34 the third peak at 289 4 ev was due to o c oh and o c or predominantly from carboxylate and uronic acids and the element k from ki and kh2po4 in influent was also found at the position of 291 6 ev which was overlapped with carbon spectrum in conclusion the characteristics of biomass and eps clearly revealed that the biofilm in ssfpbs was more stable which was owing to higher content of biomass ps and pn and lower co oco in biofilm 3 3 3 microbial community structure the microorganisms were observed and analyzed through illumina miseq 97 795 and 71 567 valid bacterial sequences were identified with 97 similarity the bacterial phylotype richness levels could be estimated by chao ace estimator and simpson shannon diversity index 35 table s2 exhibited that the sample from ssfpbs biofilm was with higher out distribution 3917 larger ace 39722 and simpson 0 1 that meant that the microbes in ssfpbs were with characteristics of higher microbial diversity what s more the complex species composition was conducive to the stable operation in ssfpbs meanwhile the microorganisms were identified and classified through the level of phyla and genus fig 4a b proteobacteria ssfpcl 86 9 ssfpbs 78 1 were the dominant phyla in ssfs and widely existed in wwtps 36 the lipopolysaccharide on the surface of proteobacteria was beneficial to attach to carrier 37 besides proteobacteria was led to illustration that it played a remarkable role in denitrification for various wastewater treatment 38 bacteroidetes accounted for 9 23 ssfpbs and 7 09 ssfpcl were proved to facilitate the processes of biodegradability and utilization to scss 39 moreover 15 genera relative abundance 1 accounted for 77 76 of the total sample abundance in ssfpbs including acinetobacter 12 48 rhizobium 22 19 and simplicispira 9 79 while 13 bacterial genera accounted for 71 32 in ssfpcl mainly composed of variovorax 27 60 acidovorax 16 09 and terrimonas 5 23 the significant differences of relative abundances declared that bdp types could influence the bacterial community structures in genus level apart from the main genera thermomonas 2 99 2 51 simplicispira 9 79 3 09 pseudomonas 1 50 0 33 flavobacterium 2 28 0 12 acinetobacter 12 48 1 53 were confirmed to be denitrifier 40 which showed less abundant in biofilm from ssfpbs while some denitrifying groups were with relatively high abundance in ssfpbs such as acidovorax 2 64 16 08 hydrogenophaga 2 53 2 79 dokdonella 0 25 1 15 this suggested that the genera above were easier to adapt and to utilize pbs200 for growth in ssf besides acidovorax was also observed in denitrification systems supported by poly 3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyvalerate phbv 40 overall 34 46 and 27 58 denitrifying bacteria were detected in ssfpcl and ssfpbs respectively which might be the reason for longer lag time of denitrification in ssfpbs besides it can be inferred that more heterotrophic bacteria might existed in ssfpbs since the higher biomass and lower effluent cod level in ssfpbs fig 4c showed that 25 bacterial genera p 0 05 were detected within the 95 confidence interval the differences in abundance of rhizobium 22 19 0 36 and variovorax 2 31 27 62 in the two reactors were larger indicating that above bacteria have stronger specificity for carbon source adaptation for metabolism functions of cell cycle control cell division chromosome partitioning and nuclear structure the functional differences between two reactors were basically same fig 4d but the most significant difference in two ssfs was carbohydrate transport and metabolism of which the abundance was larger in ssfpcl this further proved that the microorganisms in ssfpcl had stronger ability to degrade bdps which might be the internal reason for higher cod residue and quicker start up of denitrification in ssfpcl whereas the stable operation in ssfpbs was due to higher microbial diversity and biomass in the biofilm the lower effluent cod concentration resulted from more heterotrophic bacteria in ssfpbs reducing the risk of secondary pollution caused by excessive organic substances discharged from wwtp 3 4 optimal control of ssf for municipal wwtp tail water treatment 3 4 1 the optimization at start up phase by regulating bdp dose the cost would be reduced by dosing properly and the optimum dosage volume ratio 5 1 12 1 24 1 of pbs200 in ssf at start up phase was discussed in fig 5 with the pbs200 dose decreasing the start up time was extended from 5 days to 20 days the effluent no3 n concentrations in ssfpbs were almost the same eventually and the removal efficiencies were all above 88 fig 5a while the biofilter added granular pcl only removed 73 7 no3 n from sewage plant secondary effluent 9 that further proved the feasibility of pbs200 in application to ssf also the cod concentrations in effluent eventually tended to 164 2 124 4 and 64 mg l which were higher than those in influent 65 1 mg l fig 5b in ssfpbs 24 1 the cod level of effluent was much closer to that of the influent indicating that the organic carbon released from pbs200 was almost fully utilized by microbes moreover as high as 46 nh4 n was removed in ssfpbs 24 1 and the tn removal efficiencies were all higher than 64 overall ssfpbs with the volume of 24 1 could not only achieve ideal denitrifying effect but reduce the risk of effluent cod polluting water bodies 3 4 2 the optimization for treating municipal wwtp tail water by regulating flow rate and bdp dosage the simulated municipal secondary effluent was passed through filter columns with quartz sand pbs200 volume ratios of 5 1 12 1 and 24 1 the desired purifying effect of ssf for municipal wwtp tail water was achieved by adjusting the dose and flow rate it can be seen in fig 6 that effluent no3 n level in each ssf was essentially same under the flow rate of 0 03 m h meanwhile organic substances in each reactor were sufficient to strengthen denitrifying process however the no3 n removal effect gradually decreased as the flow rate increased from 0 05 to 0 09 m h it could be explained by that high flow rate reduced the interaction time between the microorganisms and bdps therefore most of dissolved carbon was discharged rather than metabolized by heterotrophic bacteria this finding was consistent with previous research using newspaper as scs the nitrate removal rate dropped sharply when the flow rate was 0 8 m d 41 at each flow rate the ssfpbs 24 1 always maintained the lowest effluent cod level indicating that the volume ratio of 24 1 could effectively avoid the risk of secondary pollution obviously the effluent cod concentration began to decrease as the flow rate increased which was because of hydraulic shear force and dilution led by high flow rate it made microorganisms and the hydrolase fall off from biofilm surface as a result the bdp degradation was weakened causing a lower cod and high no3 n in effluent furthermore no matter how the dosage and flow rate were adjusted the nh4 n concentration was always maintained at around 4 0 mg l the mature biofilm slowed down the transmission of do which was a key factor restricting the conversion of nh4 n the effluent tn concentrations in ssfs were kept in the range of 3 67 6 05 mg l which was basically not affected by operational condition it could be ascribed to that tn was mainly composed of nh4 n 3 4 3 enhancing cod removal by two stage filter system for treating municipal wwtp tail water although effluent cod concentration in ssfpbs 24 1 was demonstrated to be the lowest when treating municipal wwtp tail water it was still in excess and easy to trigger second pollution therefore a normal ssf without bdp was connected behind the ssfpbs 24 1 when the flow rate increased from 0 03 to 0 07 m h the average effluent cod concentration in the second stage filter decreased from 69 7 to 42 4 mg l even lower than the effluent limit of class a standard of the sewage treatment plant 50 mg l fig 7 interestingly about 33 cod would be further removed in ssfs operated at different flow rates through installing ssf in series thus ssfpbs 24 1 connected with a normal ssf 0 07 m h was an effectively way to reduce excessive carbon from pbs200 to achieve wastewater reusing moreover there were two fluorescence peaks in effluent observed at ex em of 250 340 270 380 nm and 240 260 400 450 nm representing soluble microbial metabolites and fulvic acid like substances respectively fig 7b these two substances which were difficult to be biodegraded might be the reason why cod could not be removed totally in previous work 42 soluble microbial metabolites were also the main component in effluent from ssfpcl therefore the removal of these two substances needed a further discussion in order to combine the solid phase carbon source with the actual engineering project a pilot scale ssf should be established to further optimize the experimental conditions for municipal wwtp tail water in the future 4 conclusions a novel biodegradable powdery bdps was added into a ssf as external carbon source and biofilm carrier to achieve advanced nitrogen removal process it was found that ssfpbs quartz sand pbs200 2 1 could be quickly started 8 day and remove 94 2 no3 n with lower effluent cod concentration which was ascribed to stronger carbon release capacity of pbs200 and higher biodiversity and biomass of biofilm besides the analysis to eps showed that pbs200 was beneficial to increase the contents of ps and pn in biofilm of ssf resulting in a more stable structure of biofilm moreover the decreased dosage of pbs200 in ssf would delay the start up time but ideal denitrifying effect could also be achieved under the quartz sand pbs200 volume ratio of 24 1 when the ssfpbs 24 1 0 07 m h was used to treat municipal secondary effluent the effluent cod concentration was about 50 mg l and around 90 no3 n could be removed furthermore a two stage filter system was helpful to further remove 33 residual cod which could avoid the problem of excessive cod released from pbs200 this study provides a new insight into the feasibility of powdery bdps applying to ssf for treating tail water in wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12713,induced air flotation iaf is a well known technology that is widely applied in urban wastewater treatment plants wwtp for fat oil and grease fog removal however most iaf systems are not optimized and typically operate with fixed parameters regardless of inflow variations furthermore the optimization of iaf systems is limited by the lack of equipment in wwtp laboratories to determine fog concentrations in wastewater in this study an adapted sulfo phospho vanillin method for fog quantification in wastewater is proposed for optimization and automation of the iaf system the proposed methodology requires simple equipment that is widely available in wwtp laboratories paving the way for in situ fog determination the method was successfully employed to determine the optimal operating conditions of the iaf system in terms of hydraulic retention time and organic loading rate furthermore a full scale iaf system was optimized using this methodology and its energy demand was reduced by 40 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fat oil and grease wastewater spectrophotometric detection optimization approach sulfo phospho vanillin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the water sector is currently undergoing a paradigm shift from wastewater treatment and nutrient removal to resource recovery thus transforming wastewater treatment plants wwtps into water resource recovery facilities wrrfs 1 the latest technological developments highlight process intensification and resource recovery to facilitate higher effluent quality pursuing net zero targets for energy and carbon footprint neutrality 2 however most wwtps and wrrfs are still based on primary secondary and tertiary treatment processes during primary treatment physical the organic load is reduced thus enhancing the extraction of organic matter as commodities cellulose recovery 3 4 and or energy further anaerobic digestion 5 7 secondary biological treatment mainly focuses on the removal or reduction of soluble colloidal pollutants and nutrients to comply with established effluent discharge regulations evolution has occurred in conventional activated sludge systems i e membrane aerated biofilm reactors 8 and aerobic granular sludge technologies 9 and the development of new biological processes i e nitritation anammox processes 10 12 micro algae based treatment processes 13 14 and purple phototrophic bacteria treatment processes 15 has demonstrated conceptual and practical progress finally tertiary treatment has been implemented to improve the quality of wastewater effluent for reclamation 16 regardless of the concept employed wwtp wrrf and the technology implemented most facilities include a preliminary treatment that reduces undesired materials in the up flow treatment line primarily wipes and the largest materials 1 cm sand gravel fat oil and grease fog these preliminary treatments typically comprise different configurations of sieves and skimming flotation grease trap units flotation is a gravitational separation process which works by increasing the density difference between the continuous and dispersed phases this difference in density is accomplished by adding air to the wastewater to promote the formation of air fog agglomerates the air fog agglomerates float whereas higher density materials sands gravel settle on the base of the skimming flotation grease trap unit enabling their extraction 17 there were five different flotation systems their classification is based on the method of bubble formation i dissolved air flotation daf ii induced air flotation iaf iii froth flotation where air is directly injected into the fluid using a sparger iv electrolytic flotation and v vacuum flotation among these technologies iaf has been widely applied in urban wwtp to remove fog iaf presents several advantages in comparison with other technologies i high separation efficiency for removing small and light particles ii high loading rate and short retention time and iii small footprint 18 fog removal in preliminary treatment is particularly important for wwtps because unremoved fog can cause blockages in the plant infrastructure thus impeding treatment processes by disrupting settlement and clarification systems 19 moreover the slow degradation of fog in secondary or biological treatments impacts the activity of microorganisms and reduces the process efficiency by preventing the transfer of oxygen or slowing down the degradation rates of other organic materials furthermore failure in fog removal can result the failure of wwtp discharge limits 20 in line with wrrf concepts management strategies for the collected fog from wastewater treatment systems have attracted increased attention because they reduce the environmental impact and enhance resource recovery 21 the main fog management strategies include anaerobic co digestion with sewage sludge 22 25 and biofuel production 26 28 as described by pérez et al 29 preliminary treatments are responsible for removing most of the fog in inflow wastewater however thus far optimization has been limited to the correct design and initial installation dimensioning the most important parameter in the design and operation of air flotation systems is the air fog ratio if the amount of air employed in the air flotation system is less than optimum the fog removal efficiency is reduced if excess air is used power is wasted in compressing diffusing excess air however it is difficult to optimize this important variable and compare its efficiency operability because of i the variety in the equipment utilized both in scale and design ii the variation in wastewater characteristics and flowrates iii differences in the design and operation parameters of each facility and iv the lack of monitoring systems 30 in practice most air flotation systems for fog removal in urban wwtp are not optimized and usually operate constantly with fixed parameters regardless of the flowrate and organic loading conditions as previously mentioned fog removal in wwtp is also limited by the lack of a standard procedure for determining the optimum operating conditions therefore an additional limiting factor is the methodology used to determine fog content in wastewater samples fog represents a wide variety of organic compounds with different molecular weights that can be dispersed forming an emulsion or even dissolved 22 31 moreover for urban wwtps there are no online fog sensors available and laboratory determination has several drawbacks such as low levels of fog μg l 1 to be quantified or matrix interferences table 1 summarizes the methods reported the determination of fog in different types of wastewaters most of the current methods for fog quantification are time intensive and costly involving the extraction of fog from wastewater with an organic solvent hexane petroleum ether benzene ethyl ether chloroform n hexane or carbon tetrachloride and subsequent determination by ir gravimetric or chromatographic equipment 30 32 when gravimetric analyses are performed fog quantification is achieved by measuring the weight of the extracted fog after evaporation of the extracting solvents although this is the most widely used method it requires a large sample and solvent volume and exhibit high measurement uncertainty on the other hand ir based quantification is generally accepted as the most accurate and reproducible method but accessibility to ir equipment is limited in the majority of wwtp laboratories recent studies have presented the sulfo phospho vanillin spv method for lipid quantification in biological systems 33 36 and lipid production from microalgae biomass 32 37 40 table 2 summarizes the spv methods reported for lipid determination in biological systems compared with conventional methods for fog quantification in wastewater table 1 spv presents several advantages the spv method has a low detection limit μg l so a small amount of sample can be used and does not require considerable sample manipulation is time and labor efficient can be automated and is reproducible and easy to implement 33 the spv method comprises two steps an initial reaction of fog with concentrated sulfuric acid at high temperature followed by a second reaction of the derived products with vanillin in the presence of phosphoric acid in this study an adapted spv method for fog quantification was proposed as the basis for iaf system optimization and automation the performance of full scale iaf flotation system from an urban wwtp was evaluated using with this adapted methodology to determine the optimum operating conditions finally a new control strategy is proposed and validated by comparing traditional and optimized fog removal systems 2 materials methods 2 1 full scale wwtp description study was conducted at the lleida wwtp the wwtp has a capacity of 160 000 population equivalent pe with an inflow of 50 000 70 000 m3 d 1 and fog production of 40 tnfog y 1 the wwtp comprised preliminary treatment units for screening and grit fog removal the grit fog removal system comprised three iaf parallel channels with a volume capacity of 162 m3 per channel surface area 82 m2 per channel each iaf channel has eight aéroflo degreasing turbines ref f315 1 5 kwh referred to as turbines pictures and geometric and volume dimensions are presented in supplementary material figs s1 s2 and s3 after preliminary treatment the water line included three primary settlers 3 1450 m3 six activated sludge reactors 4 3900 m3 and 2 3450 m3 and four secondary clarifiers 4 3150 m3 the primary sludge was thickened in two gravity thickeners 2 220 m3 and the waste activated sludge was thickened in a flotation unit 435 m3 the thickening units produced 70 100 m3 d 1 of primary sludge and 100 200 m3 d 1 of waste activated sludge was both sludges were mixed in a sludge buffer tank prior to mesophilic 35 42 c anaerobic digestion in two anaerobic digesters 2 2800 m3 the studied wwtp is highly instrumentalized a complete description of sensors probes and analyzers in both water and sludge lines has been previously published by palatsi et al 49 and romero güiza et al 50 furthermore the wwtp was equipped with 40 energy metres iem3250 schneider and an energy monitoring platform power logic egx300 schneider 2 2 analytical methods the fog determination procedure was developed by adapting the spv method to quantify lipids in biological systems 32 40 for fog quantification the sample 5 ml was placed in a 10 ml glass tube subsequently chloroform 2 ml 99 vwr chemicals ref 22711 29 was added to the tube which was then closed and agitated to extract fog in the organic phase subsequently 1 ml of the bottom chloroform extract phase was collected with a micropipette and transferred into a 7 ml glass vial an additional 1 ml of chloroform was added to the sample and further agitated taking another 1 ml of the bottom phase and transferring it to 7 ml vial the two extractions were verified to be sufficient for good fog determination in the evaluated samples however the number of extractions may be increased if required depending on the wastewater characteristics then the vial with the chloroform extract was incubated in a thermostatic unit lt200 hach at 70 c for 60 min to evaporate the chloroform once the solvent was removed concentrated sulfuric acid 2 ml 98 vwr chemicals ref 102765g was added to the vial the vial was heated for 10 min at 100 c in a thermostatic unit and cooled for 5 min in an ice bath an aliquot of freshly prepared phospho vanillin reagent 4 ml was then added to the vial and the absorbance was measured after 15 min at 530 nm using a vis rfid spectrophotometer dr3900 hach phospho vanillin reagent was prepared by dissolving vanillin 0 6 g 99 alfaaesar ref a11169 in absolute ethanol 10 ml 96 v v panreac applichem ref 131085 1612 and the resulting solution was mixed with deionized water 90 ml under continuous stirring subsequently concentrated orthophosphoric acid 400 ml 85 panreac applichem ref 131032 1211 was then added to the mixture the prepared reagents were stored in the dark until further use a calibration curve was prepared using commercial olive oil dissolved in chloroform final concentration 100 mg l 1 aliquots of the standard 0 2 ml equivalent to 0 250 μg olive oil were placed in clean glass 7 ml vials the vials were incubated at 70 c for 60 min to evaporate chloroform sulfuric acid and phospho vanillin reagent were then employed as described previously vials without fog addition were analyzed as blank controls to estimate the fog concentration curve calibration y absorbance a u vs x fog mass μg produced a trend line equation eq 1 1 y mx a where m is the slope and a the intercept of the line the fog concentration fogconc mg l 1 was determined as follows 2 fog conc y a m 3 2 v where v is the sample volume ml a standard operating procedure of the developed method is presented in the supplementary material section s2 so it can be easily adopted at any wwtp laboratory for spv method validation the samples were analyzed by an external laboratory iproma eurofins through oil and grease determination by infrared ir spectrometry lab reference ir 001 a method where oil grease is determined by extraction into hydrocarbon free solvent followed by measurement of the ir absorption spectrum of the extract the absorption between 3000 and 2900 cm 1 associated with c h groups in the oil grease was correlated to the concentration of oil grease patrons linear regression of the spv and ir methods with residual analysis was performed using origin software originlab corporation for

data at 9 operational conditions obtained in seven assays each assay was conducted by sampling the in flow and out flow of the iaf system for a period of 24 h sampling was conducted using two automatic sampling units sigma sd 900r 52 11522 hach which collected 300 ml at intervals of 15 min samples were integrated in 2 h periods resulting in 12 integrated samples per assay once integrated

improved iaf system was tested for comparison with the traditional design configuration during traditional operation the iaf system operates constantly with three channels and six turbines per channel in the improved configuration the number of channels was varied between two and three depending on the plant inflow and the number of turbines per channel was varied between three and four depending on the inlet olr each configuration was tested for five days and samples were collected hourly at the inlet and outlet of the iaf system using the same automatic sampling units described previously samples were integrated in 24 h periods proportional to the plant inflow the iaf performance of each configuration was assessed by determining the electric consumption as well as the fog extraction yield and specific fog extraction yield of both iaf configurations fig 1 schematically describes iaf sampling points measured variables and analytical methods described in materials methods section further information is available in supplementary material 3 results discussion 3 1 fog quantification in wastewater by spv method according to an extensive literature review the spv method presents two important factors that influence its accuracy and reliability solvent and standard selection table 2 solvent extraction plays an important because of the diverse chemical natures of fog appropriate solvent selection could interference and increase method selectivity chloroform based extraction solvents are most commonly used for oil grease characterisation 40 however when this method is carried out using microplates chloroform can interact and solubilize the surface of the plastic material changing the surface properties and thus influencing absorbance at different wavelengths 37 therefore a solvent mixture chloroform methanol 2 1 can be used to reduce solvent interference 32 36 48 in this study chloroform was selected as the extraction solvent because no plastic material was used in the experimental procedure regarding standard selection it is generally accepted that the spv reaction requires either a cc double bond or hydroxyl group to be present in the lipid molecule for it to be spv positive 48 the presence of more unsaturated fatty acid molecules leads to higher absorbance 32 47 therefore the selection of the standard is one of the factors that limit the accuracy of the spv method transforming it into a specific and selective method depending on the standard used 32 in this regard the complex fog composition found in wastewater 21 22 28 31 and the reasonable limitation of determining the best standard limit the accuracy of the method however mcmahon et al 35 showed that the spv method is effective in saturated and unsaturated lipid molecules through the production of an intermediate alkyl carbocation in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid moreover some studies have reported that olive oil shows maximum colour formation in comparison with other oils such as canola and sunflower oil which is attributed to the larger presence of unsaturated fatty acid molecules 32 36 47 although the presence of more unsaturated fatty acid molecules will causes higher absorbance it has also been reported that the presence of multiple double bonds in simple fatty acids does not result in the formation of a more intense colour whereby the reaction is specific to the concentration formation of a single carbon ion per molecule and the chemical structure of the sample 32 similarly the use of commercial oil in the quantification of bacterial and microalgal lipids using the spv method has demonstrated good accuracy 32 34 40 consequently the colorimetric method was first validated to generate calibration using known quantities of olive oil dissolved in chloroform the standards known quantities of the standard in the range of 0 250 μg were taken and incubated at 70 c for 60 min to evaporate the chloroform followed by the spv reaction protocol described in the experimental section the fog content was measured by plotting the absorbance at 530 nm against the oil concentration all calibration curves showed r2 higher than 0 99 supplementary material fig s4 moreover to validate the accuracy of the spv method in determining the fog content in wastewater five samples at different concentrations were selected and oil and grease were determined by ir spectrometry external laboratory a comparison between the spv and traditional ir methods is presented in fig 2 there is an evident correlation between both producing comparable results for fog determination under assay conditions with r2 higher than 0 98 and a similar range of uncertainty fig 2a furthermore the bland altman plot fig 2b indicates that the mean of the differences between the values reported by both methods is small 1 48 mg l 1 indicating that there is no bias between both methods additionally all the values fall between the limits of agreement mean 1 96 s d and are randomly dispersed which also indicates that both methods are comparable 52 3 2 evaluation of iaf at full scale wwtp the full scale wwtp assays were conducted under different iaf operational conditions a large screening consisting in seven assays were performed to test different hrt h and olr kgcod m 3 h 1 at different air input configurations kwh m 2 the hrt and olr were modified varying the number of active iaf channels 2 or 3 channels and the air input was modified by varying the number of turbines per channel powered kwh m 2 fig 3 shows the operating conditions of each assay and fig 4 shows the obtained yields table 3 summarizes the operating conditions and the obtained results data were collected every 2 h over 24 h for each assay only representative sample of stable operation conditions in terms of hrt and olr of each essay were selected between red lines in figs 3 and 4 to evaluate process performance the results showed that during the assays the iaf system inflow ranged from 1000 to 2500 m3 h 1 under normal operating conditions fig 3 the iaf configuration was switched between two and three operating channels which generated variations in olr between 2 4 and 4 1 kgcod m 3 h 1 0 15 0 40 kgfog m 3 h 1 in normal operation fig 3 and table 1 under these conditions the hrt has a range of 0 14 0 25 h the number of operating turbines was switched between 2 and 8 per iaf channel table 3 the turbine energy consumption and air input were estimated according to the equipment s technical notes 1 1 kwh per turbine and iaf area 82 m2 per channel therefore the tested iaf air input varied between 0 03 and 0 11 kwh m 2 the fog inflow outflow and extraction yield profiles are shown in and summarized in table 3 the results showed that the fog inflow had a range between 10 and 70 mg l 1 during normal operation the fog extraction capacity ranged from 10 to 40 kgfogext h 1 which represents 10 30 of the fog inflow although the maximum fog removal is 30 under assay conditions it is not clear whether this is a high or low yield since there is not sufficient literature reference information for comparison the fog composition plays an important role in the iaf removal yields because the air bubbles have a flotation effect only to the extent to which they adhere to the particles and droplets this implies that for effective flotation removal the diameter of the air bubble must be lower than the diameter of the flocculated material in suspension 30 it is estimated that the iaf system generates a bubble size range of 100 500 μm while fog is composed of free oil diameter 150 μm dispersed oil diameter 20 150 μm emulsified oil diameter 20 μm and soluble or dissolved oil diameter 5 μm 19 unfortunately in this study it was not possible to analyze the specific fog composition however considering the relatively low removal yield it is possible that the fog was composed mainly of 100 μm particles moreover it is well established that the flotation process comprises the following i the introduction of air bubbles into the wastewater ii collision between the air bubbles and suspended matter iii attachment of fine bubbles to the surface of the suspended matter iv collision between air attached suspended particles with the formation of agglomerates v entrapment of more air bubbles in the agglomerates and vi upward rise of floc structures in a sweeping action sweep flocculation 30 therefore several key variables determine the removal efficiency of the system such as air input and volume of air per unit volume of liquid bubble size distribution and degree of dispersion concentration and type of suspended matter and oils hydraulic design of the flotation chamber residence time temperature and ph 30 in this study we focused on the hrt olr and air input operational conditions because they are common parameters that are regulable in iaf systems for optimization purpose other parameters such as ph and temperature are often not regulable in urban wwtps inflows table 3 summarizes the operational conditions and fog extraction yield and fig 5 shows the correlations between fog extraction yields and kgfogext kwh 1 and operational conditions hrt and olr it can be observed that high yields 20 are obtained at low olr 0 30 kgfogin m 3 h 1 and high hrt 0 20 h however considering the specific fog extraction yield kgfogext kwh 1 high values are found for olr and hrt ranges of 0 25 0 30 kgfogin m 3 h 1 and 0 18 0 22 h respectively furthermore it is observed that high yields are obtained with an input air of 0 04 0 05 kwh m 2 and that increasing the air input 0 08 kwh m 2 does not lead to increasing the fog extraction yield resulting in poor performance the poor performance at a high air input could be associated with the attachment of fine bubbles to the surface of the fog particles turbulence plays an important role in this phenomenon because it affects the distribution of bubbles in the flow field macro turbulence has been proposed to affect the transport of particles and micro turbulence controls the dispersion of bubbles and bubble particle aggregates attachment and detachment 53 therefore high air input i e 0 08 kwh m 2 could increase the turbulence and hence the detachment of fog air particles and reduce the fog extraction yield 3 3 validation of optimized iaf at full scale wwtp full scale wwtp validation assays were conducted under real iaf operational conditions for two weeks to evaluate whether the energy efficiency of the system could be improved based on the results previously obtained in week 1 the plant was operated in the traditional configuration 3 iaf channels 6 turbines per channel while in week 2 the iaf was operated with an improved configuration for the improved configuration the number of operating iaf channels was changed based on the inflow flow rate of the wwtp during the night 23 30 07 30 when the inflow was low supplementary material fig s6 one channel was closed and the plant was only operated with two channels for the remaining day 3 channels were in operation with this improved configuration the hrt was kept more stable between 0 2 and 0 3 h avoiding large increases observed during nights using the traditional configuration fig 6 furthermore during the improved configuration the number of turbines per channel was modified depending on the organic loading rate measured by an inline cod probe at the inflow which was correlated with the fog content supplementary material fig s7 during the periods of higher olr 09 30 01 30 the iaf system was operated with four turbines per channel while during lower olr periods 01 30 09 30 only three turbines per channel were used fig 6a the energy consumption of the iaf system was measured fig 6b using energy meters it can be observed that the energy consumed in the traditional configuration is stable at approximately 35 kwh h 1 as the number of channels and turbines per channel remains constant in contrast with the improved configuration the energy consumed is reduced to 25 kwh h 1 during the day because the number of turbines is reduced from six to four and up to 15 kwh h 1 during night owing to the further reduction to three turbines and the closure of one channel on average the traditional configuration consumes 858 kwh d 1 whereas the improved configuration consumes only 508 kwh d 1 this implies a reduction of 40 in the energy consumption of the iaf system fog extraction of the iaf system using both configurations was performed to evaluate whether the reduction in energy consumption had a negative impact on the system performance the daily and average results for the traditional and improved configurations are summarized in table 4 it can be observed that the fog extraction is similar in the traditional 270 kg d 1 and improved configurations 230 kg d 1 as the inflow and fog inlet exhibited similar values in both assays the fog extraction yield was also in the same range for both configurations 17 and 16 these results together with the decrease in the energy consumption achieved using the improved iaf configuration translate into an increase in the specific fog extraction from 0 31 to 0 46 kg kwh 1 this represents an increase of 48 and a rise in the specific fog extraction yield from 20 to 32 of the fog reduction per kilowatt hour 60 increase the results obtained with these full scale assays validate the iaf improved configuration employed against the traditional configuration as it resulted in a considerable reduction in the energy consumption while maintaining a similar performance in fog extraction and fog extraction yield however this configuration could be further optimized if the system was automated and changing the number of operating channels and turbines was easier to achieve this automation an optimized operational configuration was designed the scheme is shown in fig 7 this control module was based on changing the number of iaf channels in operation based on the inflow to achieve an average hrt within the optimum range 0 20 0 04 h based on inflow flowmeter values and the number of turbines per channel based on the fog inlet olr which was correlated with the measurements obtained at the of cod inlet measured using an online probe uvassc hach supplementary material fig s7 3 4 opportunities and challenges the recovery of fog from urban wastewater is a growing challenge that increases energy and maintenance costs and can negatively affect the performance of downstream treatment processes in wwtps currently the management of iaf systems is left to the expertise of operators to adjust the process when changes occur in the wastewater inlet characteristics therefore the methodology proposed herein to determine the fog content could be an alternative solution for monitoring and controlling iaf performance and can be used to optimize and automate the iaf system furthermore as stated previously the adoption of the spv method should be straight forward in most wwtp laboratories because no advanced equipment is required thus highlighting the advantages of the proposed method a remaining challenge for the optimization of the iaf is the development of sensors that can be installed in the wwtp for online monitoring of the fog content in wastewater in the meantime the identification of other parameters such as cod that can be reasonably correlated with the fog content is proposed additionally there are limited reports on iaf system performance or fog removal in wwtp hence it is difficult to compare if the yields obtained in this work are within a reasonable range notably each wwtp should conduct a specific evaluation of the iaf performance to determine the optimal operating conditions as they may change depending on the characteristics of the wastewater finally the optimization of the iaf system is the first step the improvement in the recovery of fog from wastewater should be followed by a smart management strategy such as co digestion which transforms this waste into a resource 4 conclusions fog analyses play an important role in controlling and estimating the iaf yield performance the methodology based on the spv proposed herein is comparable to that of traditional ir based quantification the spv method supposes a significant improvement in terms of cost and simplicity and it can be performed in wwtp laboratories the proposed method for fog determination was used in a full scale wwtp to evaluate the iaf system performance and determine the optimum operating conditions in terms of the residence time organic loading rate and air input based on the evaluation results an improved configuration was tested against the traditional operation of the iaf offering a reduction of 40 in the energy consumption of the iaf system and resulting comparable fog removal furthermore a control module scheme is developed for improved efficiency of operation of an automated iaf systems the proposed methodology and case study offer an innovative strategy for iaf optimization in urban wwtp systematic methodology process

12713,induced air flotation iaf is a well known technology that is widely applied in urban wastewater treatment plants wwtp for fat oil and grease fog removal however most iaf systems are not optimized and typically operate with fixed parameters regardless of inflow variations furthermore the optimization of iaf systems is limited by the lack of equipment in wwtp laboratories to determine fog concentrations in wastewater in this study an adapted sulfo phospho vanillin method for fog quantification in wastewater is proposed for optimization and automation of the iaf system the proposed methodology requires simple equipment that is widely available in wwtp laboratories paving the way for in situ fog determination the method was successfully employed to determine the optimal operating conditions of the iaf system in terms of hydraulic retention time and organic loading rate furthermore a full scale iaf system was optimized using this methodology and its energy demand was reduced by 40 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fat oil and grease wastewater spectrophotometric detection optimization approach sulfo phospho vanillin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the water sector is currently undergoing a paradigm shift from wastewater treatment and nutrient removal to resource recovery thus transforming wastewater treatment plants wwtps into water resource recovery facilities wrrfs 1 the latest technological developments highlight process intensification and resource recovery to facilitate higher effluent quality pursuing net zero targets for energy and carbon footprint neutrality 2 however most wwtps and wrrfs are still based on primary secondary and tertiary treatment processes during primary treatment physical the organic load is reduced thus enhancing the extraction of organic matter as commodities cellulose recovery 3 4 and or energy further anaerobic digestion 5 7 secondary biological treatment mainly focuses on the removal or reduction of soluble colloidal pollutants and nutrients to comply with established effluent discharge regulations evolution has occurred in conventional activated sludge systems i e membrane aerated biofilm reactors 8 and aerobic granular sludge technologies 9 and the development of new biological processes i e nitritation anammox processes 10 12 micro algae based treatment processes 13 14 and purple phototrophic bacteria treatment processes 15 has demonstrated conceptual and practical progress finally tertiary treatment has been implemented to improve the quality of wastewater effluent for reclamation 16 regardless of the concept employed wwtp wrrf and the technology implemented most facilities include a preliminary treatment that reduces undesired materials in the up flow treatment line primarily wipes and the largest materials 1 cm sand gravel fat oil and grease fog these preliminary treatments typically comprise different configurations of sieves and skimming flotation grease trap units flotation is a gravitational separation process which works by increasing the density difference between the continuous and dispersed phases this difference in density is accomplished by adding air to the wastewater to promote the formation of air fog agglomerates the air fog agglomerates float whereas higher density materials sands gravel settle on the base of the skimming flotation grease trap unit enabling their extraction 17 there were five different flotation systems their classification is based on the method of bubble formation i dissolved air flotation daf ii induced air flotation iaf iii froth flotation where air is directly injected into the fluid using a sparger iv electrolytic flotation and v vacuum flotation among these technologies iaf has been widely applied in urban wwtp to remove fog iaf presents several advantages in comparison with other technologies i high separation efficiency for removing small and light particles ii high loading rate and short retention time and iii small footprint 18 fog removal in preliminary treatment is particularly important for wwtps because unremoved fog can cause blockages in the plant infrastructure thus impeding treatment processes by disrupting settlement and clarification systems 19 moreover the slow degradation of fog in secondary or biological treatments impacts the activity of microorganisms and reduces the process efficiency by preventing the transfer of oxygen or slowing down the degradation rates of other organic materials furthermore failure in fog removal can result the failure of wwtp discharge limits 20 in line with wrrf concepts management strategies for the collected fog from wastewater treatment systems have attracted increased attention because they reduce the environmental impact and enhance resource recovery 21 the main fog management strategies include anaerobic co digestion with sewage sludge 22 25 and biofuel production 26 28 as described by pérez et al 29 preliminary treatments are responsible for removing most of the fog in inflow wastewater however thus far optimization has been limited to the correct design and initial installation dimensioning the most important parameter in the design and operation of air flotation systems is the air fog ratio if the amount of air employed in the air flotation system is less than optimum the fog removal efficiency is reduced if excess air is used power is wasted in compressing diffusing excess air however it is difficult to optimize this important variable and compare its efficiency operability because of i the variety in the equipment utilized both in scale and design ii the variation in wastewater characteristics and flowrates iii differences in the design and operation parameters of each facility and iv the lack of monitoring systems 30 in practice most air flotation systems for fog removal in urban wwtp are not optimized and usually operate constantly with fixed parameters regardless of the flowrate and organic loading conditions as previously mentioned fog removal in wwtp is also limited by the lack of a standard procedure for determining the optimum operating conditions therefore an additional limiting factor is the methodology used to determine fog content in wastewater samples fog represents a wide variety of organic compounds with different molecular weights that can be dispersed forming an emulsion or even dissolved 22 31 moreover for urban wwtps there are no online fog sensors available and laboratory determination has several drawbacks such as low levels of fog μg l 1 to be quantified or matrix interferences table 1 summarizes the methods reported the determination of fog in different types of wastewaters most of the current methods for fog quantification are time intensive and costly involving the extraction of fog from wastewater with an organic solvent hexane petroleum ether benzene ethyl ether chloroform n hexane or carbon tetrachloride and subsequent determination by ir gravimetric or chromatographic equipment 30 32 when gravimetric analyses are performed fog quantification is achieved by measuring the weight of the extracted fog after evaporation of the extracting solvents although this is the most widely used method it requires a large sample and solvent volume and exhibit high measurement uncertainty on the other hand ir based quantification is generally accepted as the most accurate and reproducible method but accessibility to ir equipment is limited in the majority of wwtp laboratories recent studies have presented the sulfo phospho vanillin spv method for lipid quantification in biological systems 33 36 and lipid production from microalgae biomass 32 37 40 table 2 summarizes the spv methods reported for lipid determination in biological systems compared with conventional methods for fog quantification in wastewater table 1 spv presents several advantages the spv method has a low detection limit μg l so a small amount of sample can be used and does not require considerable sample manipulation is time and labor efficient can be automated and is reproducible and easy to implement 33 the spv method comprises two steps an initial reaction of fog with concentrated sulfuric acid at high temperature followed by a second reaction of the derived products with vanillin in the presence of phosphoric acid in this study an adapted spv method for fog quantification was proposed as the basis for iaf system optimization and automation the performance of full scale iaf flotation system from an urban wwtp was evaluated using with this adapted methodology to determine the optimum operating conditions finally a new control strategy is proposed and validated by comparing traditional and optimized fog removal systems 2 materials methods 2 1 full scale wwtp description study was conducted at the lleida wwtp the wwtp has a capacity of 160 000 population equivalent pe with an inflow of 50 000 70 000 m3 d 1 and fog production of 40 tnfog y 1 the wwtp comprised preliminary treatment units for screening and grit fog removal the grit fog removal system comprised three iaf parallel channels with a volume capacity of 162 m3 per channel surface area 82 m2 per channel each iaf channel has eight aéroflo degreasing turbines ref f315 1 5 kwh referred to as

activated sludge reactors 4 3900 m3 and 2 3450 m3 and four secondary clarifiers 4 3150 m3 the primary sludge was thickened in two gravity thickeners 2 220 m3 and the waste activated sludge was thickened in a flotation unit 435 m3 the thickening units produced 70 100 m3 d 1 of primary sludge and 100 200 m3 d 1 of waste activated sludge was both sludges were mixed in a sludge buffer tank prior to mesophilic 35 42 c anaerobic digestion in two anaerobic digesters 2 2800 m3 the studied wwtp is highly instrumentalized a complete description of sensors probes and analyzers in both water and sludge lines has been previously published by palatsi et al 49 and romero güiza et al 50 furthermore the wwtp was equipped with 40 energy metres iem3250 schneider and an energy monitoring platform power logic egx300 schneider 2 2 analytical methods the fog determination procedure was developed by adapting the spv method to quantify lipids in biological systems 32 40 for fog quantification the sample 5 ml was placed in a 10 ml glass tube subsequently chloroform 2 ml 99 vwr chemicals ref 22711 29 was added to the tube which was then closed and agitated to extract fog in the organic phase subsequently 1 ml of the bottom chloroform extract phase was collected with a micropipette and transferred into a 7 ml glass vial an additional 1 ml of chloroform was added to the sample and further agitated taking another 1 ml of the bottom phase and transferring it to 7 ml vial the two extractions were verified to be sufficient for good fog determination in the evaluated samples however the number of extractions may be increased if required depending on the wastewater characteristics then the vial with the chloroform extract was incubated in a thermostatic unit lt200 hach at 70 c for 60 min to evaporate the chloroform once the solvent was removed concentrated sulfuric acid 2 ml 98 vwr chemicals ref 102765g was added to the vial the vial was heated for 10 min at 100 c in a thermostatic unit and cooled for 5 min in an ice bath an aliquot of freshly prepared phospho vanillin reagent 4 ml was then added to the vial and the absorbance was measured after 15 min at 530 nm using a vis rfid spectrophotometer dr3900 hach phospho vanillin reagent was prepared by dissolving vanillin 0 6 g 99 alfaaesar ref a11169 in absolute ethanol 10 ml 96 v v panreac applichem ref 131085

to the mixture the prepared reagents were stored in the dark until further use a calibration curve was prepared using commercial olive oil dissolved in chloroform final concentration 100 mg l 1 aliquots of the standard 0 2 ml equivalent to 0 250 μg olive oil were placed in clean glass 7 ml vials the vials were incubated at 70 c for 60 min to evaporate chloroform sulfuric acid and phospho vanillin reagent were then employed as described previously vials without fog addition were analyzed as blank controls to estimate the fog concentration curve calibration y absorbance a u vs x fog mass μg produced a trend line equation eq 1 1 y mx a where m is the slope and a the intercept of the line the fog concentration fogconc mg l 1 was determined as follows 2 fog conc y a m 3 2 v where v is the sample volume ml a standard operating procedure of the developed method is presented in the supplementary material section s2 so it can be easily adopted at any wwtp laboratory for spv method validation the samples were analyzed by an external laboratory iproma eurofins through oil and grease determination by infrared ir spectrometry lab reference ir 001 a method where oil grease is determined by extraction into hydrocarbon free solvent followed by measurement of the ir absorption spectrum of the extract the absorption between 3000 and 2900 cm 1 associated with c h groups in the oil grease was correlated to the concentration of oil grease patrons linear regression of the spv and ir methods with residual analysis was performed using origin software originlab corporation for

data at 9 operational conditions obtained in seven assays each assay was conducted by sampling the in flow and out flow of the iaf system for a period of 24 h sampling was conducted using two automatic sampling units sigma sd 900r 52 11522 hach which collected 300 ml at intervals of 15 min samples were integrated in 2 h periods resulting in 12 integrated samples per assay once integrated

improved iaf system was tested for comparison with the traditional design configuration during traditional operation the iaf system operates constantly with three channels and six turbines per channel in the improved configuration the number of channels was varied between two and three depending on the plant inflow and the number of turbines per channel was varied between three and four depending on the inlet olr each configuration was tested for five days and samples were collected hourly at the inlet and outlet of the iaf system using the same automatic sampling units described previously samples were integrated in 24 h periods proportional to the plant inflow the iaf performance of each configuration was assessed by determining the electric consumption as well as the fog extraction yield and specific fog extraction yield of both iaf configurations fig 1 schematically describes iaf sampling points measured variables and analytical methods described in materials methods section further information is available in supplementary material 3 results discussion 3 1 fog quantification in wastewater by spv method according to an extensive literature review the spv method presents two important factors that influence its accuracy and reliability solvent and standard selection table 2 solvent extraction plays an important because of the diverse chemical natures of fog appropriate solvent selection could interference and increase method selectivity chloroform based extraction solvents are most commonly used for oil grease characterisation 40 however when this method is carried out using microplates chloroform can interact and solubilize the surface of the plastic material changing the surface properties and thus influencing absorbance at different wavelengths 37 therefore a solvent mixture chloroform methanol 2 1 can be used to reduce solvent interference 32 36 48 in this study chloroform was selected as the extraction solvent because no plastic material was used in the experimental procedure regarding standard selection it is generally accepted that the spv reaction requires either a cc double bond or hydroxyl group to be present in the lipid molecule for it to be spv positive 48 the presence of more unsaturated fatty acid molecules leads to higher absorbance 32 47 therefore the selection of the standard is one of the factors that limit the accuracy of the spv method transforming it into a specific and selective method depending on the standard used 32 in this regard the complex fog composition found in wastewater 21 22 28 31 and the reasonable limitation of determining the best standard limit the accuracy of the method however mcmahon et al 35 showed that the spv method is effective in saturated and unsaturated lipid molecules through the production of an intermediate alkyl carbocation in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid moreover some studies have reported that olive oil shows maximum colour formation in comparison with other oils such as canola and sunflower oil which is attributed to the larger presence of unsaturated fatty acid molecules 32 36 47 although the presence of more unsaturated fatty acid molecules will causes higher absorbance it has also been reported that the presence of multiple double bonds in simple fatty acids does not result in the formation of a more intense colour whereby the reaction is specific to the concentration formation of a single carbon ion per molecule and the chemical structure of the sample 32 similarly the use of commercial oil in the quantification of bacterial and microalgal lipids using the spv method has demonstrated good accuracy 32 34 40 consequently the colorimetric method was first validated to generate calibration using known quantities of olive oil dissolved in chloroform the standards known quantities of the standard in the range of 0 250 μg were taken and incubated at 70 c for 60 min to evaporate the chloroform followed by the spv reaction protocol described in the experimental section the fog content was measured by plotting the absorbance at 530 nm against the oil concentration all calibration curves showed r2 higher than 0 99 supplementary material fig s4 moreover to validate the accuracy of the spv method in determining the fog content in wastewater five samples at different concentrations were selected and oil and grease were determined by ir spectrometry external laboratory a comparison between the spv and traditional ir methods is presented in fig 2 there is an evident correlation between both producing comparable results for fog determination under assay conditions with r2 higher than 0 98 and a similar range of uncertainty fig 2a furthermore the bland altman plot fig 2b indicates that the mean of the differences between the values reported by both methods is small 1 48 mg l 1 indicating that there is no bias between both methods additionally all the values fall between the limits of agreement mean 1 96 s d and are randomly dispersed which also indicates that both methods are comparable 52 3 2 evaluation of iaf at full scale wwtp the full scale wwtp assays were conducted under different iaf operational conditions a large screening consisting in seven assays were performed to test different hrt h and olr kgcod m 3 h 1 at different air input configurations kwh m 2 the hrt and olr were modified varying the number of active iaf channels 2 or 3 channels and the air input was modified by varying the number of turbines per channel powered kwh m 2 fig 3 shows the operating conditions of each assay and fig 4 shows the obtained yields table 3 summarizes the operating conditions and the obtained results data were collected every 2 h over 24 h for each assay only representative sample of stable operation conditions in terms of hrt and olr of each essay were selected between red lines in figs 3 and 4 to evaluate process performance the results showed that during the assays the iaf system inflow ranged from 1000 to 2500 m3 h 1 under normal operating conditions fig 3 the iaf configuration was switched between two and three operating channels which generated variations in olr between 2 4 and 4 1 kgcod m 3 h 1 0 15 0 40 kgfog m 3 h 1 in normal operation fig 3 and table 1 under these conditions the hrt has a range of 0 14 0 25 h the number of operating turbines was switched between 2 and 8 per iaf channel table 3 the turbine energy consumption and air input were estimated according to the equipment s technical notes 1 1 kwh per turbine and iaf area 82 m2 per channel therefore the tested iaf air input varied between 0 03 and 0 11 kwh m 2 the fog inflow outflow and extraction yield profiles are shown in and summarized in table 3 the results showed that the fog inflow had a range between 10 and 70 mg l 1 during normal operation the fog extraction capacity ranged from 10 to 40 kgfogext h 1 which represents 10 30 of the fog inflow although the maximum fog removal is 30 under assay conditions it is not clear whether this is a high or low yield since there is not sufficient literature reference information for comparison the fog composition plays an important role in the iaf removal yields because the air bubbles have a flotation effect only to the extent to which they adhere to the particles and droplets this implies that for effective flotation removal the diameter of the air bubble must be lower than the diameter of the flocculated material in suspension 30 it is estimated that the iaf system generates a bubble size range of 100 500 μm while fog is composed of free oil diameter 150 μm dispersed oil diameter 20 150 μm emulsified oil diameter 20 μm and soluble or dissolved oil diameter 5 μm 19 unfortunately in this study it was not possible to analyze the specific fog composition however considering the relatively low removal yield it is possible that the fog was composed mainly of 100 μm particles moreover it is well established that the flotation process comprises the following i the introduction of air bubbles into the wastewater ii collision between the air bubbles and suspended matter iii attachment of fine bubbles to the surface of the suspended matter iv collision between air attached suspended particles with the formation of agglomerates v entrapment of more air bubbles in the agglomerates and vi upward rise of floc structures in a sweeping action sweep flocculation 30 therefore several key variables determine the removal efficiency of the system such as air input and volume of air per unit volume of liquid bubble size distribution and degree of dispersion concentration and type of suspended matter and oils hydraulic design of the flotation chamber residence time temperature and ph 30 in this study we focused on the hrt olr and air input operational conditions because they are common parameters that are regulable in iaf systems for optimization purpose other parameters such as ph and temperature are often not regulable in urban wwtps inflows table 3 summarizes the operational conditions and fog extraction yield and fig 5 shows the correlations between fog extraction yields and kgfogext kwh 1 and operational conditions hrt and olr it can be observed that high yields 20 are obtained at low olr 0 30 kgfogin m 3 h 1 and high hrt 0 20 h however considering the specific fog extraction yield kgfogext kwh 1 high values are found for olr and hrt ranges of 0 25 0 30 kgfogin m 3 h 1 and 0 18 0 22 h respectively furthermore it is observed that high yields are obtained with an input air of 0 04 0 05 kwh m 2 and that increasing the air input 0 08 kwh m 2 does not lead to increasing the fog extraction yield resulting in poor performance the poor performance at a high air input could be associated with the attachment of fine bubbles to the surface of the fog particles turbulence plays an important role in this phenomenon because it affects the distribution of bubbles in the flow field macro turbulence has been proposed to affect the transport of particles and micro turbulence controls the dispersion of bubbles and bubble particle aggregates attachment and detachment 53 therefore high air input i e 0 08 kwh m 2 could increase the turbulence and hence the detachment of fog air particles and reduce the fog extraction yield 3 3 validation of optimized iaf at full scale wwtp full scale wwtp validation assays were conducted under real iaf operational conditions for two weeks to evaluate whether the energy efficiency of the system could be improved based on the results previously obtained in week 1 the plant was operated in the traditional configuration 3 iaf channels 6 turbines per channel while in week 2 the iaf was operated with an improved configuration for the improved configuration the number of operating iaf channels was changed based on the inflow flow rate of the wwtp during the night 23 30 07 30 when the inflow was low supplementary material fig s6 one channel was closed and the plant was only operated with two channels for the remaining day 3 channels were in operation with this improved configuration the hrt was kept more stable between 0 2 and 0 3 h avoiding large increases observed during nights using the traditional configuration fig 6 furthermore during the improved configuration the number of turbines per channel was modified depending on the organic loading rate measured by an inline cod probe at the inflow which was correlated with the fog content supplementary material fig s7 during the periods of higher olr 09 30 01 30 the iaf system was operated with four turbines per channel while during lower olr periods 01 30 09 30 only three turbines per channel were used fig 6a the energy consumption of the iaf system was measured fig 6b using energy meters it can be observed that the energy consumed in the traditional configuration is stable at approximately 35 kwh h 1 as the number of channels and turbines per channel remains constant in contrast with the improved configuration the energy consumed is reduced to 25 kwh h 1 during the day because the number of turbines is reduced from six to four and up to 15 kwh h 1 during night owing to the further reduction to three turbines and the closure of one channel on average the traditional configuration consumes 858 kwh d 1 whereas the improved configuration consumes only 508 kwh d 1 this implies a reduction of 40 in the energy consumption of the iaf system fog extraction of the iaf system using both configurations was performed to evaluate whether the reduction in energy consumption had a negative impact on the system performance the daily and average results for the traditional and improved configurations are summarized in table 4 it can be observed that the fog extraction is similar in the traditional 270 kg d 1 and improved configurations 230 kg d 1 as the inflow and fog inlet exhibited similar values in both assays the fog extraction yield was also in the same range for both configurations 17 and 16 these results together with the decrease in the energy consumption achieved using the improved iaf configuration translate into an increase in the specific fog extraction from 0 31 to 0 46 kg kwh 1 this represents an increase of 48 and a rise in the specific fog extraction yield from 20 to 32 of the fog reduction per kilowatt hour 60 increase the results obtained with these full scale assays validate the iaf improved configuration employed against the traditional configuration as it resulted in a considerable reduction in the energy consumption while maintaining a similar performance in fog extraction and fog extraction yield however this configuration could be further optimized if the system was automated and changing the number of operating channels and turbines was easier to achieve this automation an optimized operational configuration was designed the scheme is shown in fig 7 this control module was based on changing the number of iaf channels in operation based on the inflow to achieve an average hrt within the optimum range 0 20 0 04 h based on inflow flowmeter values and the number of turbines per channel based on the fog inlet olr which was correlated with the measurements obtained at the of cod inlet measured using an online probe uvassc hach supplementary material fig s7 3 4 opportunities and challenges the recovery of fog from urban wastewater is a growing challenge that increases energy and maintenance costs and can negatively affect the performance of downstream treatment processes in wwtps currently the management of iaf systems is left to the expertise of operators to adjust the process when changes occur in the wastewater inlet characteristics therefore the methodology proposed herein to determine the fog content could be an alternative solution for monitoring and controlling iaf performance and can be used to optimize and automate the iaf system furthermore as stated previously the adoption of the spv method should be straight forward in most wwtp laboratories because no advanced equipment is required thus highlighting the advantages of the proposed method a remaining challenge for the optimization of the iaf is the development of sensors that can be installed in the wwtp for online monitoring of the fog content in wastewater in the meantime the identification of other parameters such as cod that can be reasonably correlated with the fog content is proposed additionally there are limited reports on iaf system performance or fog removal in wwtp hence it is difficult to compare if the yields obtained in this work are within a reasonable range notably each wwtp should conduct a specific evaluation of the iaf performance to determine the optimal operating conditions as they may change depending on the characteristics of the wastewater finally the optimization of the iaf system is the first step the improvement in the recovery of fog from wastewater should be followed by a smart management strategy such as co digestion which transforms this waste into a resource 4 conclusions fog analyses play an important role in controlling and estimating the iaf yield performance the methodology based on the spv proposed herein is comparable to that of traditional ir based quantification the spv method supposes a significant improvement in terms of cost and simplicity and it can be performed in wwtp laboratories the proposed method for fog determination was used in a full scale wwtp to evaluate the iaf system performance and determine the optimum operating conditions in terms of the residence time organic loading rate and air input based on the evaluation results an improved configuration was tested against the traditional operation of the iaf offering a reduction of 40 in the energy consumption of the iaf system and resulting comparable fog removal furthermore a control module scheme is developed for improved efficiency of operation of an automated iaf systems the proposed methodology and case study offer an innovative strategy for iaf optimization in urban wwtp systematic methodology process

khso5 98 hydrochloric acid hcl 37 commercial cuo and co3o4 in powder form had purchased from aladdin corporation ltd china the milli q water was used for the preparation of tca stock solutions and as a solvent in all other experiments the buffer solutions of phosphate and citrate were prepared for ph experimentations 2 2 synthesis of sh cuo the cuo sheet was synthesized by adding 5 g of cuso4 7h2o in 100 ml milli q water and stirred for 1 h the nh4oh was then added to the above prepared mixture to maintain the ph around neutral conditions furthermore this mixture was then shifted to an autoclave teflon lined and placed in an oven for about 15 h at 175 c then the mixture was passed through a vacuum filtration process and the precipitates were cleaned via ethanol and water several times to remove unreacted portions the commercially available cuo and co3o4 were also used as a comparison in experimentation as co3o4 is mostly used for pms activation 2 3 experimental method the stock solution of 0 15 mm tca was prepared by mixing pure tca in milli q water for about 1 h the tests were carried out in a 200 ml conical flask to accomplish the optimum mixing a predetermined amount of tca was added and mixed for 30 min to reach equilibrium and adsorption a fixed quantity of activator was then added followed by continuous stirring for 30 min buffer solutions including citrate and phosphate were used to change the ph of the reaction mixture and a ph meter was used to determine the ph of the solution to start the reactions depending on the type of experiment varying amounts 0 1 mm 0 5 mm of oxidant pms and catalyst 0 05 g l 0 25 g l were added to the reaction mixture while it was still being stirred one milliliter of the sample was taken out of the conical flask mixed with n hexane 1 0 ml to stop the further reaction and then this sample was analyzed this process was repeated three times for each experiment and then the standard deviation and median of the results were presented the influence of dominant radicals such as so4 or oh was determined through scavenging 2 4 analytical method the sample collected via a method described in the prior section was

gas chromatograph gc vial then a predetermined amount of this sample was injected into a gc 7860 shanghai yiyo electronic technology co ltd china to analyze the concentration of tca the gc 7860 is equipped with a db vrx column and electron capture detector ecd the temperature of the detector injector and column was fixed as mentioned in our previous studies 28 the leaching of cu ions was

radiation source at an energy step size of 0 05 ev for a high resolution xps spectrum 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of synthesized sh cuo numerous analytical techniques were used to characterize the produced catalysts the xrd pattern showed distinct and prominent peaks of monoclinic tenorite cuo at 32 49 35 49 38 73 48 72 58 33 61 53 66 24 68 09 72 42 and 75 22 indexed as 1 1 0 0

was calculated through eq 1 and found to be 86 in the xrd diffraction no further peaks were observed confirming the purity of the sample the average crystallite size was calculated as 24 nm using sherrer equation as shown in eq 2 29 the sem analysis presented a sheet like structure of synthesized materials along with asymmetrical quadrangular shapes the sheet length and width were determined through micrograph and found to be 0 50 1 05 μm and 0 18 0 40 μm correspondingly fig 2a the tem image showed a regular distribution of sh cuo fig 2b while hrtem analysis determined 0 0 2 cuo planes having inner plane spacing around 0 2517 nm fig 2b inset the bet surface area presented the n2 adsorption desorption class iv curve of sh cuo and commercial samples presented and mesoporous sh cuo

considerably better than other reported studies as shown in table s1 and eventually influences degradation performance 1 crystallinity area of crystalline peaks area of all peaks 2 d kλ βcos ɵ where d

diffraction angle 3 2 the tca removal through sh cuo in pms primarily the tca removal efficiency of synthesized and commercial catalytic agents in the pms system was evaluated separately it has been well known that the removal process of contaminants from groundwater through catalysts consists of two phenomena adsorption followed by degradation so initially tca removal caused by adsorption was measured before degradation in this case separate experiments with sh cuo solvent cuo only pms solvent pms only and tca solvent tca control were conducted to measure degradation through adsorption or evaporation as shown in fig 3 the tca control experiment showed only 4 reduction from the original amount that may be due to volatilization the pms merely adsorbed 7 32 of tca while sh cuo showed about 19 adsorption efficiency after 120 mins with different kinetic behaviors these results showed that adsorption of pms sh cuo played its role in the removal of tca the high adsorption of tca in the sh cuo system could be attributed to the sheet structure with more surface availability which can trap contaminants the sh cuo performed better in pms activation for tca degradation 92 than other commercial and cuo and co3o4 43 and 47 respectively as indicated in fig 4a the consumption of pms was examined using the abts calorimetric method and it was discovered that its concentration dropped over time indicating the breakdown of pms during the reaction as shown in fig s2 when compared to cuo pms and co3o4 pms the sh cuo pms system had a lower pms concentration at the end of the reaction as shown in fig s1 presenting that sh cuo had greater catalytic activity due to higher consumption and activation of oxidant furthermore the kinetic analysis of degradation schemes was performed and it was discovered that the reaction rate constants of sh cuo cuo and co3o4 were 0 017 min 1 0 005 min 1 and 0 005 min 1 respectively with high regression coefficients r2 values of 0 976 0 962 and 0 937 correspondingly as shown in fig 4b these findings demonstrated that sh cuo outperforms cuo and co3o4 the increased surface area of sh cuo may be the cause since it may provide more active sites for pms breakdown resulting in the production of more reactive oxygen species ros such as so4 this phenomenon can be validated through bet adsorption desorption curves shown in fig s2 and the surface properties of sh cuo described in the previous section furthermore free metal ions are expected to be liberated into an aqueous solution containing pms a small experiment was performed to evaluate the contribution of the homogeneous system to degradation performance in the sh cuo pms system the number of cu ions leached during the 120 min reaction was found to be 0 23 mg l as a result the same amount of cu ions were added to the preset mixture for heterogeneous pms activation it was discovered that cu2 pms only removes 18 of tca implying that tca degradation in the sh cuo pms process is mostly due to heterogeneous action 3 3 parametric optimization the impact of several parameters including tca concentration sh cuo and pms dosage as well as temperature and ph were investigated as presented in fig 5 tca breakdown was reported to be accelerated from 59 75 to 95 42 with increasing pms concentration 0 1 0 5 mm in the sh cuo pms system fig 5a this could be due to an increase in ros as solitary pms did not affect elimination efficiency hence 0 5 mm pms concentration was considered optimum for further experiments the initial tca concentration can also influence degrading performance as seen in fig 5b raising the tca concentration 0 10 0 40 mm gradually reduces the deterioration rate from 96 42 to 61 42 the obvious cause could be a higher concentration of tca occupying the catalyst s active sites rendering them ineffective for pms activation however if the tca content is high more oxidant is required and pms is in short supply to meet this high demand the 0 15 mm was considered in this study because it is the average concentration of tca in most of the contaminated sites in china furthermore the influence of sh cuo on tca degradation was also investigated the tca removal was found to be 67 42 85 88 92 35 and 95 42 at 0 05 g l 0 15 g l 0 20 g l and 0 25 g l sh cuo concentrations respectively as shown in fig 6a the increase in tca degradation may be owing to the availability of more reactive species at larger sh cuo doses offering a good platform to degrade the pollutant additionally the influence of temperature 15 c 25 c 30 c 35 c was also evaluated and a strong rising trend between temperature increases with degrading performance was discovered fig 6b as most of the experiments were conducted around room temperature so 25 c was chosen the activation energy is essential for all reaction mechanisms and can be calculated using the arrhenius equation eq 3 which is based on the relationship between the reaction rate constant and the temperature 3 ln k ln a e a rt here the ea is activation energy and r is the rate constant t is the temperature k is the reaction rate constant and a is the frequency factor the slope of the equation was calculated by drawing a curve between 1 t and ln k and the activation energy was determined to be 9 601 kj mol the activation energy of sh cuo was discovered to be lower than that of many other reactions 30 32 this demonstrated that catalytic activation for tca breakdown might be easily accomplished our predicted activation energy was found to be significantly greater than that of diffusion control processes implying that surface activation of the catalyst is dominant in tca degradation the fenton system is largely influenced by the solution ph due to alteration in the generation of reactive oxygen species so catalytic performance of sh cuo was checked at various ph 3 11 conditions as shown in fig 7 the results indicated that degradation performance was found to be 31 02 ph 3 78 12 ph 4 92 10 ph 5 88 85 ph 7 86 15 ph 8 79 51 ph 9 and 58 42 ph 11 moreover the reaction kinetics of ph experiments were determined using the following eq 4 4 ln c i c o kt where co and ci are tca concentrations at the initial and specified time t respectively k is rate constant which can be calculated by the slope obtained from the linear fitting analysis the rate constant was found to be 0 00266 min 1 ph 3 0 00649 min 1 ph 4 0 00696 min 1 ph 5 and 0 00683 min 1 ph 7 0 00634 min 1 ph 8 0 00583 min 1 ph 9 0 00387 min 1 and ph 11 the rate constant at ph 5 is 2 61 and 1 81 times greater than values obtained at ph 3 and 11 correspondingly this could be due to the production and variation of hso5 in the studied system 33 the catalyst surface was supposed to be a positive charge under our ph range as phzpc of sh cuo was measured and calculated to be 9 1 and produce electrostatic forces to promote the contact with hso5 34 it can be concluded from the above results that the tca degradation can be found maximum around ph 7 8 this may be due to the surface charge of sh cuo so the zeta potential mv of synthesized material was calculated using eq 5 and the results are shown in fig s3 5 ζ 4 πη d t μ where ζ and μ are zeta potential and electrophoretic mobility respectively dt is the dielectric constant and η is the viscosity of the medium the results indicated that sh cuo has a positive surface charge from the 2 9 ph range and the zero point charge phzpc was found to be 9 1 other studies confirmed that the pka1 of the pms is less than zero and the pka2 is 9 4 so there will be the existence of hso4 at studied ph conditions 30 the increase in positive surface charge under acidic circumstances promotes electrostatic interaction between the pms and sh cuo negative charged resulting in a higher removal efficiency 35 36 furthermore as the ph approached phzpc the quantity of positive surface charge on the produced catalyst reduced resulting in a decrease in electrostatic attraction between sh cuo and pms 37 another factor could be the formation of non radical species at higher ph levels 38 finally experiments conducted using all the optimum parameters obtained pms 0 5 mm sh cuo 0 25 g l t 25 c tca 0 15 mm and ph 5 in this section and about 97 5 tca removal was observed fig s5 3 4 degradation mechanism it was thought that the degradation of tca occurred in presence of radical species in the pms catalyzed system and oh so4 and so5 may be dominant but the influence of later mentioned so5 species can be overlooked due to lower redox potential 1 1 v 39 to investigate the influence of the dominant radical species the tertiary butyl alcohol tba and methanol meoh were selected as scavenging agents for oh and so4 radicals respectively a specific concentration 0 1 m was selected for ongoing experiments it can be noted in fig 8 that when tba was added in the sh cuo pms system no significant decrease in degradation was seen indicating that the oh are not the prominent reactive species when meoh was added as a scavenging agent however the system displayed a substantial delay in tca removal efficiency indicating that so4 played a noteworthy role in the sh cuo pms system the scavenging studies show that while meoh scavenges the breakdown of tca there is still more than 40 degradation that may be obtained this indicated that there could be some other way or species non radical involved in remediation of tca to investigate the other mechanisms involved in the activation and degradation process a further study on the xps analysis was carried out before and after activation to determine the change in valance states of cu the xps spectra fig 9 of sh cuo revealed prominent peaks at 933 04 ev and 934 76 ev ascribed to cu2 in copper hydroxide and copper oxide respectively the peaks at 940 81 ev and 942 58 ev are satellite peaks of cu2 oxidative species furthermore the xps spectra following the reaction were examined and it was found that cu2p3 2 characteristic peaks stretched and broadened attributed to the variations in the oxidation state of copper during the degradation process the reason behind that the cu2 oh oso3 complex forms on the surface of sh cuo and this complex decomposes to cu3 and so4 radicals as the process progresses this cu3 can operate as a strong oxidant due to its high reduction potential 2 3 v in solid form so the cu3 generated in the system helps the oxidation of tca observed under the presence of meoh as a scavenger the cu3 production and conversion in the sh cuo pms follow the reactions described in eqs 6 9 6 hso 5 cu 2 oh oh cu 2 oh oso 3 7 cu 2 oh oso 3 so 4 cu 3 oh 8 cu 3 oh hso 5 h 2 o cu 2 ooso 3 9 2cu 2 ooso 3 2h 2 o o 2 2h 2so 4 2cu 2 3 5 the stability test the stability of synthesized nanomaterial is vital for practical applications given this the recyclability of sh cuo was tested for four consecutive cycles at optimum dosages determined in previous experiments it was discovered that sh cuo retained its features and stability despite a 13 decline in performance until the fourth cycle fig 10 the decline in degradation performance could be owing to fewer active components being available as a result of leaching oxidation and poisoning of nanomaterials throughout the degradation process the leaching of cu2 in solution was measured and found less than 0 35 mg l which is within the range of permissible discharge regulations of china s water resources furthermore the xrd sem and xps characteristics of spent sh cuo revealed the presence of prominent peaks and structures confirming sh cuo durability as shown in fig s4 and fig 9 the higher stability and excellent catalytic performance of sh cuo make it suitable for practical application for the removal of hazardous chemicals from groundwater furthermore the performance of sh cuo was checked in actual water and about 30 4 of tca was degraded this may be due to the presence of various dissolved ions in actual groundwater shown in fig s5 4 conclusions the sh cuo was synthesized for the activation of pms for the removal of toxic tca the sh cuo exhibited superior performance 93 compared to commercially available cuo 43 and co3o4 47 the higher surface availability pore volume and surface area of sh cuo contribute to its higher catalytic efficacy the degrading performance was affected by several variables including pms 0 5 mm and sh cuo dosage 0 25 g l reaction temperature and solution ph of 5 the catalytic mechanism suggested that so4 radicals as well as the production and conversion of cu3 were responsible for tca breakdown the stability experiments elucidated that sh cuo can be used for multiple cycles without any change in morphology hence in the end we got the answer to our article title that synthesized sh cuo efficiently enabled the removal of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the pms system compared to other commercially available cuo and co3o4 under various experimental conditions

mixed with n hexane 1 0 ml to stop the further reaction and then this sample was analyzed this process was repeated three times for each experiment and then the standard deviation and median of the results were presented the influence of dominant radicals such as so4 or oh was determined through scavenging 2 4 analytical method the sample collected via a method described in the prior section was followed the solvent and the sample were mixed for a couple of minutes until both layers were clear the upper layer was then collected from the sample bottle via a dropper and transferred to a clean gas chromatograph gc vial then a predetermined amount of this sample was injected into a gc 7860 shanghai yiyo electronic technology co ltd china to analyze the concentration of tca the gc 7860 is equipped with a db vrx column and electron capture detector ecd the temperature of the detector injector and column was fixed as mentioned in our previous studies 28 the leaching of cu ions was

radiation source at an energy step size of 0 05 ev for a high resolution xps spectrum 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of synthesized sh cuo numerous analytical techniques were used to characterize the produced catalysts the xrd pattern showed distinct and prominent peaks of monoclinic tenorite cuo at 32 49 35 49 38 73 48 72 58 33 61 53 66 24 68 09 72 42 and 75 22 indexed as 1 1 0 0

was calculated through eq 1 and found to be 86 in the xrd diffraction no further peaks were observed confirming the purity of the sample the average crystallite size was calculated as 24 nm using sherrer equation as shown in eq 2 29 the sem analysis presented a sheet like structure of synthesized materials along with asymmetrical quadrangular shapes the sheet length and width were determined through micrograph and found to be 0 50 1 05 μm and 0 18 0 40 μm correspondingly fig 2a the tem image showed a regular distribution of sh cuo fig 2b while hrtem analysis determined 0 0 2 cuo planes

diffraction angle 3 2 the tca removal through sh cuo in pms primarily the tca removal efficiency of synthesized and commercial catalytic agents in the pms system was evaluated separately it has been well known that the removal process of contaminants from groundwater through catalysts consists of two phenomena adsorption followed by degradation so initially tca removal caused by adsorption was measured before degradation in this case separate experiments with sh cuo solvent cuo only pms solvent pms only and tca solvent tca control were conducted to measure degradation through adsorption or evaporation as shown in fig 3 the tca control experiment showed only 4 reduction from the original amount that may be due to volatilization the pms merely adsorbed 7 32 of tca while sh cuo showed about 19 adsorption efficiency after 120 mins with different kinetic behaviors these results showed that adsorption of pms sh cuo played its role in the removal of tca the high adsorption of tca in the sh cuo system could be attributed to the sheet structure with more surface availability which can trap contaminants the sh cuo performed better in pms activation for tca degradation 92 than other commercial and cuo and co3o4 43 and 47 respectively as indicated in fig 4a the consumption of pms was examined using the abts calorimetric method and it was discovered that its concentration dropped over time indicating the breakdown of pms during the reaction as shown in fig s2 when compared to cuo pms and co3o4 pms the sh cuo pms system had a lower pms concentration at the end of the reaction as shown in fig s1 presenting that sh cuo had greater catalytic activity due to higher consumption and activation of oxidant furthermore the kinetic analysis of degradation schemes was performed and it was discovered that the reaction rate constants of sh cuo cuo and co3o4 were 0 017 min 1 0 005 min 1 and 0 005 min 1 respectively with high regression coefficients r2 values of 0 976 0 962 and 0 937 correspondingly as shown in fig 4b these findings demonstrated that sh cuo outperforms cuo and co3o4 the increased surface area of sh cuo may be the cause since it may provide more active sites for pms breakdown resulting in the production of more reactive oxygen species ros such as so4 this phenomenon can be validated through bet adsorption desorption curves shown in fig s2 and the surface properties of sh cuo described in the previous section furthermore free metal ions are expected to be liberated into an aqueous solution containing pms a small experiment was performed to evaluate the contribution of the homogeneous system to degradation performance in the sh cuo pms system the number of cu ions leached during the 120 min reaction was found to be 0 23 mg l as a result the same amount of cu ions were added to the preset mixture for heterogeneous pms activation it was discovered that cu2 pms only removes 18 of tca implying that tca degradation in the sh cuo pms process is mostly due to heterogeneous action 3 3 parametric optimization the impact of several parameters including tca concentration sh cuo and pms dosage as well as temperature and ph were investigated as presented in fig 5 tca breakdown was reported to be accelerated from 59 75 to 95 42 with increasing pms concentration 0 1 0 5 mm in the sh cuo pms system fig 5a this could be due to an increase in ros as solitary pms did not affect elimination efficiency hence 0 5 mm pms concentration was considered optimum for further experiments the initial tca concentration can also influence degrading performance as seen in fig 5b raising the tca concentration 0 10 0 40 mm gradually reduces the deterioration rate from 96 42 to 61 42 the obvious cause could be a higher concentration of tca occupying the catalyst s active sites rendering them ineffective for pms activation however if the tca content is high more oxidant is required and pms is in short supply to meet this high demand the 0 15 mm was considered in this study because it is the average concentration of tca in most of the contaminated sites in china furthermore the influence of sh cuo on tca degradation was also investigated the tca removal was found to be 67 42 85 88 92 35 and 95 42 at 0 05 g l 0 15 g l 0 20 g l and 0 25 g l sh cuo concentrations respectively as shown in fig 6a the increase in tca degradation may be owing to the availability of more reactive species at larger sh cuo doses offering a good platform to degrade the pollutant additionally the influence of temperature 15 c 25 c 30 c 35 c was also evaluated and a strong rising trend between temperature increases with degrading performance was discovered fig 6b as most of the experiments were conducted around room temperature so 25 c was chosen the activation energy is essential for all reaction mechanisms and can be calculated using the arrhenius equation eq 3 which is based on the relationship between the reaction rate constant and the temperature 3 ln k ln a e a rt here the ea is activation energy and r is the rate constant t is the temperature k is the reaction rate constant and a is the frequency factor the slope of the equation was calculated by drawing a curve between 1 t and ln k and the activation energy was determined to be 9 601 kj mol the activation energy of sh cuo was discovered to be lower than that of many other reactions 30 32 this demonstrated that catalytic activation for tca breakdown might be easily accomplished our predicted activation energy was found to be significantly greater than that of diffusion control processes implying that surface activation of the catalyst is dominant in tca degradation the fenton system is largely influenced by the solution ph due to alteration in the generation of reactive oxygen species so catalytic performance of sh cuo was checked at various ph 3 11 conditions as shown in fig 7 the results indicated that degradation performance was found to be 31 02 ph 3 78 12 ph 4 92 10 ph 5 88 85 ph 7 86 15 ph 8 79 51 ph 9 and 58 42 ph 11 moreover the reaction kinetics of ph experiments were determined using the following eq 4 4 ln c i c o kt where co and ci are tca concentrations at the initial and specified time t respectively k is rate constant which can be calculated by the slope obtained from the linear fitting analysis the rate constant was found to be 0 00266 min 1 ph 3 0 00649 min 1 ph 4 0 00696 min 1 ph 5 and 0 00683 min 1 ph 7 0 00634 min 1 ph 8 0 00583 min 1 ph 9 0 00387 min 1 and ph 11 the rate constant at ph 5 is 2 61 and 1 81 times greater than values obtained at ph 3 and 11 correspondingly this could be due to the production and variation of hso5 in the studied system 33 the catalyst surface was supposed to be a positive charge under our ph range as phzpc of sh cuo was measured and calculated to be 9 1 and produce electrostatic forces to promote the contact with hso5 34 it can be concluded from the above results that the tca degradation can be found maximum around ph 7 8 this may be due to the surface charge of sh cuo so the zeta potential mv of synthesized material was calculated using eq 5 and the results are shown in fig s3 5 ζ 4 πη d t μ where ζ and μ are zeta potential and electrophoretic mobility respectively dt is the dielectric constant and η is the viscosity of the medium the results indicated that sh cuo has a positive surface charge from the 2 9 ph range and the zero point charge phzpc was found to be 9 1 other studies confirmed that the pka1 of the pms is less than zero and the pka2 is 9 4 so there will be the existence of hso4 at studied ph conditions 30 the increase in positive surface charge under acidic circumstances promotes electrostatic interaction between the pms and sh cuo negative charged resulting in a higher removal efficiency 35 36 furthermore as the ph approached phzpc the quantity of positive surface charge on the produced catalyst reduced resulting in a decrease in electrostatic attraction between sh cuo and pms 37 another factor could be the formation of non radical species at higher ph levels 38 finally experiments conducted using all the optimum parameters obtained pms 0 5 mm sh cuo 0 25 g l t 25 c tca 0 15 mm and ph 5 in this section and about 97 5 tca removal was observed fig s5 3 4 degradation mechanism it was thought that the degradation of tca occurred in presence of radical species in the pms catalyzed system and oh so4 and so5 may be dominant but the influence of later mentioned so5 species can be overlooked due to lower redox potential 1 1 v 39 to investigate the influence of the dominant radical species the tertiary butyl alcohol tba and methanol meoh were selected as scavenging agents for oh and so4 radicals respectively a specific concentration 0 1 m was selected for ongoing experiments it can be noted in fig 8 that when tba was added in the sh cuo pms system no significant decrease in degradation was seen indicating that the oh are not the prominent reactive species when meoh was added as a scavenging agent however the system displayed a substantial delay in tca removal efficiency indicating that so4 played a noteworthy role in the sh cuo pms system the scavenging studies show that while meoh scavenges the breakdown of tca there is still more than 40 degradation that may be obtained this indicated that there could be some other way or species non radical involved in remediation of tca to investigate the other mechanisms involved in the activation and degradation process a further study on the xps analysis was carried out before and after activation to determine the change in valance states of cu the xps spectra fig 9 of sh cuo revealed prominent peaks at 933 04 ev and 934 76 ev ascribed to cu2 in copper hydroxide and copper oxide respectively the peaks at 940 81 ev and 942 58 ev are satellite peaks of cu2 oxidative species furthermore the xps spectra following the reaction were examined and it was found that cu2p3 2 characteristic peaks stretched and broadened attributed to the variations in the oxidation state of copper during the degradation process the reason behind that the cu2 oh oso3 complex forms on the surface of sh cuo and this complex decomposes to cu3 and so4 radicals as the process progresses this cu3 can operate as a strong oxidant due to its high reduction potential 2 3 v in solid form so the cu3 generated in the system helps the oxidation of tca observed under the presence of meoh as a scavenger the cu3 production and conversion in the sh cuo pms follow the reactions described in eqs 6 9 6 hso 5 cu 2 oh oh cu 2 oh oso 3 7 cu 2 oh oso 3 so 4 cu 3 oh 8 cu 3 oh hso 5 h 2 o cu 2 ooso 3 9 2cu 2 ooso 3 2h 2 o o 2 2h 2so 4 2cu 2 3 5 the stability test the stability of synthesized nanomaterial is vital for practical applications given this the recyclability of sh cuo was tested for four consecutive cycles at optimum dosages determined in previous experiments it was discovered that sh cuo retained its features and stability despite a 13 decline in performance until the fourth cycle fig 10 the decline in degradation performance could be owing to fewer active components being available as a result of leaching oxidation and poisoning of nanomaterials throughout the degradation process the leaching of cu2 in solution was measured and found less than 0 35 mg l which is within the range of permissible discharge regulations of china s water resources furthermore the xrd sem and xps characteristics of spent sh cuo revealed the presence of prominent peaks and structures confirming sh cuo durability as shown in fig s4 and fig 9 the higher stability and excellent catalytic performance of sh cuo make it suitable for practical application for the removal of hazardous chemicals from groundwater furthermore the performance of sh cuo was checked in actual water and about 30 4 of tca was degraded this may be due to the presence of various dissolved ions in actual groundwater shown in fig s5 4 conclusions the sh cuo was synthesized for the activation of pms for the removal of toxic tca the sh cuo exhibited superior performance 93 compared to commercially available cuo 43 and co3o4 47 the higher surface availability pore volume and surface area of sh cuo contribute to its higher catalytic efficacy the degrading performance was affected by several variables including pms 0 5 mm and sh cuo dosage 0 25 g l reaction temperature and solution ph of 5 the catalytic mechanism suggested that so4 radicals as well as the production and conversion of cu3 were responsible for tca breakdown the stability experiments elucidated that sh cuo can be used for multiple cycles without any change in morphology hence in the end we got the answer to our article title that synthesized sh cuo efficiently enabled the removal of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the pms system compared to other commercially available cuo and co3o4 under various experimental conditions
