10130,atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration temperature and nitrogen n are the key regulators of productivity and water use of plants under the changing climate however field scale studies on the interactive effect of the three above critical inputs are limited hence this field study was conducted with three climate treatments ambient ac elevated co2 ec 550 µmol mol 1 and co elevation of both co2 and temperature ecet 550 µmol mol 1 and temperature 2 c above ambient and four n treatments 0 50 100 and 150 of recommended n dose of 120 kg n ha 1 the experiment was carried out in open top field chambers to study the effects of climate and n application on grain yield evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue in wheat crop crop et was estimated by field water balance method and wue by taking the ratio of grain yield to crop et elevation of co2 showed 9 yield gain over ambient averaged across n levels whereas co elevation of temperature reduced the yield gain to 4 further n application significantly altered the level of co2 response under co2 enriched environment the yield gain was 15 with n100 as compared to 2 and 4 under n0 and n50 respectively indicating co2 enrichment benefits in grain yield was n dependent the three years pooled data showed significant effect of climate n and their interaction on profile water storage evapotranspiration and wue elevation of co2 alone or with co elevation of temperature resulted in significant decline in crop et by 4 11 mm and significant increase in profile soil moisture and wue the wue improved significantly by 12 under ec and by 4 under ecet respectively with the increase more attributed to gain in grain yield quantitative derivation from the three years field experimentation could establish that under elevated co2 scenario 550 µmol mol 1 an additional 1 c rise in temperature would result in enhanced crop et by 5 mm and yield loss of about 4 this study thus revealed that limited n and increased temperature would potentially restrict the co2 mediated benefits in wheat yield and water use under the changing climate keywords co2 enrichment crop water use co2 fertilization climate change impact water nitrogen interaction 1 introduction rising atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration and simultaneous global warming have raised several concerns on future agricultural production the highest ever monthly record of atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration at mauna loa observatory reached a peak of 417 1 µmol mol 1 during may 2020 world meteorological organization 2020 a decadal analysis shows the growth rate of co2 at 2 06 µmol mol 1 yr 1 during 2005 2015 as compared to 1 86 µmol mol 1 yr 1 during 1995 2005 the significant increase in the atmospheric co2 concentration has a direct and substantial influence on ecological and biological processes with several ramifications primarily because co2 is a raw material in the process of photosynthetic assimilation increased co2 concentration stimulates net photosynthesis by increasing the availability of co2 as a substrate for rubisco enzyme and simultaneously reducing photorespiration in plants ainsworth et al 2008 this process of co2 fertilization is reported to enhance growth and metabolism in several crops particularly in c3 crops ainsworth and rogers 2007 lenka and lal 2012 kimball 2016 lenka et al 2020 the yield advantage is about 14 30 in wheat crop long et al 2006 kimball 2016 with reportedly higher response in controlled conditions ainsworth et al 2008 apart from its effect on carbon metabolism co2 enrichment is also reported to influence water dynamics in plants due to alteration in stomatal behaviour thus crop evapotranspiration which is one of the major bio physical processes associated with feedbacks of co2 enrichment is likely to be affected as water metabolism is primarily regulated by stomatal opening and balance between intercellular and atmospheric co2 concentration xu et al 2016 christy et al 2018 wang et al 2018 reduction in stomatal conductance has been attributed to be the major factor in lowering the crop evapotranspiration leakey et al 2009 kimball 2016 though differing results on the effect of co2 elevation in coping with drought situations have been reported uddin et al 2018 wang et al 2018 rise in temperature due to global warming is likely to be another potential factor modifying the plant responses to increased co2 as most biological processes are temperature sensitive ruiz vera et al 2015 lenka et al 2017 dusenge et al 2019 thus the net effect of global change on plant carbon and water dynamics depends on plant responses to simultaneous changes in co2 concentration and temperature despite several studies on the impact of co2 elevation on net primary productivity very less is known on the field scale response in terms of water use in wheat due to combined influence of co2 temperature and n management the findings from pot or controlled studies wu et al 2004 chavan et al 2019 on effects of co2 enrichment have a larger uncertainty when extrapolated to larger scales field and ecosystem scale because of several interacting processes such as run off and soil evaporation allen 2000 wu et al 2004 bernacchi et al 2007 lenka and lal 2012 christy et al 2018 the co2 mediated net saving in crop water use is likely to bring a positive interactive effect on crop growth and yield and thus may influence water use efficiency wue in crop plants as water and n are the two critical inputs for crop production their role is going to increase under future climate few previous studies reported lower crop water use and significantly higher wue in wheat under co2 elevation wu et al 2004 uddin et al 2018 field scale studies on crop water use and wue in wheat crop under the combined influence of co2 and temperature at different n application levels are almost non existent keeping the above research gaps in view three hypotheses were set for the study 1 increment in grain yield due to co2 enrichment is n dependent 2 co elevation of temperature nullifies the benefits of co2 mediated responses 3 co2 elevation reduces water use and increases water use efficiency hence this field experiment was taken up for three consecutive years in open top field chambers otc to investigate the effects of elevation of co2 and co elevation of co2 and temperature on grain yield response crop evapotranspiration stomatal conductance and water use efficiency under different n application levels in wheat crop in the

respectively 3 2 grain yield a significant effect of climate was observed in two crop seasons whereas significant effect of n was observed across all the three crop seasons interaction of climate n was not significant in any of the crop seasons table 2 however the pooled data showed significant effect of climate n as well as their interaction higher grain yield was recorded under ec as compared to ambient and ecet the ambient and ecet treatments were at par fig 2 the co2 fertilization effects over ambient were higher under n100 or n150 as compared to lower n application levels fig 3 averaged across n treatments about 9 higher yield under ec and 4 higher yield under ecet was observed as compared to ambient increase in n application up to n100 resulted in significant increase in grain yield in all the study years the grain yield under n100 and n150 were statistically similar fig 4 the grain yield followed the order of n150 n100 n50 n0 compared over n0 the yield response under n100 in the ambient ec and ecet treatments were 45 63 and 48 respectively fig 5 the corresponding values under n150 were 48 64 and 56 the response of n150 over n100 was marginal under ambient and under ec but was to the extent of 8 under ecet treatment the pooled data showed significantly higher grain yield under ec n100 which was similar to ec n150 and ecet n150 treatments significantly lowest grain yield was observed in the n0 treatments under any climate condition 3 3 crop evapotranspiration in general a trend of reduction in et was observed under ec and ecet than ambient in most of the years as well as in the pooled data fig 6 effects of climate and n were significant on crop et table 2 the general trend of et followed the order ac ecet ec the crop et per season was lower by 8 mm under ec and by 3 mm under ecet than ambient respectively the three years data showed a significant interaction between climate and n table 2 among the treatments et was significantly highest under ac n150 followed by ecet n150 and was significantly lowest under ec n0 averaged over climate treatments the crop et was higher by 7 10 mm under n100 or n150 as compared to n0 as observed in the pooled data fig 6 table 3 3 4 profile water stock at harvest soil moisture during crop growth and change in soil water storage in general elevation of co2 alone or in combination with temperature showed significantly higher profile water storage than ambient fig 7 table 2 a significant effect of climate and n was observed in all the years the interaction was significant only in the 3rd season and in the pooled data table 2 the general trend of profile water storage followed the order ec ecet ac among the n treatments only n100 or n150 showed lower profile water storage the profile water stock was significantly highest under ec n0 and significantly lowest under ac n150 as observed from the pooled data of three years table 3 the depth wise distribution of soil moisture content fig 8 monitored at regular intervals during the crop growth season showed a general trend of higher soil moisture content under ec than the other two treatments the ecet and ambient treatments were either similar or ecet showed slightly higher soil moisture content than ambient the average soil water storage at the sowing of the crop was 147 4 mm depletion in soil water storage s was significantly higher under ambient followed by ecet and then ec treatment table 3 among the n treatments n150 showed significantly higher depletion in profile water storage followed by n100 or n50 with all the three n treatments significantly higher than that of n0 3 5 water use efficiency wue effect of climate n as well as their interaction was significant on wue table 2 the wue was significantly higher under ec followed by ecet and ambient table 3 similar trend of difference between climate treatments was observed in all the study seasons though the numerical values were lower in the 1st crop season fig 9 among the treatments significantly higher wue was observed in ec n100 which was at par with ec n150 on the other hand significantly lowest wue was observed in n0 under all climate conditions fig 9 effect of n on wue was consistently observed across study years as well as in the pooled data the wue followed the trend of n150 n100 n50 n0 table 3 3 6 photosynthesis rate pn stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr effect of climate was significant on pn in all the observation dates across study years though effects of n and climate n interaction were generally non significant table 2 on the contrary effects of climate n and their interaction were significant on gs and tr in most of the observation dates table 2 the pn values under ec and ecet were statistically similar with significantly lower values under ac treatment fig 10 significantly lower gs and higher tr was observed under ec and ecet treatments despite variation in the trend of measured data figs 11 and 12 the gs was similar among n application treatments with all n treatments being significantly higher than n0 the same trend was observed in tr also significantly highest values of gs was observed under ac n100 in most cases 4 discussion 4 1 effect of climate and n on grain yield among the climatic parameters co2 and temperature are the two critical variables influencing plant growth and metabolism our study spanning over three consecutive seasons of wheat crop indicated a significant effect of elevated co2 over ambient on grain yield with average of 15 at recommended dose of n application n100 a much lower co2 fertilization benefit under n50 or n0 fig 3 confirmed our 1st hypothesis and underlined the role of n in harnessing the co2 mediated response in crop plants lenka and lal 2012 asif et al 2020 our findings are in agreement with some previous observations reich et al 2014 terrer et al 2019 availability of n is an important contributor to sink development in plants and thus regulates some yield attributes like tiller and leaf production in wheat thus diminished co2 fertilization benefits under low availability of soil n have been reported reich et al 2014 in their experiment elevated co2 resulted about 33 increase in plant biomass under optimum availability of water and n in contrast to negligible increase under low n and water stress conditions reich et al 2014 at global scale the strength of co2 fertilization is primarily driven by n in about 65 of global vegetation terrer et al 2019 thus a down regulation of photosynthetic assimilation may be the primary driver in diminishing the co2 mediated benefits under low n availability elevated co2 is reported to induce fertilization effect particularly in c3 plants long et al 2006 kimball et al 2016 uddin et al 2018 lenka et al 2019 2020 primarily due to reduction in oxygenase activity of rubisco enzyme and higher rate of photosynthesis fig 10 however the extent of increase in crop yield upon exposure to elevated co2 is variable with the nature of crop experiment abiotic stress and site fertility ainsworth et al 2008 qiao et al 2010 broberg et al 2019 in general field studies report a lower co2 fertilization effect than in pot experiments ainsworth et al 2008 in our study wheat grain yield enhancement owing to elevation of co2 was about 9 across n levels and 15 at n100 which was similar to other findings from field condition in india and south asia qiao et al 2010 hazra et al 2019 about 17 increase in average wheat grain yield was reported from a field experiment in otcs hazra et al 2019 in indian condition and 19 increase in a face experiment kimball 2016 in usa qiao et al 2010 from an otc study in china reported about 7 enhancement in wheat grain yield under well watered and 10 under drought stress conditions a meta analysis of field grown wheat data indicated 26 yield advantage with co2 elevation up to 600 ppm broberg et al 2019 on the other hand single season pot experiments in phytotron in north india report larger co2 fertilization effect in wheat kant et al 2007 rakshit et al 2012 grain yield was reported to increase by 35 45 with co2 elevation over ambient kant et al 2007 rakshit et al 2012 observed about 11 increase in grain and shoot biomass under elevated co2 much of the yield benefits accrued from co2 elevation were offset with co elevation of temperature as observed from a non significant increase in grain yield by about 4 under ecet over ambient fig 3 the observations are in line with some previous findings where co elevation of temperature along with elevation of co2 resulted in non significant about 5 decrease in grain yield and shoot biomass rakshit et al 2012 this indicates temperature elevation exerted an adverse effect on crop yield in the later part of crop growth when the ambient air temperature is generally higher a non significant increase in grain yield under ecet was observed despite statistically similar pn values under ec and ecet in the early period of crop growth fig 10 for instance in 2019 crop season the pn values were similar between ec and ecet at 58 days after sowing but the pn was significantly higher under ec than ecet at 79 days after sowing fig 10 this was partly in line with our set 2nd hypothesis that co elevation of temperature may offset the co2 mediated benefits further it was observed that higher n application n150 could alleviate the adverse effect of higher temperature to some extent figs 3 and 5 on the other hand at the same site with the same experimental set up lenka et al 2020 showed 34 47 yield advantage in soybean with co elevation of co2 and temperature it thus indicates that effect of enhanced co2 is crop specific and depends upon temperature threshold of the particular crop 4 2 effect of climate and n on crop et profile soil moisture physiological attributes and water use efficiency elevation of co2 reduces crop et and consequentially improves profile water storage in several crops bernacchi et al 2007 kimball 2016 lenka et al 2020 however very few information is available on the combined influence of elevated co2 and temperature on crop water use in our experiment significant reduction in crop et and improvement in soil profile water storage was observed in the three study years due to co2 enrichment table 3 across all the three seasons of experiment the gain in profile water storage up to 60 cm soil depth at harvest was to the extent of 9 mm under ec translating to about 7 higher profile soil water content under ec than ambient reduced crop et and better soil moisture regime under co2 enrichment treatments proved the 3rd hypothesis and is consistent with some previous findings for instance 9 decrease in et was reported by allen et al 2003 whereas 9 16 decrease in et in soybean was observed by bernacchi et al 2007 at the same site lenka et al 2020 reported 4 5 decrease in crop et and 5 9 increase in profile water storage in soybean crop uddin et al 2018 reported co2 elevation reduces crop water use and improves drought tolerance in wheat plants primarily due to better below ground biomass however the advantage of water saving under co2 enrichment got reduced with co elevation of temperature table 3 temperature elevation in this experiment ecet treatment was made to the extent of about 2 c above ambient elevation of co2 also causes simultaneous increase in temperature a comparison of thermal profile showed about 1 2 c of higher temperature under ecet than ec lenka et al 2020 the profile water stock was higher by 6 mm and crop et was lower by an equal amount under ec as compared to ecet table 3 comparison of the grain yield showed a penalty of about 5 due to rise in temperature under ecet than the yield under ec table 3 thus under elevated co2 scenario 550 µmol mol 1 an additional rise of temperature by about 1 c would result in increase in crop et by about 5 mm and yield loss of about 4 elevation in atmospheric co2 concentration imparts a physiological response in form of regulation in stomatal opening and closing which is intricately linked to a reduction in water loss from plants as reflected in lowered crop et ainsworth and rogers 2007 li et al 2013 kimball 2016 the decrease in gs is considered to be the primary factor in reducing plant water demand leakey et al 2009 kimball 2016 kirschbaum and mcmillan 2018 however a wide degree of variability in the response of gs to co2 elevation has been reported leakey et al 2009 which is similar to our findings fig 11 despite numerically lower mean gs values under ec and ecet in our study there was a lot of variability with regard to the trend in the gs and tr values in different dates of measurement numerically we observed a reduction in gs to the extent of 8 28 under ec than ambient which was similar to earlier reports ainsworth and rogers 2007 bernacchi et al 2007 lenka et al 2020 significantly lower gs under ec over ambient could not translate to similar level of gain in profile water storage though a significantly higher profile water stock and lower et was observed under ec as well as ecet treatments this was because of either similar or higher tr under ec and ecet than ambient fig 12 soil evaporation plays a dominant role in contributing to et after the month of february because the leaf cover starts declining by that time and the crop harvesting gets nearer in the study region wheat is harvested in the 3rd week of march additionally a better canopy coverage under co2 enriched treatments might have reduced the evaporation loss from soil surface significantly higher leaf area was shown to be the major mechanism in reduced crop et in soybean crop in the same study site lenka et al 2020 higher leaf area was also observed under ec and ecet treatments data not shown thus a lower gs and higher leaf area under co2 elevation treatments might be the primary explanation for a reduced crop et under these treatments we observed a reduction in crop et by 8 mm under ec which also resulted in significantly higher soil water storage at harvest to the extent of 7 and higher wue by 12 our results are similar to other reports where wue increased by about 10 under well watered and by 14 under drought conditions despite non significant gain in et of wheat crop qiao et al 2010 a significant gain in wue under ecet partly disproved our 2nd hypothesis that co elevation of temperature may negate all co2 mediated responses lower wue values in the 1st crop season as compared to the other two seasons were because of higher irrigation applied and also due to the lower crop yield in the 1st season table 1 fig 2 than the other two crop years the wue in terms of shoot biomass and grain yield in wheat has been reported to improve by 62 and 128 due to co2 elevation respectively wu et al 2004 despite a significant increase in wue under both ec and ecet the results are much lower than the findings of wu et al 2004 because of two possible reasons 1 results of field experiment report much lower co2 mediated response than pot experiments or controlled growth chamber experiments 2 the crop yield in the ambient condition of the present experiment was much higher as compared over the other nearby fields or compared to the national average yield and thus site fertility can be another major explanation for a lower response broberg et al 2019 for instance 26 increase in wue was reported in soybean from a pot study due to co2 elevation li et al 2013 an increase of 37 50 in wue was observed in soybean due to elevation in co2 and or temperature in a field experiment during 2016 18 lenka et al 2020 effect of n on wue was consistently significant across study years as well as in the pooled data higher wue was observed under n150 and or n100 followed by n50 and n0 fig 9 this was due to a higher grain yield and also due to greater co2 mediated response at high n application rates as discussed in section 4 1 thus n application level has a key role in modulating wue under co2 enrichment conditions the interactive effect between climate and n was significant which indicated optimum n requirement for significantly higher grain yield and thus higher wue out of the two parameters viz grain yield and water use the results suggest that higher wue is attributed more to grain yield rather than crop et 5 conclusions the field experiment spanning over three consecutive crop seasons clearly showed co2 fertilization effect to be dependent upon n application recommended dose of n application resulted in 15 yield gain in wheat under co2 enrichment low n and co elevation of temperature partially negated the co2 induced advantages in terms of yield et and water use efficiency elevation of co2 or co elevation of temperature significantly influenced profile water storage crop et and wue elevation of co2 improved profile water storage by about 10 mm and increased wue by 12 in wheat crop however quantitative derivation from the field experiment results could establish that under elevated co2 scenario 550 µmol mol 1 an additional 1 c rise in temperature would enhance crop et by 5 mm and decrease yield by 4

10130,atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration temperature and nitrogen n are the key regulators of productivity and water use of plants under the changing climate however field scale studies on the interactive effect of the three above critical inputs are limited hence this field study was conducted with three climate treatments ambient ac elevated co2 ec 550 µmol mol 1 and co elevation of both co2 and temperature ecet 550 µmol mol 1 and temperature 2 c above ambient and four n treatments 0 50 100 and 150 of recommended n dose of 120 kg n ha 1 the experiment was carried out in open top field chambers to study the effects of climate and n application on grain yield evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue in wheat crop crop et was estimated by field water balance method and wue by taking the ratio of grain yield to crop et elevation of co2 showed 9 yield gain over ambient averaged across n levels whereas co elevation of temperature reduced the yield gain to 4 further n application significantly altered the level of co2 response under co2 enriched environment the yield gain was 15 with n100 as compared to 2 and 4 under n0 and n50 respectively indicating co2 enrichment benefits in grain yield was n dependent the three years pooled data showed significant effect of climate n and their interaction on profile water storage evapotranspiration and wue elevation of co2 alone or with co elevation of temperature resulted in significant decline in crop et by 4 11 mm and significant increase in profile soil moisture and wue the wue improved significantly by 12 under ec and by 4 under ecet respectively with the increase more attributed to gain in grain yield quantitative derivation from the three years field experimentation could establish that under elevated co2 scenario 550 µmol mol 1 an additional 1 c rise in temperature would result in enhanced crop et by 5 mm and yield loss of about 4 this study thus revealed that limited n and increased temperature would potentially restrict the co2 mediated benefits in wheat yield and water use under the changing climate keywords co2 enrichment crop water use co2 fertilization climate change impact water nitrogen interaction 1 introduction rising atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration and simultaneous global warming have raised several concerns on future agricultural production the highest ever monthly record of atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration at mauna loa observatory reached a peak of 417 1 µmol mol 1 during may 2020 world meteorological organization 2020 a decadal analysis shows the growth rate of co2 at 2 06 µmol mol 1 yr 1 during 2005 2015 as compared to 1 86 µmol mol 1 yr 1 during 1995 2005 the significant increase in the atmospheric co2 concentration has a direct and substantial influence on ecological and biological processes with several ramifications primarily because co2 is a raw material in the process of photosynthetic assimilation increased co2 concentration stimulates net photosynthesis by increasing the availability of co2 as a substrate for rubisco enzyme and simultaneously reducing photorespiration in plants ainsworth et al 2008 this process of co2 fertilization is reported to enhance growth and metabolism in several crops particularly in c3 crops ainsworth and rogers 2007 lenka and lal 2012 kimball 2016 lenka et al 2020 the yield advantage is about 14 30 in wheat crop long et al 2006 kimball 2016 with reportedly higher response in controlled conditions ainsworth et al 2008 apart from its effect on carbon metabolism co2 enrichment is also reported to influence water dynamics in plants due to alteration in stomatal behaviour thus crop evapotranspiration which is one of the major bio physical processes associated with feedbacks of co2 enrichment is likely to be affected as water metabolism is primarily regulated by stomatal opening and balance between intercellular and atmospheric co2 concentration xu et al 2016 christy et al 2018 wang et al 2018 reduction in stomatal conductance has been attributed to be the major factor in lowering the crop evapotranspiration leakey et al 2009 kimball 2016 though differing results on the effect of co2 elevation in coping with drought situations have been reported uddin et al 2018 wang et al 2018 rise in temperature due to global warming is likely to be another potential factor modifying the plant responses to increased co2 as most biological processes are temperature sensitive ruiz vera et al 2015 lenka et al 2017 dusenge et al 2019 thus the net effect of global change on plant carbon and water dynamics depends on plant responses to simultaneous changes in co2 concentration and temperature despite several studies on the impact of co2 elevation on net primary productivity very less is known on the field scale response in terms of water use in wheat due to combined influence of co2 temperature and n management the findings from pot or controlled studies wu et al 2004 chavan et al 2019 on effects of co2 enrichment have a larger uncertainty when extrapolated to larger scales field and ecosystem scale because of several interacting processes such as run off and soil evaporation allen 2000 wu et al 2004 bernacchi et al 2007 lenka and lal 2012 christy et al 2018 the co2 mediated net saving in crop water use is likely to bring a positive interactive effect on crop growth and yield and thus may influence water use efficiency wue in crop plants as water and n are the two critical inputs for crop production their role is going to increase under future climate few previous studies reported lower crop water use and significantly higher wue in wheat under co2 elevation wu et al 2004 uddin et al 2018 field scale studies on crop water use and wue in wheat crop under the combined influence of co2 and temperature at different n application levels are almost non existent keeping the above research gaps in view three hypotheses were set for the study 1 increment in grain yield due to co2 enrichment is n dependent 2 co elevation of temperature nullifies the benefits of co2 mediated responses 3 co2 elevation reduces water use and increases water use efficiency hence this field experiment was taken up for three consecutive years in open top field chambers otc to investigate the effects of elevation of co2 and co elevation of co2 and temperature on grain yield response crop evapotranspiration stomatal conductance and water use efficiency under different n application levels in wheat crop in the

respectively 3 2 grain yield a significant effect of climate was observed in two crop seasons whereas significant effect of n was observed across all the three crop seasons interaction of climate n was not significant in any of the crop seasons table 2 however the pooled data showed significant effect of climate n as well as their interaction higher grain yield was recorded under ec as compared to ambient and ecet the ambient and ecet treatments were at par fig 2 the co2 fertilization effects over ambient were higher under n100 or n150 as compared to lower n application levels fig 3 averaged across n treatments about 9 higher yield under ec and 4 higher yield under ecet was observed as compared to ambient increase in n application up to n100 resulted in significant increase in grain yield in all the study years the grain yield under n100 and n150 were statistically similar fig 4 the grain yield followed the order of n150 n100 n50 n0 compared over n0 the yield response under n100 in the ambient ec and ecet treatments were 45 63 and 48 respectively fig 5 the corresponding values under n150 were 48 64 and 56 the response of n150 over n100 was marginal under ambient and under ec but was to the extent of 8 under ecet treatment the pooled data showed significantly higher grain yield under ec n100 which was similar to ec n150 and ecet n150 treatments significantly lowest grain yield was observed in the n0 treatments under any climate condition 3 3 crop evapotranspiration in general a trend of reduction in et was observed under ec and ecet than ambient in most of the years as well as in the pooled data fig 6 effects of climate and n were significant on crop et table 2 the general trend of et followed the order ac ecet ec the crop et per season was lower by 8 mm under ec and by 3 mm under ecet than ambient respectively the three years data showed a significant interaction between climate and n table 2 among the treatments et was significantly highest under ac n150 followed by ecet n150 and was significantly lowest under ec n0 averaged over climate treatments the crop et was higher by 7 10 mm under n100 or n150 as compared to n0 as observed in the pooled data fig 6 table 3

profile water storage than ambient fig 7 table 2 a significant effect of climate and n was observed in all the years the interaction was significant only in the 3rd season and in the pooled data table 2 the general trend of profile water storage followed the order ec ecet ac among the n treatments only n100 or n150 showed lower profile water storage the profile water stock was significantly highest under ec n0 and significantly lowest under ac n150 as observed from the pooled data of three years table 3 the depth wise distribution of soil moisture content fig 8 monitored at regular intervals during the crop growth season showed a general trend of higher soil moisture content under ec than the other two treatments the ecet and ambient treatments were either similar or ecet showed slightly higher soil moisture content than ambient the average soil water storage at the sowing of the crop was 147 4 mm depletion in soil water storage s was significantly higher under ambient followed by

higher than that of n0 3 5 water use efficiency wue effect of climate n as well as their interaction was significant on wue table 2 the wue was significantly higher under ec followed by ecet and ambient table 3 similar trend of difference between climate treatments was observed in all the study seasons though the numerical values were lower in the 1st crop season fig 9 among the treatments significantly higher wue was observed in ec n100 which was at par with ec n150 on the other hand significantly lowest wue was observed in n0 under all climate conditions fig 9 effect of n on wue was

tr effect of climate was significant on pn in all the observation dates across study years though effects of n and climate n interaction were generally non significant table 2 on the contrary effects of climate n and their interaction were significant on gs and tr in most of the observation dates table 2 the pn values under ec and ecet were statistically similar with significantly lower values under ac treatment fig 10 significantly lower gs and higher tr was observed under ec and ecet treatments despite variation in the trend of measured data figs 11 and 12 the gs was similar among n application treatments with all n treatments being significantly higher than n0 the same trend was observed in tr also significantly highest values of gs was observed under ac n100 in most cases 4 discussion 4 1 effect of climate and n on grain yield among the climatic parameters co2 and temperature are the two critical variables influencing plant growth and metabolism our study spanning over three consecutive seasons of wheat crop indicated a significant effect of elevated co2 over ambient on grain yield with average of 15 at recommended dose of n application n100 a much lower co2 fertilization benefit under n50 or n0 fig 3 confirmed our 1st hypothesis and underlined the role of n in harnessing the co2 mediated response in crop plants lenka and lal 2012 asif et al 2020 our findings are in agreement with some previous observations reich et al 2014 terrer et al 2019 availability of n is an important contributor to sink development in plants and thus regulates some yield attributes like tiller and leaf production in wheat thus diminished co2 fertilization benefits under low availability of soil n have been reported reich et al 2014 in their experiment elevated co2 resulted about 33 increase in plant biomass under optimum availability of water and n in contrast to negligible increase under low n and water stress conditions reich et al 2014 at global scale the strength of co2 fertilization is primarily driven by n in about 65 of global vegetation terrer et al 2019 thus a down regulation of photosynthetic assimilation may be the primary driver in diminishing the co2 mediated benefits under low n availability elevated co2 is reported to induce fertilization effect particularly in c3 plants long et al 2006 kimball et al 2016 uddin et al 2018 lenka et al 2019 2020 primarily due to reduction in oxygenase activity of rubisco enzyme and higher rate of photosynthesis fig 10 however the extent of increase in crop yield upon exposure to elevated co2 is variable with the nature of crop experiment abiotic stress and site fertility ainsworth et al 2008 qiao et al 2010 broberg et al 2019 in general field studies report a lower co2 fertilization effect than in pot experiments ainsworth et al 2008 in our study wheat grain yield enhancement owing to elevation of co2 was about 9 across n levels and 15 at n100 which was similar to other findings from field condition in india and south asia qiao et al 2010 hazra et al 2019 about 17 increase in average wheat grain yield was reported from a field experiment in otcs hazra et al 2019 in indian condition and 19 increase in a face experiment kimball 2016 in usa qiao et al 2010 from an otc study in china reported about 7 enhancement in wheat grain yield under well watered and 10 under drought stress conditions a meta analysis of field grown wheat data indicated 26 yield advantage with co2 elevation up to 600 ppm broberg et al 2019 on the other hand single season pot experiments in phytotron in north india report larger co2 fertilization effect in wheat kant et al 2007 rakshit et al 2012 grain yield was reported to increase by 35 45 with co2 elevation over ambient kant et al 2007 rakshit et al 2012 observed about 11 increase in grain and shoot biomass under elevated co2 much of the yield benefits accrued from co2 elevation were offset with co elevation of temperature as observed from a non significant increase in grain yield by about 4 under ecet over ambient fig 3 the observations are in line with some previous findings where co elevation of temperature along with elevation of co2 resulted in non significant about 5 decrease in grain yield and shoot biomass rakshit et al 2012 this indicates temperature elevation exerted an adverse effect on crop yield in the later part of crop growth when the ambient air temperature is generally higher a non significant increase in grain yield under ecet was observed despite statistically similar pn values under ec and ecet in the early period of crop growth fig 10 for instance in 2019 crop season the pn values were similar between ec and ecet at 58 days after sowing but the pn was significantly higher under ec than ecet at 79 days after sowing fig 10 this was partly in line with our set 2nd hypothesis that co elevation of temperature may offset the co2 mediated benefits further it was observed that higher n application n150 could alleviate the adverse effect of higher temperature to some extent figs 3 and 5 on the other hand at the same site with the same experimental set up lenka et al 2020 showed 34 47 yield advantage in soybean with co elevation of co2 and temperature it thus indicates that effect of enhanced co2 is crop specific and depends upon temperature threshold of the particular crop 4 2 effect of climate and n on crop et profile soil moisture physiological attributes and water use efficiency elevation of co2 reduces crop et and consequentially improves profile water storage in several crops bernacchi et al 2007 kimball 2016 lenka et al 2020 however very few information is available on the combined influence of elevated co2 and temperature on crop water use in our experiment significant reduction in crop et and improvement in soil profile water storage was observed in the three study years due to co2 enrichment table 3 across all the three seasons of experiment the gain in profile water storage up to 60 cm soil depth at harvest was to the extent of 9 mm under ec translating to about 7 higher profile soil water content under ec than ambient reduced crop et and better soil moisture regime under co2 enrichment treatments proved the 3rd hypothesis and is consistent with some previous findings for instance 9 decrease in et was reported by allen et al 2003 whereas 9 16 decrease in et in soybean was observed by bernacchi et al 2007 at the same site lenka et al 2020 reported 4 5 decrease in crop et and 5 9 increase in profile water storage in soybean crop uddin et al 2018 reported co2 elevation reduces crop water use and improves drought tolerance in wheat plants primarily due to better below ground biomass however the advantage of water saving under co2 enrichment got reduced with co elevation of temperature table 3 temperature elevation in this experiment ecet treatment was made to the extent of about 2 c above ambient elevation of co2 also causes simultaneous increase in temperature a comparison of thermal profile showed about 1 2 c of higher temperature under ecet than ec lenka et al 2020 the profile water stock was higher by 6 mm and crop et was lower by an equal amount under ec as compared to ecet table 3 comparison of the grain yield showed a penalty of about 5 due to rise in temperature under ecet than the yield under ec table 3 thus under elevated co2 scenario 550 µmol mol 1 an additional rise of temperature by about 1 c would result in increase in crop et by about 5 mm and yield loss of about 4 elevation in atmospheric co2 concentration imparts a physiological response in form of regulation in stomatal opening and closing which is intricately linked to a reduction in water loss from plants as reflected in lowered crop et ainsworth and rogers 2007 li et al 2013 kimball 2016 the decrease in gs is considered to be the primary factor in reducing plant water demand leakey et al 2009 kimball 2016 kirschbaum and mcmillan 2018 however a wide degree of variability in the response of gs to co2 elevation has been reported leakey et al 2009 which is similar to our findings fig 11 despite numerically lower mean gs values under ec and ecet in our study there was a lot of variability with regard to the trend in the gs and tr values in different dates of measurement numerically we observed a reduction in gs to the extent of 8 28 under ec than ambient which was similar to earlier reports ainsworth and rogers 2007 bernacchi et al 2007 lenka et al 2020 significantly lower gs under ec over ambient could not translate to similar level of gain in profile water storage though a significantly higher profile water stock and lower et was observed under ec as well as ecet treatments this was because of either similar or higher tr under ec and ecet than ambient fig 12 soil evaporation plays a dominant role in contributing to et after the month of february because the leaf cover starts declining by that time and the crop harvesting gets nearer in the study region wheat is harvested in the 3rd week of march additionally a better canopy coverage under co2 enriched treatments might have reduced the evaporation loss from soil surface significantly higher leaf area was shown to be the major mechanism in reduced crop et in soybean crop in the same study site lenka et al 2020 higher leaf area was also observed under ec and ecet treatments data not shown thus a lower gs and higher leaf area under co2 elevation treatments might be the primary explanation for a reduced crop et under these treatments we observed a reduction in crop et by 8 mm under ec which also resulted in significantly higher soil water storage at harvest to the extent of 7 and higher wue by 12 our results are similar to other reports where wue increased by about 10 under well watered and by 14 under drought conditions despite non significant gain in et of wheat crop qiao et al 2010 a significant gain in wue under ecet partly disproved our 2nd hypothesis that co elevation of temperature may negate all co2 mediated responses lower wue values in the 1st crop season as compared to the other two seasons were because of higher irrigation applied and also due to the lower crop yield in the 1st season table 1 fig 2 than the other two crop years the wue in terms of shoot biomass and grain yield in wheat has been reported to improve by 62 and 128 due to co2 elevation respectively wu et al 2004 despite a significant increase in wue under both ec and ecet the results are much lower than the findings of wu et al 2004 because of two possible reasons 1 results of field experiment report much lower co2 mediated response than pot experiments or controlled growth chamber experiments 2 the crop yield in the ambient condition of the present experiment was much higher as compared over the other nearby fields or compared to the national average yield and thus site fertility can be another major explanation for a lower response broberg et al 2019 for instance 26 increase in wue was reported in soybean from a pot study due to co2 elevation li et al 2013 an increase of 37 50 in wue was observed in soybean due to elevation in co2 and or temperature in a field experiment during 2016 18 lenka et al 2020 effect of n on wue was consistently significant across study years as well as in the pooled data higher wue was observed under n150 and or n100 followed by n50 and n0 fig 9 this was due to a higher grain yield and also due to greater co2 mediated response at high n application rates as discussed in section 4 1 thus n application level has a key role in modulating wue under co2 enrichment conditions the interactive effect between climate and n was significant which indicated optimum n requirement for significantly higher grain yield and thus higher wue out of the two parameters viz grain yield and water use the results suggest that higher wue is attributed more to grain yield rather than crop et 5 conclusions the field experiment spanning over three consecutive crop seasons clearly showed co2 fertilization effect to be dependent upon n application recommended dose of n application resulted in 15 yield gain in wheat under co2 enrichment low n and co elevation of temperature partially negated the co2 induced advantages in terms of yield et and water use efficiency elevation of co2 or co elevation of temperature significantly influenced profile water storage crop et and wue elevation of co2 improved profile water storage by about 10 mm and increased wue by 12 in wheat crop however quantitative derivation from the field experiment results could establish that under elevated co2 scenario 550 µmol mol 1 an additional 1 c rise in temperature would enhance crop et by 5 mm and decrease yield by 4

10131,in agriculture soil evaporation is considered a loss of water and crop transpiration is a crucial factor affecting crop growth and yield although there have been numerous studies on evapotranspiration et on farmland only a few have been conducted on field crop transpiration because of the difficulties in the direct measurement of transpiration and in separate evaluation of evaporation and transpiration under field conditions in this study we used the heat pulse method to measure the sap velocity in sugarcane stems to evaluate field transpiration during summer at the study site on tanegashima island at about 31 n in japan the reference crop et was determined by the food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith method from on site meteorological data and was compared with the measured transpiration the daily transpiration in august ranged from 3 3 mm d 1 to 6 6 mm d 1 the corresponding sap flow varied from 0 27 l d 1 to 0 55 l d 1 per stalk the daily analysis of et showed that a standard value of 1 25 for the crop coefficient presented by the fao is acceptable as the crop coefficient for the mid season growth stage of sugarcane in the study site numerical simulations of richards equation with the sink term were conducted to examine the response of root water uptake to atmospheric transpiration demand throughout 20 consecutive clear and dry days in august the decrease in the soil moisture in the root zone depends on the transpiration demand during daytime and soil moisture is redistributed and recovered during the nighttime the hourly numerical results in august support a standard value of 1 20 for the basal crop coefficient in the mid season growth stage as proposed by fao the simulations showed that roots extract water preferentially from the deep and wet soil layers to meet the transpiration demand transpiration predicted from the sink term agreed well with the actual transpiration measured by the heat pulse method therefore the numerical analysis of soil moisture dynamics under the atmospheric transpiration demand based on the reference crop et can be an effective tool to evaluate field sugarcane water consumption keywords heat pulse method reference crop evapotranspiration numerical analysis root water uptake soil moisture 1 introduction food energy and water few are indispensable and fundamental resources for the sustainability of human beings in modern society few resources are in a complicated nexus each having a trade off relationship with the others cosgrove and loucks 2015 scanlon et al 2017 therefore we have to efficiently utilize and manage few resources recently sugarcane has been used not only as an agricultural product but also as a biofuel crop grecco et al 2019 total global biofuel production by sugarcane corn and sorghum is 50 billion l a year sugarcane solely accounts for approximately 40 and is now a major contributor to biofuel production lam et al 2009 therefore many integrated studies have been conducted on the nexus among water resources agricultural production and energy additionally the expansion of sugarcane production for biofuel may function against the conservation of water resources in our study sugarcane the main agricultural crop in the southern islands of japan was selected as the target crop only a few studies have been conducted on the water use and evapotranspiration et of sugarcane in the southern islands of japan et studies on field sugarcane are intensively carried out on the okinawa islands fig 1 for example the daily mean et on okinawa island ranges from 5 9 mm d 1 to 6 4 mm d 1 in the summer season reaching a maximum in august and the crop coefficient kc is 1 24 in august based on long term field water balance lysimeter experiments hossain et al 2005 et observed by the bowen ratio energy balance method on the okinawa island reaches to maximum 6 01 mm d 1 in august and its annual average is 2 91 mm d 1 hiyane 2008 high et occurs during the summer season under high air temperature and solar radiation conditions to the best of our knowledge field research on sugarcane transpiration in these regions has not been reported despite many studies on et in sugarcane fields cabral et al 2012 hiyane et al 2004 field sugarcane transpiration has rarely been reported chabot et al 2005 nassif et al 2014 because of the difficulties in accurate direct measurements of transpiration and in separate evaluation of et as evaporation and transpiration under actual field conditions bastidas obando et al 2017 eksteen et al 2014 kool et al 2014 qiu et al 1999 rafi et al 2019 previous studies on the partitioning of et into soil surface evaporation e and crop transpiration t suggest that e accounts for 20 40 of et in crops such as corn cotton wheat and sorghum e et can be large for the initial crop development stage kool et al 2014 in the sorghum experiments conducted by qiu et al 1999 e ranged from 3 to 20 of et and the measured values of e in august were mostly less than 1 5 mm d 1 under a well developed sorghum canopy moreover in a grain sorghum with a leaf area index greater than 1 in texas usa e accounted for 13 of et ritchie 1972 thus e often constitutes a large fraction of et and may not be negligible under the mid season growth stage condition soil evaporation however is a loss of water from the point of view of agricultural water use and transpiration not et has the major effect on the crop growth james et al 1983 thus water use by field sugarcane should be examined from field sugarcane transpiration sap flow measurements are an effective way to directly evaluate the transpiration of herbaceous crops in small plots where it is difficult to apply micrometeorological approaches approaches to measure sap flow such as heat pulse stem heat balance and constant heater methods cohen et al 1993 gerdes et al 1994 miner et al 2017 sakuratani 1981 are thermal based techniques used to capture water flow through the plant stem for example according to the heat balance method four sap flow sensors were applied to estimate the field sugarcane sap flow in southern brazil for ten days in summer nassif et al 2014 and t by sap flow ranged from 3 15 mm d 1 to 5 98 mm d 1 chabot et al 2005 showed that during the mid season stage over ten days in august in morocco the sap flow measurement for 14 sugarcane stems resulted in an overestimation by 35 compared to the et results in which the soil surface evaporation was neglected the heat balance method for long period usage usually requires sensor maintenance in which the sensor is regularly removed from the stem to prevent stem strangulation kool et al 2014 in this study we used the heat pulse hp method cohen et al 1988 1993 to measure the sap velocity in sugarcane stem and estimate sugarcane transpiration for about two months in tanegashima island about 31 n japan the first objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between field sugarcane transpiration determined by the hp method and the reference crop et determined by the fao penman monteith fao pm method allen et al 1998 we discuss the daily and hourly sap flow responses to solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit vpd the difference between the saturation vapor pressure of air and the actual vapor pressure the second objective is to investigate the relationship between the root water uptake and transpiration in the sugarcane field we discuss the response of root water uptake to atmospheric transpiration demand on the basis of numerical simulation of soil moisture dynamics in the root zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites field experiments were performed on the tanegashima islands in southern japan where sugarcane

sugarcane cultivar was nif8 which is a japanese cultivar and most popular in the study site single row planting with 1 2 m spacing between rows is normally used according to the local practice on the islands of southern japan two planting conditions namely spring planting and summer planting are used gunarathna et al 2018 summer planting usually starts in september and spring planting in march

of stem diameters in the test plot obtained on september 12 2016 is shown in fig 2 the total number of stems in the plot was 255 and the mean stem diameter was 22 0 mm the six representative sugarcane plants selected in the plot for the hp method had a mean stem diameter of 22 7 mm range 22 1 24 1 mm and a mean plant height of 3 20 m range 2 88 3 42 m the mean annual air temperature and precipitation during 1975 2016 were 19 7 c and 2401 mm y 1 respectively the seasonal maxima of air temperature occurred mostly in august and the maximum air temperature 34 7 c was recorded on august 20 1998 during the field experiment the maximum air temperature on august 22 2016 was 34 4 c the fourth highest since 1975 based on the mean air temperature humidity wind speed and sunshine hours recorded by the tanegashima local meteorological agency 30 7200 n 130 9817 e the average potential evaporation in august of each year during 1980 2019 calculated by the penman method for a surface albedo of 0 06 was 5 8 mm d 1 range 4 8 7 0 mm d 1 the potential evaporation in august 2016 was slightly higher than the average at 6 5 mm d 1 in this study the mid season growth stage during summer under high air temperature and solar radiation conditions in which the maximum plant height reaches 3 m was selected to compare the measured transpiration t a with the transpiration estimated based on the basal crop coefficient kcb mid using the dual crop coefficient approach in fao the plowed soil at the study site was volcanic ash soil the soil moisture characteristic curves obtained in laboratory experiments using disturbed soil samples from the site and the van genuchten model seki 2007 van genuchten 1980 are shown in fig 3 the soil field capacity at the soil suction head of 1 m was 0 5 m3 m 3 and the stress point at the soil suction head of 10 m was 0 42 m3 m 3 soil moisture content was measured with a commercial capacitance sensor gs1 meter group inc usa at 1 h sampling intervals at depths of 5 15 25 35 and 50 cm at the center of the test plot notably the subsoil below a depth of 50 cm is different from the volcanic ash soil and is composed of pyroclastic flow deposits 2 2 transpiration we used the hp method to evaluate the field sugarcane transpiration in the hp method a short heat pulse is applied and the sap flow rate is estimated from the velocity of the heat pulse moving with the sap flow in the stem a central needle with a diameter of 0 6 mm was used as a probe of a line heater across the stem and two additional needles downstream and upstream relative to the heater probe were used as thermocouples for temperature measurements we used the hp measurement system originally developed and presented by cohen et al 1988 1993 and applied by takeuchi et al 1996 the design of the probe was originally described by cohen et al 1988 the probe has two temperature sensors and one line heater plain hypodermic needle the length of the temperature sensors was 7 5 mm and the spherical thermocouple junction was near the tip of the needle we applied six probes to the sugarcane stems the probe needle was adjusted to be inserted for example at a depth of 5 5 mm from the stem surface when the stem diameter was 22 mm sugarcane has scattered vascular bundles in the whole stem therefore in a preliminary experiment on the three detection locations of the temperature sensors inserted in the stem the heat pulse speed was detected as low when the sensor installation depth was deep close to the center of the stem whereas it was detected as high when the depth was shallow close to the surface of the stem the hp method requires a reliable calibration constant to account for the effects of tissue wounding caused by needle insertion and to convert the sap velocity to volumetric flow rate the measured hp velocity v is converted to the volumetric sap flow rate sf as follows 1 sf c v a where a is the cross sectional area of flow in the stem and c is the calibration constant which depends mainly on the crop species sensor design and insertion depth of the thermocouples miner et al 2017 steppe et al 2010 in this study sugarcane grown in a pot in a greenhouse with stem diameter 23 mm was used to determine c the volume of the pot was 45 l and the total weight including soil and sugarcane was about 35 kg the pot was completely covered with a plastic sheet to prevent evaporation from the soil surface water loss from the pot by transpiration was measured using an electronic balance having a resolution of 0 5 g gp 40 k a d co ltd japan and the sap velocity v was simultaneously measured over two consecutive days the sampling interval was 30 min thermocouples were installed at a distance of 1 4 of the stem diameter from the stem surface here daily transpiration t a mm d 1 was obtained from sf cm3 d 1 and expressed per land area using the planting density of the test plot eksteen et al 2014 miner et al 2017 to confirm the validity of c determined in the greenhouse experiment a potometer test chen and wang 2012 de rocher and tausch 1994 was carried out for field grown sugarcane this test is widely used for woody and herbaceous plants because of its simplicity the selected sugarcane plants were cut at the bottom of the stem above the soil surface the detached stem with leaves on the upper part was placed in a container with water and then immediately recut under water to prevent air entry the stem with leaves was moved into a smaller glass beaker under water so that the cut surface remained under water water loss from the glass beaker caused by transpiration was measured gravimetrically at regular time intervals the potometer test was performed at the study site on october 14 2016 one stem out of six having a mean diameter of 22 mm fig 2 was selected in the test plot the potometer test lasted from 11 30 h to 14 30 h with a sampling interval of 30 min the solar radiation was also measured at a sampling interval of 30 min for further examination the potometer test was applied to two more field grown sugarcane plants in a sugarcane field third ratoon managed by a local private farmer on okinawa island 26 1346 n 127 6819 e altitude 31 m in okinawa prefecture japan fig 1 this supplementary test confirms the validity of the calibration constant investigated under greenhouse and other island environmental conditions supplementary potometer test was performed on two stems with diameters of 25 2 mm for stem no 1 and 24 3 mm for stem no 2 from 10 55 h to 13 10 h with a sampling interval of 15 min on september 14 2018 2 3 crop evapotranspiration the fao penman monteith fao pm method allen et al 1998 was used for calculating the reference crop et et0 the half hourly weather data were obtained from a weather station vp 4 ds 2 davis cup anemometer pyr solar radiation ecrn 100 meter group inc installed on the side of the plot fig 1 with the crop coefficient kc crop evapotranspiration etc under standard conditions i e well watered and optimal agronomic conditions can be estimated as etc kc et0 in the dual crop coefficient approach by introducing the basal crop coefficient kcb and the soil evaporation coefficient ke crop transpiration tc can be expressed as tc kcb et0 the fao holds the following standard values to be valid in the middle of sugarcane development kc 1 25 kcb 1 2 and ke 0 05 allen et al 1998 asce 1996 in this study the et0 determined by the fao pm method was compared with the actual transpiration t a measured by the hp method based on the daily et0 values and t a measured in a small sugarcane field we will further examine the relationship between et0 and t a for the field sugarcane at our study site to relate the measured t a by the hp method and the calculated kc et0 by the fao pm method we need a value of soil evaporation e under the well developed sugarcane canopy having a plant height of about 3 m however soil evaporation and pan evaporation were not measured and were not available for the study site therefore we assumed that the soil evaporation ranged from 10 to 20 of the potential water surface evaporation ep calculated by the penman method for a water surface albedo of 0 06 the soil evaporation was estimated under the weather conditions of the study site using the locally calibrated values of crop coefficients kc 1 24 in august 1 29 in september and 1 20 in october in okinawa island fig 1 hossain et al 2005 the calculated kc et0 was compared with the estimated crop evapotranspiration of t a e and kc et0 2 4 numerical approach for root water uptake and transpiration for one dimensional vertical transient flows in unsaturated soils the richards equation with a sink term to account for the crop root water uptake was numerically solved by finite difference approximation based on feddes et al 1978 and used for the analysis of soil moisture movements in a soil root system momii et al 1993 the basic equation with the sink term feddes and raats 2004 vereecken et al 2008 is written as follows 2 θ t q z s z t where θ is the volumetric water content t is time z is the vertical space coordinate positive downward s is the volumetric rate of root water uptake per unit time and q is the specific darcy s water flux which can be expressed by the following equation 3 q k h h z 1 where h is the soil matric pressure head and k is the hydraulic conductivity the rate of change in total soil moisture δs from the soil surface to the bottom of the soil layer z max is calculated using the following equation 4 s 0 z max θ t d z to numerically solve eqs 2 and 3 the initial and boundary conditions soil moisture retention characteristic and hydraulic conductivity function need to be defined the calculation period was 10 days august 12 21 2016 when there was no rainfall at the study site the initial condition of the vertical soil moisture profile on august 12 was given as the interpolation of the soil moisture contents measured in the field at five depths 5 15 25 35 and 50 cm the calculation domain was spanned from the soil surface to a depth of z max 50 cm in the volcanic ash soil layer over the subsoil the boundary condition on the soil surface was given by an hourly evaporative flux of 0 05 et0 according to the value of ke 0 05 allen et al 1998 the hourly et0 was calculated from the hourly meteorological data of temperature relative humidity wind speed at 2 m height and solar radiation at the site the soil moisture measured at a depth of 50 cm was used as the bottom boundary condition the grid spacing was 1 cm and the time increment was controlled from 1 s to 60 s in the closed form model proposed by van genuchten 1980 see vg model in fig 3 for the moisture retention characteristics and hydraulic conductivity function with respect to the soil matric suction head the coefficients were found to be α 0 13 m 1 and n 1 076 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was 1 10 5 m s 1 and the saturated soil moisture content was 0 607 m3m 3 which were experimentally determined using the disturbed soil samples in the test plot the sink term in eq 2 was modeled using the macroscopic approach to root water uptake as a function of water stress and root distribution feddes and raats 2004 kumar et al 2013 skaggs et al 2006 as follows 5 s z t β z α h t p t where t p t is the potential transpiration rate α h is the water stress response function 0 α 1 and β z is the root distribution function assuming that crop water storage can be ignored and water extracted by the roots is instantaneously transpired into the atmosphere the transpiration can be numerically calculated from the integration of the sink term in space as follows 6 t sink t 0 z max s z t dz t p t was given as 1 2 et0 according to the basal crop coefficient kcb 1 2 for sugarcane in the mid season growth stage allen et al 1998 the calculated result of t sink under 1 2 et0 was compared with the result obtained under the condition of et0 the water stress response function was then characterized using the four matric suction heads such as h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 as proposed by feddes et al 1978 skaggs et al 2006 h 1 is the anaerobiosis point h 2 and h 3 are suction heads having the maximum water uptake h 3 is the suction head at which soil water begins to limit optimum crop growth and h 4 is the permanent wilting point at the lower limit of soil water availability to plants for the numerical calculation h 1 0 10 m h 2 0 20 m and h 4 160 0 m were selected moreover h 3 is a function of transpiration demand and the values of h 3 for the higher demand of 5 mm d 1 and the lower demand of 1 mm d 1 were given as 6 0 m and 10 0 m respectively feddes and raats 2004 grecco et al 2019 numerous functions for β z have been used in crop fields including constant linear trapezoidal and exponential functions braud et al 2005 sallo et al 2020 the function of β z originally depends on the root length density distribution and root activity with depth z it was difficult for us to distinguish between the inactive and the newly developed active roots in soil layers because of ratooning although root density may generally decrease exponentially with depth this is not known a priori in each field spatial root distribution is a record of strategic adaptation of roots to changing soil irrigation and water conditions coelho and or 1999 momii 2016 in our visual observation we recognized the existence of the roots in the plow layer of volcanic ash soil however it was not clear whether those roots were active or not root length density does not always coincide with the actual root water uptake pattern here β z was calibrated for the constant linear trapezoidal exponential and step functions by matching the measured and calculated soil moisture changes at 15 cm and 35 cm for three days august 12 14 2016 in the numerical calculation the rooting zone was assumed to be the whole plow layer and the rooting depth l was 49 cm except for two space grid points on the soil surface and bottom boundaries the model performance of β z was assessed from the values of the statistical criteria of the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse legates and mccabe 1999 sahoo et al 2013 between the calculated and measured soil moisture contents in this study our own developed numerical program which was originally applied to the numerical analysis of soil water dynamics by momii et al 1992 1993 was used because of its ease for site specific boundary conditions atmospheric et demand and the calculations of t sink in eq 6 under specific root distribution functions 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of heat pulse method the sap flow rate was evaluated using the hp method with a calibration constant of c 1 3 fig 4 this constant was determined from the slope of the regression line 1 32 between the sap flow rate determined by the hp method and the transpiration rate of potted sugarcane measured using an electronic balance at c 1 3 the sap flow rate corresponded well with transpiration the accumulated sap flow rates on july 3 and 4 by the hp method were 1 61 l d 1 and 1 64 l d 1 respectively fig 4 whereas those by the gravimetric method were 1 65 l d 1 and 1 71 l d 1 respectively the difference was only 4 to examine the model performance three statistical criteria such as nse determination coefficient r 2 and rmse were calculated for 58 data points collected from 06 00 h to 20 00 h on july 3 and 4 2016 because values of nse and r 2 close to 1 and of rmse close to 0 indicate good model performance the values obtained nse 0 91 r 2 0 95 and rmse 17 5 g h 1 indicate good agreement between the flow rate evaluated by the hp method and the measured transpiration we used c 1 3 for the evaluation of transpiration in field sugarcane the transpiration changes measured by the hp method with c 1 3 and by the potometer test on tanegashima island are shown in fig 5a although the potometer test was short and the solar radiation was relatively low under cloudy conditions the transpiration by the potometer test and the hp method roughly followed the change in solar radiation and was in relatively good correspondence the accumulated sap flow rates recorded for 3 h by the hp and the gravimetric methods were 94 g and 86 g respectively and the difference was about 9 in the supplementary test of okinawa island the solar radiation was higher than that in tanegashima island fig 5b and the accumulated sap flow rates for 2 h by the hp method were 162 g for stem no 1 and 135 g for stem no 2 whereas those by the gravimetric method were 166 g and 143 g for stem no 1 and stem no 2 respectively the differences were only 2 and 5 respectively the on site potometer test used was simple and it was sufficient to confirm the applicability of c 1 3 for field grown sugarcane thus the calibration constant c 1 3 for sugarcane is suitable for the hp method when the thermocouples are installed at a distance of 1 4 of the stem diameter from the stem surface 3 2 daily transpiration fig 6a shows that daily changes in transpiration closely followed those in et0 estimated from the atmospheric variables obtained by the fao pm model field sugarcane transpiration decreased with a gradual decrease in air temperature and solar radiation from august to october fig 6a b the correlation between t a and solar radiation r s was high r 2 0 86 whereas that between t a and vpd was low r 2 0 51 similar responses have been observed in maize wang et al 2020 the maximum transpiration was 6 6 mm d 1 which corresponded to a maximum sap flow rate of 0 55 l d 1 per stalk on august 30 at a daily mean temperature of 26 2 c daily mean relative humidity of 56 8 and solar radiation of 20 1 mj m 2 d 1 table 1 the et0 on that date was 5 7 mm d 1 from august 12 30 the crop stage was in a period of high solar radiation mean value of 21 3 mj m 2 d 1 and temperature mean value of 28 0 c the daily transpiration for these 20 days ranged from 3 3 mm d 1 to 6 6 mm d 1 which corresponded to the sap flow from 0 27 l d 1 to 0 55 l d 1 per stalk table 1 these values are comparable to the daily transpiration of field sugarcane measured by the heat balance method for ten days in the summer season in southern brazil ranging from 3 15 mm d 1 to 5 98 mm d 1 from 0 34 l d 1 to 0 64 l d 1 nassif et al 2014 except for a rainfall of 14 mm over 3 days august 22 24 2016 there was no rainfall or irrigation at the study site between august 12 and september 2 in irrigation planning in humid regions when the soil moisture suction head in a soil layer for predominant water consumption reaches at the stress point of a suction head of 10 m irrigation is initiated to recover the soil moisture up to the field capacity the average soil moisture content decreased gradually above the stress point from august 14 to september 2 fig 6c after a rainfall of 79 5 mm over 5 days september 3 7 2016 the average soil moisture recovered below the stress point the soil moisture data suggest that sugarcane roots in the upper soil layer could be under water stress from august 14 to september 2 fig 7 shows that a high correlation r 2 0 90 was observed between t a and et0 the linear regression equation was t a 1 2 et0 0 73 for all the data points data points n 62 the slope of 1 2 is consistent with the basal crop coefficient of 1 2 for sugarcane as proposed by the fao allen et al 1998 as mentioned above the average soil moisture status at all the examined depths suggested that sugarcane roots experienced water stress from august 14 to september 2 the relationship between t a and et0 in the absence of water stress n 41 was also linear and similar to that with the full dataset fig 7 assuming that the soil moisture content is sufficient to partly meet the atmospheric transpiration demand t a may follow the changes in et0 at the study site even if the moisture in the upper soil layers decreases above the stress point we expect that the transpiration demand can be met from the deeper and wetter soil layer at a depth of 50 cm fig 6c here we tried to relate the measured t a obtained using the hp method and calculated kc et0 obtained using the fao pm method when the soil evaporation ranged from 10 to 20 of the potential evaporation ep e ranges from 0 2 mm d 1 to 1 5 mm d 1 under the weather conditions of the study site when 15 of ep was selected as e during august october in the study site e ranged from 0 23 mm d 1 to 1 11 mm d 1 reaching its maximum on august 29 with a mean of 0 67 mm d 1 fig 8 these values of e are similar to those from the sorghum field of e etc 13 ritchie 1972 and e 1 5 mm d 1 in the summer season qiu et al 1999 using the locally calibrated values of crop coefficients kc 1 24 in august 1 29 in september 1 20 in october in okinawa island hossain et al 2005 the calculated kc et0 closely corresponded with the estimated crop evapotranspiration of t a e fig 8 the value of kc almost coincided with the standard crop coefficient kc mid of 1 25 for the mid season growth stage presented by the fao allen et al 1999 no significant differences between kc et0 and kc mid et0 were recognized and both were in good correspondence with t a e fig 8 the value of 1 25 is acceptable for the crop coefficient kc mid for mid season growth stage of the sugarcane grown in tanegashima island the value of kc mid 1 25 has also been reported in the mid season growth stage of sugarcane grown in australia and eswatini inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 thus our results on the tanegashima island of southern japan substantially support the standard value of 1 25 proposed by the fao 3 3 hourly transpiration fig 9a shows that sf closely followed the changes in r s with time on two sunny days of august 12 and 13 2016 the correlation between r s and sf was high r 2 0 96 and the daily sf for the two days were 0 42 l d 1 and 0 47 l d 1 however the peak of vpd lagged those of sf and r s for example the sf peaked at 11 30 h and vpd peaked at 15 00 h the maximum value of sf sf max on august 13 was 63 cm3 h 1 and that of vpd vpdmax was 1 6 kpa the relationship between the vpd and sf showed a distinct clockwise hysteresis loop when the vpd increased in the morning the sf increased and when the vpd decreased in the afternoon the sf tended to decrease however the sf at any given vpd in the afternoon was lower than the sf in the morning at the same vpd fig 9c zeppel et al 2004 hysteresis between hourly transpiration and meteorological variables has been reported in greenhouse cucumber in spain medrano et al 2005 and a maize field in china wang et al 2020 the sf vpd hysteresis relation can be modeled on the basis of a time lag between the hourly scale of the sf and vpd zhang et al 2014 because hysteresis can also be affected by plants and soil moisture status further research on the hysteresis pattern of field grown sugarcane will be needed peng et al 2018 here no hysteresis response of transpiration to r s was detected while we clearly demonstrated a pronounced clockwise loop pattern of hysteresis in the response of transpiration to vpd in our study area s sugarcane field 3 4 root water uptake and transpiration the rmse and nse values for various functions of root distribution β z are shown in table 2 judging from the negative nse values the functions decreasing with depth linear and exponential functions were not applicable to the sugarcane field at the study site the increase in the trapezoidal and step functions with depth sufficiently evaluated the measured soil moisture depletion as evident from the lower rmse values than those of the other functions because the nse values of the step function for both 15 cm and 35 cm depths were close to 1 the step function in space rooting depth l 49 cm β z 0 5 l for the upper root zone and 1 5 l for the lower root zone was adopted to compensate for the greater sink in the lower soil layers than in the upper soil layers the measured and calculated hourly soil moisture depletion over 10 days from august 12 21 with no rainfall is shown in fig 10 a negative δs value calculated using eq 4 during daytime indicates a decrease in the total soil moisture and a positive one during nighttime indicates a total soil moisture increase fig 10 the calculated soil moisture values were in good correspondence with the measured values at a depth of 15 35 cm in particular at 35 cm both the measured and calculated data showed a step shaped soil moisture depletion with time the step shaped moisture depletion is caused by the high transpiration demand during daytime and no demand during nighttime during daytime the decrease in soil moisture in the root zone depends on the root water uptake rate which is controlled by the water stress and root distribution functions whereas during nighttime the soil moisture is redistributed and it recovers under capillary rise conditions both t a measured by the hp method and potential transpiration t p 1 2 et0 estimated using the basal crop coefficient for full grown sugarcane were highly correlated with r 2 0 93 for 240 data points fig 11a a comparison of the measured t a and total sink t sink calculated by eq 6 is shown in fig 11b for the first 4 days august 12 15 t a and t sink corresponded with each other the numerically calculated t sink under the different potential transpirations of t p et0 kcb 1 0 underestimated the measured transpiration t a in comparison with kcb 1 20 fig 11b thus the numerical calculation suggests that the value of kcb mid 1 20 can also be used for the calculation of the hourly transpiration demand for kcb mid et0 in tanegashima island japan after august 16 t sink gradually became smaller than t a this difference means that the root water uptake could not meet the atmospheric transpiration demand because of a shortage in soil moisture in the root zone assuming that the root zone extended below 50 cm we numerically simulated the hypothetical soil layer to a depth of 60 cm the boundary condition at 50 cm was reset at a depth of 60 cm for the hypothetical soil layer with a rooting depth of l 59 cm other conditions of calculation for the hypothetical 60 cm soil layer were the same as those for the 50 cm soil layer the reference total sink t sink numerically simulated for the hypothetical soil layer was in good correspondence with the measured t a for 10 days fig 11b this simulation suggests that root water uptake in the sugarcane field can occur in soil layers deeper than 50 cm to examine the spatial and temporal changes in root water uptake we calculated the sink term s z t on august 18 in the original calculation domain to a depth of 50 cm fig 12 the dominant area of root water uptake where the value of the sink term was greater than for example 0 001 m3 m 3 h 1 was distributed from about 28 49 cm most of the soil moisture was extracted by the roots of the bottom half of the soil layer where the sink term value was greater than 0 002 m3 m 3 h 1 the roots in the deep layers can extract soil moisture at a high rate to meet the atmospheric transpiration demand because root water uptake in the upper layers is limited owing to the higher suction head for example the stress point of 10 m therefore the numerical approach shows that root water uptake preferentially occurs in deep soil layers where high soil moisture is maintained and meets the transpiration demand our findings agree with a previous report of preferential root water uptake from deep wet soil layers in a grass covered forest lai and katul 2000 4 conclusions the aim of this study is to help optimize irrigation water management for sugarcane fields at the study site we investigated the relationship between transpiration and reference crop evapotranspiration in sugarcane fields on tanegashima island in japan based on the sap flow measurements obtained using the hp method and the numerical analysis of soil moisture movement considering the root water uptake at present 3 mm d 1 of irrigation water is commonly used for the irrigation of sugarcane fields in the study area this value may be sufficient during spring and autumn however transpiration mostly exceeds 4 mm d 1 during august and therefore site specific irrigation water management based on the atmospheric transpiration demand would allow farmers to optimize crop growth and agricultural water use the crop water requirement can be evaluated through the soil moisture depletion corresponding to the changes in the atmospheric transpiration demand and the differences in the soil moisture characteristics and root distributions in different fields in applying the numerical analysis to a specific crop field a locally calibrated crop coefficient is needed to evaluate the transpiration of the plant and the area s soil moisture depletion this study concludes that the standard value presented by the fao is acceptable with respect to the values of the mid season growth stage crop coefficient and basal crop coefficient for sugarcane the values can be applied to tanegashima island about 31 n in japan therefore numerical analysis of soil moisture dynamics under the atmospheric transpiration demand based on the reference crop evapotranspiration can be an effective tool to evaluate the water consumption by sugarcane fields and manage the supply of irrigation water at the study site the current study is limited to a case of the sugarcane of the mid season growth stage in tanegashima island japan but the root water uptake simulation can be expanded to other islands and crop development stages in southern japan

10131,in agriculture soil evaporation is considered a loss of water and crop transpiration is a crucial factor affecting crop growth and yield although there have been numerous studies on evapotranspiration et on farmland only a few have been conducted on field crop transpiration because of the difficulties in the direct measurement of transpiration and in separate evaluation of evaporation and transpiration under field conditions in this study we used the heat pulse method to measure the sap velocity in sugarcane stems to evaluate field transpiration during summer at the study site on tanegashima island at about 31 n in japan the reference crop et was determined by the food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith method from on site meteorological data and was compared with the measured transpiration the daily transpiration in august ranged from 3 3 mm d 1 to 6 6 mm d 1 the corresponding sap flow varied from 0 27 l d 1 to 0 55 l d 1 per stalk the daily analysis of et showed that a standard value of 1 25 for the crop coefficient presented by the fao is acceptable as the crop coefficient for the mid season growth stage of sugarcane in the study site numerical simulations of richards equation with the sink term were conducted to examine the response of root water uptake to atmospheric transpiration demand throughout 20 consecutive clear and dry days in august the decrease in the soil moisture in the root zone depends on the transpiration demand during daytime and soil moisture is redistributed and recovered during the nighttime the hourly numerical results in august support a standard value of 1 20 for the basal crop coefficient in the mid season growth stage as proposed by fao the simulations showed that roots extract water preferentially from the deep and wet soil layers to meet the transpiration demand transpiration predicted from the sink term agreed well with the actual transpiration measured by the heat pulse method therefore the numerical analysis of soil moisture dynamics under the atmospheric transpiration demand based on the reference crop et can be an effective tool to evaluate field sugarcane water consumption keywords heat pulse method reference crop evapotranspiration numerical analysis root water uptake soil moisture 1 introduction food energy and water few are indispensable and fundamental resources for the sustainability of human beings in modern society few resources are in a complicated nexus each having a trade off relationship with the others cosgrove and loucks 2015 scanlon et al 2017 therefore we have to efficiently utilize and manage few resources recently sugarcane has been used not only as an agricultural product but also as a biofuel crop grecco et al 2019 total global biofuel production by sugarcane corn and sorghum is 50 billion l a year sugarcane solely accounts for approximately 40 and is now a major contributor to biofuel production lam et al 2009 therefore many integrated studies have been conducted on the nexus among water resources agricultural production and energy additionally the expansion of sugarcane production for biofuel may function against the conservation of water resources in our study sugarcane the main agricultural crop in the southern islands of japan was selected as the target crop only a few studies have been conducted on the water use and evapotranspiration et of sugarcane in the southern islands of japan et studies on field sugarcane are intensively carried out on the okinawa islands fig 1 for example the daily mean et on okinawa island ranges from 5 9 mm d 1 to 6 4 mm d 1 in the summer season reaching a maximum in august and the crop coefficient kc is 1 24 in august based on long term field water balance lysimeter experiments hossain et al 2005 et observed by the bowen ratio energy balance method on the okinawa island reaches to maximum 6 01 mm d 1 in august and its annual average is 2 91 mm d 1 hiyane 2008 high et occurs during the summer season under high air temperature and solar radiation conditions to the best of our knowledge field research on sugarcane transpiration in these regions has not been reported despite many studies on et in sugarcane fields cabral et al 2012 hiyane et al 2004 field sugarcane transpiration has rarely been reported chabot et al 2005 nassif et al 2014 because of the difficulties in accurate direct measurements of transpiration and in separate evaluation of et as evaporation and transpiration under actual field conditions bastidas obando et al 2017 eksteen et al 2014 kool et al 2014 qiu et al 1999 rafi et al 2019 previous studies on the partitioning of et into soil surface evaporation e and crop transpiration t suggest that e accounts for 20 40 of et in crops such as corn cotton wheat and sorghum e et can be large for the initial crop development stage kool et al 2014 in the sorghum experiments conducted by qiu et al 1999 e ranged from 3 to 20 of et and the measured values of e in august were mostly less than 1 5 mm d 1 under a well developed sorghum canopy moreover in a grain sorghum with a leaf area index greater than 1 in texas usa e accounted for 13 of et ritchie 1972 thus e often constitutes a large fraction of et and may not be negligible under the mid season growth stage condition soil evaporation however is a loss of water from the point of view of agricultural water use and transpiration not et has the major effect on the crop growth james et al 1983 thus water use by field sugarcane should be examined from field sugarcane transpiration sap flow measurements are an effective way to directly evaluate the transpiration of herbaceous crops in small plots where it is difficult to apply micrometeorological approaches approaches to measure sap flow such as heat pulse stem heat balance and constant heater methods cohen et al 1993 gerdes et al 1994 miner et al 2017 sakuratani 1981 are thermal based techniques used to capture water flow through the plant stem for example according to the heat balance method four sap flow sensors were applied to estimate the field sugarcane sap flow in southern brazil for ten days in summer nassif et al 2014 and t by sap flow ranged from 3 15 mm d 1 to 5 98 mm d 1 chabot et al 2005 showed that during the mid season stage over ten days in august in morocco the sap flow measurement for 14 sugarcane stems resulted in an overestimation by 35 compared to the et results in which the soil surface evaporation was neglected the heat balance method for long period usage usually requires sensor maintenance in which the sensor is regularly removed from the stem to prevent stem strangulation kool et al 2014 in this study we used the heat pulse hp method cohen et al 1988 1993 to measure the sap velocity in sugarcane stem and estimate sugarcane transpiration for about two months in tanegashima island about 31 n japan the first objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between field sugarcane transpiration determined by the hp method and the reference crop et determined by the fao penman monteith fao pm method allen et al 1998 we discuss the daily and hourly sap flow responses to solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit vpd the difference between the saturation vapor pressure of air and the actual vapor pressure the second objective is to investigate the relationship between the root water uptake and transpiration in the sugarcane field we discuss the response of root water uptake to atmospheric transpiration demand on the basis of numerical simulation of soil moisture dynamics in the root zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites field experiments were performed on the tanegashima islands in southern japan where sugarcane saccharum spp is the dominant crop the study site was a sugarcane field 48 m 29 m at the kagoshima prefectural institute for agricultural development 30 7315 n 131 0261 e altitude 51 m fig 1 the sugarcane cultivar was nif8 which is a japanese cultivar and most popular in the study site single row planting with 1 2 m spacing between rows is normally used according to the local practice on the islands of southern japan two planting conditions namely spring planting and summer planting are used gunarathna et al 2018 summer planting usually starts in september and spring planting in march both planting crops are harvested around february after 1 5 years and 1 year respectively in this study the first ratoon sugarcane crop of spring planting on march 29 was selected the observation period from august to october is in the mid season growth stage with the plant height reaching over 3 m being exposed to high solar radiation and air temperature in a year the test plot in the field 4 8 m 4 8 m 23 04 m2 consisted of four furrows which are 1 2 m apart meteorological conditions sap flow and soil moisture were recorded from august 12 2016 to october 12 2016 the frequency distribution of stem diameters in the test plot obtained on september 12 2016 is shown in fig 2 the total number of stems in the plot was 255 and the mean stem diameter was 22 0 mm the six representative sugarcane plants selected in the plot for the hp method had a mean stem diameter of 22 7 mm range 22 1 24 1 mm and a mean plant height of 3 20 m range 2 88 3 42 m the mean annual air temperature and precipitation during 1975 2016 were 19 7 c and 2401 mm y 1 respectively the seasonal maxima of air temperature occurred mostly in august and the maximum air temperature 34 7 c was recorded on august 20 1998 during the field experiment the maximum air temperature on august 22 2016 was 34 4 c the fourth highest since 1975 based on the mean air temperature humidity wind speed and sunshine hours recorded by the tanegashima local meteorological agency 30 7200 n 130 9817 e the average potential evaporation in august of each year during 1980 2019 calculated by the penman method for a surface albedo of 0 06 was 5 8 mm d 1 range 4 8 7 0 mm d 1 the potential evaporation in august 2016 was slightly higher than the average at 6 5 mm d 1 in this study the mid season growth stage during summer under high air temperature and solar radiation conditions in which the maximum plant height reaches 3 m was selected to compare the measured transpiration t a with the transpiration estimated based on the basal crop coefficient kcb mid using the dual crop coefficient approach in fao the plowed soil at the study site was volcanic ash soil the soil moisture characteristic curves obtained in laboratory experiments using disturbed soil samples from the site and the van genuchten model seki 2007 van genuchten 1980 are shown in fig 3 the soil field capacity at the soil suction head of 1 m was 0 5 m3 m 3 and the stress point at the soil suction head of 10 m was 0 42 m3 m 3 soil moisture content was measured with a commercial capacitance sensor gs1 meter group inc usa at 1 h sampling intervals at depths of 5 15 25 35 and 50 cm at the center of the test plot notably the subsoil below a depth of 50 cm is different from the volcanic ash soil and is composed of pyroclastic flow deposits 2 2 transpiration we used the hp method to evaluate the field sugarcane transpiration in the hp method a short heat pulse is applied and the sap flow rate is estimated from the velocity of the heat pulse moving with the sap flow in the stem a central needle with a diameter of 0 6 mm was used as a probe of a line heater across the stem and two additional needles downstream and upstream relative to the heater probe were used as thermocouples for temperature measurements we used the hp measurement system originally developed and presented by cohen et al 1988 1993 and applied by takeuchi et al 1996 the design of the probe was originally described by cohen et al 1988 the probe has two temperature sensors and one line heater plain hypodermic needle the length of the temperature sensors was 7 5 mm and the spherical thermocouple junction was near the tip of the needle we applied six probes to the sugarcane stems the probe needle was adjusted to be inserted for example at a depth of 5 5 mm from the stem surface when the stem diameter was 22 mm sugarcane has scattered vascular bundles in the whole stem therefore in a preliminary experiment on the three detection locations of the temperature sensors inserted in the stem the heat pulse speed was detected as low when the sensor installation depth was deep close to the center of the stem whereas it was detected as high when the depth was shallow close to the surface of the stem the hp method requires a reliable calibration constant to account for the effects of tissue wounding caused by needle insertion and to convert the sap velocity to volumetric flow rate the measured hp velocity v is converted to the volumetric sap flow rate sf as follows 1 sf c v a where a is the cross sectional area of flow in the stem and c is the calibration constant which depends mainly on the crop species sensor design and insertion depth of the thermocouples miner et al 2017 steppe et al 2010 in this study sugarcane grown in a pot in a greenhouse with stem diameter 23 mm was used to determine c the volume of the pot was 45 l and the total weight including soil and sugarcane was about 35 kg the pot was completely covered with a plastic sheet to prevent evaporation from the soil surface water loss from the pot by transpiration was measured using an electronic balance having a resolution of 0 5 g gp 40 k a d co ltd japan and the sap velocity v was simultaneously measured over two consecutive days the sampling interval was 30 min thermocouples were installed at a distance of 1 4 of the stem diameter from the stem surface here daily transpiration t a mm d 1 was obtained from sf cm3 d 1 and expressed per land area using the planting density of the test plot eksteen et al 2014 miner et al 2017 to confirm the validity of c determined in the greenhouse experiment a potometer test chen and wang 2012 de rocher and tausch 1994 was carried out for field grown sugarcane this test is widely used for woody and herbaceous plants because of its simplicity the selected sugarcane plants were cut at the bottom of the stem above the soil surface the detached stem with leaves on the upper part was placed in a container with water and then immediately recut under water to prevent air entry the stem with leaves was moved into a smaller glass beaker under water so that the cut surface remained under water water loss from the glass beaker caused by transpiration was measured gravimetrically at regular time intervals the potometer test was performed at the study site on october 14 2016 one stem out of six having a mean diameter of 22 mm fig 2 was selected in the test plot the potometer test lasted from 11 30 h to 14 30 h with a sampling interval of 30 min the solar radiation was also measured at a sampling interval of 30 min for further examination the potometer test was applied to two more field grown sugarcane plants in a sugarcane field third ratoon managed by a local private farmer on okinawa island 26 1346 n 127 6819 e altitude 31 m in okinawa prefecture japan fig 1 this supplementary test confirms the validity of the calibration constant investigated under greenhouse and other island environmental conditions supplementary potometer test was performed on two stems with diameters of 25 2 mm for stem no 1 and 24 3 mm for stem no 2 from 10 55 h to 13 10 h with a sampling interval of 15 min on september 14 2018 2 3 crop evapotranspiration the fao penman monteith fao pm method allen et al 1998 was used for calculating the reference crop et et0 the half hourly weather data were obtained from a weather station vp 4 ds 2 davis cup anemometer pyr solar radiation ecrn 100 meter group inc installed on the side of the plot fig 1 with the crop coefficient kc crop evapotranspiration etc under standard conditions i e well watered and optimal agronomic conditions can be estimated as etc kc et0 in the dual crop coefficient approach by introducing the basal crop coefficient kcb and the soil evaporation coefficient ke crop transpiration tc can be expressed as tc kcb et0 the fao holds the following standard values to be valid in the middle of sugarcane development kc 1 25 kcb 1 2 and ke 0 05 allen et al 1998 asce 1996 in this study the et0 determined by the fao pm method was compared with the actual transpiration t a measured by the hp method based on the daily et0 values and t a measured in a small sugarcane field we will further examine the relationship between et0 and t a for the field sugarcane at our study site to relate the measured t a by the hp method and the calculated kc et0 by the fao pm method we need a value of soil evaporation e under the well developed sugarcane canopy having a plant height of about 3 m however soil evaporation and pan evaporation were not measured and were not available for the study site therefore we assumed that the soil evaporation ranged from 10 to 20 of the potential water surface evaporation ep calculated by the penman method for a water surface albedo of 0 06 the soil evaporation was estimated under the weather conditions of the study site using the locally calibrated values of crop coefficients kc 1 24 in august 1 29 in september and 1 20 in october in okinawa island fig 1 hossain et al 2005 the calculated kc et0 was compared with the estimated crop evapotranspiration of t a e and kc et0 2 4 numerical approach for root water uptake and transpiration for one dimensional vertical transient flows in unsaturated soils the richards equation with a sink term to account for the crop root water uptake was numerically solved by finite difference approximation based on feddes et al 1978 and used for the analysis of soil moisture movements in a soil root system momii et al 1993 the basic equation with the sink term feddes and raats 2004 vereecken et al 2008 is written as follows 2 θ t q z s z t where θ is the volumetric water content t is time z is the vertical space coordinate positive downward s is the volumetric rate of root water uptake per unit time and q is the specific darcy s water flux which can be expressed by the following equation 3 q k h h z 1 where h is the soil matric pressure head and k is the hydraulic conductivity the rate of change in total soil moisture δs from the soil surface to the bottom of the soil layer z max is calculated using the following equation 4 s 0 z max θ t d z to numerically solve eqs 2 and 3 the initial and boundary conditions soil moisture retention characteristic and hydraulic conductivity function need to be defined the calculation period was 10 days august 12 21 2016 when there was no rainfall at the study site the initial condition of the vertical soil moisture profile on august 12 was given as the interpolation of the soil moisture contents measured in the field at five depths 5 15 25 35 and 50 cm the calculation domain was spanned from the soil surface to a depth of z max 50 cm in the volcanic ash soil layer over the subsoil the boundary condition on the soil surface was given by an hourly evaporative flux of 0 05 et0 according to the value of ke 0 05 allen et al 1998 the hourly et0 was calculated from the hourly meteorological data of temperature relative humidity wind speed at 2 m height and solar radiation at the site the soil moisture measured at a depth of 50 cm was used as the bottom boundary condition the grid spacing was 1 cm and the time increment was controlled from 1 s to 60 s in the closed form model proposed by van genuchten 1980 see vg model in fig 3 for the moisture retention characteristics and hydraulic conductivity function with respect to the soil matric suction head the coefficients were found to be α 0 13 m 1 and n 1 076 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was 1 10 5 m s 1 and the saturated soil moisture content was 0 607 m3m 3 which were experimentally determined using the disturbed soil samples in the test plot the sink term in eq 2 was modeled using the macroscopic approach to root water uptake as a function of water stress and root distribution feddes and raats 2004 kumar et al 2013 skaggs et al 2006 as follows 5 s z t β z α h t p t where t p t is the potential transpiration rate α h is the water stress response function 0 α 1 and β z is the root distribution function assuming that crop water storage can be ignored and water extracted by the roots is instantaneously transpired into the atmosphere the transpiration can be numerically calculated from the integration of the sink term in space as follows 6 t sink t 0 z max s z t dz t p t was given as 1 2 et0 according to the basal crop coefficient kcb 1 2 for sugarcane in the mid season growth stage allen et al 1998 the calculated result of t sink under 1 2 et0 was compared with the result obtained under the condition of et0 the water stress response function was then characterized using the four matric suction heads such as h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 as proposed by feddes et al 1978 skaggs et al 2006 h 1 is the anaerobiosis point h 2 and h 3 are suction heads having the maximum water uptake h 3 is the suction head at which soil water begins to limit optimum crop growth and h 4 is the permanent wilting point at the lower limit of soil water availability to plants for the numerical calculation h 1 0 10 m h 2 0 20 m and h 4 160 0 m were selected moreover h 3 is a function of transpiration demand and the values of h 3 for the higher demand of 5 mm d 1 and the lower demand of 1 mm d 1 were given as 6 0 m and 10 0 m respectively feddes and raats 2004 grecco et al 2019 numerous functions for β z have been used in crop fields including constant linear trapezoidal and exponential functions braud et al 2005 sallo et al 2020 the function of β z originally depends on the root length density distribution and root activity with depth z it was difficult for us to distinguish between the inactive and the newly developed active roots in soil layers because of ratooning although root density may generally decrease exponentially with depth this is not known a priori in each field spatial root distribution is a record of strategic adaptation of roots to changing soil irrigation and water conditions coelho and or 1999 momii 2016 in our visual observation we recognized the existence of the roots in the plow layer of volcanic ash soil however it was not clear whether those roots were active or not root length density does not always coincide with the actual root water uptake pattern here β z was calibrated for the constant linear trapezoidal exponential and step functions by matching the measured and calculated soil moisture changes at 15 cm and 35 cm for three days august 12 14 2016 in the numerical calculation the rooting zone was assumed to be the whole plow layer and the rooting depth l was 49 cm except for two space grid points on the soil surface and bottom boundaries the model performance of β z was assessed from the values of the statistical criteria of the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse legates and mccabe 1999 sahoo et al 2013 between the calculated and measured soil moisture contents in this study our own developed numerical program which was originally applied to the numerical analysis of soil water dynamics by momii et al 1992 1993 was used because of its ease for site specific boundary conditions atmospheric et demand and the calculations of t sink in eq 6 under specific root distribution functions 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of heat pulse method the sap flow rate was evaluated using the hp method with a calibration constant of c 1 3 fig 4 this constant was determined from the slope of the regression line 1 32 between the sap flow rate determined by the hp method and the transpiration rate of potted sugarcane measured using an electronic balance at c 1 3 the sap flow rate corresponded well with transpiration the accumulated sap flow rates on july 3 and 4 by the hp method were 1 61 l d 1 and 1 64 l d 1 respectively fig 4 whereas those by the gravimetric method were 1 65 l d 1 and 1 71 l d 1 respectively the difference was only 4 to examine the model performance three statistical criteria such as nse determination coefficient r 2 and rmse were calculated for 58 data points collected from 06 00 h to 20 00 h on july 3 and 4 2016 because values of nse and r 2 close to 1 and of rmse close to 0 indicate good model performance the values obtained nse 0 91 r 2 0 95 and rmse 17 5 g h 1 indicate good agreement between the flow rate evaluated by the hp method and the measured transpiration we used c 1 3 for the evaluation of transpiration in field sugarcane the transpiration changes measured by the hp method with c 1 3 and by the potometer test on tanegashima island are shown in fig 5a although the potometer test was short and the solar radiation was relatively low under cloudy conditions the transpiration by the potometer test and the hp method roughly followed the change in solar radiation and was in relatively good correspondence the accumulated sap flow rates recorded for 3 h by the hp and the gravimetric methods were 94 g and 86 g respectively and the difference was about 9 in the supplementary test of okinawa island the solar radiation was higher than that in tanegashima island fig 5b and the accumulated sap flow rates for 2 h by the hp method were 162 g for stem no 1 and 135 g for stem no 2 whereas those by the gravimetric method were 166 g and 143 g for stem no 1 and stem no 2 respectively the differences were only 2 and 5 respectively the on site potometer test used was simple and it was sufficient to confirm the applicability of c 1 3 for field grown sugarcane thus the calibration constant c 1 3 for sugarcane is suitable for the hp method when the thermocouples are installed at a distance of 1 4 of the stem diameter from the stem surface 3 2 daily transpiration fig 6a shows that daily changes in transpiration closely followed those in et0 estimated from the atmospheric variables obtained by the fao pm model field sugarcane transpiration decreased with a gradual decrease in air temperature and solar radiation from august to october fig 6a b the correlation between t a and solar radiation r s was high r 2 0 86 whereas that between t a and vpd was low r 2 0 51 similar responses have been observed in maize wang et al 2020 the maximum transpiration was 6 6 mm d 1 which corresponded to a maximum sap flow rate of 0 55 l d 1 per stalk on august 30 at a daily mean temperature of 26 2 c daily mean relative humidity of 56 8 and solar radiation of 20 1 mj m 2 d 1 table 1 the et0 on that date was 5 7 mm d 1 from august 12 30 the crop stage was in a period of high solar radiation mean value of 21 3 mj m 2 d 1 and temperature mean value of 28 0 c the daily transpiration for these 20 days ranged from 3 3 mm d 1 to 6 6 mm d 1 which corresponded to the sap flow from 0 27 l d 1 to 0 55 l d 1 per stalk table 1 these values are comparable to the daily transpiration of field sugarcane measured by the heat balance method for ten days in the summer season in southern brazil ranging from 3 15 mm d 1 to 5 98 mm d 1 from 0 34 l d 1 to 0 64 l d 1 nassif et al 2014 except for a rainfall of 14 mm over 3 days august 22 24 2016 there was no rainfall or irrigation at the study site between august 12 and september 2 in irrigation planning in humid regions when the soil moisture suction head in a soil layer for predominant water consumption reaches at the stress point of a suction head of 10 m irrigation is initiated to recover the soil moisture up to the field capacity the average soil moisture content decreased gradually above the stress point from august 14 to september 2 fig 6c after a rainfall of 79 5 mm over 5 days september 3 7 2016 the average soil moisture recovered below the stress point the soil moisture data suggest that sugarcane roots in the upper soil layer could be under water stress from august 14 to september 2 fig 7 shows that a high correlation r 2 0 90 was observed between t a and et0 the linear regression equation was t a 1 2 et0 0 73 for all the data points data points n 62 the slope of 1 2 is consistent with the basal crop coefficient of 1 2 for sugarcane as proposed by the fao allen et al 1998 as mentioned above the average soil moisture status at all the examined depths suggested that sugarcane roots experienced water stress from august 14 to september 2 the relationship between t a and et0 in the absence of water stress n 41 was also linear and similar to that with the full dataset fig 7 assuming that the soil moisture content is sufficient to partly meet the atmospheric transpiration demand t a may follow the changes in et0 at the study site even if the moisture in the upper soil layers decreases above the stress point we expect that the transpiration demand can be met from the deeper and wetter soil layer at a depth of 50 cm fig 6c here we tried to relate the measured t a obtained using the hp method and calculated kc et0 obtained using the fao pm method when the soil evaporation ranged from 10 to 20 of the potential evaporation ep e ranges from 0 2 mm d 1 to 1 5 mm d 1 under the weather conditions of the study site when 15 of ep was selected as e during august october in the study site e ranged from 0 23 mm d 1 to 1 11 mm d 1 reaching its maximum on august 29 with a mean of 0 67 mm d 1 fig 8 these values of e are similar to those from the sorghum field of e etc 13 ritchie 1972 and e 1 5 mm d 1 in the summer season qiu et al 1999 using the locally calibrated values of crop coefficients kc 1 24 in august 1 29 in september 1 20 in october in okinawa island hossain et al 2005 the calculated kc et0 closely corresponded with the estimated crop evapotranspiration of t a e fig 8 the value of kc almost coincided with the standard crop coefficient kc mid of 1 25 for the mid season growth stage presented by the fao allen et al 1999 no significant differences between kc et0 and kc mid et0 were recognized and both were in good correspondence with t a e fig 8 the value of 1 25 is acceptable for the crop coefficient kc mid for mid season growth stage of the sugarcane grown in tanegashima island the value of kc mid 1 25 has also been reported in the mid season growth stage of sugarcane grown in australia and eswatini inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 thus our results on the tanegashima island of southern japan substantially support the standard value of 1 25 proposed by the fao 3 3 hourly transpiration fig 9a shows that sf closely followed the changes in r s with time on two sunny days of august 12 and 13 2016 the correlation between r s and sf was high r 2 0 96 and the daily sf for the two days were 0 42 l d 1 and 0 47 l d 1 however the peak of vpd lagged those of sf and r s for example the sf peaked at 11 30 h and vpd peaked at 15 00 h the maximum value of sf sf max on august 13 was 63 cm3 h 1 and that of vpd vpdmax was 1 6 kpa the relationship between the vpd and sf showed a distinct clockwise hysteresis loop when the vpd increased in the morning the sf increased and when the vpd decreased in the afternoon the sf tended to decrease however the sf at any given vpd in the afternoon was lower than the sf in the morning at the same vpd fig 9c zeppel et al 2004 hysteresis between hourly transpiration and meteorological variables has been reported in greenhouse cucumber in spain medrano et al 2005 and a maize field in china wang et al 2020 the sf vpd hysteresis relation can be modeled on the basis of a time lag between the hourly scale of the sf and vpd zhang et al 2014 because hysteresis can also be affected by plants and soil moisture status further research on the hysteresis pattern of field grown sugarcane will be needed peng et al 2018 here no hysteresis response of transpiration to r s was detected while we clearly demonstrated a pronounced clockwise loop pattern of hysteresis in the response of transpiration to vpd in our study area s sugarcane field 3 4 root water uptake and transpiration the rmse and nse values for various functions of root distribution β z are shown in table 2 judging from the negative nse values the functions decreasing with depth linear and exponential functions were not applicable to the sugarcane field at the study site the increase in the trapezoidal and step functions with depth sufficiently evaluated the measured soil moisture depletion as evident from the lower rmse values than those of the other functions because the nse values of the step function for both 15 cm and 35 cm depths were close to 1 the step function in space rooting depth l 49 cm β z 0 5 l for the upper root zone and 1 5 l for the lower root zone was adopted to compensate for the greater sink in the lower soil layers than in the upper soil layers the measured and calculated hourly soil moisture depletion over 10 days from august 12 21 with no rainfall is shown in fig 10 a negative δs value calculated using eq 4 during daytime indicates a decrease in the total soil moisture and a positive one during nighttime indicates a total soil moisture increase fig 10 the calculated soil moisture values were in good correspondence with the measured values at a depth of 15 35 cm in particular at 35 cm both the measured and calculated data showed a step shaped soil moisture depletion with time the step shaped moisture depletion is caused by the high transpiration demand during daytime and no demand during nighttime during daytime the decrease in soil moisture in the root zone depends on the root water uptake rate which is controlled by the water stress and root distribution functions whereas during nighttime the soil moisture is redistributed and it recovers under capillary rise conditions both t a measured by the hp method and potential transpiration t p 1 2 et0 estimated using the basal crop coefficient for full grown sugarcane were highly correlated with r 2 0 93 for 240 data points fig 11a a comparison of the measured t a and total sink t sink calculated by eq 6 is shown in fig 11b for the first 4 days august 12 15 t a and t sink corresponded with each other the numerically calculated t sink under the different potential transpirations of t p et0 kcb 1 0 underestimated the measured transpiration t a in comparison with kcb 1 20 fig 11b thus the numerical calculation suggests that the value of kcb mid 1 20 can also be used for the calculation of the hourly transpiration demand for kcb mid et0 in tanegashima island japan after august 16 t sink gradually became smaller than t a this difference means that the root water uptake could not meet the atmospheric transpiration demand because of a shortage in soil moisture in the root zone assuming that the root zone extended below 50 cm we numerically simulated the hypothetical soil layer to a depth of 60 cm the boundary condition at 50 cm was reset at a depth of 60 cm for the hypothetical soil layer with a rooting depth of l 59 cm other conditions of calculation for the hypothetical 60 cm soil layer were the same as those for the 50 cm soil layer the reference total sink t sink numerically simulated for the hypothetical soil layer was in good correspondence with the measured t a for 10 days fig 11b this simulation suggests that root water uptake in the sugarcane field can occur in soil layers deeper than 50 cm to examine the spatial and temporal changes in root water uptake we calculated the sink term s z t on august 18 in the original calculation domain to a depth of 50 cm fig 12 the dominant area of root water uptake where the value of the sink term was greater than for example 0 001 m3 m 3 h 1 was distributed from about 28 49 cm most of the soil moisture was extracted by the roots of the bottom half of the soil layer where the sink term value was greater than 0 002 m3 m 3 h 1 the roots in the deep layers can extract soil moisture at a high rate to meet the atmospheric transpiration demand because root water uptake in the upper layers is limited owing to the higher suction head for example the stress point of 10 m therefore the numerical approach shows that root water uptake preferentially occurs in deep soil layers where high soil moisture is maintained and meets the transpiration demand our findings agree with a previous report of preferential root water uptake from deep wet soil layers in a grass covered forest lai and katul 2000 4 conclusions the aim of this study is to help optimize irrigation water management for sugarcane fields at the study site we investigated the relationship between transpiration and reference crop evapotranspiration in sugarcane fields on tanegashima island in japan based on the sap flow measurements obtained using the hp method and the numerical analysis of soil moisture movement considering the root water uptake at present 3 mm d 1 of irrigation water is commonly used for the irrigation of sugarcane fields in the study area this value may be sufficient during spring and autumn however transpiration mostly exceeds 4 mm d 1 during august and therefore site specific irrigation water management based on the atmospheric transpiration demand would allow farmers to optimize crop growth and agricultural water use the crop water requirement can be evaluated through the soil moisture depletion corresponding to the changes in the atmospheric transpiration demand and the differences in the soil moisture characteristics and root distributions in different fields in applying the numerical analysis to a specific crop field a locally calibrated crop coefficient is needed to evaluate the transpiration of the plant and the area s soil moisture depletion this study concludes that the standard value presented by the fao is acceptable with respect to the values of the mid season growth stage crop coefficient and basal crop coefficient for sugarcane the values can be applied to tanegashima island about 31 n in japan therefore numerical analysis of soil moisture dynamics under the atmospheric transpiration demand based on the reference crop evapotranspiration can be an effective tool to evaluate the water consumption by sugarcane fields and manage the supply of irrigation water at the study site the current study is limited to a case of the sugarcane of the mid season growth stage in tanegashima island japan but the root water uptake simulation can be expanded to other islands and crop development stages in southern japan applicability of our approach to the different soil and atmospheric environments will be examined in the future research funding this research was supported by the grant in aid for scientific research

10132,increasing agricultural productivity through irrigation technologies is recognized as an effective way to improve smallholders livelihoods and food security in developing countries however most smallholder farmers do not have access to irrigation technologies using a double bounded contingent valuation survey data from smallholders in ethiopia and probit and bivariate probit models this paper analyzes smallholder farmers demand for agricultural water lifting technologies wlts and the factors affecting the demand for these technologies assessment of farmers preferences among three water lifting technologies available in local markets motorized pump rope and washer and pulley show that farmers prefer motorized pumps to pulley or rope and washer technologies use of motorized pumps is more efficient and save labour than pulley or rope and washer technologies however results show that smallholders are constrained by inadequate access to financing options to adopt more efficient and labour saving water lifting technology and hence operate below the production possibility frontier enhanced access to finance could help ease this constraint and allow smallholders to acquire more efficient irrigation technologies enhance adoption and improve productivity with a growing population pressure and land fragmentation in rural ethiopia the livelihoods of smallholders depend mainly on the meagre land endowment they possess increasing the productivity of land using yield enhancing technologies particularly multiple cropping per year via small scale irrigation is key to improve their livelihoods targeted interventions are thus warranted to mitigate the key adoption constraints such as improving access to credit and technical know how of smallholders keywords adoption small scale irrigation demand ethiopia smallholder farmers water lifting technologies willingness to pay 1 introduction studies in sub saharan africa ssa and other developing countries show a positive impact of irrigation in agricultural productivity and poverty reduction ayele 2011 etissa et al 2014 desilva et al 2014 woodhouse et al 2017 xie et al 2018 wiggins and lankford 2019 irrigation increases agricultural production through protecting crops against risks of uneven unreliable and insufficient rainfall or by enabling production of high value crops in a dry season and multiple cropping burney and naylor 2012 balana et al 2020 irrigation creates additional employment and helps smooth seasonal shortfalls in food supply and encourage the production of crops that contribute towards diverse and nutritious diet it could also benefit the urban poor by keeping food prices low despite growing demand for food girma and awulachew 2007 ethiopia which is referred to as the water tower of africa has an estimated ground water potential of 2 6 6 5 billion m3 12 river basins with an estimated mean annual flow volume of 122 billion m3 and 11 freshwater lakes awulachew et al 2007 the country also comprises of an estimated cultivable land area between 30 and 70 mha awulachew et al 2010 despite this potential the country s agriculture is highly dependent on rain fed agricultural system where rainfall is erratic and often insufficient only 15 mha of land is under cultivation of which only about 640 000 ha are irrigated according to gebregziabher 2012 the country has used 5 of its water resources to irrigate only 5 of its irrigation potential which implies underutilization of agricultural water resources one of the potential solutions in addressing agricultural water management problem in ethiopia could be the promotion of affordable small scale water lifting technologies wlts for irrigation such as motorized water pumps pulley and rope and washer pumps such technologies could increase smallholder farmers access to agricultural water during dry seasons that allow farmers to practice multiple cropping in a year by providing supplemental irrigation access to agricultural water also cushions failure of the main wet season crops from dry spells in rain fed agriculture system fox and rockstrom 2000 2003 however most smallholder farmers in sub saharan african countries lack access to irrigation technologies burney and naylor 2012 acheampong et al 2018 several factors such as high cost of the technologies lack of access to financing options lack of technical know how limited access to productive resources land and water sources or lack of market access may constrain adoption of irrigation technologies some studies claim that high prices of the technologies and operating costs are the key factors for the low demand for wlts nunes and boatwright 2004 it may also be the case that the availability or supply of the technologies are limited ngigi 2003 lack of knowledge and technical knowhow could also be confounding factors in limiting the adoption of the wlts despite the claims on the potential factors that could impede smallholder s demand for wlts there is lack of empirical evidence for the low demand for the productivity enhancing wlts among smallholders in ethiopia understanding smallholder s preference and demand for wlts and the factors influencing their demand for these technologies are key for designing sustainable and effective agricultural water management interventions and policies targeting smallholders however there exist knowledge gaps on the farmers preference for specific types of wlts and their demand for these technologies only few studies examined the factors affecting smallholders preference to certain water lifting technologies these studies focused on estimating the economic value of irrigation water and provision and improvement of potable water supply for urban people in ethiopia gebregziabher 2012 2014 but did not attempt to estimate the willingness to pay of smallholder farmers for the small scale irrigation technologies and the factors for low adoption of these technologies the purpose of this study is thus to fill the knowledge gap on smallholders effective demand for wlts identify the key factors that influence their demand and adoption of these technologies in ethiopia and other developing countries with similar conditions this could guide targeted interventions on agricultural water management technologies to benefit smallholder farmers a contingent valuation approach was applied to elicit the preference and demand for the set of selected agricultural water lifting technologies primary data were collected from 208 smallholders farm households sampled from four selected weredas districts in rural ethiopia a probit modelling approach was used to estimate the willingness to pay for the technologies key factors influencing smallholder s demand adoption constraints and policy implications for scaling up of small scale irrigation technologies are discussed the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a concise review on the application of contingent valuation approach on market goods data analytical approach and empirical model specifications are presented in section 3 section 4 presents the findings and followed by discussions in section 5 the last section concludes the paper with key policy implications 2 application of contingent valuation to market goods contingent valuation cv is a survey based approach used to elicit individual s preference for the non market values of environmental and other non market goods or values of marketed goods based on the attributes of the good hoevenagel 1994 stewart and khan 2006 mattia et al 2010 arcadio et al 2012 even if there is a market for the good it may not reflect the true value or willingness to pay wtp of individuals mattia et al 2010 two assumptions that underly the cv method are 1 people have well ordered but hidden preferences for goods and 2 people are capable of transforming these preferences into monetary values hoevenagel 1994 balana et al 2012 for value elicitation the cv method presents respondents with a description of the attributes of the good under consideration or scenario of proposed changes and asks the respondents to express in monetary terms their maximum willingness to pay for the good or the minimum compensation they would be willing to accept for a certain negative change balana et al 2012 estimation of wtp for marketed goods using a cv method is relevant in testing its validity and assessing how the real market operates perman et al 2003 in particular in rural economies of developing countries where market imperfections appears to be a norm the validation test gives an insight in deviation between prices of market good such as irrigation equipment or technologies elicited through cv survey and the existing market price of the technologies so that one can examine the attributes or factors that account for the deviation more broadly the wtp measure for market goods ensures the knowledge about consumers valuations and choice behavior which helps marketers and companies in setting optimal pricing decisions and predictions of individual consumer choice the study by arcadio et al 2012 presents the importance of wtp in valuation of both marketed and non marketed goods wtp estimates can be used to assess the price elasticity of demand and for modeling demand functions it also helps apply market segment based on demand functions similar studies indicate that the importance of wtp study for marketed goods in measuring product brands setting price for new products predicting future demand and price for the existing and novel goods jesdapipat 2009 renee 2012 despite these advantages there is limited application of wtp estimation approach for the marketed goods notable exceptions are andersson et al 2008 for safety car philip 2012 for mobile application arcadio et al 2012 for organic apples and kabyanga et al 2018 for biogas digester regarding water lifting technologies for irrigation use in ssa few studies applied variants of wtp estimation fentahun et al 2020 used cv method to elicit irrigators willingness to pay for soil moisture tools in south eastern africa using discrete choice experiment method houessionon et al 2017 estimated farmers preferences and their demand for agricultural water management technologies using primary data collected from 300 smallholder farmers sampled from two municipalities in burkina faso zongo et al 2015 analyze farmers practices and willingness to adopt supplementary irrigation on rain fed crops in the long dry spell areas of burkina faso nakanyike 2014 estimates farmers demand for virus free sweet potato vines in uganda from randomly selected 200 households using a contingent valuation method the same study also estimates the market potential for the sweet potato vines and shows vine production was an economically viable enterprise and vine producers should target commercial sweet potato farmers ulimwengu and sanyal 2011 analyze farmers demand for agricultural advisory services in uganda using a contingent valuation method falola et al 2013 examine uptake of agricultural insurance by cocoa farmers in nigeria and their willingness to pay the study also identifies several factors such as education and extension services that influence the up take and willingness to pay using a propensity matching technique zeweld et al 2015 investigated the adoption constraints and impacts of small scale irrigation in northern ethiopia gebergziabher et al 2014 analyze the economic factors influencing adoption of motor pumps in ethiopia their findings show a positive correlation between the factors influencing adoption of motorized pumps and other water lifting technologies socio economic and demographic factors and spatial variability in biophysical characteristics such as rainfall topography soil and water conservation influence farmers decision to adopt water lifting technologies the preceding literature indicate the relevance and empirical application of stated preference methods particularly contingent valuation method to assess preferences and estimate the demand for irrigation and other agricultural technologies in developing countries 3 materials and methods 3 1 conceptual model the conceptual model guiding our empirical analysis of the willingness to pay data is based on the random utility theory rut train 2003 the key idea in this theory is that an individual s or household s resource allocation decision e g purchase of goods is driven by the underlying utility maximization behavior the rut is based on the rationality assumption of economic agents in that a decision maker i in making a choice from j alternatives selects the alternative that maximizes his her utility and the utility assigned to each alternative depends on the attributes of the alternative a j and the characteristics of the decision maker x i according to this theory the utility assigned to alternative j by individual i is not known by certainty by external analyst i e some parts the utility are unobservable ɛ from the perspective of the researcher thus in the context of contingent valuation the analyst can only make probability statements about the respondent s yes or no answer to the suggested scenario following haab and mcconnell 2002 the yes and no responses can be specified using an indirect utility function for each respondent assuming that a decision maker gains utility from the use of the water lifting technology as compared to the status quo let u ij u i i i x i a j ε ij is an indirect utility function for the i th respondent from use of the j th technology j 1 if the individual uses the technology for irrigation or j 0 otherwise i e the status quo i i is the i th respondent s income x i is a vector of household characteristics and a j attributes of a given water lifting technology chosen by the individual and ε ij is a random component based on this model respondent i answers yes i e technology j 1 for a required payment of ρ i bid value if the utility of adopting the chosen water lifting technology u i 1 net of the required payment exceeds utility of the status quo u i 0 eq 1 1 u i 1 i i ρ i x i a j ε i 1 u i 0 i i x i ε i 0 however a researcher does not know the random part of preference and can only make probability statement about a yes or no response the probability that the respondent says yes is the probability the individual gets better off in the proposed change so that u i1 u i0 for individual i this probability is given by p y i 1 as in eq 2 2 p y i 1 p u i 1 i i ρ i x i a j ε i 1 u i 0 i i x i ε i 0 where y i 1 if the respondent says yes to a given bid value and y i 0 otherwise denoting the utility difference between adopting and not adopting the j th technology by a latent variable y i an individual chooses the j th technology if the utility difference y i exceeds the bid value ρ i and we observe y i 1 adoption and y i 0 otherwise eq 3 3 y i z i β ε i y i 1 if y i ρ i y i 0 if y i ρ i where the z i vector contains both technology attributes and the characteristics of decision makers from eq 3 and assuming a standard normal distribution of the error term the probability that an individual farmer is willing to pay for a given irrigation technology can be estimated using a probit model eq 4 4 p y i 1 p y i ρ i p z i β ε i ρ i p ε i z i β ρ i f z i β where y i z i β ε i and f z i β is the cumulative distribution function of ε i 3 2 description of the study areas this study is based on data gathered from four districts weredas in ethiopia adami tulu district in oromia regional state dangla and bahir dar zuria districts in amhara regional state and lemo district in southern regional state fig 1 from 2013 to 2018 the feed the future innovation laboratory for small scale irrigation ilssi project promoted use of small scale irrigation ssi technologies in these districts in ethiopia ilssi is a usaid funded project implemented in ghana ethiopia mali and tanzania http ilssi tamu edu and aims at providing technical knowledge base and local capacity for sustainable smallholder irrigation development the project has conducted extensive field studies on socioeconomics of water lifting technologies assessment of water availability for irrigation and the scalability of various small scale technologies however the project does not provide the technologies to farmers for free rather facilitates the partnership between farmers or farmers associations and microfinance institutions in the respective study sites in terms of agro ecology all the four study areas fall under the mid altitude woina dega 1 1 woina dega is an agro ecological zone classification in ethiopia covering altitudes between 1500 and 2300 m a s l and thus share similar biophysical characteristics average elevation temperature and rainfall adami tulu is in the ethiopian rift valley characterized by drought prone agro ecology tropical rainy woina dega agro climatic zone with elevation between 1560 and 2300 m a s l meter above sea level and an annual average rainfall of around 750 mm ministry of water resources 2008 the general climate in dangla is moist sub tropical woina dega characterized by moderate temperature and enough kiremt 2 2 kiremt is the amharic word and represents the main rainy season july september in ethiopia rainfall assefa 2015 the average annual rainfall in the area is about 1600 mm bahir dar zuria is mainly characterized by a plain area with an average elevation of 1848 m a s l its annual rainfall ranges between 1200 and 1800 mm and characterized by a woina dega agro ecology most part of lemo falls under moist woina dega agroecological zone dubale et al 2015 the rainfall in lemo varies between 950 and 1200 mm annually and most of the area is between 2100 and 2500 m a s l the farming system in all the four study districts is characterized by a mixed crop livestock production with rain fed production dominates though some districts e g bahir dar zuria and adami tulu practice limited irrigated farming maize finger millet teff rice and chickpeas are the major annual crops grown in bahir dar zuria and dangla in lemo district farmers grow some trees crops such as coffee and enset ensete ventricosum musaceae as well as annual crops mainly wheat maize and fava beans the main crops grown in adami tulu include maize haricot beans and teff the ilssi project intervention on small scale water lifting technologies aimed at improving smallholders access to these technologies for growing high value vegetables in dry season and improve livelihoods and nutrition the four study areas generally exhibit peri urban population settlements with good connections to roads and market centers adami tulu is a district town with over 10 000 population and located at about 168 km south of addis ababa with a population of over 26 000 dangla is a town situated along the addis ababa bahir dar road at 77 km south west of bahir dar the capita of amhara region bahir dar zuria is a peri urban district around the city of bahir dar lemo is a district surrounds the town of hosaena in southern ethiopia a major settlement of over 76 000 population overall the study areas have good access to markets to sell their agricultural produce 3 3 data and survey design data were collected from a survey of smallholder farmers sampled from the four ilssi intervention sites in ethiopia as decribed above a contingent valuation survey with close ended elicitation format and open ended follow up questions were employed the questionnaire includes demographic economic market access and valuation questions the questionnaire was pre tested and revised based on feedbacks before final administration of the survey survey was administered in a face to face interview through trained enumerators conversant of local languages and field experience of the study areas relevant secondary data were obtained from the districts agriculture offices central statistics agency and the international water management institute a multi stage sampling technique was employed the four districts were already selected by the ilssi project for piloting small scale irrigation intervention based on the information from the district agriculture offices five kebeles 3 3 kebele is the lowest administrative unit in ethiopia which were identified as intensive users of small scale irrigation technologies were selected finally a random sampling technique was used to select 208 sample farm households the sample size was determined using the minimum sample size formulae of fowler 2013 and then adjusted to the target population following cochran 1977 the sample was divided into two groups a group of respondents who participated in the ilssi project interventions treated group and another group which did not participate control group ilssi intervention i e treatment assignment was made to a randomly selected smallholders in the study locations prior to the cv survey an open ended reconnaissance survey was conducted with selected farmers where they were asked to state the prices they would be willing to pay for three different wlts fuel powered motorized pumps rope and washer and pulley this helps reduce the effect of start up price bias which is often encountered in double bounded dichotomous choice survey farmers participated in the reconnaissance survey were excluded from the final survey market prices of the three wlts were obtained from local markets based on the reconnaissance survey and information on market prices five starting prices were determined for each technology table 1 and sampled households were randomly assigned into five equal groups each sampled farmer was then provided with a random initial price for the selected technology the farmers who accepted the first price were given a second value which is higher than the first price on the other hand if the interviewee responded no to the initial price in a follow up question he she is provided with a lower value than the initial price this process results in four possible outcomes 1 both answers yes 2 both answers no 3 a yes followed by a no and 4 a no followed by a yes the responses elicited through the survey are summarized in table 1 the no no responses i e the unwillingness to pay to both the initial and follow up prices could be an indication of either a genuine lack of demand for the technology or a protest response even though a farmer may have positive demand for the technology though there is no established criteria to differentiate such responses between genuine and protest boyle 2003 suggested certain follow up questions to identify such responses inclusion of protest responses i e zero wpt values in the estimation of mean and aggregate wtp leads to biased estimates thus following alebel et al 2009 mezgebo et al 2013 we excluded protest responses from the aggregate willingness to pay estimation 3 4 empirical model cameron and quiggin 1994 assume separate distributional parameters for the underlying latent willingness to pay in their empirical double bounded binary models i e one for the initial bid value and another for the follow up value based on this assumption the two latent willingness to pay values for the respondent wtp i 1 y 1 and wtp i 2 y 2 can be described by the bivariate probit model as in eq 5 greene 2003 5 y 1 x 1 β 1 ε 1 y 2 x 2 β 2 ε 2 the error terms in eq 5 are assumed to be jointly normally distributed with zero means and variances δ 1 2 and δ 1 2 correlation coefficient ρ β 1 and β 2 are coefficients for the first and second equations and x 1 and x 2 are explanatory variables the choice of explanatory variables in the empirical model table 2 is based on the theory of demand mas colell et al 1995 random utility theory train 2003 and literature arcadio et al 2012 balana et al 2012 gebergziabher et al 2014 nonvide 2017 following hanemann 1991 the probabilities of the four possible outcomes in the double bounded dichotomous value elicitation format can be expressed by a set of equations eq 6 6 p yes yes p ρ u y i g ρ u θ p yes no p ρ i y i ρ u g ρ u θ g ρ i θ p no yes p ρ l y i ρ i g ρ i θ g ρ l θ p no no p ρ l y i 1 g ρ l θ where ρ u is the upper value followed by a yes no response situation ρ l is a lower value followed by a no yes response and g ρ i θ g ρ u θ and g ρ l θ denote the cumulative probability distributions for the initial upper and lower follow up values respectively from eq 6 the log likelihood function for the i th respondent can be specified as in eq 7 7 ln l θ d i yy ln g ρ u θ d i yn ln g ρ u θ g ρ i θ d i ny ln g ρ i θ g ρ l θ d i nn ln 1 g ρ l θ where d i yy 1 for a yes yes d i yn 1 for a yes no d i ny 1 for a no yes and d i nn 1 for a no no responses and zero otherwise for each combination bivariate probit model estimation deliver two parameter estimates from the two rounds of bidding process however the first round parameters are generally used in the computation of mean wtp this is because the second equation parameters are likely to contain more noise in terms of anchoring bias where the respondent is assumed to take the clue from the first bid while forming his response for the second question table 2 presents the description of the variables used in the empirical model 4 results 4 1 descriptive analysis table 3 summarizes the descriptive statistics of the variables included in the model about 82 of surveyed households are male headed 40 do have prior experience or knowledge about the water lifting technologies and 44 responded that they engage in off farm activities about 76 5 of the sample households expressed their willingness to pay for the wlts however there is statistically significant difference in wtp among male headed and female headed households household size varies from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 18 persons respondents age ranges from 18 to 76 years with an average age of 43 6 it is expected that the younger farmers are willing to pay more for the wlts assuming that older farmers have more farming experience and tend to stick to their traditional farming systems the education level of respondents ranges from illiterate to secondary school graduate with an average of 3 83 years school schooling about 69 2 of respondents attended formal education while the rest are illiterate average annual income farm and off farm income for those willing and unwilling respondents show a statistically significant difference at 1 level the average farmland holding is about 1 42 ha with min 0 2 ha and max 6 ha farmers on average have 0 81 ha of irrigable land the difference in average land holding among willing and unwilling households is statistically insignificant in terms of livestock ownership willing households on average own more livestock than the unwilling households which is also statistically significant about 52 of the respondents reported that they have access to credit access to credit for the purpose of this study refers to either the ability of farmers to borrow money from the financial institutions or the possibility of farmers to own the technologies in credit term farm households can acquire technologies either in cash payment or in credit buying on credit increases farmers ability to pay for the technologies in the study areas all the surveyed households prefer either annual or semi annual credit term as a payment option for the technologies to immediate cash payment table 4 reports mean comparisons of household characteristics to test presence of selection bias and no significant difference was found among the intervention and control group 4 2 econometric results 4 2 1 probit model results table 5 reports results of the probit model estimation a wald test was used to test the joint significance of the explanatory variables the overall significance of the model was good eight of the variables in the model show the a priori expected sign and more than half of them were found to be significant in affecting wtp decision table 5 these include household size age of the household head farmland size initial bid values household income off farm activity access to credit and livestock ownership family size household income livestock ownership initial bid values and access to credit affect wtp positively but off farm activity farmland size and age of the head affect wtp decision negatively table 6 presents the marginal effects i e the partial derivatives of explanatory variables with respect to discrete yes or no responses to the initial bid price ρ i computed following age has a negative and statistically significant effect on the farmers decision to pay for the wlts the marginal effect shows that other things being equal a one year increase in the age of the head decreases the probability of accepting the initial bid price by 1 3 indicating that younger farmers are willing to pay more for the technologies compared to older farmers the result is consistent with the findings of mezgebo et al 2013 and alebel et al 2009 holding other things constant a unit increase in the family size of the farm household increases the probability of accepting the first proposed bid by about 4 2 this may be due to the economic contribution of additional family members in the household assuming that additional labor force could increase the efficiency of technology utilization the study by alhassan et al 2013 also found similar results households income has a positive and statistically significant at 1 level of significance effect on accepting the initial bid price which is consistent with economic theory assuming water lifting technologies are normal goods the result is also consistent with previous works by mezgebo et al 2013 and bane 2005 results show that the initial bid values have negative effect on a yes response to the wtp question and significant at 5 level this explains the fact that higher initial bid values lead to lower number of yes responses to the initial bid values this is intuitive and in line with the law of demand that postulates ceteris paribus a negative relationship between price and quantity demanded farmers participation in off farm activity is found to have an adverse effect on the probability of a household willingness to pay farm households involved in off farm activities are less likely to show their willingness to pay for the wlts this apparently counterintutive result may be explained by either that off farm income is too small to finance investment in wlts or the households who engage in off farm activities are landless poor or irrigated farming is no longer their preferred activity due to high return alternate off farm businesses given that 39 of the respondents reported that they engage in daily labour works as a means for additional income in the survey area off farm activities appear to be carried out by relatively poor and landless households size of farmland has a negative effect significant at 5 level on the probability of accepting the initial bid prices of the wlts table 6 a possible reason could be that households with large land holdings have more options to diversify their rain fed crops it may also be the case that households with large land holdings tend to engage largescale irrigation systems such as gravity based irrigation as shown by gebregziabher et al 2013 similar findings have demonstrated the relative efficiency of agricultural inputs by farmers with smaller land holdings compared to larger ones ricker gilbert et al 2009 balana et al 2011a 2011b woodhouse et al 2017 the probability of the household willingness to pay for the technologies increase by 19 2 with credit access suggesting that access to credit increases farmers willingness to pay limited access to credit has been found the major constraints to adoption of agricultural technology such as pumps nakawuka et al 2017 de fraiture and giordano 2014 show that 80 smallholders used own saving to acquire irrigation equipment this may imply a low access to credit by smallholders however it should be noted that credit constraints need not to be entirely associated with supply side factors demand side factors such as risk averse behavior and lack of access to information could also affect smallholders access to credit balana and oyeyemi 2020 4 2 2 bivariate probit model results we estimated three bivariate probit models for each of the water lifting technologies motorized pump rope and washer and pulley and the estimation results are reported in tables 7a c in each of the tables column 1 presents the coefficients to pooled sample wtp estimate for the technologies in response to the change of the initial and follow up bid prices columns 2 and 3 respectively present the corresponding estimates for intervention and control household groups in column 1 of the three tables the results show that the initial and second bid prices have the expected signs and statistically significant mostly at 5 level of significance assuming higher initial and second bid prices lead to lower probability of accepting the bid prices the initial and the follow up bids have a negative and significant effect in determining farmers stated wtp the effects of the initial bid price for pulley technology in both intervention and control groups columns 2 and 3 table 7c and the that of the second bid price for rope and washer technology in the control group column 3 table 7b on farmer s willingness to pay are statistically insignificant though negative for rope and washer pump technology we observe differentiated effects of the initial and follow bid prices on wtp of the intervention and control groups table 7b however we did not observe differential effects of the bid values on farmers wtp for the motorized pumps in both the intervention and control groups the effects are negative and statistically significant for both groups columns 1 and 2 table 7a this may imply that there is no selection bias and both the intervention and control groups had similar experience and prior knowledge and information on these agricultural water lifting technologies the coefficients of the bid prices were used to compute the mean wtp table 8 the mean wtp of the pooled sample the intervention and the control groups are computed for each of the three water lifting technologies results show that the intervention group are more willing to pay for motorized pump and rope and washer technologies but the control group are willing to pay a higher price for the pulley technology this is perhaps because farmers who benefited from the intervention scheme gained more experience and knowledge and have better access to technologies via credit sales and hence would be willing to pay for the more efficient and costly technologies e g motorized pumps compared to those who were not included in the program farmers who do not have access to credit scheme would tend to pay more for the pulley technology which is relatively cheaper but less efficient besides double bounded questions farmers were also asked an open ended question on the maximum amount they are willing to pay for the three technologies the mean wtps from the open ended elicitation approach are generally lower than the one obtained from double bounded method possible explanation for this could be that when asked an open ended question farmers may believe that the technology is to be provided at the discount rate through the government so that they tend to state lower values for the technologies similar behavioral anticipations were reported by mezgebo et al 2013 while aggregating mean wtp to derive total wtp estimates mitchell and carson 1989 indicate that before computing total wtp one has to be careful on population choice bias sampling frame sample non response bias and sample selection biases to have valid aggregation of benefits use of random sampling method in sample selection in person interview and exclusion of protest zero bidders minimize the occurrence of such biases and hence valid estimation of aggregate willingness to pay taking the above cautions into account we derived the aggregate willingness to pay values for the three technologies by extrapolating the preference of the sampled farmers and the mean wtp column 5 and the last column in table 8 consistent with that of the mean wtp values for the three technologies the aggregate wtp values obtained from the open ended questions are lower than that obtained from the double bounded method 5 discussions and policy implications smallholder farmers in developing countries are constrained by lack of access to agricultural technologies such as improved seeds fertilizer and irrigation which led to low productivity and persistent food insecurity minten and barret 2008 collier and dercon 2014 several factors such as market imperfections high cost of the technologies and lack of access to credit may contribute to low adoption of agricultural technologies balana and oyeyemi 2020 particularly with growing population pressure on natural resources and changing climate intensification and boosting productivity through adoption of improved technologies such as small scale irrigation is vital for poverty reduction food and nutrition security and income to smallholder farmers rosegrant et al 2009 balana et al 2020 agriculture development related literature emphasize the promotion of small scale irrigation technologies as a key strategy towards improving low yielding smallholder farming systems and food security in sub sahara africa barron et al 2008 burney and naylor 2012 increasing smallholders agricultural productivity through irrigation technologies is recognized as one of the most effective ways to fight poverty and reduce farmers vulnerability to climate change burney and naylor 2012 in two recent case studies in northern ghana balana et al 2019 and balana et al 2020 show that access to irrigation technologies enable smallholder farmers produce high value crops and help promote crop diversification and multiple cropping in a year which significantly increase returns to land and labour and reduce risk small scale irrigation technology could enhance a dry season off peak production activity thus provide additional employment opportunities and income for smallholder farmers to meet their cash demands balana et al 2020 however despite increased emphasis on irrigation technology and its potential for agricultural development its adoption has been lagging among smallholders in ssa for instance only about 5 of the irrigation potential is utilized in ethiopia gebregziabher 2012 and less than 2 of the total cultivatable area is irrigated in ghana namara et al 2011 one could logically ask as to why the adoption rates of irrigation technologies are so low by smallholders despite the immense economic benefits of irrigated farming one of the key findings in the present study indicates lack of access to credit as a key impediment to adoption of irrigation wlts the results show that farmers participated in the ilssi project intervention where financing for the purchase of wlts was facilitated via the project have adopted the technologies as well as were willing to pay more for the technologies as compared to the control groups previous studies reported similar findings where lack of access to low cost irrigation technologies as one of the main barriers to the adoption of small sacle irrigation technologies getacher et al 2013 gebergziabher et al 2014 nonvide 2017 merrey and lefore 2018 studies in ghana ethiopia and zambia showed that more than 80 of small scale irrigators did not access to credit to purchase irrigation equipment and hence relied on their own savings de fraiture and giordano 2014 similarly gebergziabher et al 2014 showed that smallholder farmers do not have access to formal credit and usually use their own financing mechanisms to purchase irrigation water pumps as part of the ilssi project several early consultation meetings with ilssi stakeholders showed that a fundamental barrier to adoption ssi technologies at household level was related to farmers low capacity to finance the initial investment costs for the ssi technology ilssi 2016 a baseline household survey conducted under the ilssi project in 2015 in one of the study locations in amhara region showed that even those farmers whose loan application was accepted have received only about 50 of the amount needed to invest in wlts i e an average loan amount received was etb 4370 against the etb 8560 amount required to purchase typical 5 0 horse power hp diesel powered motor pump and the loan was acquired at an annual interest rate of 17 5 depending on the make or model and hp the market prices of motorized pumps can go up etb 15 000 during the study time thus it can be argued that supply side credit constraints appear to be a major factor affecting adoption of small scale irrigation technologies however besides supply side credit constraints discussed above credit constraints to smallholders may manifest itself in demand side too balana and oyeyemi 2020 boucher et al 2009 for example smallholders may voluntarily withdraw from the credit market due to fear of risk of losing collateral even if they have the collateral wealth needed to qualify for a loan boucher et al 2009 similarly high transactions costs for instance bureaucratic administrative processes information asymmetry financial illiteracy of borrowers lengthy loan application and processing and transport costs due to far distance may generate negative incentives to loan application even if bankers would approve their application for instance in ethiopia the ilssi project worked with local microfinance institutions and facilitated provision of water lifting technologies on credit to increase uptake of the wlts however loan diversion for non agricultural purposes lack of loan management skills and low repayment of loans hampered this initiative ilssi 2016 thus improving financial literacy of smallholders and risk mitigation interventions could provide a remedy for demand side credit constraints and potentially improve smallholders credit access and irrigation technology adoption another key finding in this study is the relationship between endowments i e land holdings and access to credit one could intuitively assume that as a fixed asset land can serve as a collateral and hence would enhance credit access and higher willingness to pay for irrigation technologies our model results however show that land size and willingness to pay are negatively related and statistically significant in other words the less the size of landholdings the higher the wtp for irrigation technology this is an interesting finding in the sense that by investing in irrigation technologies smallholders with small land holdings can increase productivity and farm income this is consistent with previous findings elsewhere in africa in a case study on smallholders willingness to adopt catchment management measures in kapingazi river catchment in central kenya balana et al 2011a 2011b found a negative relationship between land size owned and the likelihood of program adoption in a study on farmers preference to soil management measures in southern ethiopia tarfasa et al 2018 showed that small landholding was not a major constraint for the adoption of soil management measures a study balana et al 2020 in floodplain zones of northern ghana indicates that most of the crops grown under supplementary irrigation are produced by smallholder women farmers on small plots of land 0 1 ha thus small land holdings do not seem to deter adoption of agricultural technologies provided that appropriate mechanisms such as access to finance cost effective technologies and risk mitigation options are in place farmers with small holdings are more likely to adopt productivity enhancing agricultural technologies these empirical findings confirm boserup s theory which postulates that an increasing agricultural intensification and higher productivity as population pressure on land increases boserup 1965 demont et al 2007 6 conclusion and recommendations the agricultural sector in ethiopia is dominated by a rain fed system and characterized predominantly by low productivity smallholders subsistence farming increasing smallholders access to agricultural water and small scale irrigation technologies is a promising strategy to enhance productivity and improve rural livelihoods particularly with a growing population pressure on natural resources and changing climate intensification and boosting productivity through small scale irrigation technology can play a key role in poverty reduction food and nutrition security and livelihoods however currently smallholder farmers are constrained from accessing irrigation technologies several factors such as market imperfections risk averse behaviour knowledge gaps and lack of access to financing options contribute to low adoption rates of these technologies understanding the factors affecting farmers preference for different small scale irrigation technologies and their potential willingness to pay for the technologies will provide decision support evidence for increasing access and up scaling of such technologies among smallholders this study is designed to understand farmers adoption constraints and estimate their willingness to pay for the three commonly available irrigation water lifting technologies fuel powered motor pumps rope and washer and pulley technology using empirical data from ethiopia primary data were collected using a double bounded contingent valuation elicitation method we estimated the likelihood of adoption of these technologies i e proxied by their willingness to pay and the factors affecting farmers wtp for the technologies using probit and bivariate probit models results indicate that high bid prices land size and age of the household head are likely to reduce households wtp for the wlts on the other hand access to credit household income number of livestock and household size have positive effects on the probability of households adopting and their willingness to pay for technologies the prices efficiency operational costs and labour requirement vary among the three wlts considered in the study overall farmers are willing to pay adopt more efficient and less labor intensive wlts such as fuel powered motorized pumps even at higher investment cost based on the findings we propose four policy recommendations 1 resource poor smallholders are constrained by lack of financing options to adopt or use more capital intensive but efficient wlts such as fuel powered motorized pumps thus they choose to invest in a less efficient low cost and labor intensive wlts such as pully and hence operate below the production possibility frontier improving smallholders access to alternative options e g via in cash credit on credit sales or irrigation equipment leasing arrangements could help ease this constraint and allow farmers to acquire more efficient and less laborious wlts and enhance wide scale adoption 2 smallholders face supply side constraints to credit this was demonstrated by the differences observed in the willingness to pay or adopt for wlts by the ilssi beneficiary farmers against the control group policy on improving smallholders access to finance should be considered as an important intervention to enhance adoption of small scale irrigation technologies 3 smallholders also face demand side constraints to credit lack of prudent financial management financial literacy loan diversion gaps in technical know how and low repayment should be addressed by targeted interventions on strengthening smallholder s capacity and entrepreneurship skill so that they can be self motivated to engage in irrigated farming as a profitable undertaking 4 our finding show that farmers with small landholdings are willing to pay more for small scale irrigation technologies as compared to farmers with large landholdings the livelihoods of the former group of farmers mainly depend on the meagre endowment they possess increasing the productivity of land using yield enhancing technologies particularly multiple cropping per year via small scale irrigation is key to improve their livelihoods thus farmers with relatively small landholdings require targeted policy interventions to improving their access to cost effective irrigation technologies other complementary inputs and their technical capacity this study focused on the demand side of the wlts with limited number of technologies and smaller sample size building on the findings of this study we suggest future studies covering more locations larger sample size and broader set of small scale irrigation technologies future studies need also to focus on uncovering the supply side factors such as the supply chain availability of affordable technologies to smallholders information asymmetry and transaction costs besides the economics and livelihoods effects there is also lack of evidence on the environmental effects of scaling up of small scale irrigation in a changing climatic scenario an integrated assessment is

10132,increasing agricultural productivity through irrigation technologies is recognized as an effective way to improve smallholders livelihoods and food security in developing countries however most smallholder farmers do not have access to irrigation technologies using a double bounded contingent valuation survey data from smallholders in ethiopia and probit and bivariate probit models this paper analyzes smallholder farmers demand for agricultural water lifting technologies wlts and the factors affecting the demand for these technologies assessment of farmers preferences among three water lifting technologies available in local markets motorized pump rope and washer and pulley show that farmers prefer motorized pumps to pulley or rope and washer technologies use of motorized pumps is more efficient and save labour than pulley or rope and washer technologies however results show that smallholders are constrained by inadequate access to financing options to adopt more efficient and labour saving water lifting technology and hence operate below the production possibility frontier enhanced access to finance could help ease this constraint and allow smallholders to acquire more efficient irrigation technologies enhance adoption and improve productivity with a growing population pressure and land fragmentation in rural ethiopia the livelihoods of smallholders depend mainly on the meagre land endowment they possess increasing the productivity of land using yield enhancing technologies particularly multiple cropping per year via small scale irrigation is key to improve their livelihoods targeted interventions are thus warranted to mitigate the key adoption constraints such as improving access to credit and technical know how of smallholders keywords adoption small scale irrigation demand ethiopia smallholder farmers water lifting technologies willingness to pay 1 introduction studies in sub saharan africa ssa and other developing countries show a positive impact of irrigation in agricultural productivity and poverty reduction ayele 2011 etissa et al 2014 desilva et al 2014 woodhouse et al 2017 xie et al 2018 wiggins and lankford 2019 irrigation increases agricultural production through protecting crops against risks of uneven unreliable and insufficient rainfall or by enabling production of high value crops in a dry season and multiple cropping burney and naylor 2012 balana et al 2020 irrigation creates additional employment and helps smooth seasonal shortfalls in food supply and encourage the production of crops that contribute towards diverse and nutritious diet it could also benefit the urban poor by keeping food prices low despite growing demand for food girma and awulachew 2007 ethiopia which is referred to as the water tower of africa has an estimated ground water potential of 2 6 6 5 billion m3 12 river basins with an estimated mean annual flow volume of 122 billion m3 and 11 freshwater lakes awulachew et al 2007 the country also comprises of an estimated cultivable land area between 30 and 70 mha awulachew et al 2010 despite this potential the country s agriculture is highly dependent on rain fed agricultural system where rainfall is erratic and often insufficient only 15 mha of land is under cultivation of which only about 640 000 ha are irrigated according to gebregziabher 2012 the country has used 5 of its water resources to irrigate only 5 of its irrigation potential which implies underutilization of agricultural water resources one of the potential solutions in addressing agricultural water management problem in ethiopia could be the promotion of affordable small scale water lifting technologies wlts for irrigation such as motorized water pumps pulley and rope and washer pumps such technologies could increase smallholder farmers access to agricultural water during dry seasons that allow farmers to practice multiple cropping in a year by providing supplemental irrigation access to agricultural water also cushions failure of the main wet season crops from dry spells in rain fed agriculture system fox and rockstrom 2000 2003 however most smallholder farmers in sub saharan african countries lack access to irrigation technologies burney and naylor 2012 acheampong et al 2018 several factors such as high cost of the technologies lack of access to financing options lack of technical know how limited access to productive resources land and water sources or lack of market access may constrain adoption of irrigation technologies some studies claim that high prices of the technologies and operating costs are the key factors for the low demand for wlts nunes and boatwright 2004 it may also be the case that the availability or supply of the technologies are limited ngigi 2003 lack of knowledge and technical knowhow could also be confounding factors in limiting the adoption of the wlts despite the claims on the potential factors that could impede smallholder s demand for wlts there is lack of empirical evidence for the low demand for the productivity enhancing wlts among smallholders in ethiopia understanding smallholder s preference and demand for wlts and the factors influencing their demand for these technologies are key for designing sustainable and effective agricultural water management interventions and policies targeting smallholders however there exist knowledge gaps on the farmers preference for specific types of wlts and their demand for these technologies only few studies examined the factors affecting smallholders preference to certain water lifting technologies these studies focused on estimating the economic value of irrigation water and provision and improvement of potable water supply for urban people in ethiopia gebregziabher 2012 2014 but did not attempt to estimate the willingness to pay of smallholder farmers for the small scale irrigation technologies and the factors for low adoption of these technologies the purpose of this study is thus to fill the knowledge gap on smallholders effective demand for wlts identify the key factors that influence their demand and adoption of these technologies in ethiopia and other developing countries with similar conditions this could guide targeted interventions on agricultural water management technologies to benefit smallholder farmers a contingent valuation approach was applied to elicit the preference and demand for the set of selected agricultural water lifting technologies primary data were collected from 208 smallholders farm households sampled from four selected weredas districts in rural ethiopia a probit modelling approach was used to estimate the willingness to pay for the technologies key factors influencing smallholder s demand adoption constraints and policy implications for scaling up of small scale irrigation technologies are discussed the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a concise review on the application of contingent valuation approach on market goods data analytical approach and empirical model specifications are presented in section 3 section 4 presents the findings and followed by discussions in section 5 the last section concludes the paper with key policy implications 2 application of contingent valuation to market goods contingent valuation cv is a survey based approach used to elicit individual s preference for the non market values of environmental and other non market goods or values of marketed goods based on the attributes of the good hoevenagel 1994 stewart and khan 2006 mattia et al 2010 arcadio et al 2012 even if there is a market for the good it may not reflect the true value or willingness to pay wtp of individuals mattia et al 2010 two assumptions that underly the cv method are 1 people have well ordered but hidden preferences for goods and 2 people are capable of transforming these preferences into monetary values hoevenagel 1994 balana et al 2012 for value elicitation the cv method presents respondents with a description of the attributes of the good under consideration or scenario of proposed changes and asks the respondents to express in monetary terms their maximum willingness to pay for the good or the minimum compensation they would be willing to accept for a certain negative change balana et al 2012 estimation of wtp for marketed goods using a cv method is relevant in testing its validity and assessing how the real market operates perman et al 2003 in particular in rural economies of developing countries where market imperfections appears to be a norm the validation test gives an insight in deviation between prices of market good such as irrigation equipment or technologies elicited through cv survey and the existing market price of the technologies so that one can examine the attributes or factors that account for the deviation more broadly the wtp measure for market goods ensures the knowledge about consumers valuations and choice behavior which helps marketers and companies in setting optimal pricing decisions and predictions of individual consumer choice the study by arcadio et al 2012 presents the importance of wtp in valuation of both marketed and non marketed goods wtp estimates can be used to assess the price elasticity of demand and for modeling demand functions it also helps apply market segment based on demand functions similar studies indicate that the importance of wtp study for marketed goods in measuring product brands setting price for new products predicting future demand and price for the existing and novel goods jesdapipat 2009 renee 2012 despite these advantages there is limited application of wtp estimation approach for the marketed goods notable exceptions are andersson et al 2008 for safety car philip 2012 for mobile application arcadio et al 2012 for organic apples and kabyanga et al 2018 for biogas digester regarding water lifting technologies for irrigation use in ssa few studies applied variants of wtp estimation fentahun et al 2020 used cv method to elicit irrigators willingness to pay for soil moisture tools in south eastern africa using discrete choice experiment method houessionon et al 2017 estimated farmers preferences and their demand for agricultural water management technologies using primary data collected from 300 smallholder farmers sampled from two municipalities in burkina faso zongo et al 2015 analyze farmers practices and willingness to adopt supplementary irrigation on rain fed crops in the long dry spell areas of burkina faso nakanyike 2014 estimates farmers demand for virus free sweet potato vines in uganda from randomly selected 200 households using a contingent valuation method the same study also estimates the market potential for the sweet potato vines and shows vine production was an economically viable enterprise and vine producers should target commercial sweet potato farmers ulimwengu and sanyal 2011 analyze farmers demand for agricultural advisory services in uganda using a contingent valuation method falola et al 2013 examine uptake of agricultural insurance by cocoa farmers in nigeria and their willingness to pay the study also identifies several factors such as education and extension services that influence the up take and willingness to pay using a propensity matching technique zeweld et al 2015 investigated the adoption constraints and impacts of small scale irrigation in northern ethiopia gebergziabher et al 2014 analyze the economic factors influencing adoption of motor pumps in ethiopia their findings show a positive correlation between the factors influencing adoption of motorized pumps and other water lifting technologies socio economic and demographic factors and spatial variability in biophysical characteristics such as rainfall topography soil and water conservation influence farmers decision to adopt water lifting technologies the preceding literature indicate the relevance and empirical application of stated preference methods particularly contingent valuation method to assess preferences and estimate the demand for irrigation and other agricultural technologies in developing countries 3 materials and methods 3 1 conceptual model the conceptual model guiding our empirical analysis of the willingness to pay data is based on the random utility theory rut train 2003 the key idea in this theory is that an individual s or household s resource allocation decision e g purchase of goods is driven by the underlying utility maximization behavior the rut is based on the rationality assumption of economic agents in that a decision maker i in making a choice from j alternatives selects the alternative that maximizes his her utility and the utility assigned to each alternative depends on the attributes of the alternative a j and the characteristics of the decision maker x i according to this theory the utility assigned to alternative j by individual i is not known by certainty by external analyst i e some parts the utility are unobservable ɛ from the perspective of the researcher thus in the context of contingent valuation the analyst can only make probability statements about the respondent s yes or no answer to the suggested scenario following haab and mcconnell 2002 the yes and no responses can be specified using an indirect utility function for each respondent assuming that a decision maker gains utility from the use of the water lifting technology as compared to the status quo let u ij u i i i x i a j ε ij is an indirect utility function for the i th respondent from use of the j th technology j 1 if the individual uses the technology for irrigation or j 0 otherwise i e the status quo i i is the i th respondent s income x i is a vector of household characteristics and a j attributes of a given water lifting technology chosen by the individual and ε ij is a random component based on this model respondent i answers yes i e technology j 1 for a required payment of ρ i bid value if the utility of adopting the chosen water lifting technology u i 1 net of the required payment exceeds utility of the status quo u i 0 eq 1 1 u i 1 i i ρ i x i a j ε i 1 u i 0 i i x i ε i 0 however a researcher does not know the random part of preference and can only make probability statement about a yes or no response the probability that the respondent says yes is the probability the individual gets better off in the proposed change so that u i1 u i0 for individual i this probability is given by p y i 1 as in eq 2 2 p y i 1 p u i 1 i i ρ i x i a j ε i 1 u i 0 i i x i ε i 0 where y i 1 if the respondent says yes to a given bid value and y i 0 otherwise denoting the utility difference between adopting and not adopting the j th technology by a latent variable y i an individual chooses the j th technology if the utility difference y i exceeds the bid value ρ i and we observe y i 1 adoption and y i 0 otherwise eq 3 3 y i z i β ε i y i 1 if y i ρ i y i 0 if y i ρ i where the z i vector contains both technology attributes and the characteristics of decision makers from eq 3 and assuming a standard normal distribution of the error term the probability that an individual farmer is willing to pay for a given irrigation technology can be estimated using a probit model eq 4 4 p y i 1 p y i ρ i p z i β ε i ρ i p ε i z i β ρ i f z i β where y i z i β ε i and f z i β is the cumulative distribution function of ε i 3 2 description of the study areas this study is based on data gathered from four districts weredas in ethiopia adami tulu district in oromia regional state dangla and bahir dar zuria districts in amhara regional state and lemo district in southern regional state fig 1 from 2013 to 2018 the feed the future innovation laboratory for small scale irrigation ilssi project promoted use of small scale irrigation ssi technologies in these districts in ethiopia ilssi is a usaid funded project implemented in ghana ethiopia mali and tanzania http ilssi tamu edu and aims at providing technical knowledge base and local capacity for sustainable smallholder irrigation development the project has conducted extensive field studies on socioeconomics of water lifting technologies assessment of water availability for irrigation and the scalability of various small scale technologies however the project does not provide the technologies to farmers for free rather facilitates the partnership between farmers or farmers associations and microfinance institutions in the respective study sites in terms of agro ecology all the four study areas fall under the mid altitude woina dega 1 1 woina dega is an agro ecological zone classification in ethiopia covering altitudes between 1500 and 2300 m a s l and thus share similar biophysical characteristics average elevation temperature and rainfall adami tulu is in the ethiopian rift valley characterized by drought prone agro ecology tropical rainy woina dega agro climatic zone with elevation between 1560 and 2300 m a s l meter above sea level and an annual average rainfall of around 750 mm ministry of water resources 2008 the general climate in dangla is moist sub tropical woina dega characterized by moderate temperature and enough kiremt 2 2 kiremt is the amharic word and represents the main rainy season july september in ethiopia rainfall assefa 2015 the average annual rainfall in the area is about 1600 mm bahir dar zuria is mainly characterized by a plain area with an average elevation of 1848 m a s l its annual rainfall ranges between 1200 and 1800 mm and characterized by a woina dega agro ecology most part of lemo falls under moist woina dega agroecological zone dubale et al 2015 the rainfall in lemo varies between 950 and 1200 mm annually and most of the area is between 2100 and 2500 m a s l the farming system in all the four study districts is characterized by a mixed crop livestock production with rain fed production dominates though some districts e g bahir dar zuria and adami tulu practice limited irrigated farming maize finger millet teff rice and chickpeas are the major annual crops grown in bahir dar zuria and dangla in lemo district farmers grow some trees crops such as coffee and enset ensete ventricosum musaceae as well as annual crops mainly wheat maize and fava beans the main crops grown in adami tulu include maize haricot beans and teff the ilssi project intervention on small scale water lifting technologies aimed at improving smallholders access to these technologies for growing high value vegetables in dry season and improve livelihoods and nutrition the four study areas generally exhibit peri urban population settlements with good connections to roads and market centers adami tulu is a district town with over 10 000 population and located at about 168 km south of addis ababa with a population of over 26 000 dangla is a town situated along the addis ababa bahir dar road at 77 km south west of bahir dar the capita of amhara region bahir dar zuria is a peri urban district around the city of bahir dar lemo is a district surrounds the town of hosaena in southern ethiopia a major settlement of over 76 000 population overall the study areas have good access to markets to sell their agricultural produce 3 3 data and survey design data were collected from a survey of smallholder farmers sampled from the four ilssi intervention sites in ethiopia as decribed above a contingent valuation survey with close ended elicitation format and open ended follow up questions were employed the questionnaire includes demographic economic market access and valuation questions the questionnaire was pre tested and revised based on feedbacks before final administration of the survey survey was administered in a face to face interview through trained enumerators conversant of local languages and field experience of the study areas relevant secondary data were obtained from the districts agriculture offices central statistics agency and the international water management institute a multi stage sampling technique was employed the four districts were already selected by the ilssi project for piloting small scale irrigation intervention based on the information from the district agriculture offices five kebeles 3 3 kebele is the lowest administrative unit in ethiopia which were identified as intensive users of small scale irrigation technologies were selected finally a random sampling technique was used to select 208 sample farm households the sample size was determined using the minimum sample size formulae of fowler 2013 and then adjusted to the target population following cochran 1977 the sample was divided into two groups a group of respondents who participated in the ilssi project interventions treated group and another group which did not participate control group ilssi intervention i e treatment assignment was made to a randomly selected smallholders in the study locations prior to the cv survey an open ended reconnaissance survey was conducted with selected farmers where they were asked to state the prices they would be willing to pay for three different wlts fuel powered motorized pumps rope and washer and pulley this helps reduce the effect of start up price bias which is often encountered in double bounded dichotomous choice survey farmers participated in the reconnaissance survey were excluded from the final survey market prices of the three wlts were obtained from local markets based on the reconnaissance survey and information on market prices five starting prices were determined for each technology table 1 and sampled households were randomly assigned into five equal groups each sampled farmer was then provided with a random initial price for the selected technology the farmers who accepted the first price were given a second value which is higher than the first price on the other hand if the interviewee responded no to the initial price in a follow up question he she is provided with a lower value than the initial price this process results in four possible outcomes 1 both answers yes 2 both answers no 3 a yes followed by a no and 4 a no followed by a yes the responses elicited through the survey are summarized in table 1 the no no responses i e the unwillingness to pay to both the initial and follow up prices could be an indication of either a genuine lack of demand for the technology or a protest response even though a farmer may have positive demand for the technology though there is no established criteria to differentiate such responses between genuine and protest boyle 2003 suggested certain follow up questions to identify such responses inclusion of protest responses i e zero wpt values in the estimation of mean and aggregate wtp leads to biased estimates thus following alebel et al 2009 mezgebo et al 2013 we excluded protest responses from the aggregate willingness to pay estimation 3 4 empirical model cameron and quiggin 1994 assume separate distributional parameters for the underlying latent willingness to pay in their empirical double bounded binary models i e one for the initial bid value and another for the follow up value based on this assumption the two latent willingness to pay values for the respondent wtp i 1 y 1 and wtp i 2 y 2 can be described by the bivariate probit model as in eq 5 greene 2003 5 y 1 x 1 β 1 ε 1 y 2 x 2 β 2 ε 2 the error terms in eq 5 are assumed to be jointly normally distributed with zero means and variances δ 1 2 and δ 1 2 correlation coefficient ρ β 1 and β 2 are coefficients for the first and second equations and x 1 and x 2 are explanatory variables the choice of explanatory variables in the empirical model table 2 is based on the theory of demand mas colell et al 1995 random utility theory train 2003 and literature arcadio et al 2012 balana et al 2012 gebergziabher et al 2014 nonvide 2017 following hanemann 1991 the probabilities of the four possible outcomes in the double bounded dichotomous value elicitation format can be expressed by a set of equations eq 6 6 p yes yes p ρ u y i g ρ u θ p yes no p ρ i y i ρ u g ρ u θ g ρ i θ p no yes p ρ l y i ρ i g ρ i θ g ρ l θ p no no p ρ l y i 1 g ρ l θ where ρ u is the upper value followed by a yes no response situation ρ l is a lower value followed by a no yes response and g ρ i θ g ρ u θ and g ρ l θ denote the cumulative probability distributions for the initial upper and lower follow up values respectively from eq 6 the log likelihood function for the i th respondent can be specified as in eq 7 7 ln l θ d i yy ln g ρ u θ d i yn ln g ρ u θ g ρ i θ d i ny ln g ρ i θ g ρ l θ d i nn ln 1 g ρ l θ where d i yy 1 for a yes yes d i yn 1 for a yes no d i ny 1 for a no yes and d i nn 1 for a no no responses and zero otherwise for each combination bivariate probit model estimation deliver two parameter estimates from the two rounds of bidding process however the first round parameters are generally used in the computation of mean wtp this is because the second equation parameters are likely to contain more noise in terms of anchoring bias where the respondent is assumed to take the clue from the first bid while forming his response for the second question table 2 presents the description of the variables used in the empirical model 4 results 4 1 descriptive analysis table 3 summarizes the descriptive statistics of the variables included in the model about 82 of surveyed households are male headed 40 do have prior experience or knowledge about the water lifting technologies and 44 responded that they engage in off farm activities about 76 5 of the sample households expressed their willingness to pay for the wlts however there is statistically significant difference in wtp among male headed and female headed households household size varies from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 18 persons respondents age ranges from 18 to 76 years with an average age of 43 6 it is expected that the younger farmers are willing to pay more for the wlts assuming that older farmers have more farming experience and tend to stick to their traditional farming systems the education level of respondents ranges from illiterate to secondary school graduate with an average of 3 83 years school schooling about 69 2 of respondents attended formal education while the rest are illiterate average annual income farm and off farm income for those willing and unwilling respondents show a statistically significant difference at 1 level the average farmland holding is about 1 42 ha with min 0 2 ha and max 6 ha farmers on average have 0 81 ha of irrigable land the difference in average land holding among willing and unwilling households is statistically insignificant in terms of livestock ownership willing households on average own more livestock than the unwilling households which is also statistically significant about 52 of the respondents reported that they have access to credit access to credit for the purpose of this study refers to either the ability of farmers to borrow money from the financial institutions or the possibility of farmers to own the technologies in credit term farm households can acquire technologies either in cash payment or in credit buying on credit increases farmers ability to pay for the technologies in the study areas all the surveyed households prefer either annual or semi annual credit term as a payment option for the technologies to immediate cash payment table 4 reports mean comparisons of household characteristics to test presence of selection bias and no significant difference was found among the intervention and control group 4 2 econometric results 4 2 1 probit model results table 5 reports results of the probit model estimation a wald test was used to test the joint significance of the explanatory variables the overall significance of the model was good eight of the variables in the model show the a priori expected sign and more than half of them were found to be significant in affecting wtp decision table 5 these include household size age of the household head farmland size initial bid values household income off farm activity access to credit and livestock ownership family size household income livestock ownership initial bid values and access to credit affect wtp positively but off farm activity farmland size and age of the head affect wtp decision negatively table 6 presents the marginal effects i e the partial derivatives of explanatory variables with respect to discrete yes or no responses to the initial bid price ρ i computed following age has a negative and statistically significant effect on the farmers decision to pay for the wlts the marginal effect shows that other things being equal a one year increase in the age of the head decreases the probability of accepting the initial bid price by 1 3 indicating that younger farmers are willing to pay more for the technologies compared to older farmers the result is consistent with the findings of mezgebo et al 2013 and alebel et al 2009 holding other things constant a unit increase in the family size of the farm household increases the probability of accepting the first proposed bid by about 4 2 this may be due to the economic contribution of additional family members in the household assuming that additional labor force could increase the efficiency of technology utilization the study by alhassan et al 2013 also found similar results households income has a positive and statistically significant at 1 level of significance effect on accepting the initial bid price which is consistent with economic theory assuming water lifting technologies are normal goods the result is also consistent with previous works by mezgebo et al 2013 and bane 2005 results show that the initial bid values have negative effect on a yes response to the wtp question and significant at 5 level this explains the fact that higher initial bid values lead to lower number of yes responses to the initial bid values this is intuitive and in line with the law of demand that postulates ceteris paribus a negative relationship between price and quantity demanded farmers participation in off farm activity is found to have an adverse effect on the probability of a household willingness to pay farm households involved in off farm activities are less likely to show their willingness to pay for the wlts this apparently counterintutive result may be explained by either that off farm income is too small to finance investment in wlts or the households who engage in off farm activities are landless poor or irrigated farming is no longer their preferred activity due to high return alternate off farm businesses given that 39 of the respondents reported that they engage in daily labour works as a means for additional income in the survey area off farm activities appear to be carried out by relatively poor and landless households size of farmland has a negative effect significant at 5 level on the probability of accepting the initial bid prices of the wlts table 6 a possible reason could be that households with large land holdings have more options to diversify their rain fed crops it may also be the case that households with large land holdings tend to engage largescale irrigation systems such as gravity based irrigation as shown by gebregziabher et al 2013 similar findings have demonstrated the relative efficiency of agricultural inputs by farmers with smaller land holdings compared to larger ones ricker gilbert et al 2009 balana et al 2011a 2011b woodhouse et al 2017 the probability of the household willingness to pay for the technologies increase by 19 2 with credit access suggesting that access to credit increases farmers willingness to pay limited access to credit has been found the major constraints to adoption of agricultural technology such as pumps nakawuka et al 2017 de fraiture and giordano 2014 show that 80 smallholders used own saving to acquire irrigation equipment this may imply a low access to credit by smallholders however it should be noted that credit constraints need not to be entirely associated with supply side factors demand side factors such as risk averse behavior and lack of access to information could also affect smallholders access to credit balana and oyeyemi 2020 4 2 2 bivariate probit model results we estimated three bivariate probit models for each of the water lifting technologies motorized pump rope and washer and pulley and the estimation results are reported in tables 7a c in each of the tables column 1 presents the coefficients to pooled sample wtp estimate for the technologies in response to the change of the initial and follow up bid prices columns 2 and 3 respectively present the corresponding estimates for intervention and control household groups in column 1 of the three tables the results show that the initial and second bid prices have the expected signs and statistically significant mostly at 5 level of significance assuming higher initial and second bid prices lead to lower probability of accepting the bid prices the initial and the follow up bids have a negative and significant effect in determining farmers stated wtp the effects of the initial bid price for pulley technology in both intervention and control groups columns 2 and 3 table 7c and the that of the second bid price for rope and washer technology in the control group column 3 table 7b on farmer s willingness to pay are statistically insignificant though negative for rope and washer pump technology we observe differentiated effects of the initial and follow bid prices on wtp of the intervention and control groups table 7b however we did not observe differential effects of the bid values on farmers wtp for the motorized pumps in both the intervention and control groups the effects are negative and statistically significant for both groups columns 1 and 2 table 7a this may imply that there is no selection bias and both the intervention and control groups had similar experience and prior knowledge and information on these agricultural water lifting technologies the coefficients of the bid prices were used to compute the mean wtp table 8 the mean wtp of the pooled sample the intervention and the control groups are computed for each of the three water lifting technologies results show that the intervention group are more willing to pay for motorized pump and rope and washer technologies but the control group are willing to pay a higher price for the pulley technology this is perhaps because farmers who benefited from the intervention scheme gained more experience and knowledge and have better access to technologies via credit sales and hence would be willing to pay for the more efficient and costly technologies e g motorized pumps compared to those who were not included in the program farmers who do not have access to credit scheme would tend to pay more for the pulley technology which is relatively cheaper but less efficient besides double bounded questions farmers were also asked an open ended question on the maximum amount they are willing to pay for the three technologies the mean wtps from the open ended elicitation approach are generally lower than the one obtained from double bounded method possible explanation for this could be that when asked an open ended question farmers may believe that the technology is to be provided at the discount rate through the government so that they tend to state lower values for the technologies similar behavioral anticipations were reported by mezgebo et al 2013 while aggregating mean wtp to derive total wtp estimates mitchell and carson 1989 indicate that before computing total wtp one has to be careful on population choice bias sampling frame sample non response bias and sample selection biases to have valid aggregation of benefits use of random sampling method in sample selection in person interview and exclusion of protest zero bidders minimize the occurrence of such biases and hence valid estimation of aggregate willingness to pay taking the above cautions into account we derived the aggregate willingness to pay values for the three technologies by extrapolating the preference of the sampled farmers and the mean wtp column 5 and the last column in table 8 consistent with that of the mean wtp values for the three technologies the aggregate wtp values obtained from the open ended questions are lower than that obtained from the double bounded method 5 discussions and policy implications smallholder farmers in developing countries are constrained by lack of access to agricultural technologies such as improved seeds fertilizer and irrigation which led to low productivity and persistent food insecurity minten and barret 2008 collier and dercon 2014 several factors such as market imperfections high cost of the technologies and lack of access to credit may contribute to low adoption of agricultural technologies balana and oyeyemi 2020 particularly with growing population pressure on natural resources and changing climate intensification and boosting productivity through adoption of improved technologies such as small scale irrigation is vital for poverty reduction food and nutrition security and income to smallholder farmers rosegrant et al 2009 balana et al 2020 agriculture development related literature emphasize the promotion of small scale irrigation technologies as a key strategy towards improving low yielding smallholder farming systems and food security in sub sahara africa barron et al 2008 burney and naylor 2012 increasing smallholders agricultural productivity through irrigation technologies is recognized as one of the most effective ways to fight poverty and reduce farmers vulnerability to climate change burney and naylor 2012 in two recent case studies in northern ghana balana et al 2019 and balana et al 2020 show that access to irrigation technologies enable smallholder farmers produce high value crops and help promote crop diversification and multiple cropping in a year which significantly increase returns to land and labour and reduce risk small scale irrigation technology could enhance a dry season off peak production activity thus provide additional employment opportunities and income for smallholder farmers to meet their cash demands balana et al 2020 however despite increased emphasis on irrigation technology and its potential for agricultural development its adoption has been lagging among smallholders in ssa for instance only about 5 of the irrigation potential is utilized in ethiopia gebregziabher 2012 and less than 2 of the total cultivatable area is irrigated in ghana namara et al 2011 one could logically ask as to why the adoption rates of irrigation technologies are so low by smallholders despite the immense economic benefits of irrigated farming one of the key findings in the present study indicates lack of access to credit as a key impediment to adoption of irrigation wlts the results show that farmers participated in the ilssi project intervention where financing for the purchase of wlts was facilitated via the project have adopted the technologies as well as were willing to pay more for the technologies as compared to the control groups previous studies reported similar findings where lack of access to low cost irrigation technologies as one of the main barriers to the adoption of small sacle irrigation technologies getacher et al 2013 gebergziabher et al 2014 nonvide 2017 merrey and lefore 2018 studies in ghana ethiopia and zambia showed that more than 80 of small scale irrigators did not access to credit to purchase irrigation equipment and hence relied on their own savings de fraiture and giordano 2014 similarly gebergziabher et al 2014 showed that smallholder farmers do not have access to formal credit and usually use their own financing mechanisms to purchase irrigation water pumps as part of the ilssi project several early consultation meetings with ilssi stakeholders showed that a fundamental barrier to adoption ssi technologies at household level was related to farmers low capacity to finance the initial investment costs for the ssi technology ilssi 2016 a baseline household survey conducted under the ilssi project in 2015 in one of the study locations in amhara region showed that even those farmers whose loan application was accepted have received only about 50 of the amount needed to invest in wlts i e an average loan amount received was etb 4370 against the etb 8560 amount required to purchase typical 5 0 horse power hp diesel powered motor pump and the loan was acquired at an annual interest rate of 17 5 depending on the make or model and hp the market prices of motorized pumps can go up etb 15 000 during the study time thus it can be argued that supply side credit constraints appear to be a major factor affecting adoption of small scale irrigation technologies however besides supply side credit constraints discussed above credit constraints to smallholders may manifest itself in demand side too balana and oyeyemi 2020 boucher et al 2009 for example smallholders may voluntarily withdraw from the credit market due to fear of risk of losing collateral even if they have the collateral wealth needed to qualify for a loan boucher et al 2009 similarly high transactions costs for instance bureaucratic administrative processes information asymmetry financial illiteracy of borrowers lengthy loan application and processing and transport costs due to far distance may generate negative incentives to loan application even if bankers would approve their application for instance in ethiopia the ilssi project worked with local microfinance institutions and facilitated provision of water lifting technologies on credit to increase uptake of the wlts however loan diversion for non agricultural purposes lack of loan management skills and low repayment of loans hampered this initiative ilssi 2016 thus improving financial literacy of smallholders and risk mitigation interventions could provide a remedy for demand side credit constraints and potentially improve smallholders credit access and irrigation technology adoption another key finding in this study is the relationship between endowments i e land holdings and access to credit one could intuitively assume that as a fixed asset land can serve as a collateral and hence would enhance credit access and higher willingness to pay for irrigation technologies our model results however show that land size and willingness to pay are negatively related and statistically significant in other words the less the size of landholdings the higher the wtp for irrigation technology this is an interesting finding in the sense that by investing in irrigation technologies smallholders with small land holdings can increase productivity and farm income this is consistent with previous findings elsewhere in africa in a case study on smallholders willingness to adopt catchment management measures in kapingazi river catchment in central kenya balana et al 2011a 2011b found a negative relationship between land size owned and the likelihood of program adoption in a study on farmers preference to soil management measures in southern ethiopia tarfasa et al 2018 showed that small landholding was not a major constraint for the adoption of soil management measures a study balana et al 2020 in floodplain zones of northern ghana indicates that most of the crops grown under supplementary irrigation are produced by smallholder women farmers on small plots of land 0 1 ha thus small land holdings do not seem to deter adoption of agricultural technologies provided that appropriate mechanisms such as access to finance cost effective technologies and risk mitigation options are in place farmers with small holdings are more likely to adopt productivity enhancing agricultural technologies these empirical findings confirm boserup s theory which postulates that an increasing agricultural intensification and higher productivity as population pressure on land increases boserup 1965 demont et al 2007 6 conclusion and recommendations the agricultural sector in ethiopia is dominated by a rain fed system and characterized predominantly by low productivity smallholders subsistence farming increasing smallholders access to agricultural water and small scale irrigation technologies is a promising strategy to enhance productivity and improve rural livelihoods particularly with a growing population pressure on natural resources and changing climate intensification and boosting productivity through small scale irrigation technology can play a key role in poverty reduction food and nutrition security and livelihoods however currently smallholder farmers are constrained from accessing irrigation technologies several factors such as market imperfections risk averse behaviour knowledge gaps and lack of access to financing options contribute to low adoption rates of these technologies understanding the factors affecting farmers preference for different small scale irrigation technologies and their potential willingness to pay for the technologies will provide decision support evidence for increasing access and up scaling of such technologies among smallholders this study is designed to understand farmers adoption constraints and estimate their willingness to pay for the three commonly available irrigation water lifting technologies fuel powered motor pumps rope and washer and pulley technology using empirical data from ethiopia primary data were collected using a double bounded contingent valuation elicitation method we estimated the likelihood of adoption of these technologies i e proxied by their willingness to pay and the factors affecting farmers wtp for the technologies using probit and bivariate probit models results indicate that high bid prices land size and age of the household head are likely to reduce households wtp for the wlts on the other hand access to credit household income number of livestock and household size have positive effects on the probability of households adopting and their willingness to pay for technologies the prices efficiency operational costs and labour requirement vary among the three wlts considered in the study overall farmers are willing to pay adopt more efficient and less labor intensive wlts such as fuel powered motorized pumps even at higher investment cost based on the findings we propose four policy recommendations 1 resource poor smallholders are constrained by lack of financing options to adopt or use more capital intensive but efficient wlts such as fuel powered motorized pumps thus they choose to invest in a less efficient low cost and labor intensive wlts such as pully and hence operate below the production possibility frontier improving smallholders access to alternative options e g via in cash credit on credit sales or irrigation equipment leasing arrangements could help ease this constraint and allow farmers to acquire more efficient and less laborious wlts and enhance wide scale adoption 2 smallholders face supply side constraints to credit this was demonstrated by the differences observed in the willingness to pay or adopt for wlts by the ilssi beneficiary farmers against the control group policy on improving smallholders access to finance should be considered as an important intervention to enhance adoption of small scale irrigation technologies 3 smallholders also face demand side constraints to credit lack of prudent financial management financial literacy loan diversion gaps in technical know how and low repayment should be addressed by targeted interventions on strengthening smallholder s capacity and entrepreneurship skill so that they can be self motivated to engage in irrigated farming as a profitable undertaking 4 our finding show that farmers with small landholdings are willing to pay more for small scale irrigation technologies as compared to farmers with large landholdings the livelihoods of the former group of farmers mainly depend on the meagre endowment they possess increasing the productivity of land using yield enhancing technologies particularly multiple cropping per year via small scale irrigation is key to improve their livelihoods thus farmers with relatively small landholdings require targeted policy interventions to improving their access to cost effective irrigation technologies other complementary inputs and their technical capacity this study focused on the demand side of the wlts with limited number of technologies and smaller sample size building on the findings of this study we suggest future studies covering more locations larger sample size and broader set of small scale irrigation technologies future studies need also to focus on uncovering the supply side factors such as the supply chain availability of affordable technologies to smallholders information asymmetry and transaction costs besides the economics and livelihoods effects there is also lack of evidence on the environmental effects of scaling up of small scale irrigation in a changing climatic scenario an integrated assessment is

10133,potential evapotranspiration pet is an important consideration in the study of agricultural water management and climate change although a number of studies have already explored the effects of climate factors on changes in pet the quantitative effects of various driving factors needs to be further studied as most studies have not accounted for vegetation dynamics by characterizing changes in leaf area and stomatal resistance here we used the shuttleworth wallace s w model based on climate vegetation and energy factors to quantitatively analyze the effects of various driving factors at multiple spatial scales over the main grain producing area of china mgpac from 1982 to 2016 the s w model had a satisfactory performance because s w based standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei had a higher determination coefficient 0 33 vs 0 26 than penman monteith based spei for soil moisture standardized anomaly over mgpac mgpac had a mean annual pet of 926 20 mm and showed a marked increase of 3 844 mm yr 1 during the study period evergreen broadleaf forest and grassland had the highest and lowest annual average pet values 1535 65 mm and 633 67 mm respectively although climate factors could directly explain 79 42 of the pet increase over the mgpac vegetation dynamics were also identified to be a non negligible factor explaining the increase in pet directly explaining 18 91 of the pet trend specifically vegetation dynamics contributed to explaining 67 30 and 48 91 of the pet trend in the huang huai hai and loess plateau regions these findings are closely related to changes in the temperature and leaf area index lai which notably increased by 0 04 c yr 1 p 0 01 and 0 0038 m2 m 2 yr 1 p 0 01 respectively regarding single drivers variation in temperature and lai significantly increased the pet by 3 582 mm yr 1 p 0 01 and 1 127 mm yr 1 p 0 01 across the mgpac respectively this study can provide a new insight to improve agricultural production and management in china keywords potential evapotranspiration vegetation dynamics shuttleworth wallace model driving factors effect main grain production area of china 1 introduction potential evapotranspiration pet characterizes the maximum evaporation volume over a specified region with an unlimited water supply and can be interpreted as the capacity of the atmosphere to remove water from the surface through evaporation and plant transpiration allen et al 1998 li et al 2017 b j liu et al 2018 m l liu et al 2018 pet plays a key role in agricultural water management the hydrological cycle and climatology zhang et al 2013 thus characterizing spatiotemporal trends in pet is critically important for managing the utilization of water resources and irrigation equipment as well as estimating crop growth liu et al 2013 sun et al 2016 over the past several decades more than 50 methods have been proposed and used to calculate pet luo et al 2017 these methods can generally be classified into temperature decisive radiation decisive energy decisive and synthesis types based on the different types of input data however most of these methods only use climate variables to calculate pet without considering spatial heterogeneity of the underlying surface dunn and mackay 1995 yuan et al 2008 in fact the underlying surface such as the distribution of vegetation can greatly impact canopy resistance and soil surface resistance which can significantly affect pet h zhao et al 2016 j zhao et al 2016 research relating to the calculation of pet has received much recent attention bao et al 2019 brauman et al 2012 peng et al 2019 verstraeten et al 2008 yuan and quiring 2014 zhang et al 2011 h zhao et al 2016 j zhao et al 2016 although the penman monteith p m function has been widely used to estimate pet by introducing a canopy resistance term that reflects the leaf stomata effect on pet estimation the big leaf assumption in p m considers the crop canopy either as a single uniform canopy or a bare soil surface stannard 1993 realistically the application of the big leaf hypothesis is limited to large regions where the distribution of vegetation is never closed zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2006 to circumvent these shortcomings when pet is only estimated using climate variables two source models have been proposed to more accurately estimate pet mo et al 2004 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 xu et al 2012 yuan et al 2008 yuan and quiring 2014 zhou et al 2006 these models can effectively describe changes in soil surface evaporation and vegetation transpiration along with the vegetation type distribution and growth stage by applying a resistance network in theory the structures of the two source models are more rigorous and thus superior to methods that estimate pet only using climatic variables or big leaf assumptions with large scale applications stannard 1993 the shuttleworth wallace s w model is a two source pet estimation model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 it has been extensively used to estimate pet for different climatic characteristics and has shown satisfactory performance anapalli et al 2019 chen et al 2020 fuentes peñailillo et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 li et al 2015 2016 zhou et al 2006 however these applications of two source pet estimation models are primarily focused on the basin or regional scale within a single climate zone the efficacy of its application at the national scale across multiple climatic zones and biome types has not yet been characterized in addition to the evolution of pet estimation methods the effects of various driving factors on pet estimation have also been extensively studied for example wang et al 2017 indicated that the effects of climatic factors can vary considerably among different regions and periods mcvicar and roderick 2012 reviewed global wind speed trends to identify the contributions of aerodynamic components to changes in pet sun et al 2016 analyzed shifts in pet over southwest china from 1961 to 2012 and separated key climatic factors based on simulation experiments of different scenarios with the p m method guo et al 2017 assessed the sensitivity of climatic factors to changes in pet in different australian climatic zones using sobol s first order sensitivity indices and identified temperature to be the most important variable for pet wang et al 2019 assessed the impacts of meteorological factors on pet by calculating dimensionless sensitivity coefficients and contribution rates for china from 1982 to 2015 althoff et al 2019 used a statistical correlation method to identify the impacts of climatic factors on the computations of reference evapotranspiration at sum of hourly and daily time steps across brazilian territory however these extensive studies have had one major shortcoming they have only estimated the contribution of climate variables without considering the impact of vegetation in addition to climate warming vegetation greenness in the northern hemisphere has been observed by remote sensing technology buermann et al 2003 nemani et al 2003 recent studies have shown that the response of vegetation to climate change can contribute to changes in evapotranspiration and these effects may vary by location and vegetation type b j liu et al 2018 m l liu et al 2018 niu et al 2019 moreover these vegetation feedbacks can interact with the leaf area index lai in the context of co2 fertilization effects which can increase stomatal resistance and decrease transpiration b j liu et al 2018 m l liu et al 2018 swann et al 2016 therefore uncertainty stemming from neglecting vegetation dynamics can affect the robustness of pet estimates here we use an s w model to estimate pet from 1982 to 2016 on a national scale over the main grain producing areas mgpac of china which is a wide area with various climatic zones and biome types the main objectives of this study were the following 1 to validate the accuracy of the estimated pet over the mgpac 2 to explore spatiotemporal variation in the trend in pet at different spatial scales over the mgpac and 3 to identify the effects of different driving factors on variation in pet while considering vegetation dynamics the results of this study provides a reference for the arrangement of agricultural production and management in china 2 methods and data 2 1 study area china is the third largest country in the world in terms of area and includes complex climatic zones the mgpac fig 1 is distributed in central and east china from 97 5 to 135 0 e and from 18 2 to 53 5 n and is characterized by a temperate monsoon climate subtropical monsoon climate and tropical monsoon climate from north to south to analyze the impact of the local climatic zone on agriculture production mgpac was subdivided into seven spatial regions based on the agricultural regionalization proposed by liu et al 2019 and xu et al 2002 fig 1 1 the northeast china region necr where spring wheat summer corn and rice are grown and which has a long low temperature period and flat topography in central and southern areas 2 the inner mongolia and the great wall region mgr which is a semiarid region with corn and pasture and has a similar climate to the necr because of its similar latitude distribution 3 the huang huai hai region hhhr which has a semi humid climate and wide plains consisting of winter wheat and summer corn which are often used as cultivated land 4 the loess plateau region lpr which has coarse cereals and winter wheat and is located in the semiarid region 5 the middle lower yangtze river plain region yrr supports the growth of double cropping rice and rape has hilly and flat land and is located in a humid region with substantial hydrothermal resources 6 the southwest china region swcr which has rape and rice is characterized by broad mountains and hills and has abundant water resources and radiation energy and 7 the south china region scr which supports the growth of double or three cropping rice and is characterized by hills high temperatures and perennial precipitation 2 2 meteorological data monthly meteorological data were obtained from the data assimilation and modeling center institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences by merging data from several stations from the china meteorological administration based on the global land data assimilation system the global energy and water cycle experiment surface radiation budget princeton reanalysis data and tropical rainfall measuring mission precipitation data these data included monthly average temperature t k specific humidity sh kg kg 1 wind speed at 2 m above the surface ws m s 1 atmospheric pressure ap pa downward shortwave radiation sr w m 2 and monthly cumulative precipitation mm the spatial resolution of this dataset was 0 1 and the dataset can be downloaded at the following link http data tpdc ac cn zh hans to date these data have been validated chen et al 2011 yang et al 2010 and have been shown to perform well for studying climate change cong et al 2017 wang et al 2019 wang and wu 2019 h zhao et al 2016 j zhao et al 2016 to further explore the uncertainties of this meteorological dataset this study calculated the pet over china using the p m function and climatic datasets the results were then compared with the pet results published by liu et al 2012 which calculated pet over china based on p m and climatic datasets by interpolating daily meteorological observations of 653 national stations from 1982 to 2007 fig 2 fig 2 show that pet values simulated by p m method are higher than those simulated by two source method this phenomenon is consistent with the previous studies zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2009 because the same model derived by different forcing datasets can generate uncertainties in simulated results gu et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 the obtained bias value of 3 59 in the scatter diagram indicates that the climatic dataset in this study was suitable for pet calculations for china 2 3 lai instead of deriving spatial and temporal variation in lai from the composite noaa avhrr ndvi using the sib2 method in the original s w model the global land surface satellite glass observations of historical plant lai were directly inputted into the s w model this lai dataset was developed based on time series moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr reflectance data using general regression neural networks xiao et al 2016 the glass lai dataset had spatiotemporal resolutions of 0 05 and 8 days and spanned the period from 1981 to 2017 after validation the temporal smoothness and accuracy of glass lai were found to be superior to the modis lai product mod15 and the first version of the geoland2 geov1 lai product xiao et al 2016 to match monthly mean meteorological data in the s w model the 8 day lai data in one month were averaged and were resampled into a 0 1 0 1 grid based on bilinear interpolation this dataset can be freely obtained from the national earth system science data center in china http www geodata cn

ignored the impact of co2 concentration on the calculation of the stomatal resistance of the plant canopy zhou et al 2006 this study describes the effect of co2 by linearly adjusting the minimum canopy resistance of vegetation based on the results in ainsworth and long 2005 b j liu et al 2018 and m l liu et al 2018 specifically it can be described by the following equation eq 1 1 f c o 2 1

evaporation amsterdam model gleam version 3 3a and were indirectly used to validate the reasonability of the estimated pet this dataset was calculated using a multi layer running water balance through the vertical soil profile and was corrected by microwave observations of surface soil moisture this dataset can be downloaded from the following link https www gleam eu datasets this dataset was first resampled to a 0 1 0 1 grid based on bilinear interpolation and was then converted to soil moisture standardized anomaly sma guo et al 2018 details on the calculation of sma are presented in the supplementary material monthly self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi data with 0 5 0 5 at period of 1982 2016 provided by the climatic research unit was used to validate the pet

biosphere program igbp and can be downloaded from http westdc westgis ac cn data this igbp data consisted of 17 types of data at a 1 km resolution and was produced by the united states geological survey usgs loveland et al 2000 this land cover data has been used to simulate evapotranspiration net primary productivity and soil moisture in long time series gang et al 2015 2019 niu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 zhou et al 2009 compared with the modis land cover data in 2000 this igbp data overally has slightly higher accuracy over china ran et al 2010 in this study it has been aggregated into 0 1 cells based on the method proposed by zhou et al 2006 2 7 assignment of simulated experiments to determine the mechanisms underlying patterns of pet in the mgpac of china seven simulated experiments were designed to explore the influences of climate vegetation and energy table 1 the vegetation effects refer to the impacts of lai and co2 concentration the climate effects involve temperature specific humidity atmospheric pressure and wind speed the energy effect refers to shortwave radiation to identify the relative importance of the effects of climate vegetation and energy on the pet trend specific experiments were performed as follows experiment 1 three factors changed dynamically during the entire study period to estimate the combined effects experiments 2 4 one of three factors alternately used the initial constant or the mean during the study period while the other two factors used the dynamic values over the simulated period the difference between experiment 1 and experiments 2 4 indicated the direct effects of each relevant factor on the pattern in pet and the interactive effects of every relevant factor with the other two factors experiments 5 7 one of three factors was alternately varied and the other two factors were kept constant the aim of these three experiments was to separate interactive and direct effects and capture the direct vegetation effect climate effect and energy effect in addition the trends in regional mean and pixel pet were calculated based on the linear least squares regression of pet against year to compare the relative importance of each climatic factor with lai co2 and energy each climatic factor lai and co2 were used as factors following the same method as in experiments 5 7 2 8 shuttleworth wallace model based on

the spei drought index are presented in the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 trend analysis of the driving factors fig 3 shows the annual trend of the driving factors over mgpac from 1982 to 2016 specifically mgpac experienced notable climatic warming and annual temperature increased by 0 04 c yr 1 p 0 01 from 1982 to 2016 the atmospheric pressure showed an obvious positive trend with an annual increase of 1 08 pa yr 1 p 0 01 in addition other climatic factors including atmospheric pressure wind speed and humidity did not significantly change between 1982 and 2016 shortwave radiation showed a slightly decreasing trend since 1982 with a decrease of 0 0018 w m 2 yr 1 p 0 25 the surface of china has turned increasingly green since 1982 based on the long term satellite vegetation indexes piao et al 2015 fig 3 shows that the forcing lai over mgpac in this study showed a pronounced annual increase of 0 0038 m2 m 2 p 0 01 from 1982 to 2016 similar to lai the co2 concentration over mgpac also showed a pronounced annual increase of 1 77 ppm p 0 01 from 1982 to 2016 table 2 and fig 4 show changes in sub regions and spatial trends over mgpac from 1982 to 2016 respectively the statistical results and spatial distribution show that temperature exhibited a clear positive trend with a slope greater than 0 02 c yr 1 p 0 01 over most sub regions in the mgpac except for the necr the slope exceeded 0 04 c yr 1 p 0 01 in the mgr lpr and swcr ws had significant negative trends for the necr and hhhr and a positive trend for the lpr swcr and scr sh did not show a noticeable pattern over the subregions of the mgpac except for the necr compared with climatic factors a slight negative trend in sr was observed in the northern portion of the mgpac and a slightly positive trend in sr was observed in the southern portion of the mgpac based on lai most of the mgpac became noticeably greener except for a slight decrease in the north of the mgr and necp 3 2 validation of pet estimated by the s w model pan evaporation data based on long records and high densities of measurement sites can be used to determine the non limited water evapotranspiration pet needs to be multiplied by a pan coefficient and a crop coefficient for it to be estimated however the calibration of these conversion coefficients is location specific because of differences in sitting and weather conditions furthermore bias exists because of the scale between pan evapotranspiration observations and grid values calculated by pet equations thus validating pet at a large scale via pan evapotranspiration is difficult in this study the drought index spei at 12 months was indirectly used to validate the pet calculated by p m and s w because of the high correlation between soil moisture and the drought index the sma calculated by soil moisture provided by gleam was used to compare the s w based spei 12 and p m based spei 12 additionally the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi provided by the climatic research unit cru was also used to compare the above two speis the results shown in fig 5 a indicate that the s w based spei 12 had a higher r2 0 33 vs 0 26 and slope 0 55 vs 0 45 than the p m based spei 12 for sma over the entire study area the same results were also observed for scpdsi the r2 0 59 vs 0 51 and slope 0 34 vs 0 29 for the s w based spei 12 were higher relative to the r2 and slope of the p m based spei 12 thus pet estimated by the s w model was more accurate than pet calculated by the p m model to further validate the s w based pet we used different pet products with a long time series such as modis pet from 2000 to 2014 mu et al 2011 cru pet from 1982 to 2016 harris et al 2013 and terroclimate tc pet from 1982 to 2016 abatzoglou et al 2018 that have been extracted over mgapc in addition p m based pet was also used as a reference based on the input data in this study fig 5 c shows that modis had a significantly larger pet exceeding 1400 mm and s w based pet products differed slightly from other pet products which emphasizes that the s w based pet was reasonable and suitable for pet analysis for the study area 3 3 spatial pattern of pet and trends fig 6 a shows the spatial pattern of the average annual pet between 1982 and 2016 pet generally exhibited an increasing trend from north to south which is consistent with the temperature distribution the scr had the highest pet value fig 6b in addition to high temperatures and abundant precipitation extensive forest cover is also an important factor that can significantly enhance transpiration in contrast the lowest pet value was observed in necr and mcr because of the effect of low temperature terrestrial ecosystems of the mgpac had an average annual pet of 926 20 mm and a standard deviation of 49 53 mm from 1982 to 2016 the highest pet was observed in the scr mean standard deviation 1425 13 81 35 mm followed by the yrr 1157 13 75 64 mm hhh 1037 68 68 54 mm and swcr 1026 78 65 47 mm the lowest pet was observed in the necr 704 35 39 75 mm and mgr 641 91 44 34 mm the distribution of pet is not only related to the climatic region but also to biomes fig 6c evergreen needleleaf forest enf and evergreen broadleaf forest ebf have much higher annual average pet compared with other biomes 1256 79 mm and 1535 65 mm deciduous broadleaf forest dbf and mixed forest mf with annual average pet of 1004 48 mm and 796 40 mm are the forest types with the next highest pet deciduous needleleaf forest dnf has the smallest pet 532 50 mm of forest ecosystems which stems from its location in regions with low temperatures among non forest biomes the annual mean pet of cropland cro is 1025 86 mm followed by shrubland shr with an annual mean of 947 36 mm grasslands gra have the smallest annual average pet 633 67 mm because of their low vegetation cover figs 7 and 8 display the trends in annual pet from 1982 to 2015 over the mgpac and seven sub regions when forcing factors are changed the pet values estimated by the all parameters scenario showed a clear positive trend the annual increase was 3 844 mm yr 1 p 0 01 over the mgpac in addition to the entire study area six sub regions except for necr also showed significantly increasing trends p 0 01 and the largest increasing rate for pet was observed in the lpr 6 03 mm yr 1 the annual increases of pet in the mgr hhhr yrr swcr and scr were 3 49 mm yr 1 4 35 mm yr 1 4 38 mm yr 1 5 15 mm yr 1 and 5 97 mm yr 1 respectively the direct effects of the driving factors on pet were explored based on experiments 5 7 for mgpac the direct contribution to the increase of pet under the only vegetation change scenario was 0 682 mm yr 1 p 0 01 which explained 18 91 of the pet trend under the all parameters scenario the only climate factor change directly contributed 3 053 mm yr 1 p 0 01 to the pet change and explained approximately 79 42 of the pet increase compared with climate and vegetation the direct contribution by the only radiation change had an insignificant effect on the increasing pet trend slope 0 042 and p 0 74 in general the climate forcing factors still played the most important roles in the increasing pet trend even after vegetation dynamics were considered figs 7 and 8 however vegetation dynamics had a non negligible effect on the increasing trend in pet especially in the hhhr and lpr where vegetation dynamics contributed 67 30 and 48 91 to the increasing trend in pet respectively the direct contributions by radiation change were still nearly zero which is consistent with the condition for the mgpac vegetation dynamics can reinforce the sensitivity of the vegetation to climate change and have an indirect effect on the pet trend climate change also has an indirect effect on the pet trend by enhancing the effect of vegetation fig 8 shows that the vegetation dynamics had a slightly larger effect 19 88 on the pet trend over the mgpac compared with the direct effect 18 91 moreover increased vegetation promotes the effect of climate change on the pet trend 81 17 more than the direct climate effect 79 42 among specific sub regions the indirect effect of vegetation dynamics and climate change on the pet trend generally exceeded the direct effects except for necr and scr regarding radiation the interactions with other forcing factors had negligible effects on the increased pet trend and are not shown in fig 8 fig 9 shows the spatial patterns of the responses of vegetation climate energy and all forcing factors to the pet trend from 1982 to 2016 the regions where vegetation promotes the pet fig 9a accounted for 53 13 of the pixels over mgpac and were primarily concentrated in the hhhr and lpr fig 9 b shows that climate drivers had a pronounced effect on increasing pet in most regions of the study area exceeding 85 but decreased pet in the cold necr the range of radiation sensitivity for the pet trend fig 9c was primarily concentrated between 1 and 1 across the entire study area and had a less pronounced effect on the pet trend compared with either vegetation or climate from 1982 to 2016 when all dynamic forcing factors were combined to estimate pet fig 9d approximately 87 71 of the area showed a positive pet trend and regions with a negative pet trend were exclusively located in the eastern portion of the necr 3 4 effects of single driving factors on long term trends to further distinguish the effect of single drivers on the pet trend the trends of every forcing factor were identified by alternately keeping every driver constant at its initial level while other factors were dynamically changed over the simulated period table 3 displays the rankings of the contribution of every driver over the mgpac domain for the entire mgpac the interaction of all drivers had a positive effect on pet variation in the t and lai significantly increased pet by 3 582 mm yr 1 and 1 127 mm yr 1 respectively while variation in co2 and sh decreased pet by 0 435 mm yr 1 and 0 653 mm yr 1 respectively co2 compensates for the effects of lai on the long term trends of pet specifically t significantly dominates the positive trend for pet over the southern mgpac with trends of 4 754 mm yr 1 in yrr 4 160 mm yr 1in scr and 4 592 mm yr 1 in scr the central regions follow these with trends of 3 146 mm yr 1 in the lpr and 2 929 mm yr 1 in the hhhr mgr had the smallest contribution 2 619 mm yr 1 except for necr lai also made a positive contribution to pet in the other six sub regions especially in hhhr with 3 325 mm yr 1 and lpr with 3 370 mm yr 1 compared with t and lai co2 ws sr ap and sh made smaller contributions to pet among these variables co2 made a negative contribution to pet for every sub region with a range of 0 362 mm yr 1 to 0 553 mm yr 1 ws generally made a negative contribution to pet in the northern mgpac and a positive contribution to pet in the southern mgpac the largest contribution was observed for scr with a value of 1 191 similar to co2 sh also negatively affected pet especially in necr with a contribution of 1 335 mm yr 1 sr only had a significant negative contribution in hhhr 0 863 mm yr 1 ap did not significantly change among subregions fig 10 a e displays the spatial patterns of the relative effects of seven single factors over mgpac at the pixel scale fig 10 a indicates that temperature had an overall positive effect on pet change except for small scattered patches that had negative effects strong trends in pet were present in the southwestern and southeastern portions of the mgpac with slopes exceeding 8 0 mm yr 1 sh had a negative effect on the pet trend with values lower than 0 6 mm yr 1 and significantly impacted nearly all portions of the necr fig 10b ws which had a contribution range from 0 6 1 0 mm yr 1 had effects on the necr southwest mgr and east yyr fig 10d except for hhhr the overall contribution of sr over mgpac was low with a trend ranging from 0 2 1 0 mm yr 1 fig 10e lai had an obvious positive effect with values greater than 2 0 mm yr 1 and had a strong effect in the hhhr and lpr and an insignificant effect in the southern portion of the mgpac fig 10f the magnitude of the effect for co2 was lower compared with the effects of other variables yet a slight effect of co2 was observed in the southwestern mgpac and the northern mgpac fig 11 shows the spatial pattern of the dominant factors for the long term trend of annual pet when absolute maximums at every pixel were selected t made the strongest contribution to controlling the long term trend in pet as it accounted for 70 09 of grid cells across the mgpac lai was the second most important factor and was primarily distributed in the lpr and hhhr where it accounted for 18 39 of the entire study area sh had negligible effects in the necr yrr and swcr the effects of ws were mainly restricted to the southern mgpac 3 5 trend in s w based spei 12 spei was calculated by standardizing the difference between monthly precipitation and pet fig 12 b shows that the spet trend across the mgpac had a significantly decreasing slope of 0 015 mm yr 1 p 0 015 suggesting that the drought had become increasingly serious the decreasing spei may be caused by an increase in precipitation or a decrease in pet based on the results presented in fig 12 a annual precipitation slightly increased over the mgpac at a rate of 1 23 mm yr 1 p 0 24 based on the pet trends shown in fig 7 it can therefore be deduced that the driver that results in serous drought over mgpac is pet increase although the entire mgpac shows an increased drought trend the spatial distribution of drought over mgpac was not even fig 12 c shows that the southwestern and northern mgpac the southwestern mgpac and the central region in the hhhr showed a strong pattern of increasing drought 4 discussion this study characterized the temporal and spatial changes in pet across the mgpac from 1982 to 2016 using the s w model the reasonability of the estimated pet over mgpac was indirectly validated by comparing spei with scpdsi and sma and directly validated by comparing various pet products 4 1 impacts of changes in several factors on variation in pet compared with vegetation and energy climate is the most important factor affecting changes in pet across the mpgac fig 7 furthermore the experiments designed in this study revealed that the most important climatic factors were t followed by sh ws and sr this result is consistent with the findings of wang et al 2019 who used the same data source with a similar timeframe and study region in addition to the negative effects of sh on pet this study showed that t ws and sr had positive effects on the pattern of pet which was inconsistent with the findings of wang et al 2019 but was consistent with the findings of other previous studies wang et al 2017 ye et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 in fact the change in pet was a synthesis process of single climatic factor variability the relative contribution of single climatic factors may differ between studies for a variety of reasons including different study methods regions periods and data sources wang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 in addition to the climatic factors vegetation was also identified to be an important factor affecting pet change lai not only influences the regional hydrological cycle but it also is the primary factor that controls variation in the components of evapotranspiration b j liu et al 2018 m l liu et al 2018 niu et al 2019 therefore lai was used to reflect the effect of vegetation in this study the mechanism underlying how lai affects evapotranspiration is complex on the one hand increased lai can promote evapotranspiration by expanding the surface area for canopy transpiration and interception evaporation s li et al 2018 x y li et al 2018 piao et al 2007 on the other hand increased lai decreases soil evaporation by preventing radiation energy from reaching the soil surface gu et al 2018 hungate et al 2002 therefore additional work is needed to clarify the effect of lai on the change in pet in addition to the increased vegetation area which was directly reflected by the increased lai the increased co2 concentrations can also affect vegetation dynamics through closure of the stomata to decrease the stomatal conductance of leaves which tends to reduce canopy conductance at a continental scale douville et al 2000 gedney et al 2006 sellers et al 1996 in light of this theory we simulated a 0 435 mm yr 1 effect of co2 on pet increase additionally the increased atmospheric co2 also had a co2 fertilization effect for increasing lai lian et al 2018 such an effect can expand the transpiration area of vegetation thus compensating for the impact of reduced canopy conductance stoy et al 2019 however this process is very complex and was not examined in this study this study showed that radiation only slightly affected changes in pet which presents certain contradictions with previous studies costa et al 2010 zeng et al 2014 this contradictory result may be explained by differences in the study period radiation over the mgpac showed an insignificant decreasing trend from 1982 to 2016 this phenomenon may be attributed to the intense development of industry over recent decades which has increased aerosol levels and decreased solar radiation mcvicar et al 2007 stanhill and cohen 2001 in addition skyscrapers are becoming more numerous in cities thus blocking the flow of wind which is not conducive to the diffusion of pollutants in the air 4 2 uncertainties the structure of the s w model is highly complex and requires a number of parameters to be derived the s w model represents an improvement over other climate based models for determining vegetation parameters based on land cover classification however these vegetation parameters in this study were determined by referencing the results of previous studies zhou et al 2006 and focused on studying small catchments or continents instead of making field measurements in the study area although this study obtained a reasonable spatial and temporal distribution of pet more accurate calculations would require considerable field measurements or calibrations in the study area the effect of increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations on stomata conductance was described by an empirical linear function which was used for all vegetation types without considering differences between biome types in fact this response curve needs to be further calibrated and measurements need to be taken at specific locations to reduce the uncertainty in the results alkama et al 2010 piao et al 2007 yan and dickinson 2014 4 3 potential impact of pet variability on agriculture pet variability can result in either positive or negative effects on the agricultural water supply and regional crop yield iizumi et al 2014 ray et al 2015 pet exhibited a clear increasing trend since the 1980s over the entire mgpac moreover the drought index showed the opposite trend generally the increased pet may have a major effect on the crop yield nevertheless crop yields have been high in most regions of china in these years because of improvements in agricultural practices e g irrigation level and seeds which can have a greater effect on crop yield compared with climatic factors wang et al 2017 however a sufficiently large pet increase in specific regions may have negative effects on the increase in crop yields generated by improvements in agricultural practices lobell et al 2011 wu et al 2016 indicated that increases in pet in the northern necr can enhance plant water presence and water requirements for agriculture production resulting in decreased crop yields 5 conclusions this study employed the s w two source model based on climate vegetation and energy factors to estimate the monthly pet over the mgpac for china from 1982 to 2016 the spei was indirectly used to validate the reasonability of the estimated pet by the s w model by comparing spei with scpdsi and sma validation data showed that the r2 of spei against scpdsi was 0 59 vs 0 51 and the r2 of spei vs smai was 0 33 these results imply that the pet estimated by s w was reliable moreover various pet products from other simulated models and remotely sensed algorithms also directly reinforce the reasonability of pet by s w the terrestrial ecosystems of mgpac had an average annual pet of 926 20 mm from 1982 to 2016 with an increasing rate of 3 844 mm yr 1 p 0 01 climate and vegetation had significantly positive trends p 0 01 over the 35 year period the energy factor did not show a clear pattern of change vegetation dynamics and climate factors explained 18 91 and 79 42 of the increase in pet respectively while the effect of energy change on pet increase was negligible moreover vegetation dynamics and climate factors had indirect effects on pet by making vegetation more sensitive to climate change and by promoting the effect of vegetation regarding single drivers variation in t and lai significantly increased pet by 3 582 mm yr 1 and 1 127 mm yr 1 across the mpgac respectively while variation in co2 and sh decreased pet by 0 435 mm yr 1 and 0 653 mm yr 1 respectively spei across the mgpac significantly decreased with a slope of 0 015 p 0 015 and annual precipitation showed a weak annual increase of 1 23 mm yr 1 p 0 24 across the mgpac pet increase was thus primarily responsible for increasing the frequency of drought in recent years over the mgpac across china crop yield was more affected by the improvement in agricultural practices compared with climate change in recent years however a sufficiently large

10133,potential evapotranspiration pet is an important consideration in the study of agricultural water management and climate change although a number of studies have already explored the effects of climate factors on changes in pet the quantitative effects of various driving factors needs to be further studied as most studies have not accounted for vegetation dynamics by characterizing changes in leaf area and stomatal resistance here we used the shuttleworth wallace s w model based on climate vegetation and energy factors to quantitatively analyze the effects of various driving factors at multiple spatial scales over the main grain producing area of china mgpac from 1982 to 2016 the s w model had a satisfactory performance because s w based standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei had a higher determination coefficient 0 33 vs 0 26 than penman monteith based spei for soil moisture standardized anomaly over mgpac mgpac had a mean annual pet of 926 20 mm and showed a marked increase of 3 844 mm yr 1 during the study period evergreen broadleaf forest and grassland had the highest and lowest annual average pet values 1535 65 mm and 633 67 mm respectively although climate factors could directly explain 79 42 of the pet increase over the mgpac vegetation dynamics were also identified to be a non negligible factor explaining the increase in pet directly explaining 18 91 of the pet trend specifically vegetation dynamics contributed to explaining 67 30 and 48 91 of the pet trend in the huang huai hai and loess plateau regions these findings are closely related to changes in the temperature and leaf area index lai which notably increased by 0 04 c yr 1 p 0 01 and 0 0038 m2 m 2 yr 1 p 0 01 respectively regarding single drivers variation in temperature and lai significantly increased the pet by 3 582 mm yr 1 p 0 01 and 1 127 mm yr 1 p 0 01 across the mgpac respectively this study can provide a new insight to improve agricultural production and management in china keywords potential evapotranspiration vegetation dynamics shuttleworth wallace model driving factors effect main grain production area of china 1 introduction potential evapotranspiration pet characterizes the maximum evaporation volume over a specified region with an unlimited water supply and can be interpreted as the capacity of the atmosphere to remove water from the surface through evaporation and plant transpiration allen et al 1998 li et al 2017 b j liu et al 2018 m l liu et al 2018 pet plays a key role in agricultural water management the hydrological cycle and climatology zhang et al 2013 thus characterizing spatiotemporal trends in pet is critically important for managing the utilization of water resources and irrigation equipment as well as estimating crop growth liu et al 2013 sun et al 2016 over the past several decades more than 50 methods have been proposed and used to calculate pet luo et al 2017 these methods can generally be classified into temperature decisive radiation decisive energy decisive and synthesis types based on the different types of input data however most of these methods only use climate variables to calculate pet without considering spatial heterogeneity of the underlying surface dunn and mackay 1995 yuan et al 2008 in fact the underlying surface such as the distribution of vegetation can greatly impact canopy resistance and soil surface resistance which can significantly affect pet h zhao et al 2016 j zhao et al 2016 research relating to the calculation of pet has received much recent attention bao et al 2019 brauman et al 2012 peng et al 2019 verstraeten et al 2008 yuan and quiring 2014 zhang et al 2011 h zhao et al 2016 j zhao et al 2016 although the penman monteith p m function has been widely used to estimate pet by introducing a canopy resistance term that reflects the leaf stomata effect on pet estimation the big leaf assumption in p m considers the crop canopy either as a single uniform canopy or a bare soil surface stannard 1993 realistically the application of the big leaf hypothesis is limited to large regions where the distribution of vegetation is never closed zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2006 to circumvent these shortcomings when pet is only estimated using climate variables two source models have been proposed to more accurately estimate pet mo et al 2004 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 xu et al 2012 yuan et al 2008 yuan and quiring 2014 zhou et al 2006 these models can effectively describe changes in soil surface evaporation and vegetation transpiration along with the vegetation type distribution and growth stage by applying a resistance network in theory the structures of the two source models are more rigorous and thus superior to methods that estimate pet only using climatic variables or big leaf assumptions with large scale applications stannard 1993 the shuttleworth wallace s w model is a two source pet estimation model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 it has been extensively used to estimate pet for different climatic characteristics and has shown satisfactory performance anapalli et al 2019 chen et al 2020 fuentes peñailillo et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 li et al 2015 2016 zhou et al 2006 however these applications of two source pet estimation models are primarily focused on the basin or regional scale within a single climate zone the efficacy of its application at the national scale across multiple climatic zones and biome types has not yet been characterized in addition to the evolution of pet estimation methods the effects of various driving factors on pet estimation have also been extensively studied for example wang et al 2017 indicated that the effects of climatic factors can vary considerably among different regions and periods mcvicar and roderick 2012 reviewed global wind speed trends to identify the contributions of aerodynamic components to changes in pet sun et al 2016 analyzed shifts in pet over southwest china from 1961 to 2012 and separated key climatic factors based on simulation experiments of different scenarios with the p m method guo et al 2017 assessed the sensitivity of climatic factors to changes in pet in different australian climatic zones using sobol s first order sensitivity indices and identified temperature to be the most important variable for pet wang et al 2019 assessed the impacts of meteorological factors on pet by calculating dimensionless sensitivity coefficients and contribution rates for china from 1982 to 2015 althoff et al 2019 used a statistical correlation method to identify the impacts of climatic factors on the computations of reference evapotranspiration at sum of hourly and daily time steps across brazilian territory however these extensive studies have had one major shortcoming they have only estimated the contribution of climate variables without considering the impact of vegetation in addition to climate warming vegetation greenness in the northern hemisphere has been observed by remote sensing technology buermann et al 2003 nemani et al 2003 recent studies have shown that the response of vegetation to climate change can contribute to changes in evapotranspiration and these effects may vary by location and vegetation type b j liu et al 2018 m l liu et al 2018 niu et al 2019 moreover these vegetation feedbacks can interact with the leaf area index lai in the context of co2 fertilization effects which can increase stomatal resistance and decrease transpiration b j liu et al 2018 m l liu et al 2018 swann et al 2016 therefore uncertainty stemming from neglecting vegetation dynamics can affect the robustness of pet estimates here we use an s w model to estimate pet from 1982 to 2016 on a national scale over the main grain producing areas mgpac of china which is a wide area with various climatic zones and biome types the main objectives of this study were the following 1 to validate the accuracy of the estimated pet over the mgpac 2 to explore spatiotemporal variation in the trend in pet at different spatial scales over the mgpac and 3 to identify the effects of different driving factors on variation in pet while considering vegetation dynamics the results of this study provides a reference for the arrangement of agricultural production and management in china 2 methods and data 2 1 study area china is the third largest country in the world in terms of area and includes complex climatic zones the mgpac fig 1 is distributed in central and east china from 97 5 to 135 0 e and from 18 2 to 53 5 n and is characterized by a temperate monsoon climate subtropical monsoon climate and tropical monsoon climate from north to south to analyze the impact of the local climatic zone on agriculture production mgpac was subdivided into seven spatial regions based on the agricultural regionalization proposed by liu et al 2019 and xu et al 2002 fig 1 1 the northeast china region necr where spring wheat summer corn and rice are grown and which has a long low temperature period and flat topography in central and southern areas 2 the inner mongolia and the great wall region mgr which is a semiarid region with corn and pasture and has a similar climate to the necr because of its similar latitude distribution 3 the huang huai hai region hhhr which has a semi humid climate and wide plains consisting of winter wheat and summer corn which are often used as cultivated land 4 the loess plateau region lpr which has coarse cereals and winter wheat and is located in the semiarid region 5 the middle lower yangtze river plain region yrr supports the growth of double cropping rice and rape has hilly and flat land and is located in a humid region with substantial hydrothermal resources 6 the southwest china region swcr which has rape and rice is characterized by broad mountains and hills and has abundant water resources and radiation energy and 7 the south china region scr which supports the growth of double or three cropping rice and is characterized by hills high temperatures and perennial precipitation 2 2 meteorological data monthly meteorological data were obtained from the data assimilation and modeling center institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences by merging data from several stations from the china meteorological administration based on the global land data assimilation system the global energy and water cycle experiment surface radiation budget princeton reanalysis data and tropical rainfall measuring mission precipitation data these data included monthly average temperature t k specific humidity sh kg kg 1 wind speed at 2 m above the surface ws m s 1 atmospheric pressure ap pa downward shortwave radiation sr w m 2 and monthly cumulative precipitation mm the spatial resolution of this dataset was 0 1 and the dataset can be downloaded at the following link http data tpdc ac cn zh hans to date these data have been validated chen et al 2011 yang et al 2010 and have been shown to perform well for studying climate change cong et al 2017 wang et al 2019 wang and wu 2019 h zhao et al 2016 j zhao et al 2016 to further explore the uncertainties of this meteorological dataset this study calculated the pet over china using the p m function and climatic datasets the results were then compared with the pet results published by liu et al 2012 which calculated pet over china based on p m and climatic datasets by interpolating daily meteorological observations of 653 national stations from 1982 to 2007 fig 2 fig 2 show that pet values simulated by p m method are higher than those simulated by two source method this phenomenon is consistent with the previous studies zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2009 because the same model derived by different forcing datasets can generate uncertainties in simulated results gu et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 the obtained bias value of 3 59 in the scatter diagram indicates that the climatic dataset in this study was suitable for pet calculations for china 2 3 lai instead of deriving spatial and temporal variation in lai from the composite noaa avhrr ndvi using the sib2 method in the original s w model the global land surface satellite glass observations of historical plant lai were directly inputted into the s w model this lai dataset was developed based on time series moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr reflectance data using general regression neural networks xiao et al 2016 the glass lai dataset had spatiotemporal resolutions of 0 05 and 8 days and spanned the period from 1981 to 2017 after validation the temporal smoothness and accuracy of glass lai were found to be superior to the modis lai product mod15 and the first version of the geoland2 geov1 lai product xiao et al 2016 to match monthly mean meteorological data in the s w model the 8 day lai data in one month were averaged and were resampled into a 0 1 0 1 grid based on bilinear interpolation this dataset can be freely obtained from the national earth system science data center in china http www geodata cn index html 2 4 co2 concentration data the atmospheric co2 concentration used in this study was obtained from the mauna loa observatory www esri noaa gov gmd ccgg trends mlo full the original s w model ignored the impact of co2 concentration on the calculation of the stomatal resistance of the plant canopy zhou et al 2006 this study describes the effect of co2 by linearly adjusting the minimum canopy resistance of vegetation based on the results in ainsworth and long 2005 b j liu et al 2018 and m l liu et al 2018 specifically it can be described by the following equation eq 1 1 f c o 2 1 013 1 35 0 001 c o 2 where co 2 is the atmospheric co2 concentration in ppm 2 5 pet validation data the 0 25 monthly root zone soil moisture data from 1982 to 2016 were obtained from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam version 3 3a and were indirectly used to validate the reasonability of the estimated pet this dataset was calculated using a multi layer running water balance through the vertical soil profile and was corrected by microwave observations of surface soil moisture this dataset can be downloaded from the following link https www gleam eu datasets this dataset was first resampled to a 0 1 0 1 grid based on bilinear interpolation and was then converted to soil moisture standardized anomaly sma guo et al 2018 details on the calculation of sma are presented in the supplementary material monthly self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi data with 0 5 0 5 at period of 1982 2016 provided by the climatic research unit was used to validate the pet estimates using the p m and s w approaches this dataset can be downloaded by the website at https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought this dataset was also resampled to a 0 1 0 1 grid based on bilinear interpolation details on the calculation of scpdsi are presented in van der schrier et al 2013 2 6 land cover data the land cover data were classified by the version 2 international geosphere biosphere program igbp and can be downloaded from http westdc westgis ac cn data this igbp data consisted of 17 types of data at a 1 km resolution and was produced by the united states geological survey usgs loveland et al 2000 this land cover data has been used to simulate evapotranspiration net primary productivity and soil moisture in long time series gang et al 2015 2019 niu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 zhou et al 2009 compared with the modis land cover data in 2000 this igbp data overally has slightly higher accuracy over china ran et al 2010 in this study it has been aggregated into 0 1 cells based on the method proposed by zhou et al 2006 2 7 assignment of simulated experiments to determine the mechanisms underlying patterns of pet in the mgpac of china seven simulated experiments were designed to explore the influences of climate vegetation and energy table 1 the vegetation effects refer to the impacts of lai and co2 concentration the climate effects involve temperature specific humidity atmospheric pressure and wind speed the energy effect refers to shortwave radiation to identify the relative importance of the effects of climate vegetation and energy on the pet trend specific experiments were performed as follows experiment 1 three factors changed dynamically during the entire study period to estimate the combined effects experiments 2 4 one of three factors alternately used the initial constant or the mean during the study period while the other two factors used the dynamic values over the simulated period the difference between experiment 1 and experiments 2 4 indicated the direct effects of each relevant factor on the pattern in pet and the interactive effects of every relevant factor with the other two factors experiments 5 7 one of three factors was alternately varied and the other two factors were kept constant the aim of these three experiments was to separate interactive and direct effects and capture the direct vegetation effect climate effect and energy effect in addition the trends in regional mean and pixel pet were calculated based on the linear least squares regression of pet against year to compare the relative importance of each climatic factor with lai co2 and energy each climatic factor lai and co2 were used as factors following the same method as in experiments 5 7 2 8 shuttleworth wallace model based on

the spei drought index are presented in the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 trend analysis of the driving factors fig 3 shows the annual trend of the driving factors over mgpac from 1982 to 2016 specifically mgpac experienced notable climatic warming and annual temperature increased by 0 04 c yr 1 p 0 01 from 1982 to 2016 the atmospheric pressure showed an obvious positive trend with an annual increase of 1 08 pa yr 1 p 0 01 in addition other climatic factors including atmospheric pressure wind speed and humidity did not significantly change between 1982 and 2016 shortwave radiation showed a slightly decreasing trend since 1982 with a decrease of 0 0018 w m 2 yr 1 p 0 25 the surface of china has turned increasingly green since 1982 based on the long term satellite vegetation indexes piao et al 2015 fig 3 shows that the forcing lai over mgpac in this study showed a pronounced annual increase of 0 0038 m2 m 2 p 0 01 from 1982 to 2016 similar to lai the co2 concentration over mgpac also showed a pronounced annual increase of 1 77 ppm p 0 01 from 1982 to 2016 table 2 and fig 4 show changes in sub regions and spatial trends over mgpac from 1982 to 2016 respectively the statistical results and spatial distribution show that temperature exhibited a clear positive trend with a slope greater than 0 02 c yr 1 p 0 01 over most sub regions in the mgpac except for the necr the slope exceeded 0 04 c yr 1 p 0 01 in the mgr lpr and swcr ws had significant negative trends for the necr and hhhr and a positive trend for the lpr swcr and scr sh did not show a noticeable pattern over the subregions of the mgpac except for the necr compared with climatic factors a slight negative trend in sr was observed in the northern portion of the mgpac and a slightly positive trend in sr was observed in the southern portion of the mgpac based on lai most of the mgpac became noticeably greener except for a slight decrease in the north of the mgr and necp 3 2 validation of pet estimated by the s w model pan evaporation data based on long records and high densities of measurement sites can be used to determine the non limited water evapotranspiration pet needs to be multiplied by a pan coefficient and a crop coefficient for it to be estimated however the calibration of these conversion coefficients is location specific because of differences in sitting and weather conditions furthermore bias exists because of the scale between pan evapotranspiration observations and grid values calculated by pet equations thus validating pet at a large scale via pan evapotranspiration is difficult in this study the drought index spei at 12 months was indirectly used to validate the pet calculated by p m and s w because of the high correlation between soil moisture and the drought index the sma calculated by soil moisture provided by gleam was used to compare the s w based spei 12 and p m based spei 12 additionally the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi provided by the climatic research unit cru was also used to compare the above two speis the results shown in fig 5 a indicate that the s w based spei 12 had a higher r2 0 33 vs 0 26 and slope 0 55 vs 0 45 than the p m based spei 12 for sma over the entire study area the same results were also observed for scpdsi the r2 0 59 vs 0 51 and slope 0 34 vs 0 29 for the s w based spei 12 were higher relative to the r2 and slope of the p m based spei 12 thus pet estimated by the s w model was more accurate than pet calculated by the p m model to further validate the s w based pet we used different pet products with a long time series such as modis pet from 2000 to 2014 mu et al 2011 cru pet from 1982 to 2016 harris et al 2013 and terroclimate tc pet from 1982 to 2016 abatzoglou et al 2018 that have been extracted over mgapc in addition p m based pet was also used as a reference based on the input data in this study fig 5 c shows that modis had a significantly larger pet exceeding 1400 mm and s w based pet products differed slightly from other pet products which emphasizes that the s w based pet was reasonable and suitable for pet analysis for the study area 3 3 spatial pattern of pet and trends fig 6 a shows the spatial pattern of the average annual pet between 1982 and 2016 pet generally exhibited an increasing trend from north to south which is consistent with the temperature distribution the scr had the highest pet value fig 6b in addition to high temperatures and abundant precipitation extensive forest cover is also an important factor that can significantly enhance transpiration in contrast the lowest pet value was observed in necr and mcr because of the effect of low temperature terrestrial ecosystems of the mgpac had an average annual pet of 926 20 mm and a standard deviation of 49 53 mm from 1982 to 2016 the highest pet was observed in the scr mean standard deviation 1425 13 81 35 mm followed by the yrr 1157 13 75 64 mm hhh 1037 68 68 54 mm and swcr 1026 78 65 47 mm the lowest pet was observed in the necr 704 35 39 75 mm and mgr 641 91 44 34 mm the distribution of pet is not only related to the climatic region but also to biomes fig 6c evergreen needleleaf forest enf and evergreen broadleaf forest ebf have much higher annual average pet compared with other biomes 1256 79 mm and 1535 65 mm deciduous broadleaf forest dbf and mixed forest mf with annual average pet of 1004 48 mm and 796 40 mm are the forest types with the next highest pet deciduous needleleaf forest dnf has the smallest pet 532 50 mm of forest ecosystems which stems from its location in regions with low temperatures among non forest biomes the annual mean pet of cropland cro is 1025 86 mm followed by shrubland shr with an annual mean of 947 36 mm grasslands gra have the smallest annual average pet 633 67 mm because of their low vegetation cover figs 7 and 8 display the trends in annual pet from 1982 to 2015 over the mgpac and seven sub regions when forcing factors are changed the pet values estimated by the all parameters scenario showed a clear positive trend the annual increase was 3 844 mm yr 1 p 0 01 over the mgpac in addition to the entire study area six sub regions except for necr also showed significantly increasing trends p 0 01 and the largest increasing rate for pet was observed in the lpr 6 03 mm yr 1 the annual increases of pet in the mgr hhhr yrr swcr and scr were 3 49 mm yr 1 4 35 mm yr 1 4 38 mm yr 1 5 15 mm yr 1 and 5 97 mm yr 1 respectively the direct effects of the driving factors on pet were explored based on experiments 5 7 for mgpac the direct contribution to the increase of pet under the only vegetation change scenario was 0 682 mm yr 1 p 0 01 which explained 18 91 of the pet trend under the all parameters scenario the only climate factor change directly contributed 3 053 mm yr 1 p 0 01 to the pet change and explained approximately 79 42 of the pet increase compared with climate and vegetation the direct contribution by the only radiation change had an insignificant effect on the increasing pet trend slope 0 042 and p 0 74 in general the climate forcing factors still played the most important roles in the increasing pet trend even after vegetation dynamics were considered figs 7 and 8 however vegetation dynamics had a non negligible effect on the increasing trend in pet especially in the hhhr and lpr where vegetation dynamics contributed 67 30 and 48 91 to the increasing trend in pet respectively the direct contributions by radiation change were still nearly zero which is consistent with the condition for the mgpac vegetation dynamics can reinforce the sensitivity of the vegetation to climate change and have an indirect effect on the pet trend climate change also has an indirect effect on the pet trend by enhancing the effect of vegetation fig 8 shows that the vegetation dynamics had a slightly larger effect 19 88 on the pet trend over the mgpac compared with the direct effect 18 91 moreover increased vegetation promotes the effect of climate change on the pet trend 81 17 more than the direct climate effect 79 42 among specific sub regions the indirect effect of vegetation dynamics and climate change on the pet trend generally exceeded the direct effects except for necr and scr regarding radiation the interactions with other forcing factors had negligible effects on the increased pet trend and are not shown in fig 8 fig 9 shows the spatial patterns of the responses of vegetation climate energy and all forcing factors to the pet trend from 1982 to 2016 the regions where vegetation promotes the pet fig 9a accounted for 53 13 of the pixels over mgpac and were primarily concentrated in the hhhr and lpr fig 9 b shows that climate drivers had a pronounced effect on increasing pet in most regions of the study area exceeding 85 but decreased pet in the cold necr the range of radiation sensitivity for the pet trend fig 9c was primarily concentrated between 1 and 1 across the entire study area and had a less pronounced effect on the pet trend compared with either vegetation or climate from 1982 to 2016 when all dynamic forcing factors were combined to estimate pet fig 9d approximately 87 71 of the area showed a positive pet trend and regions with a negative pet trend were exclusively located in the eastern portion of the necr 3 4 effects of single driving factors on long term trends to further distinguish the effect of single drivers on the pet trend the trends of every forcing factor were identified by alternately keeping every driver constant at its initial level while other factors were dynamically changed over the simulated period table 3 displays the rankings of the contribution of every driver over the mgpac domain for the entire mgpac the interaction of all drivers had a positive effect on pet variation in the t and lai significantly increased pet by 3 582 mm yr 1 and 1 127 mm yr 1 respectively while variation in co2 and sh decreased pet by 0 435 mm yr 1 and 0 653 mm yr 1 respectively co2 compensates for the effects of lai on the long term trends of pet specifically t significantly dominates the positive trend for pet over the southern mgpac with trends of 4 754 mm yr 1 in yrr 4 160 mm yr 1in scr and 4 592 mm yr 1 in scr the central regions follow these with trends of 3 146 mm yr 1 in the lpr and 2 929 mm yr 1 in the hhhr mgr had the smallest contribution 2 619 mm yr 1 except for necr lai also made a positive contribution to pet in the other six sub regions especially in hhhr with 3 325 mm yr 1 and lpr with 3 370 mm yr 1 compared with t and lai co2 ws sr ap and sh made smaller contributions to pet among these variables co2 made a negative contribution to pet for every sub region with a range of 0 362 mm yr 1 to 0 553 mm yr 1 ws generally made a negative contribution to pet in the northern mgpac and a positive contribution to pet in the southern mgpac the largest contribution was observed for scr with a value of 1 191 similar to co2 sh also negatively affected pet especially in necr with a contribution of 1 335 mm yr 1 sr only had a significant negative contribution in hhhr 0 863 mm yr 1 ap did not significantly change among subregions fig 10 a e displays the spatial patterns of the relative effects of seven single factors over mgpac at the pixel scale fig 10 a indicates that temperature had an overall positive effect on pet change except for small scattered patches that had negative effects strong trends in pet were present in the southwestern and southeastern portions of the mgpac with slopes exceeding 8 0 mm yr 1 sh had a negative effect on the pet trend with values lower than 0 6 mm yr 1 and significantly impacted nearly all portions of the necr fig 10b ws which had a contribution range from 0 6 1 0 mm yr 1 had effects on the necr southwest mgr and east yyr fig 10d except for hhhr the overall contribution of sr over mgpac was low with a trend ranging from 0 2 1 0 mm yr 1 fig 10e lai had an obvious positive effect with values greater than 2 0 mm yr 1 and had a strong effect in the hhhr and lpr and an insignificant effect in the southern portion of the mgpac fig 10f the magnitude of the effect for co2 was lower compared with the effects of other variables yet a slight effect of co2 was observed in the southwestern mgpac and the northern mgpac fig 11 shows the spatial pattern of the dominant factors for the long term trend of annual pet when absolute maximums at every pixel were selected t made the strongest contribution to controlling the long term trend in pet as it accounted for 70 09 of grid cells across the mgpac lai was the second most important factor and was primarily distributed in the lpr and hhhr where it accounted for 18 39 of the entire study area sh had negligible effects in the necr yrr and swcr the effects of ws were mainly restricted to the southern mgpac 3 5 trend in s w based spei 12 spei was calculated by standardizing the difference between monthly precipitation and pet fig 12 b shows that the spet trend across the mgpac had a significantly decreasing slope of 0 015 mm yr 1 p 0 015 suggesting that the drought had become increasingly serious the decreasing spei may be caused by an increase in precipitation or a decrease in pet based on the results presented in fig 12 a annual precipitation slightly increased over the mgpac at a rate of 1 23 mm yr 1 p 0 24 based on the pet trends shown in fig 7 it can therefore be deduced that the driver that results in serous drought over mgpac is pet increase although the entire mgpac shows an increased drought trend the spatial distribution of drought over mgpac was not even fig 12 c shows that the southwestern and northern mgpac the southwestern mgpac and the central region in the hhhr showed a strong pattern of increasing drought 4 discussion this study characterized the temporal and spatial changes in pet across the mgpac from 1982 to 2016 using the s w model the reasonability of the estimated pet over mgpac was indirectly validated by comparing spei with scpdsi and sma and directly validated by comparing various pet products 4 1 impacts of changes in several factors on variation in pet compared with vegetation and energy climate is the most important factor affecting changes in pet across the mpgac fig 7 furthermore the experiments designed in this study revealed that the most important climatic factors were t followed by sh ws and sr this result is consistent with the findings of wang et al 2019 who used the same data source with a similar timeframe and study region in addition to the negative effects of sh on pet this study showed that t ws and sr had positive effects on the pattern of pet which was inconsistent with the findings of wang et al 2019 but was consistent with the findings of other previous studies wang et al 2017 ye et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 in fact the change in pet was a synthesis process of single climatic factor variability the relative contribution of single climatic factors may differ between studies for a variety of reasons including different study methods regions periods and data sources wang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 in addition to the climatic factors vegetation was also identified to be an important factor affecting pet change lai not only influences the regional hydrological cycle but it also is the primary factor that controls variation in the components of evapotranspiration b j liu et al 2018 m l liu et al 2018 niu et al 2019 therefore lai was used to reflect the effect of vegetation in this study the mechanism underlying how lai affects evapotranspiration is complex on the one hand increased lai can promote evapotranspiration by expanding the surface area for canopy transpiration and interception evaporation s li et al 2018 x y li et al 2018 piao et al 2007 on the other hand increased lai decreases soil evaporation by preventing radiation energy from reaching the soil surface gu et al 2018 hungate et al 2002 therefore additional work is needed to clarify the effect of lai on the change in pet in addition to the increased vegetation area which was directly reflected by the increased lai the increased co2 concentrations can also affect vegetation dynamics through closure of the stomata to decrease the stomatal conductance of leaves which tends to reduce canopy conductance at a continental scale douville et al 2000 gedney et al 2006 sellers et al 1996 in light of this theory we simulated a 0 435 mm yr 1 effect of co2 on pet increase additionally the increased atmospheric co2 also had a co2 fertilization effect for increasing lai lian et al 2018 such an effect can expand the transpiration area of vegetation thus compensating for the impact of reduced canopy conductance stoy et al 2019 however this process is very complex and was not examined in this study this study showed that radiation only slightly affected changes in pet which presents certain contradictions with previous studies costa et al 2010 zeng et al 2014 this contradictory result may be explained by differences in the study period radiation over the mgpac showed an insignificant decreasing trend from 1982 to 2016 this phenomenon may be attributed to the intense development of industry over recent decades which has increased aerosol levels and decreased solar radiation mcvicar et al 2007 stanhill and cohen 2001 in addition skyscrapers are becoming more numerous in cities thus blocking the flow of wind which is not conducive to the diffusion of pollutants in the air 4 2 uncertainties the structure of the s w model is highly complex and requires a number of parameters to be derived the s w model represents an improvement over other climate based models for determining vegetation parameters based on land cover classification however these vegetation parameters in this study were determined by referencing the results of previous studies zhou et al 2006 and focused on studying small catchments or continents instead of making field measurements in the study area although this study obtained a reasonable spatial and temporal distribution of pet more accurate calculations would require considerable field measurements or calibrations in the study area the effect of increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations on stomata conductance was described by an empirical linear function which was used for all vegetation types without considering differences between biome types in fact this response curve needs to be further calibrated and measurements need to be taken at specific locations to reduce the uncertainty in the results alkama et al 2010 piao et al 2007 yan and dickinson 2014 4 3 potential impact of pet variability on agriculture pet variability can result in either positive or negative effects on the agricultural water supply and regional crop yield iizumi et al 2014 ray et al 2015 pet exhibited a clear increasing trend since the 1980s over the entire mgpac moreover the drought index showed the opposite trend generally the increased pet may have a major effect on the crop yield nevertheless crop yields have been high in most regions of china in these years because of improvements in agricultural practices e g irrigation level and seeds which can have a greater effect on crop yield compared with climatic factors wang et al 2017 however a sufficiently large pet increase in specific regions may have negative effects on the increase in crop yields generated by improvements in agricultural practices lobell et al 2011 wu et al 2016 indicated that increases in pet in the northern necr can enhance plant water presence and water requirements for agriculture production resulting in decreased crop yields 5 conclusions this study employed the s w two source model based on climate vegetation and energy factors to estimate the monthly pet over the mgpac for china from 1982 to 2016 the spei was indirectly used to validate the reasonability of the estimated pet by the s w model by comparing spei with scpdsi and sma validation data showed that the r2 of spei against scpdsi was 0 59 vs 0 51 and the r2 of spei vs smai was 0 33 these results imply that the pet estimated by s w was reliable moreover various pet products from other simulated models and remotely sensed algorithms also directly reinforce the reasonability of pet by s w the terrestrial ecosystems of mgpac had an average annual pet of 926 20 mm from 1982 to 2016 with an increasing rate of 3 844 mm yr 1 p 0 01 climate and vegetation had significantly positive trends p 0 01 over the 35 year period the energy factor did not show a clear pattern of change vegetation dynamics and climate factors explained 18 91 and 79 42 of the increase in pet respectively while the effect of energy change on pet increase was negligible moreover vegetation dynamics and climate factors had indirect effects on pet by making vegetation more sensitive to climate change and by promoting the effect of vegetation regarding single drivers variation in t and lai significantly increased pet by 3 582 mm yr 1 and 1 127 mm yr 1 across the mpgac respectively while variation in co2 and sh decreased pet by 0 435 mm yr 1 and 0 653 mm yr 1 respectively spei across the mgpac significantly decreased with a slope of 0 015 p 0 015 and annual precipitation showed a weak annual increase of 1 23 mm yr 1 p 0 24 across the mgpac pet increase was thus primarily responsible for increasing the frequency of drought in recent years over the mgpac across china crop yield was more affected by the improvement in agricultural practices compared with climate change in recent years however a sufficiently large

10134,over exploitation of groundwater for agricultural irrigation has attracted worldwide attention because of the rapid groundwater depletion and environmental consequences induced by the current intensified cropping system the combination of cropping system modeling with field experimentation is a powerful tool to evaluate the long term consequences of changing water management and cropping systems under inter annual climate variability here we conducted two field experiments for early maize em 2012 2018 single cropping system and winter wheat summer maize wwsm 2015 2018 double cropping system in the north china plain ncp field observations were carried out for crop growth yield and soil volumetric moisture content vmc calibration with the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model the calibrated apex model was used to assess the long term 35 years 1985 2019 impacts of em and wwsm cropping systems under four irrigation scenarios on sustainable water and crop productivity using historical weather data results showed that the apex replicated growth yield and vmc all reasonably well with r2 0 5 percent bias 25 and index of agreement 0 8 the model realistically simulated vmc under full irrigation fi while model simulations under reduced irrigation were not that accurate neglectable yield losses of em were observed by changing em fi to rainfed em rf 7 0 vs 6 8 mg ha 1 and lower inter annual yield variability shifting wwsm fi to em rf saved 47 evapotranspiration et and 115 net water use nwu regardless of the precipitation category years but caused 54 reduction in yield critical irrigation ci significantly reduced et 7 and nwu 28 of wwsm without yield loss compared to fi indicating great potentials of water saving through optimized irrigation strategy minimum irrigation mi saved et by 17 and nwu of wwsm by 62 but led to 15 ey reduction compared with fi in conclusion the wwsm cropping system under ci has the potential to maintain yield with less water consumption while rainfed em is the best alternative option for mitigating groundwater over exploitation with a certain extent risk in crop yield losses keywords alternative cropping system spring maize irrigation strategy groundwater depletion evapotranspiration 1 introduction sustainability of agriculture is being challenged by the growing demand for food production accompanied by population growth as well as the natural resources and environmental boundaries godfray et al 2010 davis et al 2019 water shortage has increasingly become a threat for irrigation agriculture which produces 46 of the world s food on 28 of the cropland molden 2007 moreover groundwater depletion has occurred in some highly intensified groundwater fed agricultural regions e g high plains and central valley in the united states indo gangetic plains in india and the north china plain scanlon et al 2012 gleeson et al 2012 sustainable crop production in these regions can be achieved in the long term only if sufficient water is available the north china plain ncp contributes to more than two thirds of wheat and one third of maize production in china nbsc 2018 however it is important to note that over exploitation of groundwater is imposing restrictions on such achievements due to the gap between annual precipitation 500 600 mm and the water requirement 850 900 mm of intensive winter wheat summer maize wwsm double cropping system van oort et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 continuous groundwater over exploitation has resulted in a 1 0 1 5 m yr 1 water table decline and led to the largest groundwater depression worldwide kong et al 2016 among water saving agricultural practices optimization in irrigation regime and cropping sequence are more promising options to mitigate groundwater crisis and ensure food security stage based deficit irrigation with optimized timing and amount greatly reduced groundwater use without significant yield loss zhang et al 2013 sun et al 2015 kang et al 2017 however based on a two year field experiment xu et al 2016 advocated that the optimal irrigation strategy for wheat is one irrigation 60 mm applied at stem elongation whereas xu et al 2018 recommended two supplemental irrigations at stem elongation and anthesis 75 mm for each irrigation based on another two year field experiment these inconsistent irrigation strategies may arise from the large inter annual precipitation variability moreover the amount of irrigation reduction induced by regime optimization is not equal to the amount of water saving real water saving can be realized only when et is reduced zhang 2018 thus it is vital to evaluate the impact of irrigation strategy optimization on real water saving considering the effect of weather variability continuous monocropping of early maize em also called spring maize in china is being proposed as a possible alternative to the current high intensity wwsm cropping system to conserve groundwater in the ncp meng et al 2012 cui et al 2018 although em has a high grain yield potential up to 16 5 mg ha 1 in the ncp meng et al 2013 there is still a yield loss range from 14 to 63 when compared with wwsm sun et al 2011 gao et al 2015 yan et al 2016 liang et al 2019 evapotranspiration et reduction of em ranged from 20 mm under the rainfed condition to 490 mm under conventional irrigation compared with wwsm meng et al 2012 yan et al 2016 liang et al 2019 the large difference in grain yield and et is mainly due to the large variability in weather management and soil type across the ncp in the southern ncp for example the grain yield of em was lower than summer maize even with a longer growing period due to high temperature stress during the grain filling stage yan et al 2017 gao et al 2018 therefore there is a need for further exploration of the grain yield and water productivity of em in the long term period process based crop simulation models have unique advantages in evaluating the effects of agricultural management scenarios under long term inter annual climate variability jeong and zhang 2020 apex is a physically based model for simulating agricultural management impacts on crop production and environmental quality on multiple spatially distributed fields williams et al 2008 osorio leyton 2019 the apex model has been widely and successfully used to simulate crop production wang et al 2008 meki et al 2013 luo and wang 2019 irrigation regime zhang et al 2016a b 2018 zhao et al 2019 conservation agriculture assefa et al 2018 and water and nitrogen management talebizadeh et al 2018 tadesse et al 2018 2019 timlin et al 2019 for major crops across the world in addition recent model improvements such as the variable saturation hydraulic conductivity methods greatly enhanced the capability and application of apex doro et al 2017 overall apex is capable of evaluating the impacts of climate soil and management practices on hydrology and crop productivity to our knowledge no studies have calibrated and validated the apex model for maize and wheat production in the ncp especially comparison analysis for wwsm and em cropping systems under diﬀerent irrigation regimes therefore two field experiments of wwsm 2015 2018 and em 2012 2018 were conducted to calibrate and validate the apex model then the validated model was used to assess the effect of irrigation strategies on water use and crop productivity of wwsm and em using historical weather data we aimed to 1 assess the applicability of apex on mimicking crop growth the yield of maize and wheat and vmc of wwsm 2 quantify grain yield water stress days ws et water use efficiency wue and net water use nwu of wwsm and em under four irrigation schedules and 3 propose optimal irrigation strategies and potential alternative cropping systems in the ncp 2 material and method 2 1 experimental site the field experiments were conducted at the wuqiao experimental station of china agricultural university 37 62 n 116 43 e a s l 18 21 m the study site is located in the southern part of hebei province which is typically representative of the overall agricultural production in the ncp fig 1 the study area has a warm temperate and continental monsoon climate the average annual precipitation over the last 35 years is 547 mm 70 of which occurred in the summer monsoon months june to august the average accumulative precipitation during winter wheat season is 131 mm fig s1 the annual mean air temperature is 13 8 c the soil is classified as silt loam hydrologic group b details of the soil texture and hydraulic properties are provided in zhao et al 2019 the depth of the groundwater table in the experiment area is approximately 17 m liang et al 2019 2 2 cropping system experiments and data collection 2 2 1 field experiment i irrigation regime optimization for wwsm the field experiment of irrigation regime optimization on wwsm cropping system was conducted during 2015 2018 in randomized complete block design with three replications four irrigation treatments were applied during the winter wheat growing season including no irrigation w0 one irrigation at pre sowing w1 two irrigation at pre sowing and jointing stage w2 and three irrigation at pre sowing jointing and anthesis stage w3 table s1 total irrigation amount for w0 w1 w2 and w3 was 0 75 150 and 225 mm respectively summer maize was rainfed except for the 2017 growing season when 60 mm post sowing irrigation were applied for ensuring the germination of maize winter wheat variety jimai 22 was sown in mid october at a density of 7 106 plants ha 1 summer maize variety zhengdan 958 was planted after winter wheat harvest at a density of 6 104 plants ha 1 surface irrigation was applied to each plot using a 4 in plastic coated hose the amount of water applied with each irrigation was controlled by a flow meter installed near the outlet fertilization and other management information can be found in wang et al 2021 field measurements that included the leaf area index lai and aboveground biomass abiom were determined at the tillering jointing anthesis 20 d post anthesis and maturity of winter wheat and at the stages of v6 v12 silking 20 d post silking and maturity of summer maize respectively sampling of plant material and calculation methods for lai and abiom can be found in yan et al 2017 and li et al 2018a at maturity plants from a 2 m2 area of winter wheat and 6 m2 area of summer maize in the middle of each plot were harvested for wheat and maize grain yield determination respectively the actual grain yield of wheat and maize was reported on a 12 5 and 14 moisture basis respectively soil water content were collected from 20 cm increments to a depth of 200 cm by using a soil corer in all wwsm plots measurements were done at pre sowing post harvesting and all the above mentioned stages for lai and abiom measurement the soil gravimetric water content was measured by oven drying at 105 c to a constant weight and then converted to soil volumetric moisture content vmc based on soil layer depth and bulk density li et al 2018a 2 2 2 field experiment ii sowing date optimization for em the field experiment of sowing date optimization on em was conducted during 2012 2018 in a randomized complete block design six sowing dates from early april to late may were established as shown in table s2 high yield maize variety jinhai 5 was planted at a density of 6 8 104 6 4 104 6 7 104 plants ha 1 during 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 2018 respectively water was supplied to each plot when needed each plot received 240 kg n ha 1 360 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 240 kg k2o ha 1 detailed information can be found in yan et al 2017 and zhang et al 2019 determination of lai abiom and grain yield of early maize was performed the same as summer maize except for the sampling frequency for early maize lai and abiom were measured 30 d after sowing to maturity at approximately 10 d intervals 2 3 apex model description the apex model was developed to expand the capabilities of the environmental policy integrated climate epic model to simulate multiple subareas simultaneously williams and izaurralde 2005 gassman et al 2010 the apex model works on a daily time step at farm or small watershed spatial scale and is capable of long term simulations up to thousands of years while the epic model works at field scale simulates homogeneous topographic soil weather and management conditions in the aepx model it is possible to divide the simulated area into many homogeneous units i e subareas hydrologically connected to allow the simulation of water flow from one subarea to another through channels and flood plains to the watershed outlet while simulating this flow the model simulates the transport of sediment nutrients and pesticides steglich et al 2018 like in the epic model the main components of the apex model are weather hydrology soil erosion nutrients dynamic soil temperature plant growth plant environment control tillage and economic budget the unique features of apex are the routing component that allows the simulation of the water flow between subareas and a manure management routine that allows to simulate liquid waste and solid manure applications from lagoons and stockpiling gassman et al 2005 the apex model provides the user with several options to simulate some key processes for instance five options are available to simulate the potential evapotranspiration hargreaves penman penman monteith priestley taylor and baier robertson the surface runoff can be estimated with two different methods a modification of the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs runoff curve number cn technique usda nrcs 2004 williams 1995 and the green and ampt infiltration equation while eight different equations are available to estimate soil water erosion the universal soil loss equation usle the onstad foster modification of the usle the modified usle method musle plus three variants theoretical version must small watershed version muss and a version that uses input coefficients musi the revised usle rusle and rusle2 the apex model simulates plant growth using a single growth model based on radiation use efficiency for biomass accumulation and daily heat unit accumulation for the phenological development gassman et al 2010 crop seasonal and annual actual et were calculated using the soil water balance equation zhang 2018 1 et p i swd r c d where p mm is precipitation i mm is irrigation swd is soil water extraction based on the difference between sowing and maturity r is runoff c is capillary rise into the root zone and d is drainage below the 200 cm soil profile because the plot is bordered by ridges r is negligible the groundwater table at the experimental site is 7 9 m 4 m c is also negligible since et could be overestimated by 45 112 mm under 3 5 irrigations for the wheat growing period which was similar to our irrigation regimes d cannot be ignored in the ncp zhang 2018 therefore simulated d was used for calculating et in the context of accurate simulation of soil moisture dynamics in this work the apex version 1501 was used to simulate the wwsm and em field trials this version includes recent developments such as an improved carbon and nitrogen cycling subroutine izaurralde et al 2006 and water percolation dynamic doro et al 2017 a detailed description of the apex model is provided by gassman et al 2010 and williams et al 2012 several successful cases study was achieved in the ncp based on the apex model and the detail description as shown in zhao et al 2019 soil parameters that may affect soil water content were calibrated simultaneously with the growth and grain yield calibration apex parameters related to rainfall runoff partitioning were adjusted during the calibration phase parm15 runoﬀ curve number weighting factor is used to fine tune the effect of crop residue on the calculation of the curve number cn that in turn affects the estimation of runoff parm16 cn retention parameter is used to estimate the retention parameter s that is related to the cn parm92 runoff volume adjustment for direct link is used to adjust the estimated cn its default value is one values greater than one increase the estimated cn resulting in higher runoff volume while values lower than one reduce the simulated runoff parm15 parm16 and parm92 were calibrated within their ranges of 0 0 3 1 1 5 and 0 1 2 0 respectively in the apex model crop growth module applies the concept of phenological crop development based on daily heat unit accumulation williams et al 1989 potential heat units of early maize summer maize and winter wheat were set to 2100 1900 and 1800 c respectively all apex model input files including weather soil and management data were edited and modified using the apexeditor an excel based tool for editing apex input files osorio leyton 2019 2 4 apex model calibration and validation the apex needs to be calibrated and validated to obtain reliable modeling results from various scenario runs and to understand model uncertainties associated with inputs and model parameters gassman et al 2005 in this study the lai abiom grain yield and vmc data collected from field trials were used for apex calibration and validation model parameters were calibrated manually using a trial error method the dataset was split into two subsets for calibration and validation respectively for wheat and summer maize apex was calibrated and validated for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively for early maize apex was calibrated for the 2012 2015 and then validated using data collected during 2016 2018 five year warm up period was applied to both wwsm and em trials to stabilize the soil organic carbon and nitrogen pools model calibration validation and evaluation procedure were combined with r 3 5 2 r core team 2019 and rstudio 1 2 1335 rstudio team 2018 r packages and functions used for the observed data import and apex model output data import cleaning massaging preparing visualization and statistical analysis are shown in table s3 the default and calibrated values of the winter wheat summer maize and early maize crop parameters are listed in table 1 2 5 simulation scenarios to compare wwsm and em under different water supply four stage based irrigation scenarios were designed namely full irrigation fi critical irrigation ci minimum irrigation mi and rainfed rf details of the irrigation scenarios are shown in table 2 model simulation results were evaluated for grain yield et wue and nwu maize grain yield was converted to wheat equivalent yield ey based on the wheat maize nutrition equivalent ratio of 1 0 708 for comparison of different crops water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as follows 2 wue ey et where ey is the wheat equivalent yield kg ha 1 and et mm is crop seasonal evapotranspiration water stress ws factor is computed by considering water supply and demand in eq 3 3 ws aep ep where aep mm d 1 is the actual plant water use rate and ep mm d 1 is the potential plant water use rate williams et al 2012 ws days i e the duration of water deficit is the accumulated days when water stress occurred nwu was calculated as eq 4 4 nwu i dp where nwu is the net groundwater use mm i is the amount of seasonal or annual irrigation mm dp is the deep percolation mm which is exported from apex model simulation for evaluating the effects of precipitation on et and wue of different crops annual precipitation during 1985 2019 was classified into different category years using empirical frequency analysis efa the precipitation years were divided into three classes wet year normal year and dry year with separating points of 25 50 and 75 probability values respectively detailed steps of the efa method can be found in zhao et al 2020 2 6 model performance evaluation criteria the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and index of agreement d willmott 1981 were applied to evaluate the model performance pbias and d were calculated as follows 5 pbias i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 100 6 d 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i m o i m 2 where o i is the ith observed value p i is the ith predicted value and m is the mean of the measured values the pbias measures the deviation of model simulated values as an underestimation 0 or overestimation 0 of the observed values the value of d ranges from 0 to 1 in which values closer to 1 indicate perfect simulation and a value of zero denotes poor predictability willmott 1981 3 results 3 1 apex calibration and validation in general simulated values of lai abiom and grain yield for winter wheat ww summer maize sm and early maize em were in good agreement with the field observations table 3 evaluation indicators for lai and abiom indicated that model performance was satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 wang et al 2012 during calibration and validation periods with r2 that ranged between 0 68 and 0 98 pbias 25 and d 0 85 table 3 the trend lines of the simulated lai and abiom matched observed crop growth curve well indicating that the calibration and validation results for lai and abiom were acceptable figs s2 s5 the calibrated parameters yielded good agreement between predicted and observed grain yields of the three crops with r2 that ranged from 0 68 to 0 91 pbias 10 and d 0 9 table 3 and fig 2 simulated time series data for vmc in different soil layers of wwsm with different irrigation treatments closely matched measured vmc during calibration and validation periods fig 3 the summary model performance statistics indicate that the simulated vmc were in good agreement with observed values under four irrigation scenarios with r2 0 5 pbias 10 and d 0 83 table 3 moreover the model performance showed a positive correlation with the amount of irrigation especially during the validation period fig 3 the r2 d value and pbias increased from 0 38 0 65 and 23 5 under w0 to 0 77 0 91 and 1 9 under w3 table s4 the model s performances were good in simulating et of wwsm with a high r2 and d value of 0 78 and 0 91 respectively a low pbias of 2 4 during the calibration period and high r2 and d value of 0 95 and 0 98 respectively a low pbias of 0 5 during validation period table 3 and fig s6 3 2 equivalent yield and water stress days the ranges of the simulated ey ws et wue and nwu of wwsm and em under four irrigation scenarios are presented in fig 4 in general ey et wue and nwu decreased and ws was intensified with the reduction in irrigation ey of ww ranged from 6 69 mg ha 1 under fi to 3 17 mg ha 1 under rf with a significant decrease of approximately 1 18 mg ha 1 on average with one irrigation reduction 75 mm moreover there were higher ey variations in restricted irrigation scenarios such as mi and rf fig 4 p 0 001 no significant difference was observed in ey of sm and em among different irrigation scenarios ey of sm and em ranged from 7 84 to 8 20 mg ha 1 and 6 80 to 7 05 mg ha 1 over four irrigation scenarios with an average of 8 03 mg ha 1 and 6 95 mg ha 1 respectively annual ey of wwsm was unaffected by decreasing irrigation from fi to ci but it was significantly reduced from ci to mi and rf fig 4 p 0 001 annual eys of wwsm were 62 79 98 and 108 higher than those of em under rf mi ci and fi respectively ey of the wwsm varied significantly among years showing high yield variations under low irrigation the ws days of ww and wwsm increased considerably when the irrigation regime changed from fi to rf but there was a weaker response in sm and em fig 4 the ws days for ww were 68 30 14 and 3 d under rf mi ci and fi respectively the ws days were significantly lower for sm than ww and ranged from 2 d under fi to 17 d under rf compared with the ws days for sm the ws days for em decreased by 9 8 5 and 2 d under rf mi ci and fi respectively annual ws days for wwsm were 85 40 19 and 5 d under rf mi ci and fi respectively which almost doubled with the decrease in irrigation ws days variation of wwsm among years significantly increased with the decrease in irrigation fig 4 p 0 001 3 3 evapotranspiration water use efficiency and net water use the et of ww and wwsm decreased significantly and its variation among years increased with each irrigation reduction but not much change was observed in sm and em under different irrigation regimes except when the irrigation regime changed from mi to rf fig 4 the highest et for ww was 400 mm under fi and ets under ci mi and rf were 13 31 and 48 lower respectively fig 4 p 0 001 the difference in et among irrigation scenarios was less than 40 mm for both sm and em the average et for em over four irrigation regimes was 80 mm higher than that for sm et for wwsm were 536 631 710 and 765 mm under rf mi ci and fi respectively the reduction in et of wwsm mainly occurred in ww because et of sm was not sensitive to irrigation rainfed em reduced et by 47 to 410 mm compared with wwsm under fi ets of different crops were reduced with the reduction of irrigation across all precipitation category years but greater response was found in the dry years and ww fig s7a the simulated wue decreased slightly for ww and increased slightly for sm wwsm and em fig 4 compared with the wue for ww under fi 17 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 simulated wue for ww under mi and rf decreased by an average of 13 and 18 fig 4 the average wue for sm were 23 5 22 7 22 2 and 21 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 under rf mi ci and fi respectively with an average of 22 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 over irrigation regimes which was 41 higher than the wue for em 16 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 the average wue for wwsm over 35 weather years under four irrigation regimes was 19 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 which was 23 higher than the wue for em the response of wue was inconsistent with different crops irrigation scenarios and precipitation category years fig s7b ww under ci had similar wue with that under fi in the three precipitation category years the wue of sm increased consistently with the reduction of irrigation in both wet and normal years but in dry years irrigation had no significant effect on wue although wues of em in dry years were 4 and 7 lower than that in wet and normal years the wue of em increased consistently with the decreasing of irrigation in all precipitation category years there was a significant decline trend for the nwu of ww and wwsm and a slower decline trend for the nwu of sm and em with the irrigation amount decrease fig 4 ww under fi had the highest nwu with a mean value of 219 mm and a lower variability compared with fi nwu of ww under ci mi and rf decreased significantly by 70 144 and 219 mm respectively fig 4 p 0 001 nwu for sm ranged from 105 mm under fi to 6 mm under rf nwu for em ranged from 38 mm under fi to 50 mm under rf indicating that rainfed em will benefit groundwater recovery in the long run nwu for wwsm under rf mi ci and fi was 7 122 234 and 324 mm respectively the average nwus under rf mi ci and fi were 43 129 217 286 mm lower for em respectively compared with that for wwsm the average nwu for both sm and em had high variability among weather years 4 discussion 4 1 apex model evaluation crop growth and water balance modules of the apex model were evaluated using measured grain yield daily growth and soil water content data collected from field study in the ncp apex simulations of lai abiom and grain yield for maize and wheat were considered reasonable with r2 0 68 pbias 21 and d values close or higher than 0 9 moriasi et al 2007 wang et al 2012 although vmc under wwsm was better estimated under high irrigation volume than lower irrigation amount apex simulations of vmc and et were considered satisfactory model simulation performance showed that vmc during the calibration period was predicted more accurately than that during the validation period tables 3 and s4 timsina and humphreys 2006 and song and jin 2020 also found more accurate and reliable simulations with increased water supply using the dssat model in general low water availability and other biotic stress make accurate simulation of vmc more challenging in crop models saseendran et al 2008 this might be due to the fact that the model is not able to capture the reduced utilization of water stored in deep soil layers by plants with shorter root length and a lower root density as a result of water stress zhang et al 2013 4 2 water saving effect induced by deficit irrigation and shifting cropping system the key to groundwater saving is to optimize the water management of crops which rely heavily on groundwater irrigation for example rice in north west india and alfalfa in california s central valley humphreys et al 2010 stokstad 2020 our results indicated that large water saving potential is concentrated on the irrigation management of ww in the ncp when ci was adopted the annual et and nwu of wwsm were significantly reduced by 7 and 28 to 710 mm and 234 mm respectively without significant yield loss when mi was adopted the annual et and nwu were reduced further to 631 mm and 122 mm irrigation optimization is an effective method for water saving but the reduction is not equal to the amount of water saving and real water saving can be realized only when et is reduced zhang 2018 in other words stage based deficit irrigation has the potential for real water saving and further reduce groundwater pumping to allow aquifers to recover stokstad 2020 according to a statistical modeling result by chen et al 2003 the upper limit of groundwater pumping is 150 mm yr 1 clearly the wwsm cropping system under mi was within this range the average et for em was 450 mm even under fi nearly 100 mm lower than the average annual precipitation the nwus of em under mi and rf were 7 and 50 mm indicating that replacing wwsm with em can replenish groundwater which would result in a rise in the level of water table although pre sowing irrigation is often recommended for em meng et al 2012 it can successfully be planted with natural precipitation events within the wide sowing window yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 therefore em under rf as alternatives to wwsm can meet the need for groundwater balance and crop production and plays an important role in designing water suitable cropping systems hu et al 2019 overall wwsm under ci benefits irrigation water conservation and crop production while wwsm under mi and em under rf are favored to be the alternative options for sustainable groundwater management in the ncp 4 3 yield effect induced by deficit irrigation and shifting cropping system although deficit irrigation and alternative cropping system can reduce water usage there could be a grain yield reduction of various degrees compared with wwsm sun et al 2011 meng et al 2012 luo et al 2018 however our results showed that there is no significant difference between ey of wwsm under ci and that under fi indicating that water stress that occurs during non critical stages has limited influence on crops in wwsm which agrees with the findings reported by zhao et al 2020 and wang et al 2021 ey of wwsm under mi and rf reduces significantly by 2 2 and 3 7 mg ha 1 compared with that under fi surprisingly the yield losses with deficit irrigation mainly occurred for wheat whereas that for maize was much less and was independent on interannual climate variation this is mainly attributable to the synchronization between precipitation water supply and water demand by crops in the past 35 years more than 75 of the total precipitation 547 mm occurred during the summer maize season therefore holst et al 2014 advocated that summer maize can be entirely rainfed winter wheat was the lowest among three crops on grain yields and wue which was consistent with the results reported by zhao et al 2018 and also corroborates the idea that wue is greater for c4 maize than c3 wheat meng et al 2017 our results showed that grain yield of em was 52 lower under fi and 38 lower under rf compared with corresponding wwsm respectively the results in this study are beneficial to sustainable crop and water productivity and the policy making of water price 4 4 alternative cropping systems for groundwater irrigation sustainability groundwater irrigation is essential for attaining food security in most semi arid agro ecological zones and becomes even more important due to more unreliable precipitation under climate change rupérez moreno et al 2017 stokstad 2020 more effort needs to be launched to save the valuable groundwater for the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in overexploited aquifers a crop distribution optimization study conducted by davis et al 2017 showed that the optimized cropping structure would save 12 of irrigation water while providing food for an additional 825 million people at a global scale however at the field scale we found that shifting from wwsm fi to em rf induced 54 yield reduction even though saving 115 of net groundwater use in the high intensified ncp furthermore wwsm under optimized irrigation strategy maintains yield with less groundwater water use thus site specific solutions are required to balance the tradeoff between food demand and groundwater conservation although local dietary habits keep the demand for wheat strong in the ncp the area of cultivated lands for winter wheat production has decreased over the past years as a result of lower input output ratio and economic benefit in the region pei et al 2015 we found that the high yield of wheat relies heavily on groundwater irrigation in all precipitation category years in contrast negligible yield difference was observed in early maize under different irrigation scenarios in other words early maize is more suitable in terms of coupling annual precipitation in addition the large yield potential 16 5 mg ha 1 favored by high summer temperature makes early maize a promising alternative to the current water intensive wwsm meng et al 2012 2013 van oort et al 2016 however some environmental impacts must be considered when wwsm is changed to em firstly soil evaporation 100 200 mm during winter fallow is not beneficial to agricultural production ren et al 2021 secondly winter fallow without mulching of wheat may lead to dust storms in the winter and spring seasons potential solutions are straw mulching subsoiling and plastic film mulching for water conservation and wind erosion control sun et al 2019 therefore implementation of drastic and systematic shifts in cropping systems such as a conversion from wwsm to em can be limited to high risk areas like groundwater severe overdraft regions this study focused on irrigation and crop management for developing groundwater neutral cropping systems similar strategies had been adopted by researchers in other over exploitation regions to mitigate groundwater depletion for example replacing water intensive rice crops with water saving crops such as maize and millets in india humphreys et al 2010 davis et al 2019 changing irrigated crops by rain fed crops in the central high plains scanlon et al 2010 or decreasing the cropping frequency of water intensive crops e g alfalfa and fruits in the california s central valley li et al 2018b stokstad 2020 our results enrich the knowledge of water saving cropping system design for groundwater recovery at the site level nevertheless our findings were based on site level experiment and simulation when studied on the broader scale the results generated may not be exactly the same cropping structure adjustment and irrigation strategy optimization at a regional scale need further exploration to further examine the effects of variability of soil weather and management 5 conclusion for the first time the apex model was calibrated and validated for early maize summer maize and winter wheat with reasonable accuracy in the north china plain with further simulation of winter wheat summer maize wwsm and early maize em cropping system under different irrigation regimes our findings demonstrated that et and net water use of wwsm under ci were reduced by 7 and 28 without yield loss compared with that under fi moreover less intensive irrigation and shifting cropping systems from wwsm to em both resulted in water saving and groundwater sustainability although groundwater balance benefits from the reduction of 17 in et and 62 in net water use ey of wwsm under mi was reduced by 15 to 12 4 mg ha 1 compared with that under fi the yield of em was independent of irrigation 6 8 7 0 mg ha 1 and had much lower interannual variability replacing wwsm fi by em rf resulted in 47 and 115 reduction in et and net water use but also resulted in 54 yield reduction our results demonstrate that the wwsm ci saves irrigation water without yield loss the em rf is the best option for groundwater sustainability but the induced yield reduction should be taken into consideration for national food security the apex model is applicable to relevant modeling research and the results here can be used in the

10134,over exploitation of groundwater for agricultural irrigation has attracted worldwide attention because of the rapid groundwater depletion and environmental consequences induced by the current intensified cropping system the combination of cropping system modeling with field experimentation is a powerful tool to evaluate the long term consequences of changing water management and cropping systems under inter annual climate variability here we conducted two field experiments for early maize em 2012 2018 single cropping system and winter wheat summer maize wwsm 2015 2018 double cropping system in the north china plain ncp field observations were carried out for crop growth yield and soil volumetric moisture content vmc calibration with the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model the calibrated apex model was used to assess the long term 35 years 1985 2019 impacts of em and wwsm cropping systems under four irrigation scenarios on sustainable water and crop productivity using historical weather data results showed that the apex replicated growth yield and vmc all reasonably well with r2 0 5 percent bias 25 and index of agreement 0 8 the model realistically simulated vmc under full irrigation fi while model simulations under reduced irrigation were not that accurate neglectable yield losses of em were observed by changing em fi to rainfed em rf 7 0 vs 6 8 mg ha 1 and lower inter annual yield variability shifting wwsm fi to em rf saved 47 evapotranspiration et and 115 net water use nwu regardless of the precipitation category years but caused 54 reduction in yield critical irrigation ci significantly reduced et 7 and nwu 28 of wwsm without yield loss compared to fi indicating great potentials of water saving through optimized irrigation strategy minimum irrigation mi saved et by 17 and nwu of wwsm by 62 but led to 15 ey reduction compared with fi in conclusion the wwsm cropping system under ci has the potential to maintain yield with less water consumption while rainfed em is the best alternative option for mitigating groundwater over exploitation with a certain extent risk in crop yield losses keywords alternative cropping system spring maize irrigation strategy groundwater depletion evapotranspiration 1 introduction sustainability of agriculture is being challenged by the growing demand for food production accompanied by population growth as well as the natural resources and environmental boundaries godfray et al 2010 davis et al 2019 water shortage has increasingly become a threat for irrigation agriculture which produces 46 of the world s food on 28 of the cropland molden 2007 moreover groundwater depletion has occurred in some highly intensified groundwater fed agricultural regions e g high plains and central valley in the united states indo gangetic plains in india and the north china plain scanlon et al 2012 gleeson et al 2012 sustainable crop production in these regions can be achieved in the long term only if sufficient water is available the north china plain ncp contributes to more than two thirds of wheat and one third of maize production in china nbsc 2018 however it is important to note that over exploitation of groundwater is imposing restrictions on such achievements due to the gap between annual precipitation 500 600 mm and the water requirement 850 900 mm of intensive winter wheat summer maize wwsm double cropping system van oort et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 continuous groundwater over exploitation has resulted in a 1 0 1 5 m yr 1 water table decline and led to the largest groundwater depression worldwide kong et al 2016 among water saving agricultural practices optimization in irrigation regime and cropping sequence are more promising options to mitigate groundwater crisis and ensure food security stage based deficit irrigation with optimized timing and amount greatly reduced groundwater use without significant yield loss zhang et al 2013 sun et al 2015 kang et al 2017 however based on a two year field experiment xu et al 2016 advocated that the optimal irrigation strategy for wheat is one irrigation 60 mm applied at stem elongation whereas xu et al 2018 recommended two supplemental irrigations at stem elongation and anthesis 75 mm for each irrigation based on another two year field experiment these inconsistent irrigation strategies may arise from the large inter annual precipitation variability moreover the amount of irrigation reduction induced by regime optimization is not equal to the amount of water saving real water saving can be realized only when et is reduced zhang 2018 thus it is vital to evaluate the impact of irrigation strategy optimization on real water saving considering the effect of weather variability continuous monocropping of early maize em also called spring maize in china is being proposed as a possible alternative to the current high intensity wwsm cropping system to conserve groundwater in the ncp meng et al 2012 cui et al 2018 although em has a high grain yield potential up to 16 5 mg ha 1 in the ncp meng et al 2013 there is still a yield loss range from 14 to 63 when compared with wwsm sun et al 2011 gao et al 2015 yan et al 2016 liang et al 2019 evapotranspiration et reduction of em ranged from 20 mm under the rainfed condition to 490 mm under conventional irrigation compared with wwsm meng et al 2012 yan et al 2016 liang et al 2019 the large difference in grain yield and et is mainly due to the large variability in weather management and soil type across the ncp in the southern ncp for example the grain yield of em was lower than summer maize even with a longer growing period due to high temperature stress during the grain filling stage yan et al 2017 gao et al 2018 therefore there is a need for further exploration of the grain yield and water productivity of em in the long term period process based crop simulation models have unique advantages in evaluating the effects of agricultural management scenarios under long term inter annual climate variability jeong and zhang 2020 apex is a physically based model for simulating agricultural management impacts on crop production and environmental quality on multiple spatially distributed fields williams et al 2008 osorio leyton 2019 the apex model has been widely and successfully used to simulate crop production wang et al 2008 meki et al 2013 luo and wang 2019 irrigation regime zhang et al 2016a b 2018 zhao et al 2019 conservation agriculture assefa et al 2018 and water and nitrogen management talebizadeh et al 2018 tadesse et al 2018 2019 timlin et al 2019 for major crops across the world in addition recent model improvements such as the variable saturation hydraulic conductivity methods greatly enhanced the capability and application of apex doro et al 2017 overall apex is capable of evaluating the impacts of climate soil and management practices on hydrology and crop productivity to our knowledge no studies have calibrated and validated the apex model for maize and wheat production in the ncp especially comparison analysis for wwsm and em cropping systems under diﬀerent irrigation regimes therefore two field experiments of wwsm 2015 2018 and em 2012 2018 were conducted to calibrate and validate the apex model then the validated model was used to assess the effect of irrigation strategies on water use and crop productivity of wwsm and em using historical weather data we aimed to 1 assess the applicability of apex on mimicking crop growth the yield of maize and wheat and vmc of wwsm 2 quantify grain yield water stress days ws et water use efficiency wue and net water use nwu of wwsm and em under four irrigation schedules

experimental station of china agricultural university 37 62 n 116 43 e a s l 18 21 m the study site is located in the southern part of hebei province which is typically representative of the overall agricultural production in the ncp fig 1 the study area has a warm temperate and continental monsoon climate the average annual precipitation over the last 35 years is 547 mm 70 of which occurred in the summer monsoon months june to august the average accumulative precipitation during winter wheat season is 131 mm fig s1 the annual mean air temperature is 13 8 c the soil is classified as silt loam hydrologic group b details of the soil texture and hydraulic properties are provided in zhao et al 2019 the depth of the groundwater table in the experiment area is approximately 17 m liang et al 2019 2 2 cropping system experiments and data collection 2 2 1 field experiment i irrigation regime optimization for wwsm the field experiment of irrigation regime optimization on wwsm cropping system was conducted during 2015 2018 in randomized complete block design with three replications four irrigation treatments were applied during the winter wheat growing season including no irrigation w0 one irrigation at pre sowing w1 two irrigation at pre sowing and jointing stage w2 and three irrigation at pre sowing jointing and anthesis stage w3 table s1 total irrigation amount for w0 w1 w2 and w3 was 0 75 150 and 225 mm respectively summer maize was rainfed except for the 2017 growing season when 60 mm post sowing irrigation were applied for ensuring the germination of maize winter wheat variety jimai 22 was sown in mid october at a density of 7 106 plants ha 1 summer maize variety zhengdan 958 was planted after winter wheat harvest at a density of 6 104 plants ha 1 surface irrigation was applied to each plot using a 4 in plastic coated hose the amount of water applied with each irrigation was controlled by a flow meter installed near the outlet fertilization and other management information can be found in wang et al 2021 field measurements that included the leaf area index lai and aboveground biomass abiom were determined at the tillering jointing anthesis 20 d post anthesis and maturity of winter wheat and at the stages of v6 v12 silking 20 d post silking and maturity of summer maize respectively sampling of plant material and calculation methods for lai and abiom can be found in yan et al 2017 and li et al 2018a at maturity plants from a 2 m2 area of winter wheat and 6 m2 area of summer maize in the middle of each plot were harvested for wheat and maize grain yield determination respectively the actual grain yield of wheat and maize was reported on a 12 5 and 14 moisture basis respectively soil water content were collected from 20 cm increments to a depth of 200 cm by using a soil corer in all wwsm plots measurements were done at pre sowing post harvesting and all the above mentioned stages for lai and abiom measurement the soil gravimetric water content was measured by oven drying at 105 c to a constant weight and then converted to soil volumetric moisture content vmc based on soil layer depth and bulk density li et al 2018a 2 2 2 field experiment ii sowing date optimization for em the field experiment of sowing date optimization on em was conducted during 2012 2018 in a randomized complete block design six sowing dates from early april to late may were established as shown in table s2 high yield maize variety jinhai 5 was planted at a density of 6 8 104 6 4 104 6 7 104 plants ha 1 during 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 2018 respectively water was supplied to each plot when needed each plot received 240 kg n ha 1 360 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 240 kg k2o ha 1 detailed information can be found in yan et al 2017 and zhang et al 2019 determination of lai abiom and grain yield of early maize was performed the same as summer maize except for the sampling frequency for early maize lai and abiom were measured 30 d after sowing to maturity at approximately 10 d intervals 2 3 apex model description the apex model was developed to expand the capabilities of the environmental policy integrated climate epic model to simulate multiple subareas simultaneously williams and izaurralde 2005 gassman et al 2010 the apex model works on a daily time step at farm or small watershed spatial scale and is capable of long term simulations up to thousands of years while the epic model works at field scale simulates homogeneous topographic soil weather and management conditions in the aepx model it is possible to divide the simulated area into many homogeneous units i e subareas hydrologically connected to allow the simulation of water flow from one subarea to another through channels and flood plains to the watershed outlet while simulating this flow the model simulates the transport of sediment nutrients and pesticides steglich et al 2018 like in the epic model the main components of the apex model are weather hydrology soil erosion nutrients dynamic soil temperature plant growth plant environment control tillage and economic budget the unique features of apex are the routing component that allows the simulation of the water flow between subareas and a manure management routine that allows to simulate liquid waste and solid manure applications from lagoons and stockpiling gassman et al 2005 the apex model provides the user with several options to simulate some key processes for instance five options are available to simulate the potential evapotranspiration hargreaves penman penman monteith priestley taylor and baier robertson the surface runoff can be estimated with two different methods a modification of the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs runoff curve number cn technique usda nrcs 2004 williams 1995 and the green and ampt infiltration equation while eight different equations are available to estimate soil water erosion the universal soil loss equation usle the onstad foster modification of the usle the modified usle method musle plus three variants theoretical version must small watershed version muss and a version that uses input coefficients musi the revised usle rusle and rusle2 the apex model simulates plant growth using a single growth model based on radiation use efficiency for biomass accumulation and daily heat unit accumulation for the phenological development gassman et al 2010 crop seasonal and annual actual et were calculated using the soil water balance equation zhang 2018 1 et p i swd r c d where p mm is precipitation i mm is irrigation swd is soil water extraction based on the difference between sowing and maturity r is runoff c is capillary rise into the root zone and d is drainage below the 200 cm soil profile because the plot is bordered by ridges r is negligible the groundwater table at the experimental site is 7 9 m 4 m c is also negligible since et could be overestimated by 45 112 mm under 3 5 irrigations for the wheat growing period which was similar to our irrigation regimes d cannot be ignored in the ncp zhang 2018 therefore simulated d was used for calculating et in the context of accurate simulation of soil moisture dynamics in this work the apex version 1501 was used to simulate the wwsm and em field trials this version includes recent developments such as an improved carbon and nitrogen cycling subroutine izaurralde et al 2006 and water percolation dynamic doro et al 2017 a detailed description of the apex model is provided by gassman et al 2010 and williams et al 2012 several successful cases study was achieved in the ncp based on the apex model and the detail description as shown in zhao et al 2019 soil parameters that may affect soil water content were calibrated simultaneously with the growth and grain yield calibration apex parameters related to rainfall runoff partitioning were adjusted during the calibration phase parm15 runoﬀ curve number weighting factor is used to fine tune the effect of crop residue on the calculation of the curve number cn that in turn affects the estimation of runoff parm16 cn retention parameter is used to estimate the retention parameter s that is related to the cn parm92 runoff volume adjustment for direct link is used to adjust the estimated cn its default value is one values greater than one increase the estimated cn resulting in higher runoff volume while values lower than one reduce the simulated runoff parm15 parm16 and parm92 were calibrated within their ranges of 0 0 3 1 1 5 and 0 1 2 0 respectively in the apex model crop growth module applies the concept of phenological crop development based on daily heat unit accumulation williams et al 1989 potential heat units of early maize summer maize and winter wheat were set to 2100 1900 and 1800 c respectively all apex model input files including weather soil and management data were edited and modified using the apexeditor an excel based tool for editing apex input files osorio leyton 2019 2 4 apex model calibration and validation the apex needs to be calibrated and validated to obtain reliable modeling results from various scenario runs and to understand model uncertainties associated with inputs and model parameters gassman et al 2005 in this study the lai abiom grain yield and vmc data collected from field trials were used for apex calibration and validation model parameters were calibrated manually using a trial error method the dataset was split into two subsets for calibration and validation respectively for wheat and summer maize apex was calibrated and validated for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively for early maize apex was calibrated for the 2012 2015 and then validated using data collected during 2016 2018 five year warm up period was applied to both wwsm and em trials to stabilize the soil organic carbon and nitrogen pools model calibration validation and evaluation procedure were combined with r 3 5 2 r core team 2019 and rstudio 1 2 1335 rstudio team 2018 r packages and functions used for the observed data import and apex model output data import cleaning massaging preparing visualization and statistical analysis are shown in table s3 the default and calibrated values of the winter wheat summer maize and early maize crop parameters are listed in table 1 2 5 simulation scenarios to compare wwsm and em under different water supply four stage based irrigation scenarios were designed namely full irrigation fi critical irrigation ci minimum irrigation mi and rainfed rf details of the irrigation scenarios are shown in table 2 model simulation results were evaluated for grain yield et wue and nwu maize grain yield was converted to wheat equivalent yield ey based on the wheat maize nutrition equivalent ratio of 1 0 708 for comparison of different crops water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as follows 2 wue ey et where ey is the wheat equivalent yield kg ha 1 and et mm is crop seasonal evapotranspiration water stress ws factor is computed by considering water supply and demand in eq 3 3 ws aep ep where aep mm d 1 is the actual plant water use rate and ep mm d 1 is the potential plant water use rate williams et al 2012 ws days i e the duration of water deficit is the accumulated days when water stress occurred nwu was calculated as eq 4 4 nwu i dp where nwu is the net groundwater use mm i is the amount of seasonal or annual irrigation mm dp is the deep percolation mm which is exported from apex model simulation for evaluating the effects of precipitation on et and wue of different crops annual precipitation during 1985 2019 was classified into different category years using empirical frequency analysis efa the precipitation years were divided into three classes wet year normal year and dry year with separating points of 25 50 and 75 probability values respectively detailed steps of the efa method can be found in zhao et al 2020 2 6 model performance evaluation criteria the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and index of agreement d willmott 1981 were applied to evaluate the model performance pbias and d were calculated as follows 5 pbias i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 100 6 d 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i m o i m 2 where o i is the ith observed value p i is the ith predicted value and m is the mean of the measured values the pbias measures the deviation of model simulated values as an underestimation 0 or overestimation 0 of the observed values the value of d ranges from 0 to 1 in which values closer to 1 indicate perfect simulation and a value of zero denotes poor predictability willmott 1981 3 results 3 1 apex calibration and validation in general simulated values of lai abiom and grain yield for winter wheat ww summer maize sm and early maize em were in good agreement with the field observations table 3 evaluation indicators for lai and abiom indicated that model performance was satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 wang et al 2012 during calibration and validation periods with r2 that ranged between 0 68 and 0 98 pbias 25 and d 0 85 table 3 the trend lines of the simulated lai and abiom matched observed crop growth curve well indicating that the calibration and validation results for lai and abiom were acceptable figs s2 s5 the calibrated parameters yielded good agreement between predicted and observed grain yields of the three crops with r2 that ranged from 0 68 to 0 91 pbias 10 and d 0 9 table 3 and fig 2 simulated time series data for vmc in different soil layers of wwsm with different irrigation treatments closely matched measured vmc during calibration and validation periods fig 3 the summary model performance statistics indicate that the simulated vmc were in good agreement with observed values under four irrigation scenarios with r2 0 5 pbias 10 and d 0 83 table 3 moreover the model performance showed a positive correlation with the amount of irrigation especially during the validation period fig 3 the r2 d value and pbias increased from 0 38 0 65 and 23 5 under w0 to 0 77 0 91 and 1 9 under w3 table s4 the model s performances were good in simulating et of wwsm with a high r2 and d value of 0 78 and 0 91 respectively a low pbias of 2 4 during the calibration period and high r2 and d value of 0 95 and 0 98 respectively a low pbias of 0 5 during validation period table 3 and fig s6 3 2 equivalent yield and water stress days the ranges of the simulated ey ws et wue and nwu of wwsm and em under four irrigation scenarios are presented in fig 4 in general ey et wue and nwu decreased and ws was intensified with the reduction in irrigation ey of ww ranged from 6 69 mg ha 1 under fi to 3 17 mg ha 1 under rf with a significant decrease of approximately 1 18 mg ha 1 on average with one irrigation reduction 75 mm moreover there were higher ey variations in restricted irrigation scenarios such as mi and rf fig 4 p 0 001 no significant difference was observed in ey of sm and em among different irrigation scenarios ey of sm and em ranged from 7 84 to 8 20 mg ha 1 and 6 80 to 7 05 mg ha 1 over four irrigation scenarios with an average of 8 03 mg ha 1 and 6 95 mg ha 1 respectively annual ey of wwsm was unaffected by decreasing irrigation from fi to ci but it was significantly reduced from ci to mi and rf fig 4 p 0 001 annual eys of wwsm were 62 79 98 and 108 higher than those of em under rf mi ci and fi respectively ey of the wwsm varied significantly among years showing high yield variations under low irrigation the ws days of ww and wwsm increased considerably when the irrigation regime changed from fi to rf but there was a weaker response in sm and em fig 4 the ws days for ww were 68 30 14 and 3 d under rf mi ci and fi respectively the ws days were significantly lower for sm than ww and ranged from 2 d under fi to 17 d under rf compared with the ws days for sm the ws days for em decreased by 9 8 5 and 2 d under rf mi ci and fi respectively annual ws days for wwsm were 85 40 19 and 5 d under rf mi ci and fi respectively which almost doubled with the decrease in irrigation ws days variation of wwsm among years significantly increased with the decrease in irrigation fig 4 p 0 001 3 3 evapotranspiration water use efficiency and net water use the et of ww and wwsm decreased significantly and its variation among years increased with each irrigation reduction but not much change was observed in sm and em under different irrigation regimes except when the irrigation regime changed from mi to rf fig 4 the highest et for ww was 400 mm under fi and ets under ci mi and rf were 13 31 and 48 lower respectively fig 4 p 0 001 the difference in et among irrigation scenarios was less than 40 mm for both sm and em the average et for em over four irrigation regimes was 80 mm higher than that for sm et for wwsm were 536 631 710 and 765 mm under rf mi ci and fi respectively the reduction in et of wwsm mainly occurred in ww because et of sm was not sensitive to irrigation rainfed em reduced et by 47 to 410 mm compared with wwsm under fi ets of different crops were reduced with the reduction of irrigation across all precipitation category years but greater response was found in the dry years and ww fig s7a the simulated wue decreased slightly for ww and increased slightly for sm wwsm and em fig 4 compared with the wue for ww under fi 17 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 simulated wue for ww under mi and rf decreased by an average of 13 and 18 fig 4 the average wue for sm were 23 5 22 7 22 2 and 21 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 under rf mi ci and fi respectively with an average of 22 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 over irrigation regimes which was 41 higher than the wue for em 16 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 the average wue for wwsm over 35 weather years under four irrigation regimes was 19 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 which was 23 higher than the wue for em the response of wue was inconsistent with different crops irrigation scenarios and precipitation category years fig s7b ww under ci had similar wue with that under fi in the three precipitation category years the wue of sm increased consistently with the reduction of irrigation in both wet and normal years but in dry years irrigation had no significant effect on wue although wues of em in dry years were 4 and 7 lower than that in wet and normal years the wue of em increased consistently with the decreasing of irrigation in all precipitation category years there was a significant decline trend for the nwu of ww and wwsm and a slower decline trend for the nwu of sm and em with the irrigation amount decrease fig 4 ww under fi had the highest nwu with a mean value of 219 mm and a lower variability compared with fi nwu of ww under ci mi and rf decreased significantly by 70 144 and 219 mm respectively fig 4 p 0 001 nwu for sm ranged from 105 mm under fi to 6 mm under rf nwu for em ranged from 38 mm under fi to 50 mm under rf indicating that rainfed em will benefit groundwater recovery in the long run nwu for wwsm under rf mi ci and fi was 7 122 234 and 324 mm respectively the average nwus under rf mi ci and fi were 43 129 217 286 mm lower for em respectively compared with that for wwsm the average nwu for both sm and em had high variability among weather years 4 discussion 4 1 apex model evaluation crop growth and water balance modules of the apex model were evaluated using measured grain yield daily growth and soil water content data collected from field study in the ncp apex simulations of lai abiom and grain yield for maize and wheat were considered reasonable with r2 0 68 pbias 21 and d values close or higher than 0 9 moriasi et al 2007 wang et al 2012 although vmc under wwsm was better estimated under high irrigation volume than lower irrigation amount apex simulations of vmc and et were considered satisfactory model simulation performance showed that vmc during the calibration period was predicted more accurately than that during the validation period tables 3 and s4 timsina and humphreys 2006 and song and jin 2020 also found more accurate and reliable simulations with increased water supply using the dssat model in general low water availability and other biotic stress make accurate simulation of vmc more challenging in crop models saseendran et al 2008 this might be due to the fact that the model is not able to capture the reduced utilization of water stored in deep soil layers by plants with shorter root length and a lower root density as a result of water stress zhang et al 2013 4 2 water saving effect induced by deficit irrigation and shifting cropping system the key to groundwater saving is to optimize the water management of crops which rely heavily on groundwater irrigation for example rice in north west india and alfalfa in california s central valley humphreys et al 2010 stokstad 2020 our results indicated that large water saving potential is concentrated on the irrigation management of ww in the ncp when ci was adopted the annual et and nwu of wwsm were significantly reduced by 7 and 28 to 710 mm and 234 mm respectively without significant yield loss when mi was adopted the annual et and nwu were reduced further to 631 mm and 122 mm irrigation optimization is an effective method for water saving but the reduction is not equal to the amount of water saving and real water saving can be realized only when et is reduced zhang 2018 in other words stage based deficit irrigation has the potential for real water saving and further reduce groundwater pumping to allow aquifers to recover stokstad 2020 according to a statistical modeling result by chen et al 2003 the upper limit of groundwater pumping is 150 mm yr 1 clearly the wwsm cropping system under mi was within this range the average et for em was 450 mm even under fi nearly 100 mm lower than the average annual precipitation the nwus of em under mi and rf were 7 and 50 mm indicating that replacing wwsm with em can replenish groundwater which would result in a rise in the level of water table although pre sowing irrigation is often recommended for em meng et al 2012 it can successfully be planted with natural precipitation events within the wide sowing window yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 therefore em under rf as alternatives to wwsm can meet the need for groundwater balance and crop production and plays an important role in designing water suitable cropping systems hu et al 2019 overall wwsm under ci benefits irrigation water conservation and crop production while wwsm under mi and em under rf are favored to be the alternative options for sustainable groundwater management in the ncp 4 3 yield effect induced by deficit irrigation and shifting cropping system although deficit irrigation and alternative cropping system can reduce water usage there could be a grain yield reduction of various degrees compared with wwsm sun et al 2011 meng et al 2012 luo et al 2018 however our results showed that there is no significant difference between ey of wwsm under ci and that under fi indicating that water stress that occurs during non critical stages has limited influence on crops in wwsm which agrees with the findings reported by zhao et al 2020 and wang et al 2021 ey of wwsm under mi and rf reduces significantly by 2 2 and 3 7 mg ha 1 compared with that under fi surprisingly the yield losses with deficit irrigation mainly occurred for wheat whereas that for maize was much less and was independent on interannual climate variation this is mainly attributable to the synchronization between precipitation water supply and water demand by crops in the past 35 years more than 75 of the total precipitation 547 mm occurred during the summer maize season therefore holst et al 2014 advocated that summer maize can be entirely rainfed winter wheat was the lowest among three crops on grain yields and wue which was consistent with the results reported by zhao et al 2018 and also corroborates the idea that wue is greater for c4 maize than c3 wheat meng et al 2017 our results showed that grain yield of em was 52 lower under fi and 38 lower under rf compared with corresponding wwsm respectively the results in this study are beneficial to sustainable crop and water productivity and the policy making of water price 4 4 alternative cropping systems for groundwater irrigation sustainability groundwater irrigation is essential for attaining food security in most semi arid agro ecological zones and becomes even more important due to more unreliable precipitation under climate change rupérez moreno et al 2017 stokstad 2020 more effort needs to be launched to save the valuable groundwater for the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in overexploited aquifers a crop distribution optimization study conducted by davis et al 2017 showed that the optimized cropping structure would save 12 of irrigation water while providing food for an additional 825 million people at a global scale however at the field scale we found that shifting from wwsm fi to em rf induced 54 yield reduction even though saving 115 of net groundwater use in the high intensified ncp furthermore wwsm under optimized irrigation strategy maintains yield with less groundwater water use thus site specific solutions are required to balance the tradeoff between food demand and groundwater conservation although local dietary habits keep the demand for wheat strong in the ncp the area of cultivated lands for winter wheat production has decreased over the past years as a result of lower input output ratio and economic benefit in the region pei et al 2015 we found that the high yield of wheat relies heavily on groundwater irrigation in all precipitation category years in contrast negligible yield difference was observed in early maize under different irrigation scenarios in other words early maize is more suitable in terms of coupling annual precipitation in addition the large yield potential 16 5 mg ha 1 favored by high summer temperature makes early maize a promising alternative to the current water intensive wwsm meng et al 2012 2013 van oort et al 2016 however some environmental impacts must be considered when wwsm is changed to em firstly soil evaporation 100 200 mm during winter fallow is not beneficial to agricultural production ren et al 2021 secondly winter fallow without mulching of wheat may lead to dust storms in the winter and spring seasons potential solutions are straw mulching subsoiling and plastic film mulching for water conservation and wind erosion control sun et al 2019 therefore implementation of drastic and systematic shifts in cropping systems such as a conversion from wwsm to em can be limited to high risk areas like groundwater severe overdraft regions this study focused on irrigation and crop management for developing groundwater neutral cropping systems similar strategies had been adopted by researchers in other over exploitation regions to mitigate groundwater depletion for example replacing water intensive rice crops with water saving crops such as maize and millets in india humphreys et al 2010 davis et al 2019 changing irrigated crops by rain fed crops in the central high plains scanlon et al 2010 or decreasing the cropping frequency of water intensive crops e g alfalfa and fruits in the california s central valley li et al 2018b stokstad 2020 our results enrich the knowledge of water saving cropping system design for groundwater recovery at the site level nevertheless our findings were based on site level experiment and simulation when studied on the broader scale the results generated may not be exactly the same cropping structure adjustment and irrigation strategy optimization at a regional scale need further exploration to further examine the effects of variability of soil weather and management 5 conclusion for the first time the apex model was calibrated and validated for early maize summer maize and winter wheat with reasonable accuracy in the north china plain with further simulation of winter wheat summer maize wwsm and early maize em cropping system under different irrigation regimes our findings demonstrated that et and net water use of wwsm under ci were reduced by 7 and 28 without yield loss compared with that under fi moreover less intensive irrigation and shifting cropping systems from wwsm to em both resulted in water saving and groundwater sustainability although groundwater balance benefits from the reduction of 17 in et and 62 in net water use ey of wwsm under mi was reduced by 15 to 12 4 mg ha 1 compared with that under fi the yield of em was independent of irrigation 6 8 7 0 mg ha 1 and had much lower interannual variability replacing wwsm fi by em rf resulted in 47 and 115 reduction in et and net water use but also resulted in 54 yield reduction our results demonstrate that the wwsm ci saves irrigation water without yield loss the em rf is the best option for groundwater sustainability but the induced yield reduction should be taken into consideration for national food security the apex model is applicable to relevant modeling research and the results here can be used in the
