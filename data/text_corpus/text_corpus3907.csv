19535,supercritical water oxidation scwo of 41 n containing compounds was examined under a stable temperature and pressure of 450 c and 24 mpa respectively reaction time ranged from 0 5 to 6 min with 500 excess oxygen resulted in the degradation rate constants of total organic carbon k toc and total nitrogen k tn were 0 162 3 693 and 0 065 0 416 min 1 respectively the n containing products were primary n2 ammonium and nitrate as for amino group compounds the main product was ammonia while for nitro group compounds nitrate was the predominant in terms of diazo and n heterocyclic group compounds the main products generally were nitrate and ammonium respectively interestingly 2 3 and 4 nitroaniline containing both of nitro and amino group would directly decompose into n2 the reaction pathways of acid orange 74 was proposed based on fukui indices which generally included denitrification ring open and mineralization density functional theory dft method was applied to calculate the quantum properties of the 41 n containing compounds in order to further examine the relationship between tn removal and molecular structural characteristics the correlation result showed that among all the 17 molecular characteristics f n f n f 0 n and ehomo achieved high correlation coefficients graphical abstract image 1 keywords scwo tn removal ammonia molecular characteristics dft 1 introduction supercritical water oxidation scwo has been considered as a greatly promising process for treating toxic and bio refractory wastes such as wastewater sewage sludge biocides and waste leachate goto et al 1999 baur et al 2005 zou et al 2013 ma et al 2015 among these wastes n containing organic compounds with high toxicity and chemical stability are widely identified from wastewater pesticides dyestuff and chemical industries which lead to both environmental and human health problems keffala and ghrabi 2005 qin et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 the treatment known as supercritical water oxidation consists of the homogeneous oxidation of organic chemicals in an intermediate through the oxidant such as air oxygen or hydrogen peroxide at supercritical conditions t 374 c p 22 1 mpa during scwo process c h n compounds are rapidly oxidized to carbon dioxide water nitrogen and inorganic salts due to there is no generation of nox this green technology is being developed as an alternative to incineration bermejo and cocero 2006 to date some researches on scwo of n containing compounds have been available like aniline nitrophenol indole quinazoline and so on qi et al investigated the destruction of aniline in supercritical water under 400 500 c 25 32 mpa and reaction time of 10 80 s and resulted that toc removal could reach 100 when operating conditions were at 450 c 28 mpa and 46 s qi et al 2002 pérez et al found that the toc of 2 4 dinitrophenol could be almost completely removed under temperature of 500 c a constant pressure of 25 mpa and reaction time of 43 s pérez et al 2004 liu et al explored the nitrogen transformation mechanism of indole during supercritical water conducted with k2co3 as catalyst the results showed that carbon gasification efficiency could reach near 100 at 750 c and 30 min moreover the n containing products were not detected in gaseous samples and the main organic liquid products were phenol and aniline liu et al 2016 lee et al investigated the decomposition of 4 nitroaniline during scw and achieved the activation energy of 128 35 and 159 25 kj mol 1 with and without oxidant respectively at 380 440 c and within 30 s lee et al 1997 however most of present reports focused merely on one or certain n containing compounds total organic carbon toc removal or kinetic data at different operating parameters few researchers focused on the distribution of n containing products like no2 no3 nh4 and n2 which could play an important role on total nitrogen tn removal during scwo according to the study by li and oshima the main products of methylamine were nh3 and n2 after scwo and enhancing temperature or oxygen concentrations could reduce the yields of nh3 li and oshima 2005 gong et al investigated quinazoline in scw and found that without oxygen resulted in low removal efficiencies of toc and tn as well as causing coke formation and generating high concentration of nh3 and nitrogenous organic intermediate products ma et al studied the abatement of aniline during scwo and obtained that ammonia was the exclusive nitrogen containing intermediate ma et al 2012 additionally extending reaction time could remarkably improve tn removal efficiency at temperature over 500 c gong et al 2016 similarly dell orco et al studied the co oxidation of nitrate salts with ammonia in scw the results showed that no3 could react with nh2 radical and generate n2 and nox by hydrogen abstraction the conversion would increase when temperature ranged from 450 to 530 c at 300 bar within 15 s dell orco et al 1997 furthermore a large number of reports indicated that the conversion of ammonia was the rate limiting step in tn removal during scwo and improved temperature and pressure as well as prolonged reaction time could accelerate tn removal lee et al 1997 zhang and hua 2003 al duri et al 2016 killilea et al suggested that ammonia would be mainly converted to n2 when temperature was more than 600 c killilea et al 1992 bermejo et al investigated scwo of feeds with high ammonia concentrations and results indicated that total ammonia removal was possible when temperature increased over 710 c with the addition of isopropyl alcohol bermejo et al 2008 it is necessary to point out that except for n2 the presence of no3 no2 and nh4 as well as org n would contribute to total nitrogen which potentially led to aggravate eutrophication in receiving water as a result it is significant to explore tn removal and conversion mechanism of n containing products during scwo additionally density functional theory dft method has been widely used to explore the chemical reaction mechanism in organic structure and has successfully illuminated some experimental phenomena wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016a b tan et al investigated temperature sensitivity of organic compound destruction during scwo the result of correlation coefficients between temperature behavior and various molecular descriptors based on dft presented that dipole moment had the greatest influence on the oxidation thermodynamics of the organics tan et al 2014 yang et al studied tn removal products and molecular characteristics of 14 n containing compounds in scwo process and found that fukui indices based on oh radical attack f 0 could greatly affect temperature behavior of tn removal yang et al 2017 similarly jia et al also verified that fukui indices were significant factors in removing organic compounds during the fenton process jia et al 2016 in this work 41 n containing organic compounds were selected to better systematically investigate n conversion mechanism in scwo process the 41 compounds were divided into five parts by different n groups 1 nh2 ones like aniline 3 4 dichloroaniline 3 4 dca n n dimethylbenzylamine n n dmba sulfanilamide sn sulfanilic acid sa 4 dimethylaminobenzaldehyde 4 dmaba 5 chloro 2 methylaniline 5 cl 2 ma rhodamine b rb crystal violet cv and basic green bg 2

phen isatin cyanuric acid quinoline pyridine diazine and indole 5 the mixed ones like methyl orange mo eriochrome black t ebt azure b acid orange 74 ao74 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine 2 4 dnph alizarin yellow gg aygg melamine 2 3 and 4 nitroaniline 2 3 and 4 na fig 1 furthermore density functional theory dft method was used to calculate the quantum properties of the 41 compounds in order to further explore the relationship between tn removal and molecular structural characteristics 2 experimental 2 1 apparatus and experimental procedures the scwo schematic diagram was shown in fig 2 the continuous tubular reactor is made of hastelloy alloy whose designed maximum operating pressure and temperature were 40 mpa and 600 c respectively with 2 5 mm id and 2 m long resulted in an approximately effective volume of 10 ml firstly the n containing organic sample and oxidant h2o2 were pumped through two separate pumps at a desired flow rate before mixing at the reactor entrance then the reactor was heated within an electric temperature furnace and could reach the desired temperature in few minutes e g 2 min at 450 c temperatures were measured at the reactor inlet and outlet points to make sure that the temperature along the reactor remained constant the cooling system consisted of a tank with circulating water at room temperature finally a separator was applied to separate gas and liquid effluent after a back pressure regulator gas sample would undergo allochroic silica gel for dewatering before collection by gas collecting bag prior to the experiment the equipment underwent 30 min to keep the balance of temperature and pressure h2o2 30 wt was used in scwo experiments as the oxidant and all reagents were analytic grade it is generally believed that scwo reactions were effective when temperature and pressure are at 400 450 c and 24 mpa respectively which has been successfully implemented in the present reports cocero and martínez 2004 bermejo et al 2006 in this work therefore all experiments were carried out at a constant temperature of 450 c pressure of 24 mpa nevertheless sampling reaction time was designed as 0 5 1 1 5 3 and 6 min the initial concentration was 1 mm for most of target compounds however the saturated solubility of certain compounds like 2 4 dnph and 2 6 dnt was under 1 mm the saturated solution of these compounds therefore was selected to perform the experiments considering the initial concentration was 1 mm or even less 500 excess oxygen was used into this study to keep sufficient oxidation 2 2 materials and analytical methods molecular descriptors of all 41 compounds were calculated using the density functional theory dft method by material studio 6 1 dmol3 gga blyp dnp 3 5 basis and gaussian 09 dft b3lyp 6 311g level 41 n containing compounds structures were optimized by dft b3lyp 6 311g method via gaussian 09 at first secondly a b3lyp function was used to calculate the exchange and correlation terms meanwhile natural population analysis npa of atom charge was achieved by the same way most quantum descriptors at last were obtained directly from the output files such as dipole moment μ most negative or positive partial charge on a nitrogen atom qn most positive partial charge on a hydrogen atom qh most negative or positive partial charge on a carbon atom qc average value of partial charge of all carbon atoms connected to the nitrogen atom q n c most positive partial charge of a hydrogen atom connected to a carbon atom q c h energy of highest occupied molecular orbital ehomo energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital elumo and energy of molecule calculated by b3lyp method e b3lyp fukui indices including f f and f 0 were analyzed via material studio 6 1 fukui indices were key descriptors to predict the decomposition sequence of molecule as well as the site reactive selectively between the reaction pathways therefore the calculations of fukui indices and the localized double numerical basis set with polarization functional dnp were adopted as carried out in dmol3 code in material studio 6 1 meanwhile the self consistent field procedure was implemented with a convergence criterion of 10 6 a u on energy and electron density density mixing and the smearing of electronic occupations were set as 0 2 charge and 0 5 spin as well as 0 005 ha respectively these parameters were successfully conducted into our previous researches ogunsola 1995 jia et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 su et al 2016 in this study f x f x and f 0 x present the maximum values of nucleophilic attack electrophilic attack and oh radical attack respectively f n f n and f 0 n stand for their respective minimum values on main chain carbon atom f 0 n and f 0 n c refer to the maximum values of nitrogen atom and the carbon atom connected to the nitrogen atom respectively measurement of total nitrogen tn nh4 no2 and no3 concentration was using a photometer model spectroquant nova 60 merck limited gas samples like n2 were analyzed by gc tcd agilent technologies 6890 n with alltech ctr 1 column total organic carbon toc was measured by the toc analyzer multi n c 3000 chd all experiments were repeated three times and only the mean values or were shown 3 results and discussion 3 1 toc removal of 41 n containing compounds toc removal efficiencies of 41 n containing compounds at a constant temperature of 450 c and pressure of 24 mpa under diverse reaction times were shown in fig 3 from fig 3 the trends of toc removal enhanced largely with time ranging of 0 5 1 5 min and became to stable after 3 min in general when the reaction time went to 6 min the toc removal efficiencies of most compounds were above 80 and even to 100 which indicated that n containing compounds could be successfully decomposed in scwo process similarly tan et al explored temperature sensitivity of 12 organic compounds decomposition via scwo process the results presented that toc concentration had tended to stabilize after 2 min when temperature reached to near 500 c tan et al 2014 generally compared with the other n groups compounds the diazo ones obtained better toc removal rates it might because dyes themselves structure were easy to destruct using advanced oxidation processes aops zhang et al studied hydrothermal oxidation of dyeing wastewater and found that toc removal efficiency of methyl orange could be up to 97 6 within 15 min at 300 c and 10 mpa zhang et al 2016a b similarly hosseini et al investigated subcritical water oxidation of acid orange 07 a07 and achieved that a07 could be completely decomposed as temperature reached 350 c at 25 mpa with 60 s hosseini et al 2010 hisaindee et al reviewed degradation of dyes during aops the result presented that most of azo compounds could effectively be decomposed via photolysis fenton ozonation or the other aops hisaindee et al 2013 3 2 tn removal of 41 n containing compounds as shown in fig 4 the effect of reaction time on the tn removal for 41 n containing compounds was studied in the range of 0 5 6 min at the experiment condition of 450 c and 24 mpa the tendencies of tn removal showed a sharp improvement when reaction time ranged from 0 5 to 3 min and the trends tended to be stable after 3 min and finally most of the compounds obtained over 50 tn removal efficiencies at 6 min these results were in agreement with those of pinto et al who studied scwo of quinoline and found that tn removal was 50 at around 525 c and 25 mpa pinto et al 2006 comparison of toc removal tn removal rates presented a huge decline as retention time enhanced in order to further compare the removal difference between toc and tn the first order kinetic rate constants of toc and tn from 41 n containing compounds had been presented in table 1 it was obvious that the constants of toc was much higher than those of tn which demonstrated that carbon was more easily to degrade than nitrogen during scwo process al duri and alsoqyani explored scwo for the removal of 1 8 diazabicyclo 5 4 0 undec 7 ene dbu and found that the reaction rate constant of dbu was 0 0697 s 1 at 450 c and 25 mpa with 10 s al duri and alsoqyani 2017 according to the research by benjamin and savage they studied scwo of methylamine the results showed that at 450 c and around 25 mpa the reaction rate constants were 0 021 0 19 and 1 1 s 1 within 120 s benjamin and savage 2005 the diazo and nitro ones in general obtained the best and worst tn degradation rates respectively compared with the other n groups it indicated that diazo linkage n n group was easy to be break down and nitro group was hard to be destructed during scwo process the phenomenon might come from the difference of oxidation level in n atom because scwo process is a severe oxidation it could hardly reduce n atom that have already contained o atoms like nitro group in the study by and and hua they investigated scwo of nitrobenzene and found that nitrate was refractory and its concentration was increased or stable with enhancing temperature or reaction time respectively and and hua 2003 moreover the n containing products such as nh4 and no3 might also affect tn removal it would be discussed detailedly in later section 3 3 distribution of n containing products during scwo the concentration of nitrite was very little or even none from all samples it usually believed that no2 was the product from incomplete oxidation reaction in this work 500 excess of oxygen was applied into all the scwo experiments which resulted that no2 could be oxidized to no3 successfully this result was also in agreement with the previous report by segond et al who examined ammonia in sub and supercritical water oxidation and acquired a trace amount of nitrite under oxidant ratio of 267 segond et al 2002 similar results were found in the study by pérez et al they investigated scwo of 2 4 dinitrophenol with oxygen excess of 34 and resulted that the concentration of no2 was frequently below the detection limit 0 1 mg l 1 pérez et al 2004 as a result n2 org n nh4 and no3 were considered as the main n containing products in this study the n balance was defined as follows nitrogen balance ratio a m o u n t o f t n i n t h e p r o d u c t s a m o u n t o f t n i n t h e i n i t i a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n 100 and detected to be 78 0 101 4 the fluctuant balance values might have been brought by an imperfect experimental parameter and or analysis error at missing nh3 in gas considering of convenient calculation the value of n balance was assumed to 100 via magnifying or minifying by equal proportion in the subsequent results 3 3 1 amino group ones as shown in fig 5 with reaction time increasing the amount of nitrogen and org n tended to improve and decrease respectively as for nh4 and no3 it was evident that the amount of nh4 was much higher than that of no3 which concluded that the predominant n containing product was ammonia from amino group compounds during scwo process this result was also in agreement with the previous findings li and oshima examined scwo of methylamine and resulted that the main products were nh4 and n2 li and oshima 2005 interestingly the yields of nh4 was generally in an order that sa 3 4 dca 5 cl 2 ma aniline which revealed the presence of s and cl atom did improve the amount of ammonia it was well known that s and cl would be converted into h2so4 and hcl respectively during scwo the both strong acids could corrode the hastelloy alloy reactor walls and then transition metal ions like fe3 ni3 cu2 and mn2 would be generated which might play a catalytic role on the conversion of org n into ammonia houser and liu studied scw of chlorides and found that chlorine atom derived from organic chlorides did attack the reactor walls making from inconel or stainless steel then the generating metal ions could accelerate the destruction of target compound houser and liu 1996 3 3 2 nitro group ones from fig 6 predominant no3 and few nh4 were obtained in all retention time conditions which meant that nitrate was the primary n containing product from nitro group compounds after scwo moreover the amount of no3 showed little changes in general with enhancing retention time which manifested that reaction time had little effect on the removal of nitrate during scwo lee and park explored the decomposition of nitrobenzene nb in scw and found that without the oxidant nb firstly converted into benzene via breaking c n bond then n further converted to n2 nitrite as well as nitrate the yield of nitrate did not change as reaction time prolonged lee and park 1996 in terms of 2 and 4 np the nitrate amount of 2 np was higher than that of 4 np which evidenced that ortho nitro might facilitate more no3 than the para according to the report by chang and liu they examined scwo of 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt and found that the ortho nitro of tnt would be replaced firstly then so did the para nitro chang and liu 2007 therefore the nitro from 2 np would easier to be replaced and resulted in the formation of nitrate than that from 4 np 3 3 3 diazo group ones the diazo group compounds achieved successful nitrogen conversion efficiencies within 6 min fig 7 it might conclude that diazo group could be successfully mineralized and produce n2 mainly through scwo process different from refractory chemicals diazo compounds were easily degraded by aops or even bio oxidation process aravind et al 2016 till now few research on decomposition of diazo compounds in scwo has been reported then based on other correlative works focused on aops the results showed that the diazo linkage group was break at first then the aromatic was attacked and result in ring open finally led to mineralization during fenton and photo fenton oxidation lucas and peres 2006 it was noteworthy that the amount of nitrate was approximately equal to that of ammonia firstly and then the proportion of ammonia declined gradually with reaction time prolonging it concluded that the diazo group could largely convert into n2 and the residual n would generate equal amounts of nitrate and ammonia at short reaction time as reaction time prolonged nitrate would hardly to be removed while ammonia was partly converted into n2 3 3 4 heterocyclic group ones as shown in fig 8 the primary product was ammonia for n heterocyclic group compounds with reaction time increasing on the whole the amount of ammonia tended to improve by enhancing retention time in terms of quinoline and pyridine quinoline achieved more n2 and less nh4 than pyridine considering quinoline possesses more hydrocarbon chain it could play as a part of auxiliary fuel in tn removal and might result in the improvement of n2 and the reduction of nh4 during scwo al duri et al explored scwo of dbu a representative n containing heterocyclic hydrocarbon chemical and obtained main product was ammonia al duri et al 2016 additionally cabeza et al examined co oxidation of nh3 and isopropanol ipa in supercritical water and obtained high removal efficiency of ammonia when ipa nh4 ratios were lower than 0 25 cabeza et al 2014 3 3 5 mixed n group ones as can be seen in fig 9 with the increasing of reaction time the ratio of org n and n2 decreased and improved rapidly respectively as to ebt aygg and 2 4 dnph these compounds contained nitro group and resulted in a great deal of nitrate generated it demonstrated that nitro group could probably convert into nitrate and once no3 formed it was hard to be removed by scwo the results were also in agreement with the correlative researches lee and park 1996 pérez et al 2004 for melamine mo azure b ao74 2 3 and 4 na however ammonia was the main product although ao74 possessed a nitro group it also contained diazo and n heterocyclic group which might lead to ammonia as the primary product according to fig 10 and table 2 the f 0 indices value of ao74 was in an order that n 14 n 15 n 8 n 27 n 7 there is now a general consensus that the more f 0 indices value is the easier atom would be attacked in other words n 14 and n 15 were more vulnerable than the other n atoms which indicated that diazo group could probably be attacked by oh radical firstly then the n 8 n 27 and n 7 were attacked orderly in sum n2 was produced from the diazo n 14 and n 15 nitrate was formed by the nitro n 27 ammonia was generated from the n heterocyclic n 7 and n 8 based on these results the conceivable degradation pathway of ao74 was presented fig 11 in brief the reaction pathways of ao74 generally included three parts which were denitrification ring open and mineralization firstly the diazo group n 14 and n 15 was attacked by oh radical and formed n2 then the oh radical would react with the n atoms from heterocyclic group n 7 and n 8 as well as nitro group n 27 and generated ammonia and nitrate respectively secondly the benzene ring was attacked and resulted in ring open finally these intermediate products would further decompose into co2 h2o n2 and salts interestingly according to the above results ammonia and nitrate was mainly from amino and nitro group respectively in terms of 2 3 and 4 na containing the both of amino and nitro group they generated predominant yields of n2 therefore it is noteworthy that amino and nitro group could happen to convert directly into n2 during scwo process moreover the yields of n2 was in an order that 2 na 3 na 4 na which revealed that the nitro and amino in ortho site could be more easily react into n2 than those in meta and para site according to the study by dadsetani and omidi they explored the structures of 3 and 4 na and found that due to the linear structure of 4 na 3 na had more sharp peaks than 4 na which led to 3 na would be more easily to be attacked dadsetani and omidi 2015 therefore the smaller interval between the amino and nitro group was the more easily to interreact which resulted that tn removal efficiency of 2 na was better than that of 3 na and also than that of 4 na 3 4 correlation coefficients of tn removal and molecular characteristics molecular characteristics like dipole moment μ fukui indices and electron affinity have been frequently carried out into quantitative structure activity relationship qsar study thanikaivelan et al 2000 tan et al 2014 here all 41 n containing compounds k tn and their 17 respective molecular characteristics were listed in table s1 the results presented that μ qh q c h elumo ehomo and f x were positively correlated to k tn while e b3lyp qc qn q n c f n f x f n f 0 n f 0 x f 0 n and f 0 n c were negatively correlated to k tn it evidently showed that the importance of the characteristics to k tn under scwo process followed the order f n 0 425 f n 0 417 ehomo 0 415 f 0 n 0 402 q c h 0 352 f 0 n c 0 344 f 0 x 0 289 qh 0 269 μ 0 264 qc 0 255 f 0 n 0 247 e b3lyp 0 135 f x 0 133 q n c 0 067 f x 0 062 elumo 0 023 qn 0 018 as shown in table 3 the four most related molecular characteristics were f n f n f 0 n and ehomo which greatly influenced kinetic rate constant of tn removal fukui indices were the measurement of the ability of electrophilic nucleophilic or radical attack f n f n and f 0 n presented the minimum values of electrophilic attack nucleophilic attack and oh radical attack respectively generally a molecule was susceptible to electrophilic nucleophilic or oh radical attack at sites where the values of f f and f 0 respectively were large it was widely accepted that oh radical was the primary reactants to degrade the organic compounds during scwo treatment meanwhile there were also side reactions like redox reaction happened simultaneously in the time of scwo thus the higher fukui indices value of compound was the easier electrophile nucleophile or oh radical would attack and then the target compound was destructed rapidly resulted in its toc would reduce greatly as presented in figs 3 and 4 when reaction time ranged from 3 to 6 min the toc declined to none in general however the tn removal showed a week descent in the meantime it indicated that without toc namely the part of auxiliary fuel the residual tn would be hardly removed therefore the higher f f and f 0 values resulted in lower tn degradation rates another significant molecular characteristic was ehomo which determined the nucleophilic ability of target compound there is now a general consensus that ehomo could conclude the possibility of a reaction by electrophilic attack karelson et al 1996 in other words a higher value of ehomo would facilitate the oxidizing reaction so that the n atom from target compound would easier to be converted into n2 furthermore the analysis of relationship between k tn and molecular descriptors demonstrated the correlation of degradation rate with oxidation reaction these results were also in agreement with the previous research jia et al investigated fenton oxidation of organic pollutants and found that f 0 and ehomo were the significant molecular descriptors for qsar mode jia et al 2015 4 conclusions scwo is an effective treatment for removing tn especially when reaction time increased the degradation rates of toc was much higher than those of tn which revealed that carbon was more easily to degrade than nitrogen the products of n containing species were mainly n2 ammonium and nitrate during scwo process as for amino group compounds the primary product was ammonia while nitro group compounds nitrate was the predominant in terms of diazo and n heterocyclic group compounds the main products generally were nitrate and ammonium respectively interestingly 2 3 and 4 na containing both of nitro and amino groups would directly decompose into n2 additionally the reaction pathways of ao74 was presented based on fukui indices which generally included denitrification ring open and mineralization the correlationship between k tn and molecular characteristics has been calculated and results showed that f n f n f 0 n and ehomo could greatly influence degradation rate of tn removal acknowledgement this work was supported by the nsfc project

19535,supercritical water oxidation scwo of 41 n containing compounds was examined under a stable temperature and pressure of 450 c and 24 mpa respectively reaction time ranged from 0 5 to 6 min with

primary n2 ammonium and nitrate as for amino group compounds the main product was ammonia while for nitro group compounds nitrate was the predominant in terms of diazo and n heterocyclic group

investigated the destruction of aniline in supercritical water under 400 500 c 25 32 mpa and reaction time of 10 80 s and resulted that toc removal could reach 100 when operating conditions were at

efficiency could reach near 100 at 750 c and 30 min moreover the n containing products were not detected in gaseous samples and the main organic liquid products were phenol and aniline liu et al 2016 lee et al investigated the decomposition of 4 nitroaniline during scw and achieved the activation energy of 128 35 and 159 25 kj mol 1 with and without oxidant respectively at 380 440 c and within 30 s lee et al 1997 however most of present reports focused merely on one or certain n containing compounds total organic carbon toc removal or kinetic data at different operating parameters few researchers focused on the distribution of n containing products like no2 no3 nh4 and n2 which could play an important role on total nitrogen tn removal during scwo according to the study by li and oshima the main products of methylamine were nh3 and n2 after scwo and enhancing temperature or oxygen concentrations could reduce the yields of nh3 li and oshima 2005 gong et al investigated quinazoline in scw and found that without oxygen resulted in low removal efficiencies of toc and tn as well as causing coke formation and generating high concentration of nh3 and nitrogenous organic intermediate products ma et al studied the abatement of aniline during scwo and obtained that ammonia was the exclusive nitrogen containing intermediate ma et al 2012 additionally extending reaction time could remarkably improve tn removal efficiency at temperature over 500 c gong et al 2016 similarly dell orco et al studied the co oxidation of nitrate salts with ammonia in scw the results showed that no3 could react with nh2 radical and generate n2 and nox by hydrogen abstraction the conversion would increase when temperature ranged from 450 to 530 c at 300 bar within 15 s dell orco et al 1997 furthermore a large number of reports indicated that the conversion of ammonia was the rate limiting step in tn removal during scwo and improved temperature and pressure as well as prolonged reaction time could accelerate tn removal lee et al 1997 zhang and hua 2003 al duri et al 2016 killilea et al suggested that ammonia would be mainly converted to n2 when temperature was more than 600 c killilea et al 1992 bermejo et al investigated scwo of feeds with high ammonia concentrations and results indicated that total ammonia removal was possible when temperature increased over 710 c with the addition of isopropyl alcohol bermejo et al 2008 it is necessary to point out that except for n2 the presence of no3 no2 and nh4 as well as org n would contribute to total nitrogen which potentially led to aggravate eutrophication in receiving water as a result it is significant to explore tn removal and conversion mechanism of n containing products during scwo additionally density functional theory dft method has been widely used to explore the chemical reaction mechanism in organic structure and has successfully illuminated some experimental phenomena wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016a b tan et al investigated temperature sensitivity of organic compound destruction during scwo the result of correlation coefficients between temperature behavior and various molecular descriptors based on dft presented that dipole moment had the greatest influence on the oxidation thermodynamics of the organics tan et al 2014 yang et al studied tn removal products and molecular characteristics of 14 n containing compounds in scwo process and found that fukui indices based on oh radical attack f 0 could greatly affect temperature behavior of tn removal yang et al 2017 similarly jia et al also verified that fukui indices were significant factors in removing organic compounds during the fenton process jia et al 2016 in this work 41 n containing organic compounds were selected to better systematically investigate n conversion mechanism in scwo process the 41 compounds were divided into five parts by different n groups 1 nh2 ones like aniline 3 4 dichloroaniline 3 4

phen isatin cyanuric acid quinoline pyridine diazine and indole 5 the mixed ones like methyl orange mo eriochrome black t ebt azure b acid orange 74 ao74 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine 2 4 dnph alizarin yellow gg aygg melamine 2 3 and 4 nitroaniline 2 3 and 4 na fig 1 furthermore density functional theory dft method was used to calculate the quantum properties of the 41 compounds in order to further explore the relationship between tn removal and molecular structural characteristics 2 experimental 2 1 apparatus and experimental procedures the scwo schematic diagram was shown in fig 2 the continuous tubular reactor is made of hastelloy alloy whose designed maximum operating pressure and temperature were 40 mpa and 600 c respectively with 2 5 mm id and 2 m long resulted in an approximately effective volume of 10 ml firstly the n containing organic sample and oxidant h2o2 were pumped through two separate pumps at a desired flow rate before mixing at the reactor entrance then the reactor was heated within an electric temperature furnace and could reach the desired temperature in few minutes e g 2 min at 450 c temperatures were measured at the reactor inlet and outlet points to make sure that the temperature along the reactor remained constant the cooling system consisted of a tank with circulating water at room temperature finally a separator was applied to separate gas and liquid effluent after a back pressure regulator gas sample would undergo allochroic silica gel for dewatering before collection by gas collecting bag prior to the experiment the equipment underwent 30 min to keep the balance of temperature and pressure h2o2 30 wt was used in scwo experiments as the oxidant and all reagents were analytic grade it is generally believed that scwo reactions were effective when temperature and pressure are at 400 450 c and 24 mpa respectively which has been successfully implemented in the present reports cocero and martínez 2004 bermejo et al 2006 in this work therefore all experiments were carried out at a constant temperature of 450 c pressure of 24 mpa nevertheless sampling reaction time was designed as 0 5 1 1 5 3 and 6 min the initial concentration was 1 mm for most of target compounds however the saturated solubility of certain compounds like 2 4 dnph and 2 6 dnt was under 1 mm the saturated solution of these compounds therefore was selected to perform the experiments considering the initial concentration was 1 mm or even less 500 excess oxygen was used into this study to keep sufficient oxidation 2 2 materials and analytical methods molecular descriptors of all 41 compounds were calculated using the density functional theory dft method by material studio 6 1 dmol3 gga blyp dnp 3 5 basis and gaussian 09 dft b3lyp 6 311g level 41 n containing compounds structures were optimized by dft b3lyp 6 311g method via gaussian 09 at first secondly a b3lyp function was used to calculate the exchange and correlation terms meanwhile natural population analysis npa of atom charge was achieved by the same way most quantum descriptors at last were obtained directly from the output files such as dipole moment μ most negative or positive partial charge on a nitrogen atom qn most positive partial charge on a hydrogen atom qh most negative or positive partial charge on a carbon atom qc average value of partial charge of all carbon atoms connected to the nitrogen atom q n c most positive partial charge of a hydrogen atom connected to a carbon atom q c h energy of highest occupied molecular orbital ehomo energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital elumo and energy of molecule calculated by b3lyp method e b3lyp fukui indices including f f and f 0 were analyzed via material studio 6 1 fukui indices were key descriptors to predict the decomposition sequence of molecule as well as the site reactive selectively between the reaction pathways therefore the calculations of fukui indices and the localized double numerical basis set with polarization functional dnp were adopted as carried out in dmol3 code in material studio 6 1 meanwhile the self consistent field procedure was implemented with a convergence criterion of 10 6 a u on energy and electron density density mixing and the smearing of electronic occupations were set as 0 2 charge and 0 5 spin as well as 0 005 ha respectively these parameters were successfully conducted into our previous researches ogunsola 1995 jia et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 su et al 2016 in this study f x f x and f 0 x present the maximum values of nucleophilic attack electrophilic attack and oh radical attack respectively f n f n and f 0 n stand for their respective minimum values on main chain carbon atom f 0 n and f 0 n c refer to the maximum values of nitrogen atom and the carbon atom connected to the nitrogen atom respectively measurement of total nitrogen tn nh4 no2 and no3 concentration was using a photometer model spectroquant nova 60 merck limited gas samples like n2 were analyzed by gc tcd agilent technologies 6890 n with alltech ctr 1 column total organic carbon toc was measured by the toc analyzer multi n c 3000 chd all experiments were repeated three times and only the mean values or were shown 3 results and discussion 3 1 toc removal of 41 n containing compounds toc removal efficiencies of 41 n containing compounds at a constant temperature of 450 c and pressure of 24 mpa under diverse reaction times were shown in fig 3 from fig 3 the trends of toc removal enhanced largely with time ranging of 0 5 1 5 min and became to stable after 3 min in general when the reaction time went to 6 min the toc removal efficiencies of most compounds were above 80 and even to 100 which indicated that n containing compounds could be successfully decomposed in scwo process similarly tan et al explored temperature sensitivity of 12 organic compounds decomposition via scwo process the results presented that toc concentration had tended to stabilize after 2 min when temperature reached to near 500 c tan et al 2014 generally compared with the other n groups compounds the diazo ones obtained better toc removal rates it might because dyes themselves structure were easy to destruct using advanced oxidation processes aops zhang et al studied hydrothermal oxidation of dyeing wastewater and found that toc removal efficiency of methyl orange could be up to 97 6 within 15 min at 300 c and 10 mpa zhang et al 2016a b similarly hosseini et al investigated subcritical water oxidation of acid orange 07 a07 and achieved that a07 could be completely decomposed as temperature reached 350 c at 25 mpa with 60 s hosseini et al 2010 hisaindee et al reviewed degradation of dyes during aops the result presented that most of azo compounds could effectively be decomposed via photolysis fenton ozonation or the other aops hisaindee et al 2013 3 2 tn removal of 41 n containing compounds as shown in fig 4 the effect of reaction time on the tn removal for 41 n containing compounds was studied in the range of 0 5 6 min at the experiment condition of 450 c and 24 mpa the tendencies of tn removal showed a sharp improvement when reaction time ranged from 0 5 to 3 min and the trends tended to be stable after 3 min and finally most of the compounds obtained over 50 tn removal efficiencies at 6 min these results were in agreement with those of pinto et al who studied scwo of quinoline and found that tn removal was 50 at around 525 c and 25 mpa pinto et al 2006 comparison of toc removal tn removal rates presented a huge decline as retention time enhanced in order to further compare the removal difference between toc and tn the first order kinetic rate constants of toc and tn from 41 n containing compounds had been presented in table 1 it was obvious that the constants of toc was much higher than those of tn which demonstrated that carbon was more easily to degrade than nitrogen during scwo process al duri and alsoqyani explored scwo for the removal of 1 8 diazabicyclo 5 4 0 undec 7 ene dbu and found that the reaction rate constant of dbu was 0 0697 s 1 at 450 c and 25 mpa with 10 s al duri and alsoqyani 2017 according to the research by benjamin and savage they studied scwo of methylamine the results showed that at 450 c and around 25 mpa the reaction rate constants were 0 021 0 19 and 1 1 s 1 within 120 s benjamin and savage 2005 the diazo and nitro ones in general obtained the best and worst tn degradation rates respectively compared with the other n groups it indicated that diazo linkage n n group was easy to be break down and nitro group was hard to be destructed during scwo process the phenomenon might come from the difference of oxidation level in n atom because scwo process is a severe oxidation it could hardly reduce n atom that have already contained o atoms like nitro group in the study by and and hua they investigated scwo of nitrobenzene and found that nitrate was refractory and its concentration was increased or stable with enhancing temperature or reaction time respectively and and hua 2003 moreover the n containing products such as nh4 and no3 might also affect tn removal it would be discussed detailedly in later section 3 3 distribution of n containing products during scwo the concentration of nitrite was very little or even none from all samples it usually believed that no2 was the product from incomplete oxidation reaction in this work 500 excess of oxygen was applied into all the scwo experiments which resulted that no2 could be oxidized to no3 successfully this result was also in agreement with the previous report by segond et al who examined ammonia in sub and supercritical water oxidation and acquired a trace amount of nitrite under oxidant ratio of 267 segond et al 2002 similar results were found in the study by pérez et al they investigated scwo of 2 4 dinitrophenol with oxygen excess of 34 and resulted that the concentration of no2 was frequently below the detection limit 0 1 mg l 1 pérez et al 2004 as a result n2 org n nh4 and no3 were considered as the main n containing products in this study the n balance was defined as follows nitrogen balance ratio a m o u n t o f t n i n t h e p r o d u c t s a m o u n t o f t n i n t h e i n i t i a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n 100 and detected to be 78 0 101 4 the fluctuant balance values might have been brought by an imperfect experimental parameter and or analysis error at missing nh3 in gas considering of convenient calculation the value of n balance was assumed to 100 via magnifying or minifying by equal proportion in the subsequent results 3 3 1 amino group ones as shown in fig 5 with reaction time increasing the amount of nitrogen and org n tended to improve and decrease respectively as for nh4 and no3 it was evident that the amount of nh4 was much higher than that of no3 which concluded that the predominant n containing product was ammonia from amino group compounds during scwo process this result was also in agreement with the previous findings li and oshima examined scwo of methylamine and resulted that the main products were nh4 and n2 li and oshima 2005 interestingly the yields of nh4 was generally in an order that sa 3 4 dca 5 cl 2 ma aniline which revealed the presence of s and cl atom did improve the amount of ammonia it was well known that s and cl would be converted into h2so4 and hcl respectively during scwo the both strong acids could corrode the hastelloy alloy reactor walls and then transition metal ions like fe3 ni3 cu2 and mn2 would be generated which might play a catalytic role on the conversion of org n into ammonia houser and liu studied scw of chlorides and found that chlorine atom derived from organic chlorides did attack the reactor walls making from inconel or stainless steel then the generating metal ions could accelerate the destruction of target compound houser and liu 1996 3 3 2 nitro group ones from fig 6 predominant no3 and few nh4 were obtained in all retention time conditions which meant that nitrate was the primary n containing product from nitro group compounds after scwo moreover the amount of no3 showed little changes in general with enhancing retention time which manifested that reaction time had little effect on the removal of nitrate during scwo lee and park explored the decomposition of nitrobenzene nb in scw and found that without the oxidant nb firstly converted into benzene via breaking c n bond then n further converted to n2 nitrite as well as nitrate the yield of nitrate did not change as reaction time prolonged lee and park 1996 in terms of 2 and 4 np the nitrate amount of 2 np was higher than that of 4 np which evidenced that ortho nitro might facilitate more no3 than the para according to the report by chang and liu they examined scwo of 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt and found that the ortho nitro of tnt would be replaced firstly then so did the para nitro chang and liu 2007 therefore the nitro from 2 np would easier to be replaced and resulted in the formation of nitrate than that from 4 np 3 3 3 diazo group ones the diazo group compounds achieved successful nitrogen conversion efficiencies within 6 min fig 7 it might conclude that diazo group could be successfully mineralized and produce n2 mainly through scwo process different from refractory chemicals diazo compounds were easily degraded by aops or even bio oxidation process aravind et al 2016 till now few research on decomposition of diazo compounds in scwo has been reported then based on other correlative works focused on aops the results showed that the diazo linkage group was break at first then the aromatic was attacked and result in ring open finally led to mineralization during fenton and photo fenton oxidation lucas and peres 2006 it was noteworthy that the amount of nitrate was approximately equal to that of ammonia firstly and then the proportion of ammonia declined gradually with reaction time prolonging it concluded that the diazo group could largely convert into n2 and the residual n would generate equal amounts of nitrate and ammonia at short reaction time as reaction time prolonged nitrate would hardly to be removed while ammonia was partly converted into n2 3 3 4 heterocyclic group ones as shown in fig 8 the primary product was ammonia for n heterocyclic group compounds with reaction time increasing on the whole the amount of ammonia tended to improve by enhancing retention time in terms of quinoline and pyridine quinoline achieved more n2 and less nh4 than pyridine considering quinoline possesses more hydrocarbon chain it could play as a part of auxiliary fuel in tn removal and might result in the improvement of n2 and the reduction of nh4 during scwo al duri et al explored scwo of dbu a representative n containing heterocyclic hydrocarbon chemical and obtained main product was ammonia al duri et al 2016 additionally cabeza et al examined co oxidation of nh3 and isopropanol ipa in supercritical water and obtained high removal efficiency of ammonia when ipa nh4 ratios were lower than 0 25 cabeza et al 2014 3 3 5 mixed n group ones as can be seen in fig 9 with the increasing of reaction time the ratio of org n and n2 decreased and improved rapidly respectively as to ebt aygg and 2 4 dnph these compounds contained nitro group and resulted in a great deal of nitrate generated it demonstrated that nitro group could probably convert into nitrate and once no3 formed it was hard to be removed by scwo the results were also in agreement with the correlative researches lee and park 1996 pérez et al 2004 for melamine mo azure b ao74 2 3 and 4 na however ammonia was the main product although ao74 possessed a nitro group it also contained diazo and n heterocyclic group which might lead to ammonia as the primary product according to fig 10 and table 2 the f 0 indices value of ao74 was in an order that n 14 n 15 n 8 n 27 n 7 there is now a general consensus that the more f 0 indices value is the easier atom would be attacked in other words n 14 and n 15 were more vulnerable than the other n atoms which indicated that diazo group could probably be attacked by oh radical firstly then the n 8 n 27 and n 7 were attacked orderly in sum n2 was produced from the diazo n 14 and n 15 nitrate was formed by the nitro n 27 ammonia was generated from the n heterocyclic n 7 and n 8 based on these results the conceivable degradation pathway of ao74 was presented fig 11 in brief the reaction pathways of ao74 generally included three parts which were denitrification ring open and mineralization firstly the diazo group n 14 and n 15 was attacked by oh radical and formed n2 then the oh radical would react with the n atoms from heterocyclic group n 7 and n 8 as well as nitro group n 27 and generated ammonia and nitrate respectively secondly the benzene ring was attacked and resulted in ring open finally these intermediate products would further decompose into co2 h2o n2 and salts interestingly according to the above results ammonia and nitrate was mainly from amino and nitro group respectively in terms of 2 3 and 4 na containing the both of amino and nitro group they generated predominant yields of n2 therefore it is noteworthy that amino and nitro group could happen to convert directly into n2 during scwo process moreover the yields of n2 was in an order that 2 na 3 na 4 na which revealed that the nitro and amino in ortho site could be more easily react into n2 than those in meta and para site according to the study by dadsetani and omidi they explored the structures of 3 and 4 na and found that due to the linear structure of 4 na 3 na had more sharp peaks than 4 na which led to 3 na would be more easily to be attacked dadsetani and omidi 2015 therefore the smaller interval between the amino and nitro group was the more easily to interreact which resulted that tn removal efficiency of 2 na was better than that of 3 na and also than that of 4 na 3 4 correlation coefficients of tn removal and molecular characteristics molecular characteristics like dipole moment μ fukui indices and electron affinity have been frequently carried out into quantitative structure activity relationship qsar study thanikaivelan et al 2000 tan et al 2014 here all 41 n containing compounds k tn and their 17 respective molecular characteristics were listed in table s1 the results presented that μ qh q c h elumo ehomo and f x were positively correlated to k tn while e b3lyp qc qn q n c f n f x f n f 0 n f 0 x f 0 n and f 0 n c were negatively correlated to k tn it evidently showed that the importance of the characteristics to k tn under scwo process followed the order f n 0 425 f n 0 417 ehomo 0 415 f 0 n 0 402 q c h 0 352 f 0 n c 0 344 f 0 x 0 289 qh 0 269 μ 0 264 qc 0 255 f 0 n 0 247 e b3lyp 0 135 f x 0 133 q n c 0 067 f x 0 062 elumo 0 023 qn 0 018 as shown in table 3 the four most related molecular characteristics were f n f n f 0 n and ehomo which greatly influenced kinetic rate constant of tn removal fukui indices were the measurement of the ability of electrophilic nucleophilic or radical attack f n f n and f 0 n presented the minimum values of electrophilic attack nucleophilic attack and oh radical attack respectively generally a molecule was susceptible to electrophilic nucleophilic or oh radical attack at sites where the values of f f and f 0 respectively were large it was widely accepted that oh radical was the primary reactants to degrade the organic compounds during scwo treatment meanwhile there were also side reactions like redox reaction happened simultaneously in the time of scwo thus the higher fukui indices value of compound was the easier electrophile nucleophile or oh radical would attack and then the target compound was destructed rapidly resulted in its toc would reduce greatly as presented in figs 3 and 4 when reaction time ranged from 3 to 6 min the toc declined to none in general however the tn removal showed a week descent in the meantime it indicated that without toc namely the part of auxiliary fuel the residual tn would be hardly removed therefore the higher f f and f 0 values resulted in lower tn degradation rates another significant molecular characteristic was ehomo which determined the nucleophilic ability of target compound there is now a general consensus that ehomo could conclude the possibility of a reaction by electrophilic attack karelson et al 1996 in other words a higher value of ehomo would facilitate the oxidizing reaction so that the n atom from target compound would easier to be converted into n2 furthermore the analysis of relationship between k tn and molecular descriptors demonstrated the correlation of degradation rate with oxidation reaction these results were also in agreement with the previous research jia et al investigated fenton oxidation of organic pollutants and found that f 0 and ehomo were the significant molecular descriptors for qsar mode jia et al 2015 4 conclusions scwo is an effective treatment for removing tn especially when reaction time increased the degradation rates of toc was much higher than those of tn which revealed that carbon was more easily to degrade than nitrogen the products of n containing species were mainly n2 ammonium and nitrate during scwo process as for amino group compounds the primary product was ammonia while nitro group compounds nitrate was the predominant in terms of diazo and n heterocyclic group compounds the main products generally were nitrate and ammonium respectively interestingly 2 3 and 4 na containing both of nitro and amino groups would directly decompose into n2 additionally the reaction pathways of ao74 was presented based on fukui indices which generally included denitrification ring open and mineralization the correlationship between k tn and molecular characteristics has been calculated and results showed that f n f n f 0 n and ehomo could greatly influence degradation rate of tn removal acknowledgement this work was supported by the nsfc project

under prüss üstün et al 2008 wastewater management a un water analytical brief 2015 while methods such as membrane filtration uv irradiation pasteurization chlorination and ozonation have been studied for the treatment of wastewater these treatment practices have seen limited adoption in developing countries due to high investment costs high energy requirements complex maintenance dependence on

provides a scalable low cost low maintenance and energy efficient alternative to current disinfection methods stoner 1973 stoner et al 1982 strong oxidants such as chlorine containing species ccs and

wastewater raut et al 2014 2013 ros have been reported to have greater pathogen inactivation efficiency higher reactivity and no hazardous long term effects chen et al 2017 jeong et al 2006 jeong et al 2009 for instance h2o2 an ros will decompose into water upon exposure to sunlight similarly oh o2 and other ross will also decompose to water if not used for pathogen inactivation or other reactions conversely ccss will often linger in solution when unreacted leading to potentially harmful environmental and physiological side effects background on drinking water standards in the safe drinking water act sdwa 1996 brungs 1973 several electrode materials have been reported to efficiently produce ccs and ros chlorination of blackwater using ccs is a fundamental method of ecd mixed metal oxides mmos bdd and pt electrodes have been shown to be effective chlorine generators for ecd at oxidative potentials martínez huitle et al 2015 martínez huitle and ferro 2006 mmos have been a focus of ecd chen 2004 jeong et al 2009 however the electrochemical properties of these materials such as electroactivity and low over potentials for water electrolysis lead to oxidant production with diminished coulombic efficiency chen 2004 jeong et al 2009 boron doped diamond bdd is a potential electrode material that does not have these deficiencies previous papers have shown that bdd electrodes have low electroactivity a wide solvent window mechanical robustness resistance to corrosion in challenging chemical environments and ability for polarity reversal without degrading the performance of the electrode einaga 2010 einaga et al 2014 fujishima et al 2005 luong et al 2009 macpherson 2015 marselli et al 2003 swain et al 1998 application of bdd as electrochemical electrodes to generate ccs and ros in aqueous environments has also been studied jeong et al 2007 2006 jeong et al 2009 particularly important is the ability of bdd to generate ros with improved efficiency over other electrode materials due to the large over potential needed for water splitting cañizares et al 2002 less expensive and non sp3 carbon based materials such as activated carbon or carbon nanotubes have also been explored as ecd electrodes radjenovic and sedlak 2015 while these materials are easy to synthesize and hold promise as oxygen reduction catalysts chen et al 2017 to form h2o2 they are often unsuitable for use as anodes in ecd systems as they have low oxygen evolution over potentials leading to diminished ccs and oh generation efficiencies compared to bdd despite the promise of bdd there is limited literature investigating its use as an energy efficient electrode for microbial inactivation jeong et al compared bdd to other anodes and found that it was the most efficient in generating ros to inactivate e coli and investigated bacterial inactivation using specific ros jeong et al 2007 2006 jeong et al 2009 it was shown that oh generated at a constant oxidative current density could disinfect e coli with greater efficiency than ccs and other ros however the mechanism of ecd of blackwater using bdd anodes is unclear it may be from chlorination or from production of oh h2o2 o2 and o3 jeong et al jeong et al 2006 jeong et al 2009 attempted to determine the mechanism using multiple disinfection studies by varying the electrolyte and using scavengers they determined that while chlorination can often be the cause for disinfection when using a bdd anode the most kinetically favorable electrochemical pathway to producing ccs is likely indirect oxidation of cl mediated by oh it should be mentioned that these studies did not include reductive generation of h2o2 which is possible from bdd with surface non diamond content such as boron doped ultrananocrystalline diamond bd uncd thostenson et al 2017 ecd of microorganisms has commonly been studied through constant current oxidative methods although potentiometric methods promise greater coulombic efficiency due to targeted ros generation martínez huitle et al 2015 in constant current methods the potential of the cell increases with time to maintain the applied current density often moving the cell potential well beyond the onset of ros generation and into the oxygen evolution reaction oer and or hydrogen evolution reaction sacrificing efficiency for time savings martínez huitle et al 2015 martínez huitle and ferro 2006 unlike constant current and potentiostatic methods potentiodynamic methods provide potentially increased efficiency by keeping the electrode from fouling through reverse polarization and controlling the potential macpherson 2015 in contrast to other bbd electrodes bd uncd electrodes have a unique ability to generate ros in aqueous environments at both anodic and cathodic potentials recently our group reported on generation of oxidants and energy efficient disinfection of e coli using bd uncd electrodes raut et al 2014 2013 thostenson et al 2017 we previously demonstrated that oxidative functionalization of sp2 bonded carbon present on the bd uncd surface can catalyze the reductive generation of h2o2 from dissolved oxygen following the oxygen reduction reaction orr thostenson et al 2017 subsequent potential cycling was shown to create and stabilize these orr catalysts through a potentiodynamic controlled process similar correlations of sp2 and defective carbon structures have been cited to catalyze the orr for h2o2 production chen et al 2017 macpherson 2015 here we report on the benefits of potential cycling a potentiodynamic method for sanitizing blackwater and compare it to potentiostatic methods we focus on potentiometric operation rather than constant current operation to ensure preservation of catalytic functional groups on the surface of bd uncd electrodes by not over oxidizing or over reducing them thostenson et al 2017 moreover we demonstrate that potential cycling between targeted potentials using functionalized bd uncd electrodes in diluted blackwater can decrease the energy needed for disinfection of microbial species functionalized bd uncd electrodes are shown to provide binding sites for improved electrochemical processes subsequent potential cycling of the functionalized bd uncd electrodes serves the dual purposes of maintaining the binding sites and keeping the orr catalysts active through a 24 h study in undiluted blackwater the potential cycling of bd uncd is demonstrated to yield an electrode surface with less fouling and with higher current efficiency compared to potentiostatic methods this work adds to the continuing investigations of orr catalysts using functionalized carbon materials that have the potential to bring a cost effective energy efficient and practical solution to the problem of disinfecting blackwater 2 methods 2 1 electrode fabrication bd uncd films thickness 2 μm on siox si 1 μm 500 μm with geometric areas between 0 5 and 1 5 cm2 were cleaved from a 4 in 10 16 cm ul25 wafer purchased from advanced diamond technologies romeoville il the wafer has a reported surface roughness of 10 nm rms with grain sizes on the order of 3 5 nm and electrical resistivity of 0 1 ω cm cleaved pieces from this wafer were electrically connected to a thin copper wire using silver paste ted pella pn 16031 and front contact made to the bd uncd surface the contact was left to dry on a hot plate at 80 c for several hours the copper wire and paste were then isolated from the electrolyte solution using a glass tube and non conductive epoxy loctite ea 9462 hysol 2 2 electrochemical measurements all measurements were made using a sp 200 bio logic potentiostat prior to testing samples were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and blown dry with ultra high purity n2 gas airgas inc pn ni uhp 300 unless otherwise noted all electrochemical measurements were made in a 2 electrode 100 ml cell where the bd uncd wafer and a pt wire were the working and counter electrodes respectively a 2 electrode cell was used due to space constraints with all indicated potentials being the total cell potential the positive or negative sign indicates whether bd uncd was used as an anode or a cathode respectively the pt counter electrode was also used as a pseudo reference electrode in our conditions its potential remained constant at 0 5 v vs ag agcl in 0 2 m kh2po4 with and without tert butyl alcohol t buoh and 0 5 m h2so4 and 0 4 v vs ag agcl in 0 154 m nacl further information about use of pseudo reference electrodes can be found in inzelt et al 2013 and is common when electrolyte conditions may impair standard reference electrodes as is the case when working with blackwater in our previous publication the indicated potentials in a 2 electrode cell at ph 0 5 were found to be sufficient to produce h2o2 via combination of anodic generated oh or cathodic reduction of dissolved o2 as determined through colorimetry thostenson et al 2017 when possible a 3 electrode system comprised of a standard reference electrode such as ag agcl is preferred and enables more precise measurement of the working electrode potential on a standard scale however in our cell conditions and when working with blackwater in particular there are 2 reasons why use a pseudo reference electrode is preferred first particulate matter from blackwater collecting in the frit of a reference electrode may obstruct accurate measurement of the applied potential second disinfection studies using a 2 electrode cell configuration rather than a 3 electrode cell configuration highlights the applicability of the described potential cycling methods herein to real world systems that do not use a 3 electrode configuration the cell was stirred at a constant 350 rpm throughout the measurements to improve mixing of generated oxidants and microbial species a schematic of the cell can be found in sm fig 1 details regarding a control experiment to validate use of the pt wire as a pseudo reference electrode can be found in the supplementary material including sm fig 2 unless otherwise noted bd uncd was anodized at 2 v in 0 5 m h2so4 for 20 min prior to each measurement 2 3 diluted blackwater experiments diluted blackwater experiments discussed here were the result of 3 experiments per treatment method per electrolyte solution blackwater collection and use blackwater was collected from a prototype toilet system that processes human waste at rti international the details of the toilet prototype and composition of blackwater have been described previously hawkins et al 2017 sellgren et al 2017 blackwater was used within 3 days of its collection to stay within the 1 week time frame that bacterial concentrations were found to be stable in ambient lab conditions dilution of blackwater in electrolytes to shorten the timescale of the experiments and decrease electrode size blackwater was diluted 1 501 in 3 different supporting electrolyte solutions with each chosen for controlled study of different oxidizing species this was done by adding 1 ml of well stirred blackwater to 500 ml of the bulk electrolyte the solution was then stirred for several minutes and bubbled with ultra high purity o2 airgas for 10 min prior to the experiment to ensure oxygen saturation in the solution the 3 electrolyte solutions used were 0 154 m nacl sigma aldrich 0 2 m kh2po4 sigma aldrich and 0 05 m t buoh alfa aesar in 0 2 m kh2po4 the solvent water used was dispensed from a milipore q water system in a control study these solutions were found to have no effect on bacterial stability outside of electrochemical experiments all solutions using diluted blackwater were found to have a ph 7 experimental procedure a static 2 v or 2 v or dynamic 2 v followed by 2 v potential was applied to a bd uncd electrode with respect to a pt wire in diluted blackwater solutions for 45 min the same electrode was used across treatment methods when the electrolyte solution used in the blackwater dilution was changed a new electrode was then used this was done to allow for equal comparison of each treatment method while also limiting the complications of electrode history when changing electrolytes for the potentiodynamic treatment method 2 v was held first for 13 min 20 s followed by 2 v for 1 min 40 s to complete a 15 min cycle this method was optimized to more efficiently produce h2o2 compared to potentiostatic methods in our previous publication thostenson et al 2017 three total cycles were completed within the 45 min treatment time frame the pt wire was separated from the cell by a nylon membrane 0 2 μm sigma aldrich 58060 u to limit the effects of pt on disinfection the cell was continuously stirred at 350 rpm to ensure mixing of microbial pathogens and oxidizing species 1 ml samples of the diluted solution were taken to measure bacterial concentrations prior to treatment t 0 and at t 2 4 6 8 12 14 5 20 30 and 45 min most probable number mpn measurements of the samples were then made within 12 h using refrigerated samples blodgett 2010 lysogeny broth lb agar substrates were used to obtain a total non specific bacterial count from the mpn assay when refrigerated 1 ml samples were found to have stable bacterial concentrations for several days free chlorine was measured using n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine sulfate dpd hach method 8167 and a hach dr 900 colorimeter hach loveland co samples were run per the manufacturer s instructions blanks consisting of the diluted blackwater and electrolyte solutions without the addition of the dpd reagent were run before each measurement with no free chlorine found 2 4 microbial enumeration microbial enumeration measurements using mpn were made according to sellgren et al sellgren et al 2017 reported values are the average of 3 trials and normalized to the initial mpn with each independent trial presented in supplementary material sm figs 4 6 the bars at each data point indicate the standard deviation of the 3 measurements reported values for energy required to disinfect were taken as the average of 3 measurements and indicate the energy used to reach the sanitation technology platform step disinfection threshold 5 mpn ml 1 or the resultant bacterial concentration at the end of each measurement in the case that the step disinfection threshold was not reached these values are shown normalized to the cell suspension volume 100 ml and log reduction of bacteria for comparison between electrolyte solution and experiment 2 5 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps collection x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was conducted using a kratos analytical axis ultra instrument with a monochromated al kα x ray source 1486 69 ev operated at 15 kv and 10 ma 150 w in a 5 10 8 torr chamber survey spectra were collected using an analyzer pass energy of 160 ev and binding energies were collected from 5 to 1200 ev scanned at 1 ev increments each step was integrated for 500 ms and the entire spectrum was averaged across 3 sweeps analysis collected spectra were calibrated and analyzed using casa xps software following best practices as outlined in briggs and grant briggs and grant 2003 all data reported were the average of 3 measurements per sample the xps cl at values were determined by normalizing the integrated cl 2p peak intensity centered at a binding energy of 200 ev to the integrated c 1s and o 1s peak intensity centered at 285 ev and 532 ev respectively shirley background subtraction was used for all peaks 2 6 undiluted blackwater experiments unless otherwise mentioned procedures described in section 2 3 were followed for the undiluted blackwater experiments three bd uncd electrodes were held at 2 v 2 v or switched between these two potentials 2 v treatment method versus a pt wire counter electrode for 24 h in a 20 ml cell of blackwater the cell was stirred at 350 rpm throughout the 24 h change in current density measurements reported for each electrode were made at the first 100 s and last 5 s of treatment 23 59 55 of the format hh mm ss for the 2 v and 2 v methods this measurement was used to signify a decrease in electrode performance resulting from electrode fouling or catalyst depletion for the 2 v treatment method the change in anodic current density was taken as the difference between current density measured at 100 s and at 5 s before the last reduction half cycle 23 58 15 the change in cathodic current density was taken as the difference between the current measured at 100 s after the start of the first cathodic half cycle 00 15 00 which was just before the start of the 2nd potentiodynamic cycle and at 5 s before the end of 24 h treatment 23 59 55 further information regarding the selection of these time points can be found in supplementary material 3 results 3 1 comparison of potentiostatic and potentiodynamic methods in the disinfection of diluted blackwater generation of reactive oxygen species ros and chlorine containing species ccs by potentiostatic 2 v and 2 v and potentiodynamic 2 v methods were compared with different electrolyte solutions as summarized in table 1 the effect of electrolyte solution generation of ccs and ros from bdd and microbial inactivation mechanisms was previously described by jeong et al jeong et al 2006 jeong et al 2009 but will now be briefly summarized nacl 0 154 m electrolyte solution allowed study of disinfection of blackwater when cl h2o and o2 were present in solution to create ccs and ros in this case microbial inactivation was caused by direct redox ccs and ros kh2po4 0 2 m provided the similar conductivity as 0 154 m nacl but allowed study of disinfection of blackwater without addition of cl other than that naturally contained in urine which is 5 6 g l 1 nacl putman 1971 leaving only reactants for ros h2o and o2 present in this case microbial inactivation was accomplished by direct redox and ros addition of t buoh 0 05 m to the kh2po4 solution allowed for the study of disinfection in the absence of cl and oh in this case t buoh scavenged oh such that microbial inactivation happened from direct redox and ros while the effect of oh oxidation of microbial species was largely suppressed each of these cases are discussed in more detail below 3 1 1 disinfection in chloride containing electrolytes fig 1 shows the bacterial inactivation of diluted blackwater in 0 154 m nacl the 2 v treatment has little impact on the reduction of bacterial concentration in the diluted blackwater since the 2 v electrode is only able to generate ros such as h2o2 and o2 from dissolved o2 it is likely that the concentration of dissolved oxygen in solution is too low and that o2 absorption rate in the setup tested is too slow to result in significant disinfection the overpotential of the 2 v treatment was well beyond the onset of the orr found to be 0 7 v vs ag agcl in our conditions so it is unlikely the absence of disinfection was due to insufficient overpotential still it may be related to diminished electrode kinetics since bd uncd is a poor orr electrode when the non diamond content at the surface is not appropriately functionalized for the 2 v and 2 v treatments the disinfection was rapid both reducing bacterial concentrations by 3 orders of magnitude in the first 2 6 min of treatment the disinfection required little energy per log reduction of microbial concentration with both the 2 v and 2 v treatment methods using only 57 μw h l log n0 n from our previous work thostenson et al 2017 pre treatment of bd uncd electrodes in 0 5 m h2so4 was hypothesized to have been responsible for the rapid and energy efficient disinfection of the anodic methods by improving the generation of disinfecting ccs seen in fig 1 reaction pathways of forming disinfecting ccs from reaction of oh with ccs from bdd anodes is well reported in literature with a great overview of the potential reaction pathways presented in polcaro et al polcaro et al 2009 as described in polcaro et al polcaro et al 2009 bdd anodes in chloride containing electrolytes can generate hclo directly or can generate clo2 clo3 ros by secondary reaction with oh all of the species are strong oxidizers and disinfecting species to test the hypothesis that pre treatment of bd uncd can improve the generation of ccs different pre treatments of bd uncd electrodes were made and the resultant chlorine content on each electrode was measured using xps to indirectly quantify the adsorbed ccs content present on the surface it was found that ccs are only present on the electrode when a positive voltage is applied to the bd uncd electrodes in a 0 154 m nacl solution fig 2a pre treatment of bd uncd in 0 5 m h2so4 for 20 min at anodic potentials was found to further increase ccs adsorption in 0 154 m nacl by partially oxidizing surface sp2 carbon bonds leading to functional sites at the surface of bd uncd electrodes that serve as adsorption sites as previously mentioned bd uncd has a significant amount of surface sp2 bonded carbon bd uncd that is free of non diamond content i e sp2 is effectively unable to adsorb surface chemical species macpherson 2015 patten et al 2012 proper oxidation at 2 v vs pt of the non diamond surface carbon can create an optimal concentration of oxygenated functional sites we previously showed how such functional groups can be created and maintained for catalysis of the orr thostenson et al 2017 as seen in fig 2a a lesser or greater potential than 2 v vs pt diminishes this adsorption effect this is likely due to under oxidation of the non diamond carbon in the 1 v experiments and removal of the non diamond carbon in the 3 v experiments ayres et al 2016 hutton et al 2013 thostenson et al 2017 on the one hand under oxidation 2 v vs pt wire of non diamond carbon on bd uncd electrode surfaces diminishes adsorption by leaving the surface in its native h terminated surface which is hydrophobic macpherson 2015 on the other hand over oxidation 2 v vs pt wire of the non diamond carbon will create an o terminated surface that is hydrophilic but has less conductive double bonded carbon oxygen functional groups at the surface or has removed the non diamond carbon entirely bennett et al 2004 macpherson 2015 williams 2011 in both 1 v and 3 v experiments this results in diminished ccs adsorption compared to the 2 v because there is a lesser concentration of appropriately oxygenated functional groups on the bd uncd electrode surface further study revealed that potential cycling significantly increased the generated concentration of ccs by maintaining an increased concentration of adsorbed cl on the bd uncd surface this is shown in fig 2b where the 2 v potential cycling method produced more free chlorine per electrode area than the 2 v and 2 v potentiostatic methods the increased free chlorine generation from the 2 v method indicated that reverse polarization and continued regeneration of the functional groups significantly increased the generation of ccs as stated in the methods section no residual chlorine was found in solution prior to electrolysis moreover the ph for all diluted blackwater solutions was ph 7 so volatilization of free chlorine should be minimal as has been reported previously in literature schaefer et al 2017 a proposed mechanism of increased ccs generation resulting from appropriate pre treatment and potential cycling is shown in fig 3 pre treatment of the bd uncd electrode surface in 0 5 m h2so4 plays a vital role in how well cl adsorbs summarized as follows step 1 oxidation in h2so4 creates oxygenated functional groups on non diamond content on the bd uncd surface thostenson et al 2017 step 2 anodic polarization of the functionalized electrode in cl containing solutions in this work 0 154 m nacl leads to the adsorption of cl anions on the oxygenated functional groups created in step 1 step 3 continued anodic polarization at sufficient over potentials in aqueous solutions will generate oh that reacts with the adsorbed cl yielding ccs step 4 reverse polarization to a cathodic potential discharges ccs from the electrode surface and reactivates oxygenated functional group catalysts since oh radicals are short lived with very short diffusion lengths the generation rate of ccs is much higher with cl ions in close proximity and high concentration near the electrode surface than if cl ions were not adsorbed i e dispersed in solution bd uncd without appropriately functionalized non diamond carbon on the surface is unable to adsorb cl due to lack of adsorption sites this is evidenced by the 3 v h2so4 2 v nacl method in fig 2a potential cycling more specifically reverse polarization increases ccs generation as shown in step 4 of fig 3 there are two possible reasons for the increased ccs generation first adsorbed ccs content that is discharged from the electrode surface during the negative half cycle of the potential cycling method the ccs are then dispersed into solution leading to a higher free chlorine concentration second reverse polarization of the bd uncd electrode surface regenerates the functionalized non diamond carbon catalyst for increased free chlorine generation while these results were promising the data gave neither direct insight into the role of ros in disinfection of blackwater nor did they highlight key differences between potentiostatic and potentiodynamic methods since there was a significant concentration of ccs generated and disinfection was rapid comparison with a cl free electrolyte solution was needed to give mechanistic insight moreover the time scale of disinfection was too rapid to distinguish potentiostatic and potentiodynamic methods by removing cl the role of ros on disinfection from potentionstatic versus potentiodynamic methods could be more directly studied 3 1 2 disinfection in chloride free electrolytes to determine the effect of ros generated and their rate from the potentiodynamic compared to potentiostatic methods kh2po4 was employed to provide a chlorine free electrolyte solution fig 4 shows the disinfection of diluted blackwater in 0 2 m kh2po4 as can be seen in fig 4 the potentiodynamic method 2 v red circles was able to reach the sanitation technology platform step disinfection threshold and decrease microbial species concentration by 1 5 orders of magnitude below the potentiostatic method 2 v blue squares and 2 v green triangles during the 45 min treatment at 2 v in an aqueous electrolyte oh is generated by a bd uncd electrode which can lead to indirect generation of other ros such as h2o2 o3 and o2 jeong et al 2006 these second order ros were considered responsible for inactivation of microbial species in the 2 v and 2 v treatment methods jeong et al demonstrated that h2o2 is the only second order ros generated from bdd at anodic potentials to have an impact on bacterial reduction jeong et al 2006 jeong et al 2009 at 2 v there is only the generation of h2o2 via reduction of dissolved oxygen in the 2 v treatment method h2o2 is not only generated at a cathodic potential but also at an anodic potential via combination of oh the 2 v treatment method also generates h2o2 at an anodic potential through combination of oh but does not reduce dissolved oxygen for formation of h2o2 despite the different reaction pathways in generating h2o2 the potentiostatic methods 2 v and 2 v seen in fig 4 resulted in very similar disinfection curves suggesting h2o2 was largely responsible for the disinfection as it was the only ros shared by the two methods the impact of h2o2 on disinfection is further demonstrated by the 2 v treatment method which both reaches the disinfection threshold fig 4 and does so more efficiently table 2 than the other methods among other reasons described in the proceeding paragraphs the generation of h2o2 from the 2 v treatment method was previously shown to be higher and more efficient than the other static methods 2 v and 2 v with coulombic efficiencies approaching 23 and 50 for the 2 v and 2 v potentials respectively thostenson et al 2017 conversely and under different conditions jeong et al have shown that oh is likely responsible for the disinfection of e coli when using anodic potentials on bdd jeong et al 2009 jeong et al 2006 and ruled out the contributions of h2o2 from bdd at anodic potentials by adding h2o2 to an e coli solution as part of a control experiment since blackwater was treated instead of e coli in this study this difference as well as other cell conditions that differ with jeong et al could explain why we found h2o2 to be an effective oxidizer of microbial species the potentiodynamic method 2 v red circles seen in fig 4 shows improved disinfection over the potentiostatic treatment methods for three possible reasons first potential cycling leads to the continuous charging and discharging of the electrode electrolyte double layer this leads to an increased number of adsorbed species on the electrode surface over time which can result in a higher probability of direct reduction oxidation redox of microbial species and generation of oxidants compared to potentiostatic methods second the anodic over potential in water creates o2 in high concentration at the electrode surface this o2 is likely to adsorb at non diamond carbon functional groups created by oxidative pre treatment in 0 5 m h2so4 when the electrode is cycled to a reducing potential the o2 is readily available at the electrode for reduction to h2o2 following the oxygen reduction reaction this process is similar to that proposed in thostenson et al thostenson et al 2017 and to that of the electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop which require o2 injected at the electrode surface for reduction to h2o2 at higher efficiencies martínez huitle and ferro 2006 third potential cycling of bd uncd between 2 v and 2 v vs pt wire creates and maintains catalytic functional groups for the reductive generation of h2o2 from dissolved oxygen we previously described this catalytic process thostenson et al 2017 a proposed new eaop process from potential cycling of bd uncd in water based electrolytes is illustrated in fig 5 diamond does not have the binding sites needed for the orr while non diamond and functionalized carbon do as indicated by their adsorption properties macpherson 2015 pre treatment of the non diamond carbon in 0 5 m h2so4 at 2 v functionalizes the non diamond carbon present at the bd uncd surface step 1 fig 5 proper functionalization of the bd uncd surface was shown earlier in this paper to improve adsorption of cl and subsequently improve ccs generation in the case of a cl free electrolyte the functional groups adsorb o2 rather than cl at 2 v step 2 fig 5 cathodic polarization at 2 v in h2o reduces the o2 to form h2o2 step 3 fig 5 applying an anodic potential at 2 v again generates oxygen that adsorbs onto the functional groups as described previously thostenson et al 2017 oxygenated functional groups occurring on non diamond carbon such as sp2 bonded carbon on the surface of bd uncd provide enhanced oxygen reduction kinetics the energy savings resulting from this eaop process in cl free electrolyte solutions can be seen in table 2 which reports the energy required to disinfect diluted blackwater potential cycling has a net energy savings of 24 and 124 compared to the 2 v and 2 v treatment methods respectively when oh is present table 2 middle column to determine what effect oh had on disinfection 0 05 m t buoh was added to a 1 501 dilution of blackwater in 0 2 m kh2po4 t buoh is a well known oh scavenger that will quickly react with oh in solution to mitigate the role of oh in disinfection jeong et al 2009 jeong et al 2006 table 2 right column demonstrate the detriment of removing oh as a disinfecting ros the 3 treatment methods showed diminished inactivation efficiency of microbial species in diluted blackwater this result indicates a strong dependence on the anodic generation of ros and their dispersal into solution for disinfection there are two reasons this is the case first anodically generated ros such as oh or the further reaction of oh to form h2o2 o3 and o2 is largely suppressed by the t buoh which will scavenge oh this results in a diminished concentration of ros in the bulk solution for disinfection of microbial species in addition scavenging oh likely inhibits the oxidation of functional groups on the bd uncd surface fig 5 steps 2 and 4 which is important to the effectiveness of the 2 v potential cycling method as previously discussed oxygenated functional groups serve as adsorption sites for o2 and catalysts for o2 reduction to h2o2 upon cathodic polarization fig 5 step 3 second direct redox of microbial species is a small part of the overall disinfection seen in figs 1 and 4 direct redox is the only uninhibited inactivation mechanism when t buoh was added to the kh2po4 and blackwater solution table 2 right column indicates that removing oh as a direct oxidant of microbial species has a detrimental effect on disinfection energy efficiency and largely limits the ability to disinfect blackwater as can also be seen in sm fig 6 taken together these data support the conclusion of jeong et al jeong et al 2006 jeong et al 2009 that bacterial inactivation by oh is energy efficient and effective 3 2 comparison of electrode fouling effects from treatment methods in undiluted blackwater the potentiostatic and potentiodynamic methods were used to treat undiluted blackwater for 24 h so that their performance over time could be compared potentiostatic electrolysis commonly leads to diminished electrode current densities due to the accumulation of a resistive film on the electrode surface known as fouling schmalz et al 2009 through reverse polarization the film can be removed and the electrode returned to its original current density bdd electrodes have been cited to be stable under reverse polarization macpherson 2015 vinokur et al 1996 williams 2011 following 24 h electrolysis no reduction in microbial species was measured see sm fig 7 for disinfection curves likely resultant from high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand and the electrolysis period being too short however differences in current densities before and after 24 h electrolysis between the treatment methods were found and are summarized in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the potentiostatic 2 v and 2 v methods result in current densities at the end of the treatment that are roughly 70 less than their initial steady state current density the anodic and cathodic current density of the 2 v treatment decreases only 40 during the 24 h treatment much less than the potentiostatic methods the difference between the potentiostatic methods compared to the potentiodynamic method lies in the fact that the continued potential cycling of the of the 2 v treatment reverse polarizes the electrode and discharges the accumulated film the higher anodic and cathodic current densities for a given time and potential means improved electrolysis efficiency compared to the potentiostatic treatments as mentioned before these energy saving benefits are important to ecd of blackwater moreover frequently servicing an electrode in an operating environment can be problematic and impractical minimizing fouling of an electrode surface decreases electrode maintenance and allows for a more cost effective and long term solution thus the proposed potentiodynamic method has direct benefits to improving ecd of blackwater across the evolving field of decentralized wastewater treatment 4 conclusions here we report on the benefits of potential cycling a potentiodynamic method in sanitizing blackwater and compared it to two potentiostatic methods it was demonstrated that potential cycling of functionalized bd uncd electrodes in diluted blackwater can save on energy expenditure required for disinfection of microbial species functionalization of bd uncd electrodes through potential cycling is shown to provide binding sites for improved electrochemical processes subsequent potential cycling of the functionalized bd uncd electrodes serves the dual purpose of maintaining these binding sites which can become fouled with time as well as keeping their catalytic properties active through a 24 h study in undiluted blackwater the potential cycling of bd uncd is demonstrated to yield a more energy efficient disinfection process compared to two other potentiostatic methods this work adds to the continuing investigations of oxygen reduction reaction orr catalysts and

to generate ccs and ros in aqueous environments has also been studied jeong et al 2007 2006 jeong et al 2009 particularly important is the ability of bdd to generate ros with improved efficiency over

have also been explored as ecd electrodes radjenovic and sedlak 2015 while these materials are easy to synthesize and hold promise as oxygen reduction catalysts chen et al 2017 to form h2o2 they are often unsuitable for use as anodes in ecd systems as they have low oxygen evolution over potentials leading to diminished ccs and oh generation efficiencies compared to bdd despite the promise of bdd there is limited literature investigating its use as an energy efficient electrode for microbial inactivation jeong et al compared bdd to other anodes and found that it was the most efficient in generating ros to inactivate e coli and investigated bacterial inactivation using specific ros jeong et al 2007 2006 jeong et al 2009 it was shown that oh generated at a constant oxidative current density could disinfect e coli with greater efficiency than ccs and other ros however the mechanism of ecd of blackwater using bdd anodes is unclear it may be from chlorination or from production of oh h2o2 o2 and o3 jeong et al jeong et al 2006 jeong et al 2009 attempted to determine the mechanism using multiple disinfection studies by varying the electrolyte and using scavengers they determined that while chlorination can often be the cause for disinfection when using a bdd anode the most kinetically favorable electrochemical pathway to producing ccs is likely indirect oxidation of cl mediated by oh it should be mentioned that these studies did not include reductive generation of h2o2 which is possible from bdd with surface non diamond content such as boron doped ultrananocrystalline diamond bd uncd thostenson et al 2017 ecd of microorganisms has commonly been studied through constant current oxidative methods although potentiometric methods promise greater coulombic efficiency due to targeted ros generation martínez huitle et al 2015 in constant current methods the potential of the cell increases with time to maintain the applied current density often moving the cell potential well beyond the onset of ros generation and into the oxygen evolution reaction oer and or hydrogen evolution reaction sacrificing efficiency for time savings martínez huitle et al 2015 martínez huitle and ferro 2006 unlike constant current and potentiostatic methods potentiodynamic methods provide potentially increased efficiency by keeping the electrode from fouling through reverse polarization and controlling the potential macpherson 2015 in contrast to other bbd electrodes bd uncd electrodes have a unique ability to generate ros in aqueous environments at both anodic and cathodic potentials recently our group reported on generation of oxidants and energy efficient disinfection of e coli using bd uncd electrodes raut et al 2014 2013 thostenson et al 2017 we previously demonstrated that oxidative functionalization of sp2 bonded carbon present on the bd uncd surface can catalyze the reductive generation of h2o2 from dissolved oxygen following the oxygen reduction reaction orr thostenson et al 2017 subsequent potential cycling was shown to create and stabilize these orr catalysts through a potentiodynamic controlled process similar correlations of sp2 and defective carbon structures have been cited to catalyze the orr for h2o2 production chen et al 2017 macpherson 2015 here we report on the benefits of potential cycling a potentiodynamic method for sanitizing blackwater and compare it to potentiostatic methods we focus on potentiometric operation rather than constant current operation to ensure preservation of catalytic functional groups on the surface of bd uncd electrodes by not over oxidizing or over reducing them thostenson et al 2017 moreover we demonstrate that potential cycling between targeted potentials using functionalized bd uncd electrodes in diluted blackwater can decrease the energy needed for disinfection of microbial species functionalized bd uncd electrodes are shown to provide binding sites for improved electrochemical processes subsequent potential cycling of the functionalized bd uncd electrodes serves the dual purposes of maintaining the binding sites and keeping the orr catalysts active through a 24 h study in undiluted blackwater the potential cycling of bd uncd is demonstrated to yield an electrode surface with less fouling and with higher current efficiency compared to potentiostatic methods this work adds to the continuing investigations of orr catalysts using functionalized carbon materials that have the potential to bring a cost effective energy efficient and practical solution to the problem of disinfecting blackwater 2 methods 2 1 electrode fabrication bd uncd films thickness 2 μm on siox si 1 μm 500 μm with geometric areas between 0 5 and 1 5 cm2 were cleaved from a 4 in 10 16 cm ul25 wafer purchased from advanced diamond technologies romeoville il the wafer has a reported surface roughness of 10 nm rms with grain sizes on the order of 3 5 nm and electrical resistivity of 0 1 ω cm cleaved pieces from this wafer were electrically connected to a thin copper wire using silver paste ted pella pn 16031 and front contact made to the bd uncd surface the contact was left to dry on a hot plate at 80 c for several hours the copper wire and paste were then isolated from the electrolyte solution using a glass tube and non conductive epoxy loctite ea 9462 hysol 2 2 electrochemical measurements all measurements were made using a sp 200 bio logic potentiostat prior to testing samples were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and blown dry with ultra high purity n2 gas airgas inc pn ni uhp 300 unless otherwise noted all electrochemical measurements were made in a 2 electrode 100 ml cell where the bd uncd wafer and a pt wire were the working and counter electrodes respectively a 2 electrode cell was used due to space constraints with all indicated potentials being the total cell potential the positive or negative sign indicates whether bd uncd was used as an anode or a cathode respectively the pt counter electrode was also used as a pseudo reference electrode in our conditions its potential remained constant at 0 5 v vs ag agcl in 0 2 m kh2po4 with and without tert butyl alcohol t buoh and 0 5 m h2so4 and 0 4 v vs ag agcl in 0 154 m nacl further information about use of pseudo reference electrodes can be found in inzelt et al 2013 and is common when electrolyte conditions may impair standard reference electrodes as is the case when working with blackwater in our previous publication the indicated potentials in a 2 electrode cell at ph 0 5 were found to be sufficient to produce h2o2 via combination of anodic generated oh or cathodic reduction of dissolved o2 as determined through colorimetry thostenson et al 2017 when possible a 3 electrode system comprised of a standard reference electrode such as ag agcl is preferred and enables more precise measurement of the working electrode potential on a standard scale however in our cell conditions and when working with blackwater in particular there are 2 reasons why use a pseudo reference electrode is preferred first particulate matter from blackwater collecting in the frit of a reference electrode may obstruct accurate measurement of the applied potential second disinfection studies using a 2 electrode cell configuration rather than a 3 electrode cell configuration highlights the applicability of the described potential cycling methods herein to real world systems that do not use a 3 electrode configuration the cell was stirred at a constant 350 rpm throughout the measurements to improve mixing of generated oxidants and microbial species a schematic of the cell can be found in sm fig 1 details regarding a control experiment to validate use of the pt wire as a pseudo reference electrode can be found in the supplementary material including sm fig 2 unless otherwise noted bd uncd was anodized at 2 v in 0 5 m h2so4 for 20 min prior to each measurement 2 3 diluted blackwater experiments diluted blackwater experiments discussed here were the result of 3 experiments per treatment method per electrolyte solution blackwater collection and use blackwater was collected from a prototype toilet system that processes human waste at rti international the details of the toilet prototype and composition of blackwater have been described previously hawkins et al 2017 sellgren et al 2017 blackwater was used within 3 days of its collection to stay within the 1 week time frame that bacterial concentrations were found to be stable in ambient lab conditions dilution of blackwater in electrolytes to shorten the timescale of the experiments and decrease electrode size blackwater was diluted 1 501 in 3 different supporting electrolyte solutions with each chosen for controlled study of different oxidizing species this was done by adding 1 ml of well stirred blackwater to 500 ml of the bulk electrolyte the solution was then stirred for several minutes and bubbled with ultra high purity o2 airgas for 10 min prior to the experiment to ensure oxygen saturation in the solution the 3 electrolyte solutions used were 0 154 m nacl sigma aldrich 0 2 m kh2po4 sigma aldrich and 0 05 m t buoh alfa aesar in 0 2 m kh2po4 the solvent water used was dispensed from a milipore q water system in a control study these solutions were found to have no effect on bacterial stability outside of electrochemical experiments all solutions using diluted blackwater were found to have a ph 7 experimental procedure a static 2 v or 2 v or dynamic 2 v followed by 2 v potential was applied to a bd uncd electrode with respect to a pt wire in diluted blackwater solutions for 45 min the same electrode was used across treatment methods when the electrolyte solution used in the blackwater dilution was changed a new electrode was then used this was done to allow for equal comparison of each treatment method while also limiting the complications of electrode history when changing electrolytes for the potentiodynamic treatment method 2 v was held first for 13 min 20 s followed by 2 v for 1 min 40 s to complete a 15 min cycle this method was optimized to more efficiently produce h2o2 compared to potentiostatic methods in our previous publication thostenson et al 2017 three total cycles were completed within the 45 min treatment time frame the pt wire was separated from the cell by a nylon membrane 0 2 μm sigma aldrich 58060 u to limit the effects of pt on disinfection the cell was continuously stirred at 350 rpm to ensure mixing of microbial pathogens and oxidizing species 1 ml samples of the diluted solution were taken to measure bacterial concentrations prior to treatment t 0 and at t 2 4 6 8 12 14 5 20 30 and 45 min most probable number mpn measurements of the samples were then made within 12 h using refrigerated samples blodgett 2010 lysogeny broth lb agar substrates were used to obtain a total non specific bacterial count from the mpn assay when refrigerated 1 ml samples were found to have stable bacterial concentrations for several days free chlorine was measured using n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine sulfate dpd hach method 8167 and a hach dr 900 colorimeter hach loveland co samples were run per the manufacturer s instructions blanks consisting of the diluted blackwater and electrolyte solutions without the addition of the dpd reagent were run before each measurement with no free chlorine found 2 4 microbial enumeration microbial enumeration measurements using mpn were made according to sellgren et al sellgren et al 2017 reported values are the average of 3 trials and normalized to the initial mpn with each independent trial presented in supplementary material sm figs 4 6 the bars at each data point indicate the standard deviation of the 3 measurements reported values for energy required to disinfect were taken as the average of 3 measurements and indicate the energy used to reach the sanitation technology platform step disinfection threshold 5 mpn ml 1 or the resultant bacterial concentration at the end of each measurement in the case that the step disinfection threshold was not reached these values are shown normalized to the cell suspension volume 100 ml and log reduction of bacteria for comparison between electrolyte solution and experiment 2 5 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps collection x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was conducted using a kratos analytical axis ultra instrument with a monochromated al kα x ray source 1486 69 ev operated at 15 kv and 10 ma 150 w in a 5 10 8 torr chamber survey spectra were collected using an analyzer pass energy of 160 ev and binding energies were collected from 5 to 1200 ev scanned at 1 ev increments each step was integrated for 500 ms and the entire spectrum was averaged across 3 sweeps analysis collected spectra were calibrated and analyzed using casa xps software following best practices as outlined in briggs and grant briggs and grant 2003 all data reported were the average of 3 measurements per sample the xps cl at values were determined by normalizing the integrated cl 2p peak intensity centered at a binding energy of 200 ev to the integrated c 1s and o 1s peak intensity centered at 285 ev and 532 ev respectively shirley background subtraction was used for all peaks 2 6 undiluted blackwater experiments unless otherwise mentioned procedures described in section 2 3 were followed for the undiluted blackwater experiments three bd uncd electrodes were held at 2 v 2 v or switched between these two potentials 2 v treatment method versus a pt wire counter electrode for 24 h in a 20 ml cell of blackwater the cell was stirred at 350 rpm throughout the 24 h change in current density measurements reported for each electrode were made at the first 100 s and last 5 s of treatment 23 59 55 of the format hh mm ss for the 2 v and 2 v methods this measurement was used to signify a decrease in electrode performance resulting from electrode fouling or catalyst depletion for the 2 v treatment method the change in anodic current density was taken as the difference between current density measured at 100 s and at 5 s before the last reduction half cycle 23 58 15 the change in cathodic current density was taken as the difference between the current measured at 100 s after the start of the first cathodic half cycle 00 15 00 which was just before the start of the 2nd potentiodynamic cycle and at 5 s before the end of 24 h treatment 23 59 55 further information regarding the selection of these time points can be found in supplementary material 3 results 3 1 comparison of potentiostatic and potentiodynamic methods in the disinfection of diluted blackwater generation of reactive oxygen species ros and chlorine containing species ccs by potentiostatic 2 v and 2 v and potentiodynamic 2 v methods were compared with different electrolyte solutions as summarized in table 1 the effect of electrolyte solution generation of ccs and ros from bdd and microbial inactivation mechanisms was previously described by jeong et al jeong et al 2006 jeong et al 2009 but will now be briefly summarized nacl 0 154 m electrolyte solution allowed study of disinfection of blackwater when cl h2o and o2 were present in solution to create ccs and ros in this case microbial inactivation was caused by direct redox ccs and ros kh2po4 0 2 m provided the similar conductivity as 0 154 m nacl but allowed study of disinfection of blackwater without addition of cl other than that naturally contained in urine which is 5 6 g l 1 nacl putman 1971 leaving only reactants for ros h2o and o2 present in this case microbial inactivation was accomplished by direct redox and ros addition of t buoh 0 05 m to the kh2po4 solution allowed for the study of disinfection in the absence of cl and oh in this case t buoh scavenged oh such that microbial inactivation happened from direct redox and ros while the effect of oh oxidation of microbial species was largely suppressed each of these cases are discussed in more detail below 3 1 1 disinfection in chloride containing electrolytes fig 1 shows the bacterial inactivation of diluted blackwater in 0 154 m nacl the 2 v treatment has little impact on the reduction of bacterial concentration in the diluted blackwater since the 2 v electrode is only able to generate ros such as h2o2 and o2 from dissolved o2 it is likely that the concentration of dissolved oxygen in solution is too low and that o2 absorption rate in the setup tested is too slow to result in significant disinfection the overpotential of the 2 v treatment was well beyond the onset of the orr found to be 0 7 v vs ag agcl in our conditions so it is unlikely the absence of disinfection was due to insufficient overpotential still it may be related to diminished electrode kinetics since bd uncd is a poor orr electrode when the non diamond content at the surface is not appropriately functionalized for the 2 v and 2 v treatments the disinfection was rapid both reducing bacterial concentrations by 3 orders of magnitude in the first 2 6 min of treatment the disinfection required little energy per log reduction of microbial concentration with both the 2 v and 2 v treatment methods using only 57 μw h l log n0 n from our previous work thostenson et al 2017 pre treatment of bd uncd electrodes in 0 5 m h2so4 was hypothesized to have been responsible for the rapid and energy efficient disinfection of the anodic methods by improving the generation of disinfecting ccs seen in fig 1 reaction pathways of forming disinfecting ccs from reaction of oh with ccs from bdd anodes is well reported in literature with a great overview of the potential reaction pathways presented in polcaro et al polcaro et al 2009 as described in polcaro et al polcaro et al 2009 bdd anodes in chloride containing electrolytes can generate hclo directly or can generate clo2 clo3 ros by secondary reaction with oh all of the species are strong oxidizers and disinfecting species to test the hypothesis that pre treatment of bd uncd can improve the generation of ccs different pre treatments of bd uncd electrodes were made and the resultant chlorine content on each electrode was measured using xps to indirectly quantify the adsorbed ccs content present on the surface it was found that ccs are only present on the electrode when a positive voltage is applied to the bd uncd electrodes in a 0 154 m nacl solution fig 2a pre treatment of bd uncd in 0 5 m h2so4 for 20 min at anodic potentials was found to further increase ccs adsorption in 0 154 m nacl by partially oxidizing surface sp2 carbon bonds leading to functional sites at the surface of bd uncd electrodes that serve as adsorption sites as previously mentioned bd uncd has a significant amount of surface sp2 bonded carbon bd uncd that is free of non diamond content i e sp2 is effectively unable to adsorb surface chemical species macpherson 2015 patten et al 2012 proper oxidation at 2 v vs pt of the non diamond surface carbon can create an optimal concentration of oxygenated functional sites we previously showed how such functional groups can be created and maintained for catalysis of the orr thostenson et al 2017 as seen in fig 2a a lesser or greater potential than 2 v vs pt diminishes this adsorption effect this is likely due to under oxidation of the non diamond carbon in the 1 v experiments and removal of the non diamond carbon in the 3 v experiments ayres et al 2016 hutton et al 2013 thostenson et al 2017 on the one hand under oxidation 2 v vs pt wire of non diamond carbon on bd uncd electrode surfaces diminishes adsorption by leaving the surface in its native h terminated surface which is hydrophobic macpherson 2015 on the other hand over oxidation 2 v vs pt wire of the non diamond carbon will create an o terminated surface that is hydrophilic but has less conductive double bonded carbon oxygen functional groups at the surface or has removed the non diamond carbon entirely bennett et al 2004 macpherson 2015 williams 2011 in both 1 v and 3 v experiments this results in diminished ccs adsorption compared to the 2 v because there is a lesser concentration of appropriately oxygenated functional groups on the bd uncd electrode surface further study revealed that potential cycling significantly increased the generated concentration of ccs by maintaining an increased concentration of adsorbed cl on the bd uncd surface this is shown in fig 2b where the 2 v potential cycling method produced more free chlorine per electrode area than the 2 v and 2 v potentiostatic methods the increased free chlorine generation from the 2 v method indicated that reverse polarization and continued regeneration of the functional groups significantly increased the generation of ccs as stated in the methods section no residual chlorine was found in solution prior to electrolysis moreover the ph for all diluted blackwater solutions was ph 7 so volatilization of free chlorine should be minimal as has been reported previously in literature schaefer et al 2017 a proposed mechanism of increased ccs generation resulting from appropriate pre treatment and potential cycling is shown in fig 3 pre treatment of the bd uncd electrode surface in 0 5 m h2so4 plays a vital role in how well cl adsorbs summarized as follows step 1 oxidation in h2so4 creates oxygenated functional groups on non diamond content on the bd uncd surface thostenson et al 2017 step 2 anodic polarization of the functionalized electrode in cl containing solutions in this work 0 154 m nacl leads to the adsorption of cl anions on the oxygenated functional groups created in step 1 step 3 continued anodic polarization at sufficient over potentials in aqueous solutions will generate oh that reacts with the adsorbed cl yielding ccs step 4 reverse polarization to a cathodic potential discharges ccs from the electrode surface and reactivates oxygenated functional group catalysts since oh radicals are short lived with very short diffusion lengths the generation rate of ccs is much higher with cl ions in close proximity and high concentration near the electrode surface than if cl ions were not adsorbed i e dispersed in solution bd uncd without appropriately functionalized non diamond carbon on the surface is unable to adsorb cl due to lack of adsorption sites this is evidenced by the 3 v h2so4 2 v nacl method in fig 2a potential cycling more specifically reverse polarization increases ccs generation as shown in step 4 of fig 3 there are two possible reasons for the increased ccs generation first adsorbed ccs content that is discharged from the electrode surface during the negative half cycle of the potential cycling method the ccs are then dispersed into solution leading to a higher free chlorine concentration second reverse polarization of the bd uncd electrode surface regenerates the functionalized non diamond carbon catalyst for increased free chlorine generation while these results were promising the data gave neither direct insight into the role of ros in disinfection of blackwater nor did they highlight key differences between potentiostatic and potentiodynamic methods since there was a significant concentration of ccs generated and disinfection was rapid comparison with a cl free electrolyte solution was needed to give mechanistic insight moreover the time scale of disinfection was too rapid to distinguish potentiostatic and potentiodynamic methods by removing cl the role of ros on disinfection from potentionstatic versus potentiodynamic methods could be more directly studied 3 1 2 disinfection in chloride free electrolytes to determine the effect of ros generated and their rate from the potentiodynamic compared to potentiostatic methods kh2po4 was employed to provide a chlorine free electrolyte solution fig 4 shows the disinfection of diluted blackwater in 0 2 m kh2po4 as can be seen in fig 4 the potentiodynamic method 2 v red circles was able to reach the sanitation technology platform step disinfection threshold and decrease microbial species concentration by 1 5 orders of magnitude below the potentiostatic method 2 v blue squares and 2 v green triangles during the 45 min treatment at 2 v in an aqueous electrolyte oh is generated by a bd uncd electrode which can lead to indirect generation of other ros such as h2o2 o3 and o2 jeong et al 2006 these second order ros were considered responsible for inactivation of microbial species in the 2 v and 2 v treatment methods jeong et al demonstrated that h2o2 is the only second order ros generated from bdd at anodic potentials to have an impact on bacterial reduction jeong et al 2006 jeong et al 2009 at 2 v there is only the generation of h2o2 via reduction of dissolved oxygen in the 2 v treatment method h2o2 is not only generated at a cathodic potential but also at an anodic potential via combination of oh the 2 v treatment method also generates h2o2 at an anodic potential through combination of oh but does not reduce dissolved oxygen for formation of h2o2 despite the different reaction pathways in generating h2o2 the potentiostatic methods 2 v and 2 v seen in fig 4 resulted in very similar disinfection curves suggesting h2o2 was largely responsible for the disinfection as it was the only ros shared by the two methods the impact of h2o2 on disinfection is further demonstrated by the 2 v treatment method which both reaches the disinfection threshold fig 4 and does so more efficiently table 2 than the other methods among other reasons described in the proceeding paragraphs the generation of h2o2 from the 2 v treatment method was previously shown to be higher and more efficient than the other static methods 2 v and 2 v with coulombic efficiencies approaching 23 and 50 for the 2 v and 2 v potentials respectively thostenson et al 2017 conversely and under different conditions jeong et al have shown that oh is likely responsible for the disinfection of e coli when using anodic potentials on bdd jeong et al 2009 jeong et al 2006 and ruled out the contributions of h2o2 from bdd at anodic potentials by adding h2o2 to an e coli solution as part of a control experiment since blackwater was treated instead of e coli in this study this difference as well as other cell conditions that differ with jeong et al could explain why we found h2o2 to be an effective oxidizer of microbial species the potentiodynamic method 2 v red circles seen in fig 4 shows improved disinfection over the potentiostatic treatment methods for three possible reasons first potential cycling leads to the continuous charging and discharging of the electrode electrolyte double layer this leads to an increased number of adsorbed species on the electrode surface over time which can result in a higher probability of direct reduction oxidation redox of microbial species and generation of oxidants compared to potentiostatic methods second the anodic over potential in water creates o2 in high concentration at the electrode surface this o2 is likely to adsorb at non diamond carbon functional groups created by oxidative pre treatment in 0 5 m h2so4 when the electrode is cycled to a reducing potential the o2 is readily available at the electrode for reduction to h2o2 following the oxygen reduction reaction this process is similar to that proposed in thostenson et al thostenson et al 2017 and to that of the electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop which require o2 injected at the electrode surface for reduction to h2o2 at higher efficiencies martínez huitle and ferro 2006 third potential cycling of bd uncd between 2 v and 2 v vs pt wire creates and maintains catalytic functional groups for the reductive generation of h2o2 from dissolved oxygen we previously described this catalytic process thostenson et al 2017 a proposed new eaop process from potential cycling of bd uncd in water based electrolytes is illustrated in fig 5 diamond does not have the binding sites needed for the orr while non diamond and functionalized carbon do as indicated by their adsorption properties macpherson 2015 pre treatment of the non diamond carbon in 0 5 m h2so4 at 2 v functionalizes the non diamond carbon present at the bd uncd surface step 1 fig 5 proper functionalization of the bd uncd surface was shown earlier in this paper to improve adsorption of cl and subsequently improve ccs generation in the case of a cl free electrolyte the functional groups adsorb o2 rather than cl at 2 v step 2 fig 5 cathodic polarization at 2 v in h2o reduces the o2 to form h2o2 step 3 fig 5 applying an anodic potential at 2 v again generates oxygen that adsorbs onto the functional groups as described previously thostenson et al 2017 oxygenated functional groups occurring on non diamond carbon such as sp2 bonded carbon on the surface of bd uncd provide enhanced oxygen reduction kinetics the energy savings resulting from this eaop process in cl free electrolyte solutions can be seen in table 2 which reports the energy required to disinfect diluted blackwater potential cycling has a net energy savings of 24 and 124 compared to the 2 v and 2 v treatment methods respectively when oh is present table 2 middle column to determine what effect oh had on disinfection 0 05 m t buoh was added to a 1 501 dilution of blackwater in 0 2 m kh2po4 t buoh is a well known oh scavenger that will quickly react with oh in solution to mitigate the role of oh in disinfection jeong et al 2009 jeong et al 2006 table 2 right column demonstrate the detriment of removing oh as a disinfecting ros the 3 treatment methods showed diminished inactivation efficiency of microbial species in diluted blackwater this result indicates a strong dependence on the anodic generation of ros and their dispersal into solution for disinfection there are two reasons this is the case first anodically generated ros such as oh or the further reaction of oh to form h2o2 o3 and o2 is largely suppressed by the t buoh which will scavenge oh this results in a diminished concentration of ros in the bulk solution for disinfection of microbial species in addition scavenging oh likely inhibits the oxidation of functional groups on the bd uncd surface fig 5 steps 2 and 4 which is important to the effectiveness of the 2 v potential cycling method as previously discussed oxygenated functional groups serve as adsorption sites for o2 and catalysts for o2 reduction to h2o2 upon cathodic polarization fig 5 step 3 second direct redox of microbial species is a small part of the overall disinfection seen in figs 1 and 4 direct redox is the only uninhibited inactivation mechanism when t buoh was added to the kh2po4 and blackwater solution table 2 right column indicates that removing oh as a direct oxidant of microbial species has a detrimental effect on disinfection energy efficiency and largely limits the ability to disinfect blackwater as can also be seen in sm fig 6 taken together these data support the conclusion of jeong et al jeong et al 2006 jeong et al 2009 that bacterial inactivation by oh is energy efficient and effective 3 2 comparison of electrode fouling effects from treatment methods in undiluted blackwater the potentiostatic and potentiodynamic methods were used to treat undiluted blackwater for 24 h so that their performance over time could be compared potentiostatic electrolysis commonly leads to diminished electrode current densities due to the accumulation of a resistive film on the electrode surface known as fouling schmalz et al 2009 through reverse polarization the film can be removed and the electrode returned to its original current density bdd electrodes have been cited to be stable under reverse polarization macpherson 2015 vinokur et al 1996 williams 2011 following 24 h electrolysis no reduction in microbial species was measured see sm fig 7 for disinfection curves likely resultant from high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand and the electrolysis period being too short however differences in current densities before and after 24 h electrolysis between the treatment methods were found and are summarized in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the potentiostatic 2 v and 2 v methods result in current densities at the end of the treatment that are roughly 70 less than their initial steady state current density the anodic and cathodic current density of the 2 v treatment decreases only 40 during the 24 h treatment much less than the potentiostatic methods the difference between the potentiostatic methods compared to the potentiodynamic method lies in the fact that the continued potential cycling of the of the 2 v treatment reverse polarizes the electrode and discharges the accumulated film the higher anodic and cathodic current densities for a given time and potential means improved electrolysis efficiency compared to the potentiostatic treatments as mentioned before these energy saving benefits are important to ecd of blackwater moreover frequently servicing an electrode in an operating environment can be problematic and impractical minimizing fouling of an electrode surface decreases electrode maintenance and allows for a more cost effective and long term solution thus the proposed potentiodynamic method has direct benefits to improving ecd of blackwater across the evolving field of decentralized wastewater treatment 4 conclusions here we report on the benefits of potential cycling a potentiodynamic method in sanitizing blackwater and compared it to two potentiostatic methods it was demonstrated that potential cycling of functionalized bd uncd electrodes in diluted blackwater can save on energy expenditure required for disinfection of microbial species functionalization of bd uncd electrodes through potential cycling is shown to provide binding sites for improved electrochemical processes subsequent potential cycling of the functionalized bd uncd electrodes serves the dual purpose of maintaining these binding sites which can become fouled with time as well as keeping their catalytic properties active through a 24 h study in undiluted blackwater the potential cycling of bd uncd is demonstrated to yield a more energy efficient disinfection process compared to two other potentiostatic methods this work adds to the continuing investigations of oxygen reduction reaction orr catalysts and

developing countries they have to be easy to use safe cheap and sustainable with the environmental situation at the point of use mcguigan et al 2012 fewtrell et al 2005 clasen et al 2007 solar disinfection sodis is a process in which the potential of solar light is used to disinfect drinking water this developing process takes advantage of the ability of solar light to kill pathogens through genome damages and intracellular oxidative reactions giannakis 2018 and can be enhanced by the addition of various chemicals optimizing of container volume and exposure to solar light mcguigan et al 2012 kehoe et al 2001 in the sodis context processes such as solar assisted advanced oxidation processes aops present great potential the aops use the potential of a chemical oxidant species to disinfect water by inactivating potentially pathogenic species such as bacteria viruses or yeasts giannakis et al 2016 2016c 2017a 2017b and degrading various harmful organic contaminants to treat drinking water a widely studied aop is the photo fenton pf process in which hydroxyl radicals ho are generated using light iron and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and act as oxidant species in the treatment of water giannakis et al 2016a b photo fenton process can be carried out using solar light enhancing the efficiency of sodis given that fe is almost omnipresent in natural waters and h2o2 can be added and or is in situ generated vione et al 2014 sulfate radicals so4 as hydroxyl radicals present a great potential for an alternative advanced oxidation treatment for water devi et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 in comparison with photo fenton process where hydrogen peroxide is the initiator of hydroxyl radical species sulfate radicals can be generated in different pathways from peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds both acting as initiators oh et al 2016 these initiators have to be activated in order to generate sulfate radicals moreover the sulfate radicals redox potential is close to hydroxyl radicals 2 6 v ghanbari and moradi 2017 liang et al 2008 which makes so4 a good candidate for water treatment there are many activation factors such as heat ji et al 2015 tsitonaki et al 2008 light cui et al 2016 garkusheva et al 2017 transition metals oh et al 2016 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 rodríguez chueca et al 2017a and others each of them with specific efficiencies table 1 summarizes the known activators of pds the interest in using sulfate radicals instead of ho arises from characteristics which are favorable to the use of sulfate based radicals such as the selectivity to oxidation anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 yu et al 2016 and also the higher stability compared to h2o2 that allows the initiator to diffuse at wider lengths in the subsurface before microorganism activation so far a significant amount of works has been published on contaminant removal using sulfate radicals and treating large variety of compounds such as pharmaceuticals ahmed et al 2012 alcohols oh et al 2009 and others the by products generated depend on the contaminants present but the other species produced co2 h2o and so4 2 are harmless this makes the process interesting for application in drinking water treatment compared to organic contaminants the effect of sulfate radicals on microorganisms is much less studied the effectiveness of transition metal uv activated processes on escherichia coli inactivation is reported for different water conditions garkusheva et al 2017 rodríguez chueca et al 2017b sun et al 2016 there is however an important lack of studies on solar and mild thermal chemical activation of persulfate for bacterial disinfection which given the nature of the in situ sodis treatment would be greatly beneficial in this study the enhancement of the sodis process using sulfate radicals in mild conditions is evaluated solar light low amounts of iron and mild heat activation of sodium peroxydisulfate na2s2o8 are investigated to build a combined process where these three factors are optimized to disinfect simulated contaminated drinking water escherichia coli in the context of point of use technology in developing countries the effect of the most commonly encountered parameters such as reactant concentrations organic matter presence and the use of natural iron oxides as iron source is also studied the combined process for bacterial disinfection is compared to the well known photo fenton aop and briefly evaluated on virus and micropollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents chemicals and reagents were used as

sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen dsmz no 498 as bacterial species this strain is non pathogenic and allows a good approximation of wild type e coli which is a well known indicator bacterium for enteric pathogens e coli strain storage is assured in cryo vials containing 20 glycerol at 20 c bacterial pre cultures are obtained by spreading 20 μl of the strain onto plate count agar pca merck followed by 24 h incubation at 37 c heraeus instruments a grown colony is then re plated and spread on a new pca plate and incubated for additional 24 h at 37 c this 48 h process results in a master plate which is stored at 4 c and can be used during about 2 weeks in order to prepare bacterial stock solution from the master plate luria bertani lb broth is first prepared and then heat sterilized in an autoclave a colony from the master plate is then inoculated into a sterile pe eppendorf flask containing 5 ml of the lb broth prepared the flask is agitated aerobically for 8 h at 750 rpm and under a temperature of 37 c then 2 5 ml are extracted from the eppendorf flask and diluted into a sterile 500 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 250 ml of lb broth the erlenmeyer is agitated aerobically for 15 h at 750 rpm and 37 c to ensure stationary phase achievement of the bacterial population two 25 ml samples of the obtained solution are centrifuged hermle z 323 k renggli laboratory systems for 15 min at 5000 rpm and 4 c the harvested bacterial cells are then washed using saline solution and re centrifuged 5 min at 5000 rpm and 4 c twice final bacterial pellets are suspended in 25 ml of saline solution forming a stock solution which is stored at 4 c and can be used for about 10 days the e coli k12 stock solution produced within this process has a concentration estimated to approximately 109 cfu ml in order to follow bacterial population evolution against time 1 ml samples are regularly withdrawn and plated on plates containing pca before plating samples are properly diluted to ensure measurable counts of colonies ideally 15 150 colonies per plate colony forming units are manually counted after 24 h incubation at 37 c this method results in a detection limit of 10 cfu ml for undiluted samples 2 3 2 ms2 bacteriophage the ms2 bacteriophage used as a model enteric viral pathogen was acquired from dsmz no 13767 the preparation of the strain involved propagation of the virus in 1 l luria bertani broth 0 2 streptomycin was present containing the host e coli and its incubation at 37 c the od600 was followed and upon reaching 0 4 the ms2 were introduced and incubated for 5 h e coli were then lysed with chloroform and purification of the dispersion resulted in 1012 pfu ml concentration of infective bacteriophages working solutions were created in a ph 8 cbs carbonate buffer solution 0 1 mm nahco3 and 15 mm nacl and spiking took place at 106 pfu ml for experimentation the bacterial host e coli dsmz 5695 was also acquired from dsmz and is a lambda derivative of escherichia coli strain k 12 with low streptomycin resistance its propagation and cultivation is identical to k12 before experimentation 100 μl of a 109 cfu ml solution were incubated overnight in 10 ml lb solution and the resulting dispersion was used for ms2 quantification 100 μl were added to 100 μl sample and then ms2 were enumerated by pour plated by the double layer agar method dal epa method 1602 2 4 micropollutants determination for the enumeration of the micropollutants an online spe uplc ms ms acquity xevo tq waters method was used interested readers should see giannakis et al 2015 giannakis et al 2016c briefly the process involved acidification of the samples at ph 2 with hcl and spiking with a standard mixture of the surrogate contaminants in deuterated form filtration preceded loading on spe column oasis hlb 25 μm 2 1 20 mm waters with acidified 1 formic acid ultrapure water as eluent the column used was acquity hss t3 1 8 μm 2 1 100 mm waters and elution took place with a gradient of ultrapure water and acetonitrile acidified at 0 1 of formic acid finally detection of the micropollutants was achieved with multiple reaction monitoring and quantification was done with calibration by internal standards 2 5 experimental strategy as presented in the introduction main purpose of this work is to investigate bacterial inactivation using sulfate radicals generated through peroxydisulfate activation to do so 150 ml of milliq water containing approximately 106 cfu ml of e coli are prepared and exposed to various experimental conditions and bacterial population evolution in time is monitored firstly the potential of pds to inactivate e coli without any activation factor is evaluated at different concentrations secondly the potential of each activation factor simulated solar light iron and heat to activate pds is separately evaluated following couples of activation factors are used to evaluate potential synergies in the activation of pds for water disinfection finally the three activation factors are used together to optimize a combined process this combined process cp is evaluated with different pds concentrations and compared to photo fenton process complementary experiments are done coupling pds with hydrogen peroxide adding natural organic matter nom and using iron oxides as iron sources furthermore some conditions are reproduced on water contaminated with viruses or micropollutants to compare their efficiencies with the bacterial inactivation evaluation of hydroxyl radical participation to the combined process is made using tert butanol as scavenger sun et al 2016 in order to compare inactivation under the various conditions pseudo first order rate constants reported as k min 1 are estimated by linear regression fitting of the plots in origin 9 0 pro for windows the evaluation of synergistic effects when combining activation factors is made using the rate constants and the subsequent calculation a synergistic factor spuhler et al 2010 1 s h ν f e k h ν f e k h ν k f e 2 s h ν 40 c k h ν 40 c k h ν k 40 c 3 s f e 40 c k f e 40 c k f e k 40 c 4 s h ν f e 40 c k h ν f e 40 c k h ν k f e k 40 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 blank experiments no pds activation to assess the effects of peroxydisulfate pds anions themselves reactions with different pds concentrations are run without applying any activation factor 20 c dark no iron for the tested concentrations of peroxydisulfate the bacterial population remains stable within the 5 h of experimentation the two concentrations evaluated 1 8 10 5 m and 9 10 5 m present no observable differences on e coli inactivation according to those results peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 seems not capable of e coli inactivation by itself without activation means within the range of concentrations studied 3 2 evaluation of the pds activation factors single activation iron solar light and heat are evaluated separately to assess their potential for pds activation simulated solar light is used at a fixed irradiance 900 w m2 while iron is evaluated at 1 mg l of fe2 three temperature levels are tested in a range achievable in the context of a water solution exposed to daylong solar light 30 c 40 c and 50 c the mechanism of pds activation by the three isolated factors under study owes to either energy heat light or electron transfer fe once activated the sulfate radicals initiate a series of reactions involving other radicals e g ho and reactive intermediates e g h s o 5 eqs 5 9 waldemer et al 2007 5 s o 4 h 2 o h o h s o 4 2 6 2 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 7 s o 4 h o h s o 5 8 2 h o h 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 s o 4 2 o 2 in fig 1 a iron is shown to activate pds similarly to other transition metals used such as co and mn anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 rodríguez chueca et al 2017b and is subject to the following efficiency mn2 v3 ce3 fe2 ru3 co2 ghanbari and moradi 2017 however our results suggest that a 1 1 or 1 2 ratio between fe2 and pds is not appropriate to generate sulfate radicals or at least to generate them in an effective amount at this iron addition level a 1 5 ratio is appropriate for lower ratios the potential of iron species to act as scavengers may also influence the outcome as such we note a requirement to use a higher pds ratio matzek and carter 2016 the electron transfer taking place can be represented with the following general reaction eq 10 10 s 2 o 8 2 m n m n 1 s o 4 2 s o 4 and in the specific case of fe2 we get the activation and scavenging reactions eqs 11 and 12 11 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 s o 4 s o 4 2 12 s o 4 f e 2 f e 3 s o 4 2 furthermore in the specific operational starting ph 6 5 fe remains soluble and in fe2 form for a relatively limited time hence the homogeneous fe2 activation of pds is gradually converted to oxide mediated one this may indicate the opportunity directly use iron oxides and form a heterogeneous activation reaction these parameters will be further presented in the next sections as for the solar light activation experiments in fig 1b the baseline solar damage was limited the lowest pds concentration does not inflict enhancement in disinfection however an improvement is observed initially with 3 6 10 5 m the solar generated sulfate radicals normally react with the biomolecules of the bacterial cell wall such as the lipids and polysaccharides present leading to their inactivation sun et al 2016 the shoulder shape of the inactivation curves indicate that the bacteria can sustain a level of sulfate radical mediated damages prior to inactivation devi et al 2016 ghanbari and moradi 2017 matzek and carter 2016 tsitonaki et al 2010 in presence of 9 10 5 m pds the highest pds concentration used notable inactivation occurred after 3 h no cultivable cells were found since light is reported to activate pds and fast inactivation occurred with high pds amounts we assume that the required ratio is dictated by kinetics and the amount of pds has to be 1 2 to inflict cultivability loss please note that the molar ratio indicates the amount of pds that corresponds to 1 fe no fe was inserted in this test concerning heat activation of pds at 30 c initially heat alone was not expected to show any disinfection effects but some pds activation was anticipated k 1 10 7 s 1 at 25 c liang et al 2008 since no effects were observed in fig 1c we presume that the temperature is too low to activate peroxydisulfate or at least not sufficiently to generate enough radical species to inactivate bacteria however at 40 c the effects of pds activation were observable and showed a small enhancement of the disinfection process lower of that of light or iron at t 20 c in agreement with the pds activation rate constants reported in literature liang et al 2008 within the three first hours of experimentation at 40 c the behavior was similar for all pds conditions it is only after this period that a disinfection effect was observed on fig 1c suggesting the requirement of a certain time to properly accumulate damages attributed to the sulfate radicals heat and uva from the solar light are generating two radical species by the homolytic cleavage of a peroxide bond ghanbari and moradi 2017 according to eq 13 13 s 2 o 8 2 t h v 2 s o 4 those activation pathways generate two sulfate radicals from a single initiator and do not require the use of any other chemical literature suggests that the minimal temperature studied to thermally activate pds is 30 c antoniou et al 2010 while the photolysis is optimal with a light source at a wavelength in the uv c range at 254 nm ghanbari and moradi 2017 michael kordatou et al 2015 finally the thermal activation experiments at 50 c were run for only 1 h since thermal disinfection was expected indeed in absence of pds fast inactivation was achieved confirming that heating at 50 c is already an efficient way to inactivate e coli under these conditions the contribution of sulfate radicals to bacterial inactivation is low since the kinetic differences in the various pds conditions are small for this temperature level 3 3 two factor activation of pds in this section the previously evaluated activation factors iron in the form of fe2 simulated solar light and heat are coupled to enhance peroxydisulfate activation indeed some synergy effects are reported for various systems on contaminant removal oh et al 2009 matzek and carter 2016 and suggest that coupling activation factors could be an opportunity to enhance even more e coli inactivation in the context of sodis here thermal activation at 30 c and 50 c are neglected for the coupled processes since the former does not show any effect on disinfection and the latter can cause e coli inactivation in the absence of any other disinfecting means fig 2 presents a summary of the two factor activation experiments in order to evaluate synergistic effects the first order rate constants and synergistic factors were calculated according to method described in section 2 5 with equations 1 4 these values were calculated for the most higher pds amount i e 1 5 pds 9 10 5 m s2o8 2 and reported in table 4 coupling iron with thermal activation showed the slowest e coli inactivation fig 2a within pds levels tested only the 1 5 ratio reaches complete e coli inactivation in absence of the pds oxidant there were no agonistic effects among fe and heat and the synergistic factor calculated for the coupling of fe2 with thermal pds activation 1 5 ratio was equal to sfe 40 c 1 00 suggesting no synergistic effects either this value implies that the coupled process presents results corresponding to the simple addition of the individual effects of each activation factor meaning that no interactions between heating and iron is expected on the peroxydisulfate activation for water disinfection on the other hand solar light coupled with 1 ppm iron without pds presented fast disinfection with about 5 log decrease in bacterial population in only 120 min fig 2b the effects of iron species coupled with solar light on e coli inactivation have already been studied and present relatively good inactivation potential in the photo fenton process spuhler et al 2010 where fe works as a catalyst of the h2o2 decomposition adding small amounts of peroxydisulfate to this system can have antagonistic effects according to the observed results due to the scavenging effect from the iron species which reduce the availability of chemical species to interact with bacterial cells hence reducing disinfection the enhancement of the process by increasing the amount of pds up to 9 10 5 m is related to higher amounts of sulfate radical species generated by the photo catalytic activation of pds by fe the synergistic factor estimated for the solar light and iron pair was equal to shv fe 2 13 suggesting high synergy for pds activation this synergy could be explained by the capacity of solar light to react with hydrated fe3 species regenerating the fe2 catalyst activator and further producing hydroxyl radicals eq 14 bianco et al 2017 14 f e 3 h 2 o h ν f e 2 h h o this type of cycle regenerating fe2 can explain the high synergy observed since continuous illumination could ensure catalytic fe2 regeneration enhancing the sulfate radical generation hence the e coli inactivation finally in the solar heat pds activation system complete e coli inactivation was achieved within 2 h for all three experimental conditions fig 2c under these conditions the kinetics of pds contribution seems small since the process without pds presents already fast disinfection however in 60 min more than 2 log difference in bacterial populations between the sample without pds and the one with the highest pds concentration suggesting that peroxydisulfate is actively contributing to disinfection for the coupling of solar light with heating a synergistic factor of shv 40 c 1 22 is estimated this value suggests little synergy but in overall it brings the highest average improvement in the system knowing that both activation factors generate sulfate radicals via peroxide bond cleavage through energy input ghanbari and moradi 2017 an addition of radiation and thermal energies is supposed indeed as the quantum yield is smaller than 1 for solar light pds activation at 25 c khandarkhaeva et al 2015 more than a single photon is required to cleave the oxygen oxygen bond by increasing the temperature to 40 c some energy is already acting on the peroxide bond and is supposed to reduce the resulting activation energy required for activation through photolysis compared to the coupling of solar light with iron the synergistic effects seem to be lower when solar light is coupled with heat in overall the inactivation trend is heat fe solar fe solar heat in the tested conditions the main activation factor was solar light and drove the synergies demonstrated during the bacterial disinfection tests interestingly the reactor material and configuration almost completely filtered out uvb irradiation which is evidently more germicidal than uva sinton et al 2002 but inactivation was enhanced iron is known to absorb in the uva vis region and now pds was also shown to work on similar wavelengths similarly to huang et al 2018 as a result its potential use in sodis is presented and the 3 factor activation will be sought 3 4 activation of pds in a combined process triple activation following the triple pds activation hereon combined process cp is built to combine advantages of solar light iron and developed heat towards peroxydisulfate activation in the context of sodis as seen in fig 3 a without pds complete water disinfection 6 log bacterial population decrease was reached in 120 min at 40 c and 1 ppm fe2 adding peroxydisulfate at 9 10 5 m s2o8 2 lead to total inactivation within a single hour while sodis experiment showed no inactivation at all over the first hour of exposition the synergistic factor for this combined process including three pds activation factors was estimated to shv fe 40 c 2 21 which is higher than any coupled process involving two activation factors the couple presenting the closest synergistic factor is solar light pds activation with iron pds activation shv fe 2 13 which verifies the importance of light as dominant activating action more information can be found in table 3 heating up this process to 40 c induced an additional increase according to synergistic factors estimated although heating does not show any negative effects the small deviation from being an additive factor could be due to the faster iron oxidation at higher temperatures compared to 20 or 30 c as an overview of the experimental findings and in order to facilitate the comparison of the results of the various systems experimented the necessary time to reach 4 logu inactivation is reported in fig 4 these conditions correspond to protected highly protected water sources according to who world health organization 2007 the trend of activation factors ranked by their potential for water disinfection through peroxydisulfate activation show that solar light is a key element in the combined process with even better performance compared to the two factor heat fe process 3 5 heterogeneous pds activation applicability of natural oxides as iron source the combined process built is using iron sulfate salt feso4 as iron ii source in a homogeneous form but for sodis in developing countries other cheap and abundant sources of iron should be evaluated indeed in this context access to chemicals is limited and the use of naturally occurring compounds is encouraged six heterogeneous iron sources are evaluated with the conditions of the combined process within the tested iron oxides fig 5 wustite presents the best potential while hematite was the less effective the small advantage observed with wustite against the other iron oxide sources can be justified due to its intrinsic properties iron oxidation state since it is the only source composed with iron ii being is the most efficient iron species for pds activation the activation of pds on the oxide surface and the photo dissolution that enhances the homogeneous activation are described in equation 15 afterwards the dissolved fe2 continues similarly to eq 11 15 f e 2 s o 4 f e 3 s o 4 2 indicates reactions on the surface of the oxide however all sources show slower disinfection than the standard combined process with fe2 in a homogeneous form iron salt all other iron sources are probably less efficient due to i fe3 presence on the surface of the oxide and ii mass transfer limitations occurring in heterogeneous systems ghanbari and moradi 2017 most likely the need to photo dissolve iron oxides in the bulk and the increase of participation of the homogeneous part in activation of pds also plays a role for the delay in kinetics alternatively the need for photo reduction of fe3 to fe2 on the surface of oxides for effective cleavage of sulfate radicals from pds is afterwards limited by the reactivity only in the reduced sites finally an important observation was that the processes with iron oxides had similar efficiency with the coupled process without any iron coupling solar light with heating at 40 c indeed this coupled reaction showed higher inactivation after 60 min than any iron oxide and reaches 6 log inactivation after 120 min some iron oxides achieve this inactivation in 80 or 100 min as such the presence of iron oxides and their pds activation can compensate for the lower temperature conditions that may be present on the field 3 6 application of the mild pds activation to micropollutant removal and virus inactivation as contamination of water is no longer exclusively of microbial origin the effect of the process against the removal of contaminants of emerging concern was evaluated this micropollutant removal was evaluated using a mixture containing 13 micropollutants of different types pharmaceuticals and pesticides in varying concentrations and treated with the chosen presented experimental conditions fig 6 a the initial water composition is reported in table 5 an experiment in presence of model natural organic matter suwanee river nom sr nom was performed for competition in oxidants targets and closer to the real water matrices in order to evaluate removal of the presented micropollutants samples are analyzed using lc ms liquid chromatography mass spectrometry the estimation of overall removal is made by calculating the percentage removal of mol for each species and combining them in a weighted average for each sampling point of each experimental condition similarly to previous studies giannakis et al 2015 2016c the most moderate conditions simulated solar light at 40 c showed e coli complete inactivation 6 log decrease in bacterial population fig 6b within 2 h while global micropollutant removal is about 30 within the same period these results suggest that bacterial inactivation is achieved easier than micropollutant removal under these conditions this is in agreement with the sodis process which is known to kill bacteria but has no high effects on contaminant removal without enhancement all reactions with peroxydisulfate presented more than 80 micropollutant removal after only 60 min suggesting that sulfate radicals have high efficiency on contaminant degradation even the process with natural iron which is the less effective on e coli inactivation reported almost 90 micropollutant removal after 60 min of experimentation all these processes reach both 6 log e coli inactivation and 80 micropollutant removal in a single hour demonstrating the great potential of peroxydisulfate based processes in the context of mild sodis enhancement and other aop a relative order of efficiency would read for micropollutants solar cp with natural fe cp in presence of nom cp cp with h2o2 for bacteria solar cp with natural fe cp cp in presence of nom cp cp with h2o2 concerning the pathway to degradation upon generation the sulfate radicals being highly reactive they can directly react with activators as previously presented but also with non activated pds devi et al 2016 or even with water ghanbari and moradi 2017 tsitonaki et al 2010 as follows eqs 17 19 16 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 k 16 6 5 10 5 m 1 s 1 17 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 h o h k 17 660 s 1 18 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 h o k 18 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 according to equations 17 and 18 some ho can be generated in the presence of s o 4 which suggests that those species can participate together in water decontamination the common way removing the micropollutants is by oxidation radicals allow the mineralization of organic compounds according to the simplified equation eq 19 ghanbari and moradi 2017 19 s o 4 h o o r g a n i c c o m p o u n d s b y p r o d u c t s c o 2 h 2 o s o 4 2 in addition to e coli and micropollutants the capacity of peroxydisulfate to inactivate the bacteriophage ms2 virus was tested under various conditions fig 7 ms2 bacteriophage has been often used as a surrogate for human enteric pathogen viruses giannakis et al 2017a and is of high importance for the context of sodis also it presents high resistance to uv treatment giannakis et al 2017b hence similarly to mild photo fenton treatment ortega gómez et al 2015 its response to mild pds activation conditions was put under scrutiny an experiment in presence of sr nom was also performed for competition in oxidants targets being of similar order of magnitude in size with ms2 under the chosen conditions ms2 inactivation is globally achieved faster than e coli inactivation fig 7b only the experiment with the conditions of solar light at 40 c did not reach total ms2 inactivation although 40 c is a temperature that generally is causing infectivity decrease probably also the one noted here sodis could not inactivate the specific strain concerning the combined actions the activation of pds had an effect on the viral indicator and the addition of iron greatly enhanced its inactivation what makes the inactivation of ms2 much faster than e coli is the presence of proteins a protein coat proteins in the viral capsid in general these compounds react faster than the biomolecules of the e coli cell wall influencing faster inactivation of ms2 however microorganism size and as a consequence diffusion of radicals in the bulk should be taken into account in order to propose the exact inactivation pathway however the addition of natural iron seemed to have a negative effect compared to the system with no iron at all suggesting some screening and scavenging effect as well as enhanced adsorption desorption events that agglomerate viral particles with iron oxides and delay the inactivation process giannakis et al 2017b finally the presence of nom does not hinder the ms2 inactivation but has not an enhancing effect this is due to the competition of ms2 with nom negative charges for both giannakis et al 2017a while having comparable sizes giannakis et al 2017b which aggravates the process for ms2 coliphage solar heat cp with natural fe solar pds solar fe cp in presence of nom cp for bacteria cp with natural fe solar heat solar fe solar pds cp cp in presence of nom 3 7 comparison of the combined process triple activation of pds with solar photo fenton in order to benchmark the combined process cp built with a well known aop that uses similar resources and reaction conditions a comparison with a photo fenton reaction pf was done in addition a reaction including h2o2 to the cp conditions is tested cp with h2o2 hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical contributions to disinfection in the combined process and the photo fenton process with pds are evaluated by using tert butanol tba as a scavenger to block hydroxyl radical effects on e coli inactivation a summary is presented in fig 8 under the studied conditions the combined process cp and photo fenton present comparable results with complete bacterial inactivation after 60 min the addition of pds to the photo fenton process resulted in high enhancement with complete disinfection 6 log decrease in e coli population within less than 30 min of experimentation addition of free radicals generating species h2o2 or s2o8 2 clearly participated to disinfection since the inactivation is highly enhanced compared to disinfection by applied conditions alone no radicals curve compared to sodis at 20 c the combined process coupled with hydrogen peroxide pf with pds reached total inactivation after 30 min while sodis was still inefficient after 1 h showing the biggest enhancement achieved during this work the rapid inactivation of bacteria in the process coupling hydrogen peroxide h2o2 with pds s2o8 2 can be partly explained by the capacity of hydrogen peroxide to directly activate pds devi et al 2016 the interaction mechanisms between these species towards bacterial inactivation is yet not well understood but according to the results reported high synergistic effects can be considered for such a system which includes four activation factors solar light iron heat and hydrogen peroxide when adding tba to the cp e coli inactivation takes more time to achieve total disinfection 90 min with tba while only 60 min without suggesting participation of the hydroxyl radicals to the disinfection process as shown in eqs 17 and 18 before moreover when tba is applied inactivation is still more efficient than the system under the same conditions with no pds meaning that sulfate radicals also act on the disinfection of drinking water the addition of tba in the photo fenton system with pds also reduces the inactivation of e coli reaching results comparable to the combined process supposing that there is enough tba to block hydroxyl radicals concentration of tba is at least 10 orders of magnitude higher than steady state hydroxyl radical concentration estimated this observation suggests that more sulfate radicals are involved when hydrogen peroxide is present fortifying the idea that hydrogen peroxide can act as an activator of pds devi et al 2016 sun et al 2016 additional experimentation with anisole a known sulfate radical scavenger has not yielded valuable results as its immediate toxicity does not allow interpretation of the mechanism as such further experiments are required to clearly identify and quantify the contribution of both sulfate and hydroxyl radical species furthermore a comparison was performed concerning all the targets of the study namely micropollutants bacteria and viruses among the photo fenton and the triple pds activation fig 9 considering the photo fenton process lower micropollutant removal is achieved about 50 in 2 h compared with more than 95 in 1 h for the cp bacterial inactivation is similar in the two oxidation processes and the ms2 inactivation differs in favor of the photo fenton process it can be concluded that in overall the cp is more effective for organic contaminant elimination and the pf process is globally more efficient on microorganisms inactivation than on micropollutant removal the main difference among photo fenton and sulfate radical mediated degradation of the micro contaminants is that sulfate and hydroxyl radicals react with organic compounds through different mechanisms so4 mainly involves outer space mechanism while ho involves a bridged mechanism devi et al 2016 outer space and bridged mechanisms are electron transfer mechanisms specific to redox reactions the first one presents relatively faster electron transfer rates since this mechanism does not require any bond formation rastogi et al 2009 most probably this is due to their lifetime being more than a thousand times longer than the respective of hydroxyl radicals about 3 10 5 s for so4 and 2 10 8 s for ho increasing their probability to reach target molecules ghanbari and moradi 2017 michael kordatou et al 2015 also the high reactivity of hydroxyl radicals consumes the oxidant h2o2 rapidly for the degradation of the parent compound and the intermediate compound without discrimination the high selectivity of the sulfate radicals allows targeting the readily oxidizable moieties however this would reflect to the overall diminishing of the toc in the photo fenton process rather than plain the transformation of the parent compound and hence non detection by the lc ms method the same cannot be said for microorganisms where the longer lifetime of sulfate radicals is counterbalanced by their reactivity with biomolecules hence the aforementioned mitigation and shift of inactivation efficiency for bacteria and ms2 respectively 4 conclusions in this study solar water disinfection sodis enhancement using sulfate radicals was evaluated through persulfate activation using different activation factors against bacterial inactivation the evolution of e coli concentration was monitored during the reacting time in order to assess effectiveness of disinfection through persulfate activation in principle in the context of sodis pds could play the role of enhancer when activated by solar light iron or heat from the factors assessed a relative order of activation efficacy can be established iron light heat as found by the inactivation kinetics in mild conditions 1 ppm iron and 40 c the step wise construction of the combined triple activation process indicated synergies among the factors assessed solar light with iron shv fe 2 13 and solar light with heat shv 40 c 1 22 pairs showed high synergistic effects whereas iron with heat did not present any synergy sfe 40 c 1 00 the combined process including three activation factors built and optimized for sodis enhancement reported high enhancement and synergistic effects between the three activation factors shv fe 40 c 2 20 the heterogeneous fe activation demonstrated good inactivation potentials as it had efficiently enhanced bacterial inactivation through the use of iron oxides and mineral iron in addition the process performed well when nom was present in the solution even demonstrating enhancement due to iron nom complexation also the cp has achieved good degradation of mps pharmaceuticals and pesticides in water as well as rapid ms2 inactivation the comparison with the well established photo fenton process revealed that bacterial inactivation was equally fast but mp degradation was even faster the above factors indicate the possible applicability in real waters and interchangeability among the application of photo fenton and pds mediated cp the addition of both pds and h2o2 led to further 50 reduction of the residence time indicating potential of using the process in other more advanced context in conclusion mild additions of fe and pds under solar uv light are a promising application for developing and or sunny countries due to its moderate cost and applicability wherever the proposition of the photo fenton process could be applied cp could be as well assessed the limiting factor is always the oxidant h2o2 pds however if transport and distribution at reasonable cost could be achieved the success for both processes could be implied as well considering the small contribution of heating to the combined process coupling solar light with iron seems to be more promising in the context of sodis in pet bottles and using pds activation more advantageous in a cpc reactor which does not achieve high temperatures acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the european project waterspoutt h2020 water 5c 2015 ga 688928 for the financial support appendix a supplementary

19537,in this work solar disinfection sodis was enhanced by moderate addition of fe and sodium peroxydisulfate pds under solar light a systematic assessment of the activating factors was performed firstly isolated then in pairs and concluded in the combined fe heat solar uv pds activation process solar light was the most effective single activator and its combination with fe and heat double activation yielded high level of synergies up to s 2 13 the triple activation was able to reduce the bacterial load up to 6 log in less than 1 h similarly to the photo fenton process done in comparison sodis alone 5 h fe oxides were suitable activators of pds under the same conditions while the presence of organic matter enhanced bacterial inactivation by the triple activated pds process the degradation of a selected mixture of micropollutants i e drugs pesticides was also achieved in similar order of magnitude and faster than the photo fenton process finally the removal of a viral pathogen indicator ms2 bacteriophage was attained at minute range residence times the aforementioned facts indicate the suitability of the mild combined process as a potential sodis enhancement

introduction nowadays more than 10 of world s population does not have an access to improved source of drinking water mcguigan et al 2012 this lack of safe drinking water in a large proportion of world s population is responsible for many disorders development and illnesses in less developed countries fewtrell et al 2005 point of use solutions to this context and potent processes capable to treat drinking water effectively in order to achieve higher water quality and safety of consumption for the populations are necessary considering that these processes will be used especially in developing countries they have to be easy to use safe cheap and sustainable with the environmental situation at the point of use mcguigan et al 2012 fewtrell et al 2005 clasen et al 2007 solar disinfection sodis is a process in which the potential of solar light is used to disinfect drinking water this developing process takes advantage of the ability of solar light to kill pathogens through genome damages and intracellular oxidative reactions giannakis 2018 and can be enhanced by the addition of various chemicals optimizing of container volume and exposure to solar light mcguigan et al 2012 kehoe et al 2001 in the sodis context processes such as solar assisted advanced oxidation processes aops present great potential the aops use the potential of a chemical oxidant species to disinfect water by inactivating potentially pathogenic species such as bacteria viruses or yeasts giannakis et al 2016 2016c 2017a 2017b and degrading various harmful organic contaminants to treat drinking water a widely studied aop is the photo fenton pf process in which hydroxyl radicals ho are generated using light iron and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and act as oxidant species in the treatment of water giannakis et al 2016a b photo fenton process can be carried out using solar light enhancing the efficiency of sodis given that fe is almost omnipresent in natural waters and h2o2 can be added and or is in situ generated vione et al 2014 sulfate radicals so4 as hydroxyl radicals present a great potential for an alternative advanced oxidation treatment for water devi et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 in comparison with photo fenton process where hydrogen peroxide is the initiator of hydroxyl radical species sulfate radicals can be generated in different pathways from peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds both acting as initiators oh et al 2016 these initiators have to be activated in order to generate sulfate radicals moreover the sulfate radicals redox potential is close to hydroxyl radicals 2 6 v ghanbari and moradi 2017 liang et al 2008 which makes so4 a good candidate for water treatment there are many activation factors such as heat ji et al 2015 tsitonaki et al 2008 light cui et al 2016 garkusheva et al 2017 transition metals oh et al 2016 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 rodríguez chueca et al 2017a and others each of them with specific efficiencies table 1 summarizes the known activators of pds the interest in using sulfate radicals instead of ho arises from characteristics which are favorable to the use of sulfate based radicals such as the selectivity to oxidation anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 yu et al 2016 and also the higher stability compared to h2o2 that allows the initiator to diffuse at wider lengths in the subsurface before microorganism activation so far a significant amount of works has been published on contaminant removal using sulfate radicals and treating large variety of compounds such as pharmaceuticals ahmed et al 2012 alcohols oh et al 2009 and others the by products generated depend on the contaminants present but the other species produced co2 h2o and so4 2 are harmless this makes the process interesting for application in drinking water treatment compared to organic contaminants the effect of sulfate radicals on microorganisms is much less studied the effectiveness of transition metal uv activated processes on escherichia coli inactivation is reported for different water conditions garkusheva et al 2017 rodríguez chueca et al 2017b sun et al 2016 there is however an important lack of studies on solar and mild thermal chemical activation of persulfate for bacterial disinfection which given the nature of the in situ sodis treatment would be greatly beneficial in this study the enhancement of the sodis process using sulfate radicals in mild conditions is evaluated solar light low amounts of iron and mild heat activation of sodium peroxydisulfate na2s2o8 are investigated to build a combined process where these three factors are optimized to disinfect simulated contaminated drinking water escherichia coli in the context of point of use technology in developing countries the effect of the most commonly encountered parameters such as reactant concentrations organic matter presence and the use of natural iron oxides as iron source is also studied the combined process for bacterial disinfection is compared to the well known photo fenton aop and briefly evaluated on virus and micropollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents chemicals and reagents were used as

sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen dsmz no 498 as bacterial species this strain is non pathogenic and allows a good approximation of wild type e coli which is a well known indicator bacterium for enteric pathogens e coli strain storage is assured in cryo vials containing 20 glycerol at 20 c bacterial pre cultures are obtained by spreading 20 μl of the strain onto plate count agar pca merck followed by 24 h incubation at 37 c heraeus instruments a grown colony is then re plated and spread on a new pca plate and incubated for additional 24 h at 37 c this 48 h process results in a master plate which is stored at 4 c and can be used during about 2 weeks in order to prepare bacterial stock solution from the master plate luria bertani lb broth is first prepared and then heat sterilized in an autoclave a colony from the master plate is then inoculated into a sterile pe eppendorf flask containing 5 ml of the lb broth prepared the flask is agitated aerobically for 8 h at 750 rpm and under a temperature of 37 c then 2 5 ml are extracted from the eppendorf flask and diluted into a sterile 500 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 250 ml of lb broth the erlenmeyer is agitated aerobically for 15 h at 750 rpm and 37 c to ensure stationary phase achievement of the bacterial population two 25 ml samples of the obtained solution are centrifuged hermle z 323 k renggli laboratory systems for 15 min at 5000 rpm and 4 c the harvested bacterial cells are then washed using saline solution and re centrifuged 5 min at 5000 rpm and 4 c twice final bacterial pellets are suspended in 25 ml of saline solution forming a stock solution which is stored at 4 c and can be used for about 10 days the e coli k12 stock solution produced within this process has a concentration estimated to approximately 109 cfu ml in order to follow bacterial population evolution against time 1 ml samples are regularly withdrawn and plated on plates containing pca before plating samples are properly diluted to ensure measurable counts of colonies ideally 15 150 colonies per plate colony forming units are manually counted after 24 h incubation at 37 c this method results in a detection limit of 10 cfu ml for undiluted samples 2 3 2 ms2 bacteriophage the ms2 bacteriophage used as a model enteric viral pathogen was acquired from dsmz no 13767 the preparation of the strain involved propagation of the virus in 1 l luria bertani broth 0 2 streptomycin was present containing the host e coli and its incubation at 37 c the od600 was followed and upon reaching 0 4 the ms2 were introduced and

giannakis et al 2015 giannakis et al 2016c briefly the process involved acidification of the samples at ph 2 with hcl and spiking with a standard mixture of the surrogate contaminants in deuterated

elution took place with a gradient of ultrapure water and acetonitrile acidified at 0 1 of formic acid finally detection of the micropollutants was achieved with multiple reaction monitoring and quantification was done with calibration by internal standards 2 5 experimental strategy as presented in the introduction main purpose of this work is to investigate bacterial inactivation using sulfate radicals generated through peroxydisulfate activation to do so 150 ml of milliq water containing approximately 106 cfu ml of e coli are prepared and exposed to various experimental conditions and bacterial population evolution in time is monitored firstly the potential of pds to inactivate e coli without any activation factor is evaluated at different concentrations secondly the potential of each activation factor simulated solar light iron and heat to activate pds is separately evaluated following couples of activation factors are used to evaluate potential synergies in the activation of pds for water disinfection finally the three activation factors are used together to optimize a combined process this combined process cp is evaluated with different pds concentrations and compared to photo fenton process complementary experiments are done coupling pds with hydrogen peroxide adding natural organic matter nom and using iron oxides as iron sources furthermore some conditions are reproduced on water contaminated with viruses or micropollutants to compare their efficiencies with the bacterial inactivation evaluation of hydroxyl radical participation to the combined process is made using tert butanol as scavenger sun et al 2016 in order to compare inactivation under the various conditions pseudo first order rate constants reported as k min 1 are estimated by linear regression fitting of the plots in origin 9 0 pro for windows the evaluation of synergistic effects when combining activation factors is made using the rate constants and the subsequent calculation a synergistic factor spuhler et al 2010 1 s h ν f e k h ν f e k h ν k f e 2 s h ν 40 c k h ν 40 c k h ν k 40 c 3 s f e 40 c k f e 40 c k f e k 40 c 4 s h ν f e 40 c k h ν f e 40 c k h ν k f e k 40 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 blank experiments no pds activation to assess the effects of peroxydisulfate pds anions themselves reactions with different pds concentrations are run without applying any activation factor 20 c dark no iron for the tested concentrations of peroxydisulfate the bacterial population remains stable within the 5 h of experimentation the two concentrations evaluated 1 8 10 5 m and 9 10 5 m present no observable differences on e coli inactivation according to those results peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 seems not capable of e coli inactivation by itself without activation means within the range of concentrations studied 3 2 evaluation of the pds activation factors single activation iron solar light and heat are evaluated separately to assess their potential for pds activation simulated solar light is used at a fixed irradiance 900 w m2 while iron is evaluated at 1 mg l of fe2 three temperature levels are tested in a range achievable in the context of a water solution exposed to daylong solar light 30 c 40 c and 50 c the mechanism of pds activation by the three isolated factors under study owes to either energy heat light or electron transfer fe once activated the sulfate radicals initiate a series of reactions involving other radicals e g ho and reactive intermediates e g h s o 5 eqs 5 9 waldemer et al 2007 5 s o 4 h 2 o h o h s o 4 2 6 2 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 7 s o 4 h o h s o 5 8 2 h o h 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 s o 4 2 o 2 in fig 1 a iron is shown to activate pds similarly to other transition metals used such as co and mn anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 rodríguez chueca et al 2017b and is subject to the following efficiency mn2 v3 ce3 fe2 ru3 co2 ghanbari and moradi 2017 however our results suggest that a 1 1 or 1 2 ratio between fe2 and pds is not appropriate to generate sulfate radicals or at least to generate them in an effective amount at this iron addition level a 1 5 ratio is appropriate for lower ratios the potential of iron species to act as scavengers may also influence the outcome as such we note a requirement to use a higher pds ratio matzek and carter 2016 the electron transfer taking place can be represented with the following general reaction eq 10 10 s 2 o 8 2 m n m n 1 s o 4 2 s o 4 and in the specific case of fe2 we get the activation and scavenging reactions eqs 11 and 12 11 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 s o 4 s o 4 2 12 s o 4 f e 2 f e 3 s o 4 2 furthermore in the specific operational starting ph 6 5 fe remains soluble and in fe2 form for a relatively limited time hence the homogeneous fe2 activation of pds is gradually converted to oxide mediated one this may indicate the opportunity directly use iron oxides and form a heterogeneous activation reaction these parameters will be further presented in the next sections as for the solar light activation experiments in fig 1b the baseline solar damage was limited the lowest pds concentration does not inflict enhancement in disinfection however an improvement is observed initially with 3 6 10 5 m the solar generated sulfate radicals normally react with the biomolecules of the bacterial cell wall such as the lipids and polysaccharides present leading to their inactivation sun et al 2016 the shoulder shape of the inactivation curves indicate that the bacteria can sustain a level of sulfate radical mediated damages prior to inactivation devi et al 2016 ghanbari and moradi 2017 matzek and carter 2016 tsitonaki et al 2010 in presence of 9 10 5 m pds the highest pds concentration used notable inactivation occurred after 3 h no cultivable cells were found since light is reported to activate pds and fast inactivation occurred with high pds amounts we assume that the required ratio is dictated by kinetics and the amount of pds has to be 1 2 to inflict cultivability loss please note that the molar ratio indicates the amount of pds that corresponds to 1 fe no fe was inserted in this test concerning heat activation of pds at 30 c initially heat alone was not expected to show any disinfection effects but some pds activation was anticipated k 1 10 7 s 1 at 25 c liang et al 2008 since no effects were observed in fig 1c we presume that the temperature is too low to activate peroxydisulfate or at least not sufficiently to generate enough radical species to inactivate bacteria however at 40 c the effects of pds activation were observable and showed a small enhancement of the disinfection process lower of that of light or iron at t 20 c in agreement with the pds activation rate constants reported in literature liang et al 2008 within the three first hours of experimentation at 40 c the behavior was similar for all pds conditions it is only after this period that a disinfection effect was observed on fig 1c suggesting the requirement of a certain time to properly accumulate damages attributed to the sulfate radicals heat and uva from the solar light are generating two radical species by the homolytic cleavage of a peroxide bond ghanbari and moradi 2017 according to eq 13 13 s 2 o 8 2 t h v 2 s o 4 those activation pathways generate two sulfate radicals from a single initiator and do not require the use of any other chemical literature suggests that the minimal temperature studied to thermally activate pds is 30 c antoniou et al 2010 while the photolysis is optimal with a light source at a wavelength in the uv c range at 254 nm ghanbari and moradi 2017 michael kordatou et al 2015 finally the thermal activation experiments at 50 c were run for only 1 h since thermal disinfection was expected indeed in absence of pds fast inactivation was achieved confirming that heating at 50 c is already an efficient way to inactivate e coli under these conditions the contribution of sulfate radicals to bacterial inactivation is low since the kinetic differences in the various pds conditions are small for this temperature level 3 3 two factor activation of pds in this section the previously evaluated activation factors iron in the form of fe2 simulated solar light and heat are coupled to enhance peroxydisulfate activation indeed some synergy effects are reported for various systems on contaminant removal oh et al 2009 matzek and carter 2016 and suggest that coupling activation factors could be an opportunity to enhance even more e coli inactivation in the context of sodis here thermal activation at 30 c and 50 c are neglected for the coupled processes since the former does not show any effect on disinfection and the latter can cause e coli inactivation in the absence of any other disinfecting means fig 2 presents a summary of the two factor activation experiments in order to evaluate synergistic effects the first order rate constants and synergistic factors were calculated according to method described in section 2 5 with equations 1 4 these values were calculated for the most higher pds amount i e 1 5 pds 9 10 5 m s2o8 2 and reported in table 4 coupling iron with thermal activation showed the slowest e coli inactivation fig 2a within pds levels tested only the 1 5 ratio reaches complete e coli inactivation in absence of the pds oxidant there were no agonistic effects among fe and heat and the synergistic factor calculated for the coupling of fe2 with thermal pds activation 1 5 ratio was equal to sfe 40 c 1 00 suggesting no synergistic effects either this value implies that the coupled process presents results corresponding to the simple addition of the individual effects of each activation factor meaning that no interactions between heating and iron is expected on the peroxydisulfate activation for water disinfection on the other hand solar light coupled with 1 ppm iron without pds presented fast disinfection with about 5 log decrease in bacterial population in only 120 min fig 2b the effects of iron species coupled with solar light on e coli inactivation have already been studied and present relatively good inactivation potential in the photo fenton process spuhler et al 2010 where fe works as a catalyst of the h2o2 decomposition adding small amounts of peroxydisulfate to this system can have antagonistic effects according to the observed results due to the scavenging effect from the iron species which reduce the availability of chemical species to interact with bacterial cells hence reducing disinfection the enhancement of the process by increasing the amount of pds up to 9 10 5 m is related to higher amounts of sulfate radical species generated by the photo catalytic activation of pds by fe the synergistic factor estimated for the solar light and iron pair was equal to shv fe 2 13 suggesting high synergy for pds activation this synergy could be explained by the capacity of solar light to react with hydrated fe3 species regenerating the fe2 catalyst activator and further producing hydroxyl radicals eq 14 bianco et al 2017 14 f e 3 h 2 o h ν f e 2 h h o this type of cycle regenerating fe2 can explain the high synergy observed since continuous illumination could ensure catalytic fe2 regeneration enhancing the sulfate radical generation hence the e coli inactivation finally in the solar heat pds activation system complete e coli inactivation was achieved within 2 h for all three experimental conditions fig 2c under these conditions the kinetics of pds contribution seems small since the process without pds presents already fast disinfection however in 60 min more than 2 log difference in bacterial populations between the sample without pds and the one with the highest pds concentration suggesting that peroxydisulfate is actively contributing to disinfection for the coupling of solar light with heating a synergistic factor of shv 40 c 1 22 is estimated this value suggests little synergy but in overall it brings the highest average improvement in the system knowing that both activation factors generate sulfate radicals via peroxide bond cleavage through energy input ghanbari and moradi 2017 an addition of radiation and thermal energies is supposed indeed as the quantum yield is smaller than 1 for solar light pds activation at 25 c khandarkhaeva et al 2015 more than a single photon is required to cleave the oxygen oxygen bond by increasing the temperature to 40 c some energy is already acting on the peroxide bond and is supposed to reduce the resulting activation energy required for activation through photolysis compared to the coupling of solar light with iron the synergistic effects seem to be lower when solar light is coupled with heat in overall the inactivation trend is heat fe solar fe solar heat in the tested conditions the main activation factor was solar light and drove the synergies demonstrated during the bacterial disinfection tests interestingly the reactor material and configuration almost completely filtered out uvb irradiation which is evidently more germicidal than uva sinton et al 2002 but inactivation was enhanced iron is known to absorb in the uva vis region and now pds was also shown to work on similar wavelengths similarly to huang et al 2018 as a result its potential use in sodis is presented and the 3 factor activation will be sought 3 4 activation of pds in a combined process triple activation following the triple pds activation hereon combined process cp is built to combine advantages of solar light iron and developed heat towards peroxydisulfate activation in the context of sodis as seen in fig 3 a without pds complete water disinfection 6 log bacterial population decrease was reached in 120 min at 40 c and 1 ppm fe2 adding peroxydisulfate at 9 10 5 m s2o8 2 lead to total inactivation within a single hour while sodis experiment showed no inactivation at all over the first hour of exposition the synergistic factor for this combined process including three pds activation factors was estimated to shv fe 40 c 2 21 which is higher than any coupled process involving two activation factors the couple presenting the closest synergistic factor is solar light pds activation with iron pds activation shv fe 2 13 which verifies the importance of light as dominant activating action more information can be found in table 3 heating up this process to 40 c induced an additional increase according to synergistic factors estimated although heating does not show any negative effects the small deviation from being an additive factor could be due to the faster iron oxidation at higher temperatures compared to 20 or 30 c as an overview of the experimental findings and in order to facilitate the comparison of the results of the various systems experimented the necessary time to reach 4 logu inactivation is reported in fig 4 these conditions correspond to protected highly protected water sources according to who world health organization 2007 the trend of activation factors ranked by their potential for water disinfection through peroxydisulfate activation show that solar light is a key element in the combined process with even better performance compared to the two factor heat fe process 3 5 heterogeneous pds activation applicability of natural oxides as iron source the combined process built is using iron sulfate salt feso4 as iron ii source in a homogeneous form but for sodis in developing countries other cheap and abundant sources of iron should be evaluated indeed in this context access to chemicals is limited and the use of naturally occurring compounds is encouraged six heterogeneous iron sources are evaluated with the conditions of the combined process within the tested iron oxides fig 5 wustite presents the best potential while hematite was the less effective the small advantage observed with wustite against the other iron oxide sources can be justified due to its intrinsic properties iron oxidation state since it is the only source composed with iron ii being is the most efficient iron species for pds activation the activation of pds on the oxide surface and the photo dissolution that enhances the homogeneous activation are described in equation 15 afterwards the dissolved fe2 continues similarly to eq 11 15 f e 2 s o 4 f e 3 s o 4 2 indicates reactions on the surface of the oxide however all sources show slower disinfection than the standard combined process with fe2 in a homogeneous form iron salt all other iron sources are probably less efficient due to i fe3 presence on the surface of the oxide and ii mass transfer limitations occurring in heterogeneous systems ghanbari and moradi 2017 most likely the need to photo dissolve iron oxides in the bulk and the increase of participation of the homogeneous part in activation of pds also plays a role for the delay in kinetics alternatively the need for photo reduction of fe3 to fe2 on the surface of oxides for effective cleavage of sulfate radicals from pds is afterwards limited by the reactivity only in the reduced sites finally an important observation was that the processes with iron oxides had similar efficiency with the coupled process without any iron coupling solar light with heating at 40 c indeed this coupled reaction showed higher inactivation after 60 min than any iron oxide and reaches 6 log inactivation after 120 min some iron oxides achieve this inactivation in 80 or 100 min as such the presence of iron oxides and their pds activation can compensate for the lower temperature conditions that may be present on the field 3 6 application of the mild pds activation to micropollutant removal and virus inactivation as contamination of water is no longer exclusively of microbial origin the effect of the process against the removal of contaminants of emerging concern was evaluated this micropollutant removal was evaluated using a mixture containing 13 micropollutants of different types pharmaceuticals and pesticides in varying concentrations and treated with the chosen presented experimental conditions fig 6 a the initial water composition is reported in table 5 an experiment in presence of model natural organic matter suwanee river nom sr nom was performed for competition in oxidants targets and closer to the real water matrices in order to evaluate removal of the presented micropollutants samples are analyzed using lc ms liquid chromatography mass spectrometry the estimation of overall removal is made by calculating the percentage removal of mol for each species and combining them in a weighted average for each sampling point of each experimental condition similarly to previous studies giannakis et al 2015 2016c the most moderate conditions simulated solar light at 40 c showed e coli complete inactivation 6 log decrease in bacterial population fig 6b within 2 h while global micropollutant removal is about 30 within the same period these results suggest that bacterial inactivation is achieved easier than micropollutant removal under these conditions this is in agreement with the sodis process which is known to kill bacteria but has no high effects on contaminant removal without enhancement all reactions with peroxydisulfate presented more than 80 micropollutant removal after only 60 min suggesting that sulfate radicals have high efficiency on contaminant degradation even the process with natural iron which is the less effective on e coli inactivation reported almost 90 micropollutant removal after 60 min of experimentation all these processes reach both 6 log e coli inactivation and 80 micropollutant removal in a single hour demonstrating the great potential of peroxydisulfate based processes in the context of mild sodis enhancement and other aop a relative order of efficiency would read for micropollutants solar cp with natural fe cp in presence of nom cp cp with h2o2 for bacteria solar cp with natural fe cp cp in presence of nom cp cp with h2o2 concerning the pathway to degradation upon generation the sulfate radicals being highly reactive they can directly react with activators as previously presented but also with non activated pds devi et al 2016 or even with water ghanbari and moradi 2017 tsitonaki et al 2010 as follows eqs 17 19 16 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 k 16 6 5 10 5 m 1 s 1 17 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 h o h k 17 660 s 1 18 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 h o k 18 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 according to equations 17 and 18 some ho can be generated in the presence of s o 4 which suggests that those species can participate together in water decontamination the common way removing the micropollutants is by oxidation radicals allow the mineralization of organic compounds according to the simplified equation eq 19 ghanbari and moradi 2017 19 s o 4 h o o r g a n i c c o m p o u n d s b y p r o d u c t s c o 2 h 2 o s o 4 2 in addition to e coli and micropollutants the capacity of peroxydisulfate to inactivate the bacteriophage ms2 virus was tested under various conditions fig 7 ms2 bacteriophage has been often used as a surrogate for human enteric pathogen viruses giannakis et al 2017a and is of high importance for the context of sodis also it presents high resistance to uv treatment giannakis et al 2017b hence similarly to mild photo fenton treatment ortega gómez et al 2015 its response to mild pds activation conditions was put under scrutiny an experiment in presence of sr nom was also performed for competition in oxidants targets being of similar order of magnitude in size with ms2 under the chosen conditions ms2 inactivation is globally achieved faster than e coli inactivation fig 7b only the experiment with the conditions of solar light at 40 c did not reach total ms2 inactivation although 40 c is a temperature that generally is causing infectivity decrease probably also the one noted here sodis could not inactivate the specific strain concerning the combined actions the activation of pds had an effect on the viral indicator and the addition of iron greatly enhanced its inactivation what makes the inactivation of ms2 much faster than e coli is the presence of proteins a protein coat proteins in the viral capsid in general these compounds react faster than the biomolecules of the e coli cell wall influencing faster inactivation of ms2 however microorganism size and as a consequence diffusion of radicals in the bulk should be taken into account in order to propose the exact inactivation pathway however the addition of natural iron seemed to have a negative effect compared to the system with no iron at all suggesting some screening and scavenging effect as well as enhanced adsorption desorption events that agglomerate viral particles with iron oxides and delay the inactivation process giannakis et al 2017b finally the presence of nom does not hinder the ms2 inactivation but has not an enhancing effect this is due to the competition of ms2 with nom negative charges for both giannakis et al 2017a while having comparable sizes giannakis et al 2017b which aggravates the process for ms2 coliphage solar heat cp with natural fe solar pds solar fe cp in presence of nom cp for bacteria cp with natural fe solar heat solar fe solar pds cp cp in presence of nom 3 7 comparison of the combined process triple activation of pds with solar photo fenton in order to benchmark the combined process cp built with a well known aop that uses similar resources and reaction conditions a comparison with a photo fenton reaction pf was done in addition a reaction including h2o2 to the cp conditions is tested cp with h2o2 hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical contributions to disinfection in the combined process and the photo fenton process with pds are evaluated by using tert butanol tba as a scavenger to block hydroxyl radical effects on e coli inactivation a summary is presented in fig 8 under the studied conditions the combined process cp and photo fenton present comparable results with complete bacterial inactivation after 60 min the addition of pds to the photo fenton process resulted in high enhancement with complete disinfection 6 log decrease in e coli population within less than 30 min of experimentation addition of free radicals generating species h2o2 or s2o8 2 clearly participated to disinfection since the inactivation is highly enhanced compared to disinfection by applied conditions alone no radicals curve compared to sodis at 20 c the combined process coupled with hydrogen peroxide pf with pds reached total inactivation after 30 min while sodis was still inefficient after 1 h showing the biggest enhancement achieved during this work the rapid inactivation of bacteria in the process coupling hydrogen peroxide h2o2 with pds s2o8 2 can be partly explained by the capacity of hydrogen peroxide to directly activate pds devi et al 2016 the interaction mechanisms between these species towards bacterial inactivation is yet not well understood but according to the results reported high synergistic effects can be considered for such a system which includes four activation factors solar light iron heat and hydrogen peroxide when adding tba to the cp e coli inactivation takes more time to achieve total disinfection 90 min with tba while only 60 min without suggesting participation of the hydroxyl radicals to the disinfection process as shown in eqs 17 and 18 before moreover when tba is applied inactivation is still more efficient than the system under the same conditions with no pds meaning that sulfate radicals also act on the disinfection of drinking water the addition of tba in the photo fenton system with pds also reduces the inactivation of e coli reaching results comparable to the combined process supposing that there is enough tba to block hydroxyl radicals concentration of tba is at least 10 orders of magnitude higher than steady state hydroxyl radical concentration estimated this observation suggests that more sulfate radicals are involved when hydrogen peroxide is present fortifying the idea that hydrogen peroxide can act as an activator of pds devi et al 2016 sun et al 2016 additional experimentation with anisole a known sulfate radical scavenger has not yielded valuable results as its immediate toxicity does not allow interpretation of the mechanism as such further experiments are required to clearly identify and quantify the contribution of both sulfate and hydroxyl radical species furthermore a comparison was performed concerning all the targets of the study namely micropollutants bacteria and viruses among the photo fenton and the triple pds activation fig 9 considering the photo fenton process lower micropollutant removal is achieved about 50 in 2 h compared with more than 95 in 1 h for the cp bacterial inactivation is similar in the two oxidation processes and the ms2 inactivation differs in favor of the photo fenton process it can be concluded that in overall the cp is more effective for organic contaminant elimination and the pf process is globally more efficient on microorganisms inactivation than on micropollutant removal the main difference among photo fenton and sulfate radical mediated degradation of the micro contaminants is that sulfate and hydroxyl radicals react with organic compounds through different mechanisms so4 mainly involves outer space mechanism while ho involves a bridged mechanism devi et al 2016 outer space and bridged mechanisms are electron transfer mechanisms specific to redox reactions the first one presents relatively faster electron transfer rates since this mechanism does not require any bond formation rastogi et al 2009 most probably this is due to their lifetime being more than a thousand times longer than the respective of hydroxyl radicals about 3 10 5 s for so4 and 2 10 8 s for ho increasing their probability to reach target molecules ghanbari and moradi 2017 michael kordatou et al 2015 also the high reactivity of hydroxyl radicals consumes the oxidant h2o2 rapidly for the degradation of the parent compound and the intermediate compound without discrimination the high selectivity of the sulfate radicals allows targeting the readily oxidizable moieties however this would reflect to the overall diminishing of the toc in the photo fenton process rather than plain the transformation of the parent compound and hence non detection by the lc ms method the same cannot be said for microorganisms where the longer lifetime of sulfate radicals is counterbalanced by their reactivity with biomolecules hence the aforementioned mitigation and shift of inactivation efficiency for bacteria and ms2 respectively 4 conclusions in this study solar water disinfection sodis enhancement using sulfate radicals was evaluated through persulfate activation using different activation factors against bacterial inactivation the evolution of e coli concentration was monitored during the reacting time in order to assess effectiveness of disinfection through persulfate activation in principle in the context of sodis pds could play the role of enhancer when activated by solar light iron or heat from the factors assessed a relative order of activation efficacy can be established iron light heat as found by the inactivation kinetics in mild conditions 1 ppm iron and 40 c the step wise construction of the combined triple activation process indicated synergies among the factors assessed solar light with iron shv fe 2 13 and solar light with heat shv 40 c 1 22 pairs showed high synergistic effects whereas iron with heat did not present any synergy sfe 40 c 1 00 the combined process including three activation factors built and optimized for sodis enhancement reported high enhancement and synergistic effects between the three activation factors shv fe 40 c 2 20 the heterogeneous fe activation demonstrated good inactivation potentials as it had efficiently enhanced bacterial inactivation through the use of iron oxides and mineral iron in addition the process performed well when nom was present in the solution even demonstrating enhancement due to iron nom complexation also the cp has achieved good degradation of mps pharmaceuticals and pesticides in water as well as rapid ms2 inactivation the comparison with the well established photo fenton process revealed that bacterial inactivation was equally fast but mp degradation was even faster the above factors indicate the possible applicability in real waters and interchangeability among the application of photo fenton and pds mediated cp the addition of both pds and h2o2 led to further 50 reduction of the residence time indicating potential of using the process in other more advanced context in conclusion mild additions of fe and pds under solar uv light are a promising application for developing and or sunny countries due to its moderate cost and applicability wherever the proposition of the photo fenton process could be applied cp could be as well assessed the limiting factor is always the oxidant h2o2 pds however if transport and distribution at reasonable cost could be achieved the success for both processes could be implied as well considering the small contribution of heating to the combined process coupling solar light with iron seems to be more promising in the context of sodis in pet bottles and using pds activation more advantageous in a cpc reactor which does not achieve high temperatures acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the european project waterspoutt h2020 water 5c 2015 ga 688928 for the financial support appendix a supplementary

19538,fenton s reagent has been widely used to enhance sludge dewaterability however drawbacks associated with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in fenton s reagents exist since it is a hazardous chemical and shows carcinogenicity explosivity instability and corrosivity moreover initial acidification and subsequent neutralization are needed as optimal conditions for homogeneous fenton conditioning and final filtrate discharge in this study a fenton like process for the enhanced dewaterability of waste activated sludge with in situ generation of h2o2 and without extra ph adjustment was firstly proposed namely citric acid ca assisted oxygen activation in an air nano zero valent iron nzvi system and chemical re coagulation with polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdmdaac using the response surface methodology rsm the optimal doses of ca nzvi and pdmdaac were determined to be 13 33 and 9 mg g 1 dry solids ds respectively this composite conditioner showed a good dewatering capability compared with the raw sludge e g the capillary suction time decreased from 130 0 to 9 5 s the enhanced sludge dewaterability was further confirmed by laboratory scale diaphragm filter press dewatering tests which produced a lower cake moisture content compared with the raw sludge and the final ph of the filtrate was close to neutrality the citric acid promoted the production of h2o2 and fe ii fe iii species the degradation of protein in tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances and the decomposition of protein n in the solid phase of sludge resulting a greater conversion of bound water to free water the results of electron spin resonance indicated that the hydroxyl radicals were mainly responsible for the decomposition of proteinaceous compounds the subsequent chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac can make the zeta potential of sludge samples less negative reduce the repulsive electrostatic interactions and agglomerate the smaller particles into larger aggregates thus

large amounts of waste activated sludge containing more than 99 wt of water sludge dewatering is to reduce sludge volume by water separation and save costs for the subsequent transportation incineration and handling qi et al 2011 sludge composition i e extracellular polymeric substances eps is one of the key factors affecting sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2016 the removal of bound water the sum of the interstitial surface and internal water is another important factor governing sludge dewatering he et al 2017 the traditional flocculants fail to decompose eps structure and release bound water to free water neyens et al 2004 numerous studies reported that fenton process was effective for sludge dewatering through solubilizing eps components yu et al 2016 dai et al 2017 liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 with hydroxyl radicals generated via the reaction between fe ii and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 however drawbacks of fenton conditioning exist due to the use of hazardous chemicals i e h2o2 which is carcinogenic explosive instable and corrosive in nature thus posing a big threat to the ecological system and causing difficulty in storage and transportation neyens et al 2004 other oxidants such as peroxymonosulfate and persulfate have been investigated to replace h2o2 to decompose eps and enhance sludge dewatering however the prices of peroxymonosulfate and persulfate were much higher than h2o2 liu et al 2016 moreover initial acidification and or subsequent neutralization with chemicals are necessary for fenton conditioning and the final filtrate discharge initial acidification at ph of 3 is often needed for fenton oxidation to prevent iron precipitation neyens et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 also reported that acidification and fenton oxidation showed a synergistic effect in improving sludge dewaterability subsequent neutralization with alkaline additives such as red mud zhang et al 2014 and lime yu et al 2016 was also necessary for the final filtrate discharge the urgent need for a stable low cost and environmental friendly oxidant without initial acidification and or subsequent neutralization drives the sustained research on a new oxidant for sludge dewatering researchers have reported that molecular oxygen is a green and cost effective oxidant huang et al 2015 mu et al 2017 the molecular oxygen activated with nano zero valent iron nzvi can be used to degrade organic pollutants for wastewater treatment with the generation of reactive oxygen species ros i e oh and o2 shen et al 2017 generally nzvi induced molecular oxygen activation process takes place as follows firstly nzvi reacts with o2 to generate h2o2 via a two electron molecular oxygen reduction accompanying with the fe2 release eq 1 joo et al 2004 subsequently the released fe2 also reacts with o2 to generate h2o2 through a sequential single electron molecular oxygen activation pathway eqs 2 and 3 noradoun and cheng 2005 the in situ generated h2o2 then reacts with fe ii to produce oh eq 4 joo et al 2004 the major drawback of this route for the generation of ros from the molecular oxygen activated with nzvi is the narrow working ph of acidic conditions ferric ions would precipitate under neutral or alkaline ph values in form of iron hydroxides and then existed as an iron oxides film on the surface of nzvi thus hindering fe ii release and ros generation qin et al 2015 this drawback could be overcome by introducing ligands to chelate fe ii so as to maintain the dissolution of fe ii and generate the subsequent ros at neutral or weakly alkaline ph cui et al 2017 1 o2 fe0 2h fe2 h2o2 2 o2 fe2 o2 fe3 3 o2 fe2 2h h2o2 fe3 4 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh the addition of ligand can promote fenton like reaction at neutral or weakly alkaline ph through chelating iron ions and maintain the dissolved iron concentration at a sufficient level cui et al 2017 a variety of ligands have been reported to chelate ferrous ferric ions in fenton like process to promote the generation of reactive oxygen species i e oh for the removal of organic pollutants and contaminants gong et al 2016 shen et al 2017 the organic ligands such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid are recalcitrant in nature and show poor biodegradability thus causing secondary environmental pollution while the inorganic ligand such as polyphosphate may cause problems for subsequent phosphorus removal cui et al 2017 citric acid ca is an environmental friendly tricarboxylic acid the environmentally benign ca has been used for pollutants degradation and shows superiority due to its larger molecular size greater accessibility to iron center and slighter consumption during the degradation process gong et al 2016 when the citric acid ca was used as a ligand the citric acid could chelate both ferrous and ferric ions cui et al 2017 gong et al 2016 he et al 2016 firstly nzvi reacts with o2 to generate h2o2 accompanying with the release of fe2 eq 1 after this by the addition of the citric acid to the reactive media the ferrous ions are chelated by the citric acid eq 5 and are not precipitated as iron oxides in a following step the fe ii cit complex is oxidized to a fe iii cit complex allowing the formation of additional hydroxyl radicals eqs 6 8 5 fe ii cit fe ii cit 6 fe ii cit o2 fe iii cit o2 7 fe ii cit o2 2h fe iii cit h2o2 8 fe ii cit sol h2o2 sol fe iii cit sol oh oh fenton oxidation can degrade eps and release bound water so as to enhance dewaterability neyens et al 2004 furthermore better filtration and separation performance could be achieved when pre oxidation treatment was followed by coagulation with inorganic coagulant or organic polymer therefore the combination of pre oxidation process with organic polymers can effectively agglomerate sludge tiny flocs and improve sludge filterability when simultaneously releasing bound water he et al 2016 polyacrylamide pam is commonly used in full scale wastewater treatment plants for sludge dewatering wang et al 2012 however pam and its derivatives are non biodegradable carcinogenic and neurotoxic thus posing serious threats to the environment and human health ho et al 2010 in comparison polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdmdaac is more environmental friendly as it is less toxic and cheaper and has been widely used in wastewater treatment yang et al 2013 herein in this paper a combination of ca assisted air nzvi pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac was investigated via molecular oxygen activation with attempts to avoid the addition of h2o2 and extra ph adjustment its enhancement of sludge dewatering was optimized in terms of combination modes and doses of sludge conditioners the flowchart of this study is shown in fig 1 it is widely accepted that hydrophilic substances in waste activated sludge are mainly consisted of extracellular proteins and proteins are more important than polysaccharides and humic acids in affecting sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 the kinetic variations in the concentration distribution composition and functional groups of extracellular proteins along with sludge physiochemical properties were also characterized 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw sludge and chemicals the raw sludge was thickened sludge derived from a local shahu municipal wastewater treatment plant wuhan china which treated municipal wastewater using an anaerobic anoxic aerobic process at a treatment capability of 100 000 m3 d 1 it was stored at 4 c before use less than one week before tests started the raw sludge samples were diluted with milli q water pgz up shanghai china the characteristics of the diluted raw sludge were listed as follows total solids ts 22

purification system pgz up shanghai china was used for solution preparation 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 the pre oxidation process 250 ml sludge was used for sludge conditioning in a 1000 ml glass bottle equipped with porous caps to investigate the pre oxidation process to investigate the effects of initial ca and nzvi concentrations on the pre oxidation process two sets of experiments were conducted 1 the influences of the initial nzvi concentrations on sludge solubilization were studied using six different nzvi concentrations 0 11 22 44 88 and 132 mg g 1ds the other reaction conditions were maintained 17 mg g 1ds of ca reaction time of 1 h room temperature and an original ph of sludge sample ph 6 78 2 to assess the influences of the initial ca concentrations on sludge solubilization experiments were investigated at 44 mg g 1ds of nzvi reaction time of 1 h room temperature and an original ph of sludge sample ph 6 78 six different amounts of ca were added into the glass bottles with the respective ca concentrations of 0 8 5 17 26 34 and 51 mg g 1ds for both two sets of experiments ca was added into the sludge samples followed by the addition of nzvi and the mixture was mixed with compressed air for 1 h jiebao shanghai china conditioned sludge samples were drawn for the determination of concentrations of h2o2 fe ii fe iii ions and soluble protein 2 2 2 the combined pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation process 2 2 2 1 response surface methodology the optimal doses of ca nzvi and pdmdaac were determined using the response surface methodology rsm which has been widely used to optimize chemical doses for sludge dewatering process yu et al 2016 doses of ca x1 nzvi x2 and pdmdaac x3 were chosen as the independent input variables the water content of the vacuum filtered cake wc was chosen as the dependent output variable a central composite design ccd in rsm was used to optimize the doses of ca nzvi and pdmdaac with related ranges and levels of these three factors listed in table 1 wc derived from the uniform description is presented in table 2 verification of the statistical experimental strategies was also conducted 2 2 2 2 sludge dewatering

individual or combined sludge conditioning the combined ca assisted air nzvi pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac denoted as ca nzvi p were conducted 13 mg g 1ds of ca and 33 mg g 1ds of nzvi were added to 250 ml sludge in a 1000 ml glass bottle equipped with porous caps the mixture was mixed with compressed air for 1 h jiebao shanghai china afterwards 9 mg g 1ds of pdmdaac was sequentially added and stirred at 150 rpm for 10 min with a mixer my3000 6c jiangxi china ca nzvi or pdmdaac was replaced with equivalent volume of milli q water in the control groups table 3 afterwards sludge samples were drawn for the determination of cst wc particle size fe ii fe iii ions zeta potential and eps extraction as well as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses 2 2 3 identification of radicals to identify the main radicals responsible for the ca assisted air nzvi pre oxidation process quenching experiments were firstly conducted with details provided in the supplementary data for the identification of main radicals the sludge samples were centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min to obtain the sludge supernatant to exclude interference of the solid phase of sludge on the determination of radicals 200 ml of sludge supernatant was used 13 mg g 1ds of ca was added to the supernatant followed by 33 mg g 1ds of nzvi the mixture was stirred at 300 rpm in the atmosphere at 8 min mixing the sample was drawn for electron spin resonance esr spectra measurement 2 2 4 sludge dewatering by a laboratory scale diaphragm filter press a laboratory scale diaphragm filter press was used for the deep dewatering of sludge samples the photo of the diaphragm filter press is shown in fig s1 supplementary data and the details of the filter press can be found in yu et al 2016 briefly the diaphragm filter press was equipped with 6 diaphragm plates 250 mm length 250 mm width 10 mm height the dewatering procedure was comprised of a feeding pressing phase 0 8 mpa for 30 min and a diaphragm pressing phase 1 2 mpa for 10 min for the raw sludge rs it was fed into a feeding tank and then treated using the following procedures 150 rpm stir for 5 min 30 min feeding 0 8 mpa 10 min diaphragm squeezing 1 2 mpa for sludge samples treated with pdmdaac the following procedures were conducted rs fed into the tank 150 rpm stir for 5 min

the following conditioning procedures were conducted rs fed into the tank 150 rpm stir for 5 min addition of 13 mg g 1ds of ca addition of 33 mg g 1ds of nzvi mixed at 150 rpm in open air for 1 h addition of 9 mg g 1ds of pdmdaac mixed at 150 rpm for 10 min 30 min feeding 0 8 mpa 10 min diaphragm squeezing 1 2 mpa subsequently the sludge cakes can be obtained and water contents of the dewatered sludge cakes were determined 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 sludge dewaterability cst and wc were used to evaluate the sludge dewaterability the measurement of cst was conducted with a cst instrument model 304 b triton uk equipped with an 18 mm diameter funnel the whatman no 17 chromatography grade paper was used for cst measurement to measure wc the sludge samples were firstly treated by vacuum filtration method with details described in liu et al 2012 briefly 100 ml sludge sample was poured into a standard buchner funnel and a constant vacuum pressure of 50 kpa was applied for 20 min the water content of the vacuum filtered sludge cake trapped by the filter paper was measured according to the standard method and calculated according to the following equation wc w1 w2 w1 100 where w1 is the weight of the vacuum filtered sludge cake after filtration and w2 is the weight of the vacuum filtered sludge cake dried at 105 c overnight apha 2005 2 3 2 the measurement of radicals the radicals were firstly trapped with dmpo the signal was then measured using an esr spectroscopy jes fa 200 osaka japan at room temperature data were recorded at a microwave power of 0 998 mw a sweep time of 1 min and a center magnetic field of 3226 9 gauss g yuan and dai 2014 triplicates were conducted for each test 2 3 3 eps extraction eps of sludge samples described in section 2 2 2 2 was extracted according to the procedures described in li and yang 2007 and can be stratified into soluble eps sb eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps details of the extraction process were described in the supplementary data 2 3 4 other parameters the measurements of total solids and volatile solids followed the standard methods apha 2005 a protein assay kit thermofisher shanghai china was used for protein measurement based on the lowry s method frølund et al 1995 the concentration of polysaccharide was measured with phenol sulfuric method dubois et al 1956 the concentration of h2o2 was analyzed via titanometry cui et al 2017 the concentrations of fe ii and fe total in the solution were analyzed using 1 10 phenanthroline method at a wavelength of 510 nm by a dr 2000 spectrophotometer shimadzu kyoto japan schnell et al 1998 the concentration of fe iii was calculated as the difference between fe ii and fe total a zetasizer nano zs90 instrument malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk was used to measure the zeta potential of the sludge samples and biomacromolecules the particle size distribution of sludge sample was measured with a particle size analyzer malvern worcestershire uk the ftir analyses of sludge samples were conducted using a nicolet is50 ftir spectrometer thermo massachusetts usa with the scanning wavelengths of 400 4000 cm 1 xps was conducted using a phi quantera sxm phi 5300 esca kyoto japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 the pre oxidation process 3 1 1 effects of initial dose of nzvi the influence of the initial doses of nzvi on the pre oxidation process was investigated with initial dose of nzvi ranging from 0 to 132 mg g 1ds as shown in fig 2 with the initial dose of nzvi increased from 0 to 88 mg g 1ds the concentrations of h2o2 fig 2a iron ions fe ii and fe iii fig 2b and soluble protein fig 2c all increased and the concentration of fe iii was higher than fe ii while sludge filterability deteriorated as indicated by increased cst values fig 2a this may be attributed to the speculation that the reaction between ferrous ions from the corrosion of nzvi eq 1 and in situ generated h2o2 in the ca nzvi system may promote the generation of hydroxyl radicals fu et al 2015 thus resulting in the eps degradation and the release of bound water through disintegrating sludge flocs the increased amounts of small size particles caused by eps degradation and sludge disintegration may bind the porous structure during filtration thus deteriorating sludge dewaterability dogan and sanin 2009 however the excess nzvi till 88 mg g 1ds did not result in further increases in the concentrations of h2o2 iron species fe ii and fe iii and soluble protein this may be due to that the dissolution of nzvi to fe ii has reached its maximum and the further increase in the dose of nzvi did not increase the concentration of fe ii and improve the chelating ability of fe ii and ca 3 1 2 effects of initial ca concentration fig 3 shows the effects of initial ca concentration on the pre oxidation process as evidenced the initial ca concentration significantly affected the generation of h2o2 fig 3a iron dissolution fig 3b and protein solubilization fig 3c thus affecting the cst values of sludge samples fig 3a as the initial ca concentration increased from 0 to 51 mg g 1ds the cst values and the concentrations of iron ions fe ii and fe iii all showed increasing trends and the concentration of fe iii was higher than fe ii although partial ca can be degraded by the produced hydroxyl radicals the increased ca concentration may chelate more fe ii and compensate the degraded ca concentration to some extent thus contributing to the increased pre oxidation ability huang et al 2015 the addition of ca would decrease the initial ph values of sludge samples 6 78 5 34 and this may be related with the dissociation of the hydrogen ions moreover the subsequent addition of nzvi would increase the ph value of sludge samples to 6 19 and this can be related with the consumption of h for the conversion of nzvi to ferrous ions after 1 h of reaction the ph values of sludge samples further increased ph of 7 66 indicating that the ca nzvi system was a proton consuming process in this study the addition of ca played two roles in the ca assisted air nzvi system for the pre oxidation in sludge dewatering firstly as is known due to the involvement of h in the corrosion reactions and the formation of passive layer of iron oxides i e fe oh 2 fe oh 3 feooh and fe3o4 the reactivity of nzvi decreased at higher ph values guan et al 2015 mass transfer resistance in the diffusion boundary layer and iron oxides film of nzvi particles often limits the total reaction rate in the oxidation process in the nzvi air system agrawal and tratnyek 1996 citric acid is an acidifying agent and has been reported to make a ph buffer at ph 3 pka 3 08 seol and javandel 2008 the addition of citric acid may help to enhance the oxidation rate through accelerating the mass transfer by dissolution of the metal and breakdown of the passive oxide layer secondly after adding citric acid the ferrous ions can be chelated by the citric acid eq 5 this could help to prevent iron from precipitation the precipitation of iron oxides was typically observed in the conventional fenton process under neutral conditions in comparison in the ca assisted air nzvi system the fe ii cit complex can be oxidized to fe iii cit complex and iron precipitation can be hindered thus promoting the formation of more hydroxyl radicals eqs 6 8 cui et al 2017 he et al 2016 fe iii could be reduced into fe ii via eqs 9 and 10 as presented in eq 9 some fe iii cit might be reduced into fe ii cit by h2o2 as presented in eq 10 some fe iii cit might be reduced into fe ii cit with electron donor from nzvi corrosion however these two reduction reactions are quite slow therefore the concentration of fe iii in the solution was much higher than that of fe ii as shown in figs 2b and 3b on the basis of the above possible reaction paths a schematic showing the role of ca in the fenton like reaction has been added as fig 4 9 fe iii cit h2o2 fe ii cit h ho2 10 2fe iii cit fe0 2fe ii cit fe2 3 2 the combined pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation process 3 2 1 optimization of composite conditioner the optimal sludge dewatering efficiency in terms of lowest water content of the vacuum filtered sludge cake was acquired using a model as follows 11 y 76 85 3 3x1 15 28x2 0 66x3 0 49x1x2 0 39x1x3 0 10x2x3 0 69 x1 2 3 88x2 2 0 15x3 2 where x1 x2 and x3 are the coded values of the doses of ca mg g 1ds nzvi mg g 1ds and pdmdaac mg g 1ds respectively y is wc wt the model f value of 9 08 implied that the model is significant and the p value prob f of 0 0009 was less than 0 05 indicating that the second order polynomial model was significant a good fitting between the predicted and measured data was observed as indicated by a regression coefficient r2 of 0 89 suggesting that the mathematical model was significant from eq 11 the optimal experimental conditions were nzvi of 33 mg g 1ds ca of 13 mg g 1ds and pdmdaac of 9 mg g 1ds to verify the model additional experiments were conducted in triplicates and the results indicated that the moisture content of the dewatered sludge cake was 78 6 wt which was close to the predicted value by the model 78 3 wt 3 2 2 sludge dewaterability by different composite conditioners based on the results of rsm analysis the composite conditioner of ca nzvi p was added at their optimal doses nzvi of 33 mg g 1ds ca of 13 mg g 1ds and pdmdaac of 9 mg g 1ds the dewaterability of the raw sludge and sludge samples treated with different composite conditioners are shown in fig 5 for the single oxidation process of ca nzvi conditioner the sludge samples showed a poor dewaterability as indicated by the increased cst and wc values yu et al 2016 also reported that the high dose of oxidant i e h2o2 would significantly deteriorate sludge dewaterability and this may be related with the increased amounts of small size particles due to pre oxidation therefore a link to chemical re coagulation is necessary for the ca nzvi conditioner in sludge dewatering with the addition of pdmdaac cst and wc all decreased fig 5a indicating that pdmdaac was effective in reducing sludge filterability and cake moisture content the addition of pdmdaac can coagulate smaller sludge flocs into larger ones thus improving sludge dewaterability huang et al 2015 compared with the raw sludge rs the cst of the sludge conditioned by this composite conditioner of ca nzvi p decreased from 130 0 to 9 5 s and wc decreased from 95 8 to 78 6 wt the calculated bound water content is shown in fig 5b the results indicated that bound water content also decreased from 4 25 g g 1ds of raw sludge to 3 10 g g 1ds of sludge sample treated by the composite conditioner ca nzvi p possibly suggesting that the bound water trapped in eps was released and converted into free water due to the decomposition of eps it is also noted that the dewaterability in terms of wc cst and bound water of sludge samples conditioned by this composite conditioner ca nzvi p was also better than those conditioned by other composite conditioners for all the conditions investigated the differences for respective wc cst and bound water were significant with p values all less than 0 05 3 3 sludge dewatering mechanism 3 3 1 eps properties as protein is the main organic matter affecting sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 the changes of extracellular protein under different treatment conditions were investigated as shown in fig 6 the protein contents of sludge samples treated with the composite conditioner of ca nzvi reached their maximum in sb eps and minimum in tb eps this may be attributed to the oxidation effects more eps in the tightly bound layer may be degraded into small dissolved organic matters and then shifted into the bulk liquid sb eps zhang et al 2014 moreover it is also noted that the protein contents in sb eps in sludge samples conditioned with ca p were higher than those in sludge samples conditioned with p nzvi p and the raw sludge rs this may be related with the dissociation of h after adding ca to sludge samples and the sludge flocs and cells may be disintegrated due to the decreased ph values thus resulting in the increased protein content in the bulk liquid xie et al 2014 ftir was used to investigate the functional groups on the surface of the solid sludge samples so as to correlate with the changes of proteinaceous compounds in the bulk liquid before and after treatments by the composite conditioner fig 7 shows the ftir spectra of samples treated at different conditions based on the assignments of main identification peaks supplementary data table s1 four main peaks were observed in the original sewage sludge bsa and those samples conditioned with the composite conditioner of ca nzvi and the composite conditioner of ca nzvi p the experimental details for the model protein of bsa were shown in the supplementary data for all the samples investigated raw sludge and bsa no significant differences in peaks at bands at 1030 cm 1 and 1455 cm 1 were observed however the peak at a band of 3400 cm 1 assigned to oh stretching became more intense in conditioned samples ca nzvi and ca nzvi p compared with the raw samples this is probably related to the pre oxidation of raw sludge by the composite conditioners particularly the peak at a band of 1645 cm 1 assigned to c o in ketone and amine groups became more intense in conditioned samples ca nzvi and ca nzvi p compared with the raw samples possibly suggesting the degradation of proteinaceous compounds accompanied with more production of functional groups i e amine the n containing compounds in sludge solids can be classified into inorganic n protein n pyridine n pyrrole n quaternary n and nitrile n based on the different binding energies he et al 2015 supplementary data table s2 to further analyze the distribution of n containing compounds in sludge solid samples before and after treatments with the composite conditioner ca nzvi p xps analysis was used to provide more evidences to support the changes of proteinaceous compounds in the bulk liquid the high resolution spectra of c 1s o 1s and n 1s were investigated to obtain the detailed information of the chemical functionalities of sludge solid residues fig 8 a and b as shown in fig 8c and d organic protein n was the predominant n containing compound in the raw solid sludge residues and the results of xiao et al 2017a supported this finding after treating the sludge samples with the composite conditioner of ca nzvi p a significant peak binding energy of 402 ev at the side of high binding energy of n 1s in the sample was observed it implies that inorganic n containing compounds i e nh4 n may appear after the pre oxidation reaction induced by the composite conditioner of ca nzvi p and were possibly generated from the degradation of protein n the degradation of protein n in the sludge solid residue may be related with the increased soluble protein concentration in the bulk liquid as shown in fig 6 3 3 2 sludge physicochemical properties as shown in fig s2 supplementary data for the model protein bsa upon exposure to the composite conditioner of ca nzvi the zeta potential of bsa became more negative indicating that the decomposition of bsa and more negative functional groups may be released upon exposure to this ca nzvi conditioner however after conditioning the oxidized bsa with pdmdaac the zeta potential becomes less negative which suggests the decreasing negative charge density and the related higher degree of damage on electric double layer the repulsive force between particles would be reduced thus leading to agglomeration of flocs and finally enhanced sludge dewaterability li et al 2015 consistent with the results of model bsa the zeta potential of sludge samples treated with the composite conditioner of ca nzvi obviously decreased from 25 8 0 14 mv to 34 65 0 50 mv fig 9 a this may be related with the release of negative charged compounds i e protein as shown in fig 6 however it significantly increased with the addition of pdmdaac to the oxidized sludge sample ca nzvi p li et al 2015 also found that the addition of pdmdaac can result in charge neutralization and less negative zeta potential noted that the zeta potential of sludge samples treated by ca nzvi p was still more negative than those treated by the composite conditioner of ca p p and nzvi p this may because that the added pdmdaac may not completely coagulate the released negatively charged organic compounds due to the prior oxidization process induced by the ca nzvi conditioner the results of particle size distribution further supported this hypothesis as shown in fig 9b the particle size of the sludge conditioned by the ca nzvi conditioner was the smallest among the samples the ca nzvi conditioner possibly degraded the organics from large sizes into small ones via highly reactive hydroxyl radicals even with the coagulation effects of pdmdaac the particle size of the flocs treated with the composite conditioner of ca nzvi p was still smaller than that of the raw sludge rs it is also noted that differences between the zeta potential values of raw sludge and treated sludge by the ca nzvi pdmdaac conditioner were indiscernible and this was possibly due to the prior oxidation effects induced by the ca nzvi oxidation and the low dose of pdmdaac the composite conditioner of ca nzvi p might be not suitable for application with belt filter press or centrifugation however it is proved to be effective for deep dewatering in a plate and frame filter press process similar results have been noted in other deep dewatering processes i e fenton process yu et al 2016 and fe ii activated oxone oxidation process xiao et al 2017b 3 3 3 the generation and roles of radicals the radicals quenching experiments indicated that oh was the main radical in the ca nzvi system supplementary data fig s3 esr was used to further confirm and detect the production of oh during the pre oxidation process induced by the ca nzvi process no significant signals of o2 or ho2 were observed except for the signal of oh four line spectra dmpo oh with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 were observed fig 10 indicating that the generation of oh the oh radicals may be generated through eq 8 3 4 effects of ca assisted air nzvi pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac on sludge dewatering the ca assisted air nzvi pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac can significantly enhance sludge dewaterability proteinaceous organic compounds are considered as intrinsic and important parts of eps and high presence of proteinaceous matters have been consistently reported to deteriorate sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 the decreased protein content in tb eps may be related with the decomposition of eps by the attack of in situ generated oh fig 10 and protein in tb eps was gradually converted into sb eps and lb eps fig 6 for both extracellular proein and model protein of bsa the appearance of functional groups such as oh stretching and co in amine of ftir results may further indicate the degradation of organic protein in the sludge solid phase fig 7 moreover more presence of inorganic n containing compounds was noted in sludge samples treated by the ca nzvi p conditioner as indicated by xps results fig 8 possibly indicating that the degradation of protein n for the ca nzvi p conditioner the pre oxidation induced by ca assisted air nzvi system may cause both the destruction of proteinaceous compounds in the solid phase and degradation of protein in tb eps thus in turn resulting in more release of bound water compared with the raw sludge and sludge sample conditioned with pdmdaac alone fig 5b however the pre oxidation alone can release negatively charged organic compounds fig 9a the subsequent chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac can make the zeta potential of sludge samples by pre oxidation less negative and neutralize the surface charges of the particles the addition of pdmdaac can reduce the repulsive electrostatic interactions and agglomerate the smaller particles by pre oxidation into larger aggregates fig 9 and sludge filterability was more significantly enhanced compared with pre oxidation alone fig 5a further studies on the quantitative identification in the respective impacts of pre oxidation and the subsequent flocculation on sludge dewatering were necessary moreover as shown in table s3 supplementary data the results of water content of the dewatered sludge cakes obtained from a laboratory scale diaphragm filter press experiments further indicated that the combined pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation can significantly enhance sludge dewaterability compared with the raw sludge 73 16 wt versus 85 00 wt although this ca nzvi pdmdaac conditioner only achieved 3 17 higher removal of water content compared with the coagulation effect with pdmdaac alone this enhancement was significant as it mainly contributed to the removal of the bound water in sludge moisture as which was the most difficult part to be removed and the main limiting factor governing sludge dewatering efficiency since it cannot be removed by the traditional flocculants i e pdmdaac he et al 2016 3 5 implication for sludge dewatering generally sludge dewatering is a costly process regarding to the cost analysis of the proposed citric acid assisted fenton like process two comparative cost analyses were investigated one was to compare with the two commonly used ligands in fenton like process edta noradoun and cheng 2005 and sodium tetrapolyphosphate kim et al 2015 the other was to compare with the traditional fenton process yu et al 2016 as shown in table s4 the unit price of citric acid 550 700 usd ton 1 was much lower than those of edta 2000 5000 usd ton 1 and sodium polyphosphate 980 1040 usd ton 1 as shown in table s5 the total cost of the reagents in the ca nzvi pdmdaac treatment process was 51 54 usd ton 1 ds which was a bit lower than that of the traditional fenton process 54 65 usd ton 1 ds the widespread application of the traditional fenton process is still limited due to the necessity of initial acidification ph of 2 5 4 using acids i e sulfuric acid to prevent iron precipitation high cost of hydrogen peroxide and the subsequent neutralization using alkaline additives i e lime and red mud for final filtrate discharge yu et al 2016 the ca nzvi p approach used in this study might be attractive since it exhibited enhanced sludge dewaterability without using h2o2 and extra ph adjustment in the ca nzvi p treatment no extra addition of h2o2 was needed since it can be generated in situ and the final ph of sludge samples treated with ca nzvi p conditioning was close to neutrality therefore extra ph adjustment with lime was also successfully avoided nzvi may be further replaced with commercially available iron powders which could be effective in activating molecular oxygen to enhance sludge dewatering at a lower cost 4 conclusions this study investigated the application of a composite conditioner ca nzvi p for sludge dewatering the conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the composite conditioner of air ca nzvi pdmdaac can avoid the initial acidification and subsequent neutralization for sludge dewatering using a fenton like process it also circumvented the addition of extra h2o2 since it promoted in situ generation of h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals 2 cst was significantly decreased from 130 0 to 9 5 s under the optimal conditions where 13 mg g 1ds of ca 33 mg g 1ds of nzvi and 9 mg g 1 ds of pdmdaac were used after the rsm optimization the results obtained with a laboratory scale diaphragm filter press further indicated the efficacy of the composite conditioner ca nzvi p in enhancing sludge dewaterability 3 a two step mechanism of the air ca nzvi pdmdaac conditioning was proposed firstly in the pre oxidation step the proteinaceous compounds in the solid phase were destructed and protein was degraded in tb eps thus resulting in the release of bound water secondly in the subsequent chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac zeta potential values of sludge samples became less negative the repulsive electrostatic interactions of sludge flocs were reduced and small particles were agglomerated into large particles thus enhancing sludge dewaterability acknowledgments the research was supported by the national

19538,fenton s reagent has been widely used to enhance sludge dewaterability however drawbacks associated with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in fenton s reagents exist since it is a hazardous chemical and shows carcinogenicity explosivity instability and corrosivity moreover initial acidification and subsequent neutralization are needed as optimal conditions for homogeneous fenton conditioning and final filtrate discharge in this study a fenton like process for the enhanced dewaterability of waste activated sludge with in situ generation of h2o2 and without extra ph adjustment was firstly proposed namely citric acid ca assisted oxygen activation in an air nano zero valent iron nzvi system and chemical re coagulation with polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdmdaac using the response surface methodology rsm the optimal doses of ca nzvi and pdmdaac were determined to be 13 33 and 9 mg g 1 dry solids ds respectively this composite conditioner showed a good dewatering capability compared with the raw sludge e g the capillary suction time decreased from 130 0 to 9 5 s the enhanced sludge dewaterability was further confirmed by laboratory scale diaphragm filter press dewatering tests which produced a lower cake moisture content compared with the raw sludge and the final ph of the filtrate was close to neutrality the citric acid promoted the production of h2o2 and fe ii fe iii species the degradation of protein in tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances and the decomposition of protein n in the solid phase of sludge resulting a greater conversion of bound water to free water the results of electron spin resonance indicated that the hydroxyl radicals were mainly responsible for the decomposition of proteinaceous compounds the subsequent chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac can make the zeta potential of sludge samples less negative reduce the repulsive electrostatic interactions and agglomerate the smaller particles into larger aggregates thus

large amounts of waste activated sludge containing more than 99 wt of water sludge dewatering is to reduce sludge volume by water separation and save costs for the subsequent transportation incineration and handling qi et al 2011 sludge composition i e extracellular polymeric substances eps is one of the key factors affecting sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2016 the removal of bound water the sum of the interstitial surface and internal water is another important factor governing sludge dewatering he et al 2017 the traditional flocculants fail to decompose eps structure and release bound water to free water neyens et al 2004 numerous studies reported that fenton process was effective for sludge dewatering through solubilizing eps components yu et al 2016 dai et al 2017 liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 with hydroxyl radicals generated via the reaction between fe ii and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 however drawbacks of fenton conditioning exist due to the use of hazardous chemicals i e h2o2 which is carcinogenic explosive instable and corrosive in nature thus posing a big threat to the ecological system and causing difficulty in storage and transportation neyens et al 2004 other oxidants such as peroxymonosulfate and persulfate have been investigated to replace h2o2 to decompose eps and enhance sludge dewatering however the prices of peroxymonosulfate and persulfate were much higher than h2o2 liu et al 2016 moreover initial acidification and or subsequent neutralization with chemicals are necessary for fenton conditioning and the final filtrate discharge initial acidification at ph of 3 is often needed for fenton oxidation to prevent iron precipitation neyens et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 also reported that acidification and fenton oxidation showed a synergistic effect in improving sludge dewaterability subsequent neutralization with alkaline additives such as red mud zhang et al 2014 and lime yu et al 2016 was also necessary for the final filtrate discharge the urgent need for a stable low cost and environmental friendly oxidant without initial acidification and or subsequent neutralization drives the sustained research on a new oxidant for sludge dewatering researchers have reported that molecular oxygen is a green and cost effective oxidant huang et al 2015 mu et al 2017 the molecular oxygen activated with nano zero valent iron nzvi can be used to degrade organic pollutants for wastewater treatment with the generation of reactive oxygen species ros i e oh and o2 shen et al 2017 generally nzvi induced molecular oxygen activation process takes place as follows firstly nzvi reacts with o2 to generate h2o2 via a two electron molecular oxygen reduction accompanying with the fe2 release eq 1 joo et al 2004 subsequently the released fe2 also reacts with o2 to generate h2o2 through a sequential single electron molecular oxygen activation pathway eqs 2 and 3 noradoun and cheng 2005 the in situ generated h2o2 then reacts with fe ii to produce oh eq 4 joo et al 2004 the major drawback of this route for the generation of ros from the molecular oxygen activated with nzvi is the narrow working ph of acidic conditions ferric ions would precipitate under neutral or alkaline ph values in form of iron hydroxides and then existed as an iron oxides film on the surface of nzvi thus hindering fe ii release and ros generation qin et al 2015 this drawback could be overcome by introducing ligands to chelate fe ii so as to maintain the dissolution of fe ii and generate the subsequent ros at neutral or weakly alkaline ph cui et al 2017 1 o2 fe0 2h fe2 h2o2 2 o2 fe2 o2 fe3 3 o2 fe2 2h h2o2 fe3 4 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh the addition of ligand can promote fenton like reaction at neutral or weakly alkaline ph through chelating iron ions and maintain the dissolved iron concentration at a sufficient level cui et al 2017 a variety of ligands have been reported to chelate ferrous ferric ions in fenton like process to promote the generation of reactive oxygen species i e oh for the removal of organic pollutants and contaminants gong et al 2016 shen et al 2017 the organic ligands such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid are recalcitrant in nature and show poor biodegradability thus causing secondary environmental pollution while the inorganic ligand such as polyphosphate may cause problems for subsequent phosphorus removal cui et al 2017 citric acid ca is an environmental friendly tricarboxylic acid the environmentally benign ca has been used for pollutants degradation and shows superiority due to its larger molecular size greater accessibility to iron center and slighter consumption during the degradation process gong et al 2016 when the citric acid ca was used as a ligand the citric acid could chelate both ferrous and ferric ions cui et al 2017 gong et al 2016 he et al 2016 firstly nzvi reacts with o2 to generate h2o2 accompanying with the release of fe2 eq 1 after this by the addition of the citric acid to the reactive media the ferrous ions are chelated by the citric acid eq 5 and are not precipitated as iron oxides in a following step the fe ii cit complex is oxidized to a fe iii cit complex allowing the formation of additional hydroxyl radicals eqs 6 8 5 fe ii cit fe ii cit 6 fe ii cit o2 fe iii cit o2 7 fe ii cit o2 2h fe iii cit h2o2 8 fe ii cit sol h2o2 sol fe iii cit sol oh oh fenton oxidation can degrade eps and release bound water so as to enhance dewaterability neyens et al 2004 furthermore better filtration and separation performance could be achieved when pre oxidation treatment was followed by coagulation with inorganic coagulant or organic polymer therefore the combination of pre oxidation process with organic polymers can effectively agglomerate sludge tiny flocs and improve sludge filterability when simultaneously releasing bound water he et al 2016 polyacrylamide pam is commonly used in full scale wastewater treatment plants for sludge dewatering wang et al 2012 however pam and its derivatives are non biodegradable carcinogenic and neurotoxic thus posing serious threats to the environment and human health ho et al 2010 in comparison polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdmdaac is more environmental friendly as it is less toxic and cheaper and has been widely used in wastewater treatment yang et al 2013 herein in this paper a combination of ca assisted air nzvi pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac was investigated via molecular oxygen activation with attempts to avoid the addition of h2o2 and extra ph adjustment its enhancement of sludge dewatering was optimized in terms of combination modes and doses of sludge conditioners the flowchart of this study is shown in fig 1 it is widely accepted that hydrophilic substances in waste activated sludge are mainly consisted of extracellular proteins and proteins are more important than polysaccharides and humic acids in affecting sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 the kinetic variations in the concentration distribution composition and functional groups of extracellular proteins along with sludge physiochemical properties were also characterized 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw sludge and chemicals the raw sludge was thickened sludge derived from a local shahu municipal wastewater treatment plant wuhan china which treated municipal wastewater using an anaerobic anoxic aerobic process at a treatment capability of 100 000 m3 d 1 it was stored at 4 c before use less than one week before tests started the raw sludge samples were diluted with milli q water pgz up shanghai china the characteristics of the diluted raw sludge were listed as follows total solids ts 22

pdmdaac were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent company wuhan china bovine serum albumin bsa was purchased from aladdin chemical reagent company wuhan china ultrapure water from a water purification system pgz up shanghai china was used for solution preparation 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 the pre oxidation process 250 ml sludge was used for sludge conditioning in a 1000 ml glass bottle equipped with porous caps to investigate the pre oxidation process to investigate the effects of initial ca and nzvi concentrations on the pre oxidation process two sets of experiments were conducted 1 the influences of the initial nzvi concentrations on sludge solubilization were studied using six different nzvi concentrations 0 11 22 44 88 and 132 mg g 1ds the other reaction conditions were maintained 17 mg g 1ds of ca reaction time of 1 h room temperature and an original ph of sludge sample ph 6 78 2 to assess the influences of the initial ca concentrations on sludge solubilization experiments were investigated at 44 mg g 1ds of nzvi reaction time of 1 h room temperature and an original ph of sludge sample ph 6 78 six different amounts of ca were added into the glass bottles with the respective ca concentrations of 0 8 5 17 26 34 and 51 mg g 1ds for both two sets of experiments ca was added into the sludge samples followed by the addition of nzvi and the mixture was mixed with compressed air for 1 h jiebao shanghai china conditioned sludge samples were drawn for the determination of concentrations of h2o2 fe ii fe iii ions and soluble protein 2 2 2 the combined pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation process 2 2 2 1 response surface methodology the optimal doses of ca nzvi and pdmdaac were determined using the response surface methodology rsm which has been widely used to optimize chemical doses for sludge dewatering process yu et al 2016 doses of ca x1 nzvi x2 and pdmdaac x3 were chosen as the independent input variables the water content of the vacuum filtered cake wc was chosen as the dependent output variable a central composite design ccd in rsm was used to optimize the doses of ca nzvi and pdmdaac with related ranges and levels of these three factors listed in table 1 wc derived from the uniform description is presented in table 2 verification of the statistical experimental strategies was also conducted 2 2 2 2 sludge dewatering performance to explore the mechanism by the composite conditioner experiments were conducted with the optimized doses from rsm results table 3 tabulates the details of the experimental procedures of individual or combined sludge conditioning the combined ca assisted air nzvi pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac denoted as ca nzvi p were conducted 13 mg g 1ds of ca and 33 mg g 1ds of nzvi were added to 250 ml sludge in a 1000 ml glass bottle equipped with porous caps the mixture was mixed with compressed air for 1 h jiebao shanghai china afterwards 9 mg g 1ds of pdmdaac was sequentially added and stirred at 150 rpm for 10 min with a mixer my3000 6c jiangxi china ca nzvi or pdmdaac was replaced with equivalent volume of milli q water in the control groups table 3 afterwards sludge samples were drawn for the determination of cst wc particle size fe ii fe iii ions zeta potential and eps extraction as well as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses 2 2 3 identification of radicals to identify the main radicals responsible for the ca assisted air nzvi pre oxidation process quenching experiments were firstly conducted with details provided in the supplementary data for the identification of main radicals the sludge samples were centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min to obtain the sludge supernatant to exclude interference of the solid phase of sludge on the determination of radicals 200 ml of sludge supernatant was used 13 mg g 1ds of ca was added to the supernatant followed by 33 mg g 1ds of nzvi the mixture was stirred at 300 rpm in the atmosphere at 8 min mixing the sample was drawn for electron spin resonance esr spectra measurement 2 2 4 sludge dewatering by a laboratory scale diaphragm filter press a laboratory scale diaphragm filter press was used for the deep dewatering of sludge samples the photo of the diaphragm filter press is shown in fig s1 supplementary data and the details of the filter press can be found in yu et al 2016 briefly the diaphragm filter press was equipped with 6 diaphragm plates 250 mm length 250 mm width 10 mm height the dewatering procedure was comprised of a feeding pressing phase 0 8 mpa for 30 min and a diaphragm pressing phase 1 2 mpa for 10 min for the raw sludge rs it was fed into a feeding tank and then treated using the following procedures 150 rpm stir for 5 min 30 min feeding 0 8 mpa 10 min diaphragm squeezing 1 2 mpa for sludge samples treated with pdmdaac the following procedures were conducted rs fed into the tank 150 rpm stir for 5 min

dewatered sludge cakes were determined 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 sludge dewaterability cst and wc were used to evaluate the sludge dewaterability the measurement of cst was conducted with a cst instrument model 304 b triton uk equipped with an 18 mm diameter funnel the whatman no 17 chromatography grade paper was used for cst measurement to measure wc the sludge samples were firstly treated by vacuum filtration method with details described in liu et al 2012 briefly 100 ml sludge sample was poured into a standard buchner funnel and a constant vacuum pressure of 50 kpa was applied for 20 min the water content of the vacuum filtered sludge cake trapped by the filter paper was measured according to the standard method and calculated according to the following equation wc w1 w2 w1 100 where w1 is the weight of the vacuum filtered sludge cake after filtration and w2 is the weight of the vacuum filtered sludge cake dried at 105 c overnight apha 2005 2 3 2 the measurement of radicals the radicals were firstly trapped with dmpo the signal was then measured using an esr spectroscopy jes fa 200 osaka japan at room temperature data were recorded at a microwave power of 0 998 mw a sweep time of 1 min and a center magnetic field of 3226 9 gauss g yuan and dai 2014 triplicates were conducted for each test 2 3 3 eps extraction eps of sludge samples described in section 2 2 2 2 was extracted according to the procedures described in li and yang 2007 and can be stratified into soluble eps sb eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps details of the extraction process were described in the supplementary data 2 3 4 other parameters the measurements of total solids and volatile solids followed the standard methods apha 2005 a protein assay kit thermofisher shanghai china was used for protein measurement based on the lowry s method frølund et al 1995 the concentration of polysaccharide was measured with phenol sulfuric method dubois et al 1956 the concentration of h2o2 was analyzed via titanometry cui et al 2017 the concentrations of fe ii and fe total in the solution were analyzed using 1 10 phenanthroline method at a wavelength of 510 nm by a dr 2000 spectrophotometer shimadzu kyoto japan schnell et al 1998 the concentration of fe iii was calculated as the difference between fe ii and fe total a zetasizer nano zs90 instrument malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk was used to measure the zeta potential of the sludge samples and biomacromolecules the particle size distribution of sludge sample was measured with a particle size analyzer malvern worcestershire uk the ftir analyses of sludge samples were conducted using a nicolet is50 ftir spectrometer thermo massachusetts usa with the scanning wavelengths of 400 4000 cm 1 xps was conducted using a phi quantera sxm phi 5300 esca kyoto japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 the pre oxidation process 3 1 1 effects of initial dose of nzvi the influence of the initial doses of nzvi on the pre oxidation process was investigated with initial dose of nzvi ranging from 0 to 132 mg g 1ds as shown in fig 2 with the initial dose of nzvi increased from 0 to 88 mg g 1ds the concentrations of h2o2 fig 2a iron ions fe ii and fe iii fig 2b and soluble protein fig 2c all increased and the concentration of fe iii was higher than fe ii while sludge filterability deteriorated as indicated by increased cst values fig 2a this may be attributed to the speculation that the reaction between ferrous ions from the corrosion of nzvi eq 1 and in situ generated h2o2 in the ca nzvi system may promote the generation of hydroxyl radicals fu et al 2015 thus resulting in the eps degradation and the release of bound water through disintegrating sludge flocs the increased amounts of small size particles caused by eps degradation and sludge disintegration may bind the porous structure during filtration thus deteriorating sludge dewaterability dogan and sanin 2009 however the excess nzvi till 88 mg g 1ds did not result in further increases in the concentrations of h2o2 iron species fe ii and fe iii and soluble protein this may be due to that the dissolution of nzvi to fe ii has reached its maximum and the further increase in the dose of nzvi did not increase the concentration of fe ii and improve the chelating ability of fe ii and ca 3 1 2 effects of initial ca concentration fig 3 shows the effects of initial ca concentration on the pre oxidation process as evidenced the initial ca concentration significantly affected the generation of h2o2 fig 3a iron dissolution fig 3b and protein solubilization fig 3c thus affecting the cst values of sludge samples fig 3a as the initial ca concentration increased from 0 to 51 mg g 1ds the cst values and the concentrations of iron ions fe ii and fe iii all showed increasing trends and the concentration of fe iii was higher than fe ii although partial ca can be degraded by the produced hydroxyl radicals the increased ca concentration may chelate more fe ii and compensate the degraded ca concentration to some extent thus contributing to the increased pre oxidation ability huang et al 2015 the addition of ca would decrease the initial ph values of sludge samples 6 78 5 34 and this may be related with the dissociation of the hydrogen ions moreover the subsequent addition of nzvi would increase the ph value of sludge samples to 6 19 and this can be related with the consumption of h for the conversion of nzvi to ferrous ions after 1 h of reaction the ph values of sludge samples further increased ph of 7 66 indicating that the ca nzvi system was a proton consuming process in this study the addition of ca played two roles in the ca assisted air nzvi system for the pre oxidation in sludge dewatering firstly as is known due to the involvement of h in the corrosion reactions and the formation of passive layer of iron oxides i e fe oh 2 fe oh 3 feooh and fe3o4 the reactivity of nzvi decreased at higher ph values guan et al 2015 mass transfer resistance in the diffusion boundary layer and iron oxides film of nzvi particles often limits the total reaction rate in the oxidation process in the nzvi air system agrawal and tratnyek 1996 citric acid is an acidifying agent and has been reported to make a ph buffer at ph 3 pka 3 08 seol and javandel 2008 the addition of citric acid may help to enhance the oxidation rate through accelerating the mass transfer by dissolution of the metal and breakdown of the passive oxide layer secondly after adding citric acid the ferrous ions can be chelated by the citric acid eq 5 this could help to prevent iron from precipitation the precipitation of iron oxides was typically observed in the conventional fenton process under neutral conditions in comparison in the ca assisted air nzvi system the fe ii cit complex can be oxidized to fe iii cit complex and iron precipitation can be hindered thus promoting the formation of more hydroxyl radicals eqs 6 8 cui et al 2017 he et al 2016 fe iii could be reduced into fe ii via eqs 9 and 10 as presented in eq 9 some fe iii cit might be reduced into fe ii cit by h2o2 as presented in eq 10 some fe iii cit might be reduced into fe ii cit with electron donor from nzvi corrosion however these two reduction reactions are quite slow therefore the concentration of fe iii in the solution was much higher than that of fe ii as shown in figs 2b and 3b on the basis of the above possible reaction paths a schematic showing the role of ca in the fenton like reaction has been added as fig 4 9 fe iii cit h2o2 fe ii cit h ho2 10 2fe iii cit fe0 2fe ii cit fe2 3 2 the combined pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation process 3 2 1 optimization of composite conditioner the optimal sludge dewatering efficiency in terms of lowest water content of the vacuum filtered sludge cake was acquired using a model as follows 11 y 76 85 3 3x1 15 28x2 0 66x3 0 49x1x2 0 39x1x3 0 10x2x3 0 69 x1 2 3 88x2 2 0 15x3 2 where x1 x2 and x3 are the coded values of the doses of ca mg g 1ds nzvi mg g 1ds and pdmdaac mg g 1ds respectively y is wc wt the model f value of 9 08 implied that the model is significant and the p value prob f of 0 0009 was less than 0 05 indicating that the second order polynomial model was significant a good fitting between the predicted and measured data was observed as indicated by a regression coefficient r2 of 0 89 suggesting that the mathematical model was significant from eq 11 the optimal experimental conditions were nzvi of 33 mg g 1ds ca of 13 mg g 1ds and pdmdaac of 9 mg g 1ds to verify the model additional experiments were conducted in triplicates and the results indicated that the moisture content of the dewatered sludge cake was 78 6 wt which was close to the predicted value by the model 78 3 wt 3 2 2 sludge dewaterability by different composite conditioners based on the results of rsm analysis the composite conditioner of ca nzvi p was added at their optimal doses nzvi of 33 mg g 1ds ca of 13 mg g 1ds and pdmdaac of 9 mg g 1ds the dewaterability of the raw sludge and sludge samples treated with different composite conditioners are shown in fig 5 for the single oxidation process of ca nzvi conditioner the sludge samples showed a poor dewaterability as indicated by the increased cst and wc values yu et al 2016 also reported that the high dose of oxidant i e h2o2 would significantly deteriorate sludge dewaterability and this may be related with the increased amounts of small size particles due to pre oxidation therefore a link to chemical re coagulation is necessary for the ca nzvi conditioner in sludge dewatering with the addition of pdmdaac cst and wc all decreased fig 5a indicating that pdmdaac was effective in reducing sludge filterability and cake moisture content the addition of pdmdaac can coagulate smaller sludge flocs into larger ones thus improving sludge dewaterability huang et al 2015 compared with the raw sludge rs the cst of the sludge conditioned by this composite conditioner of ca nzvi p decreased from 130 0 to 9 5 s and wc decreased from 95 8 to 78 6 wt the calculated bound water content is shown in fig 5b the results indicated that bound water content also decreased from 4 25 g g 1ds of raw sludge to 3 10 g g 1ds of sludge sample treated by the composite conditioner ca nzvi p possibly suggesting that the bound water trapped in eps was released and converted into free water due to the decomposition of eps it is also noted that the dewaterability in terms of wc cst and bound water of sludge samples conditioned by this composite conditioner ca nzvi p was also better than those conditioned by other composite conditioners for all the conditions investigated the differences for respective wc cst and bound water were significant with p values all less than 0 05 3 3 sludge dewatering mechanism 3 3 1 eps properties as protein is the main organic matter affecting sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 the changes of extracellular protein under different treatment conditions were investigated as shown in fig 6 the protein contents of sludge samples treated with the composite conditioner of ca nzvi reached their maximum in sb eps and minimum in tb eps this may be attributed to the oxidation effects more eps in the tightly bound layer may be degraded into small dissolved organic matters and then shifted into the bulk liquid sb eps zhang et al 2014 moreover it is also noted that the protein contents in sb eps in sludge samples conditioned with ca p were higher than those in sludge samples conditioned with p nzvi p and the raw sludge rs this may be related with the dissociation of h after adding ca to sludge samples and the sludge flocs and cells may be disintegrated due to the decreased ph values thus resulting in the increased protein content in the bulk liquid xie et al 2014 ftir was used to investigate the functional groups on the surface of the solid sludge samples so as to correlate with the changes of proteinaceous compounds in the bulk liquid before and after treatments by the composite conditioner fig 7 shows the ftir spectra of samples treated at different conditions based on the assignments of main identification peaks supplementary data table s1 four main peaks were observed in the original sewage sludge bsa and those samples conditioned with the composite conditioner of ca nzvi and the composite conditioner of ca nzvi p the experimental details for the model protein of bsa were shown in the supplementary data for all the samples investigated raw sludge and bsa no significant differences in peaks at bands at 1030 cm 1 and 1455 cm 1 were observed however the peak at a band of 3400 cm 1 assigned to oh stretching became more intense in conditioned samples ca nzvi and ca nzvi p compared with the raw samples this is probably related to the pre oxidation of raw sludge by the composite conditioners particularly the peak at a band of 1645 cm 1 assigned to c o in ketone and amine groups became more intense in conditioned samples ca nzvi and ca nzvi p compared with the raw samples possibly suggesting the degradation of proteinaceous compounds accompanied with more production of functional groups i e amine the n containing compounds in sludge solids can be classified into inorganic n protein n pyridine n pyrrole n quaternary n and nitrile n based on the different binding energies he et al 2015 supplementary data table s2 to further analyze the distribution of n containing compounds in sludge solid samples before and after treatments with the composite conditioner ca nzvi p xps analysis was used to provide more evidences to support the changes of proteinaceous compounds in the bulk liquid the high resolution spectra of c 1s o 1s and n 1s were investigated to obtain the detailed information of the chemical functionalities of sludge solid residues fig 8 a and b as shown in fig 8c and d organic protein n was the predominant n containing compound in the raw solid sludge residues and the results of xiao et al 2017a supported this finding after treating the sludge samples with the composite conditioner of ca nzvi p a significant peak binding energy of 402 ev at the side of high binding energy of n 1s in the sample was observed it implies that inorganic n containing compounds i e nh4 n may appear after the pre oxidation reaction induced by the composite conditioner of ca nzvi p and were possibly generated from the degradation of protein n the degradation of protein n in the sludge solid residue may be related with the increased soluble protein concentration in the bulk liquid as shown in fig 6 3 3 2 sludge physicochemical properties as shown in fig s2 supplementary data for the model protein bsa upon exposure to the composite conditioner of ca nzvi the zeta potential of bsa became more negative indicating that the decomposition of bsa and more negative functional groups may be released upon exposure to this ca nzvi conditioner however after conditioning the oxidized bsa with pdmdaac the zeta potential becomes less negative which suggests the decreasing negative charge density and the related higher degree of damage on electric double layer the repulsive force between particles would be reduced thus leading to agglomeration of flocs and finally enhanced sludge dewaterability li et al 2015 consistent with the results of model bsa the zeta potential of sludge samples treated with the composite conditioner of ca nzvi obviously decreased from 25 8 0 14 mv to 34 65 0 50 mv fig 9 a this may be related with the release of negative charged compounds i e protein as shown in fig 6 however it significantly increased with the addition of pdmdaac to the oxidized sludge sample ca nzvi p li et al 2015 also found that the addition of pdmdaac can result in charge neutralization and less negative zeta potential noted that the zeta potential of sludge samples treated by ca nzvi p was still more negative than those treated by the composite conditioner of ca p p and nzvi p this may because that the added pdmdaac may not completely coagulate the released negatively charged organic compounds due to the prior oxidization process induced by the ca nzvi conditioner the results of particle size distribution further supported this hypothesis as shown in fig 9b the particle size of the sludge conditioned by the ca nzvi conditioner was the smallest among the samples the ca nzvi conditioner possibly degraded the organics from large sizes into small ones via highly reactive hydroxyl radicals even with the coagulation effects of pdmdaac the particle size of the flocs treated with the composite conditioner of ca nzvi p was still smaller than that of the raw sludge rs it is also noted that differences between the zeta potential values of raw sludge and treated sludge by the ca nzvi pdmdaac conditioner were indiscernible and this was possibly due to the prior oxidation effects induced by the ca nzvi oxidation and the low dose of pdmdaac the composite conditioner of ca nzvi p might be not suitable for application with belt filter press or centrifugation however it is proved to be effective for deep dewatering in a plate and frame filter press process similar results have been noted in other deep dewatering processes i e fenton process yu et al 2016 and fe ii activated oxone oxidation process xiao et al 2017b 3 3 3 the generation and roles of radicals the radicals quenching experiments indicated that oh was the main radical in the ca nzvi system supplementary data fig s3 esr was used to further confirm and detect the production of oh during the pre oxidation process induced by the ca nzvi process no significant signals of o2 or ho2 were observed except for the signal of oh four line spectra dmpo oh with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 were observed fig 10 indicating that the generation of oh the oh radicals may be generated through eq 8 3 4 effects of ca assisted air nzvi pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac on sludge dewatering the ca assisted air nzvi pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac can significantly enhance sludge dewaterability proteinaceous organic compounds are considered as intrinsic and important parts of eps and high presence of proteinaceous matters have been consistently reported to deteriorate sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 the decreased protein content in tb eps may be related with the decomposition of eps by the attack of in situ generated oh fig 10 and protein in tb eps was gradually converted into sb eps and lb eps fig 6 for both extracellular proein and model protein of bsa the appearance of functional groups such as oh stretching and co in amine of ftir results may further indicate the degradation of organic protein in the sludge solid phase fig 7 moreover more presence of inorganic n containing compounds was noted in sludge samples treated by the ca nzvi p conditioner as indicated by xps results fig 8 possibly indicating that the degradation of protein n for the ca nzvi p conditioner the pre oxidation induced by ca assisted air nzvi system may cause both the destruction of proteinaceous compounds in the solid phase and degradation of protein in tb eps thus in turn resulting in more release of bound water compared with the raw sludge and sludge sample conditioned with pdmdaac alone fig 5b however the pre oxidation alone can release negatively charged organic compounds fig 9a the subsequent chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac can make the zeta potential of sludge samples by pre oxidation less negative and neutralize the surface charges of the particles the addition of pdmdaac can reduce the repulsive electrostatic interactions and agglomerate the smaller particles by pre oxidation into larger aggregates fig 9 and sludge filterability was more significantly enhanced compared with pre oxidation alone fig 5a further studies on the quantitative identification in the respective impacts of pre oxidation and the subsequent flocculation on sludge dewatering were necessary moreover as shown in table s3 supplementary data the results of water content of the dewatered sludge cakes obtained from a laboratory scale diaphragm filter press experiments further indicated that the combined pre oxidation and chemical re coagulation can significantly enhance sludge dewaterability compared with the raw sludge 73 16 wt versus 85 00 wt although this ca nzvi pdmdaac conditioner only achieved 3 17 higher removal of water content compared with the coagulation effect with pdmdaac alone this enhancement was significant as it mainly contributed to the removal of the bound water in sludge moisture as which was the most difficult part to be removed and the main limiting factor governing sludge dewatering efficiency since it cannot be removed by the traditional flocculants i e pdmdaac he et al 2016 3 5 implication for sludge dewatering generally sludge dewatering is a costly process regarding to the cost analysis of the proposed citric acid assisted fenton like process two comparative cost analyses were investigated one was to compare with the two commonly used ligands in fenton like process edta noradoun and cheng 2005 and sodium tetrapolyphosphate kim et al 2015 the other was to compare with the traditional fenton process yu et al 2016 as shown in table s4 the unit price of citric acid 550 700 usd ton 1 was much lower than those of edta 2000 5000 usd ton 1 and sodium polyphosphate 980 1040 usd ton 1 as shown in table s5 the total cost of the reagents in the ca nzvi pdmdaac treatment process was 51 54 usd ton 1 ds which was a bit lower than that of the traditional fenton process 54 65 usd ton 1 ds the widespread application of the traditional fenton process is still limited due to the necessity of initial acidification ph of 2 5 4 using acids i e sulfuric acid to prevent iron precipitation high cost of hydrogen peroxide and the subsequent neutralization using alkaline additives i e lime and red mud for final filtrate discharge yu et al 2016 the ca nzvi p approach used in this study might be attractive since it exhibited enhanced sludge dewaterability without using h2o2 and extra ph adjustment in the ca nzvi p treatment no extra addition of h2o2 was needed since it can be generated in situ and the final ph of sludge samples treated with ca nzvi p conditioning was close to neutrality therefore extra ph adjustment with lime was also successfully avoided nzvi may be further replaced with commercially available iron powders which could be effective in activating molecular oxygen to enhance sludge dewatering at a lower cost 4 conclusions this study investigated the application of a composite conditioner ca nzvi p for sludge dewatering the conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the composite conditioner of air ca nzvi pdmdaac can avoid the initial acidification and subsequent neutralization for sludge dewatering using a fenton like process it also circumvented the addition of extra h2o2 since it promoted in situ generation of h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals 2 cst was significantly decreased from 130 0 to 9 5 s under the optimal conditions where 13 mg g 1ds of ca 33 mg g 1ds of nzvi and 9 mg g 1 ds of pdmdaac were used after the rsm optimization the results obtained with a laboratory scale diaphragm filter press further indicated the efficacy of the composite conditioner ca nzvi p in enhancing sludge dewaterability 3 a two step mechanism of the air ca nzvi pdmdaac conditioning was proposed firstly in the pre oxidation step the proteinaceous compounds in the solid phase were destructed and protein was degraded in tb eps thus resulting in the release of bound water secondly in the subsequent chemical re coagulation with pdmdaac zeta potential values of sludge samples became less negative the repulsive electrostatic interactions of sludge flocs were reduced and small particles were agglomerated into large particles thus enhancing sludge dewaterability acknowledgments the research was supported by the national

19539,this study characterized the dissolved organic matter dom and byproducts generated after the exposure of activated sludge to ozone and naclo in ceramic mbr it was found that naclo triggered more significant release of dom than ozone proteins with the molecular weight greater than 20 kda and humic acid like substances were the principal components of dom generated by naclo while ozone was found to effectively degrade larger biopolymers to low molecular weight substances the results showed that more than 80 of dom generated by naclo and ozone could pass through the 0 2 μm ceramic membrane furthermore total organic chlorine tocl was determined to be the principal species of halogenated byproducts in both cases while the generation of tocl by naclo was much more significant than that by ozone only a small fraction of tocl was removed by the 0 2 μm ceramic membrane more importantly the toxic bioassays further revealed that the supernatant of sludge suspension and permeate in the mbr with naclo cleaning exhibited higher developmental toxicity to the polychaete embryos than those by ozone the results clearly showed that on line chemical cleaning with ozone should be a more eco friendly and safer approach for sustaining long term membrane permeability in ceramic mbr graphical abstract image 1 keywords ceramic membrane bioreactor on line chemical cleaning ozone sodium hypochlorite dissolved organic matter halogenated byproducts 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbr have been commonly used for advanced wastewater reclamation due to its unique features of superb effluent quality low sludge production smaller footprint etc while on line chemical cleaning is essential for sustaining long term membrane permeability in mbr lee et al 2016 during on line cleaning chemical agents are directly injected into the membrane in the reverse direction to the normal filtration while the membranes are still submerged in sludge suspension wang et al 2014 the chemical agents passed through membranes inevitably contact with sludge suspension in mbr sodium hypochlorite naclo is the most popular oxidizing agent used for on line chemical cleaning of mbr at the frequency of weeks to months wei et al 2011 lee et al 2013 park et al 2015 wang et al 2014 recent studies showed that naclo passed through membranes could trigger the generation of dissolved organic matter dom and halogenated byproducts in mbr navarro et al 2016 cai et al 2016 abdullah and bérubé 2013 wang et al 2018 the presence of such products in mbr poses a serious concern on permeate reuse and recycle in contrast to naclo ozone can destruct a considerable fraction of disinfection by products dbp precursors therefore reduce the dbp formation mao et al 2018 as a strong oxidant ozone has been explored for membrane cleaning park et al 2015 qi et al 2018 mascolo et al 2010 you and tsai 2010 an ozone dosage below 5 mg l 1 had been reported to be effective for mitigation of membrane fouling tang et al 2017 song et al 2018 while ozonation of sludge suspension in mbr can also disrupt cells resulting in bacterial lysis and plasma release he et al 2006 however little information is available for the potential generation of dom and byproducts by ozone during on line chemical cleaning of mbr although the oxidation potential of ozone is chemically higher than that of naclo the generation of dom and dbp during chemical cleaning of mbr largely depends on the structure and response of microbial consortium to cleaning chemicals this study thus investigated the potential generation of dom and halogenated byproducts from activated sludge upon the exposure to ozone and naclo at different dosages ceramic microfiltration membrane which has the robust chemical stability and can withstand the severe oxidizing conditions in the presence of ozone and naclo was used in this study the produced dom were characterized by three dimensional excitation emission matrix spectra

pan and zhang 2013 2 7 comparative developmental toxic bioassay a marine polychaete platynereis dumerilii was employed to investigate the comparative developmental toxicity of above mentioned supernatants and mbr permeate stock cultures of the marine polychaete p dumerilii were performed according to the method developed by dorresteijn 1990 and modified by yang and zhang 2013 prior to the bioassay the sample was first pretreated using freeze drying to remove the water content for concentrating the non volatile components the detailed procedure can be found in supplementary information after 12 h postfertilization embryos were exposed to the pretreated supernatants and mbr permeate the embryos were expected to reach their larval stage after 24 h contact a normal larva is characterized by a girdle of large ciliated cells in the equatorial region four dominant lipid droplets and free swimming behavior the larvae were observed under a stereo microscope with 40 magnification in the absence of one or more of these characteristics an embryo was considered as abnormally developed the normal development percentage was calculated as the ratio of normally developed embryos to total embryos the higher the normal development percentage of a water sample at the same concentration factor the lower the toxicity of the water sample would be preliminary tests were conducted to determine the appropriate concentration factor at which the toxicities of different samples could be assessed a control sample was prepared by exposing the embryos to seawater for all the tests duplicate samples were prepared and analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 generation of dom fig 1 a showed the released dom in supernatants after the respective exposure of activated sludge to ozone and naclo the concentration of doc generated after the contact with ozone in the range of 0 1 mg l 1 remained nearly constant while further increase in the ozone dosage resulted in a significant release of doc e g about 7 55 mg l 1 of doc was found at the ozone dosage of 5 mg l 1 these results clearly suggested that biomass was partially solubilized to dom at the higher ozone dosage however more significant release of dom was observed after the exposure of activated sludge to naclo despite ozone has a higher oxidation potential for instance the doc release at 0 5 mg l 1 of naclo was nearly 1 5 time higher than that produced at a similar ozone dosage these in turn suggested that the generation of dom was not only related to chemical oxidation power but also depended on how microorganisms responded to such cleaning chemicals previous study has demonstrated that intracellular substance could be released from sludge flocs after the contact of activated sludge with naclo wang et al 2014 during ozonation the reactive species of oxygen and hydroxyl radicals were first produced and further oxidized microorganisms however in the case of naclo halogenated byproducts could be eventually generated guo et al 2012 in this study the sludge suspension after the exposure to ozone and naclo were fed into a standard crossflow microfiltration and it was found that more than 80 of dom generated from activated sludge by ozone and naclo could pass through the microfiltration membrane fig 1b this in turn may raise serious concerns about the reuse and recycle of such mbr permeate 3 2 dom composition 3 2 1 eem fluorescence analysis of released dom in this study dom generated after the exposure of activated sludge to ozone and naclo were characterized by three dimensional eem spectra coupled with fri technique five main components i e tyrosine like proteins tryptophan like proteins fluvic acid like materials smp and hal were identified from the eem fluorescence spectra of the dom samples as can be seen in fig 2 the fluorescence intensities of the five components in the supernatants remained nearly unchanged at the ozone dosage of 0 1 mg l 1 however hal was found to increase significantly with the increase in the ozone dosage up to 5 mg l 1 and became dominant with the abundance of more than 50 in dom fig 2d in this study the intensities of tyrosine like and tryptophan like proteins in the supernatants were also found to rapidly decrease accompanied by an increase in hal at high ozone dosage fig 2a and b on the other hand only slight increase in the intensities of fulvic acid like materials and smp was observed at high ozone dosage according to henderson et al 2008 hal in dom probably originated form the decomposition of dead cells and macromolecular organics such as proteins and polysaccharides as a strong oxidant ozone is able to destroy the cell walls of microorganism leading to release of intracellular cytoplasm with increased soluble organic matters with low molecular weights he et al 2006 de melo et al 2016 del vecchio et al 2017 for example ozonation could break up protein like substances liu et al 2011 while parlanti et al 2000 found that the increased hal was related to decreased protein like substances after the exposure of activated sludge to naclo the intensities of these five identified components in supernatants increased with the increase of the naclo dosage and they were obviously higher than those observed in ozonation naclo can damage cell membranes of microorganisms causing cell lysis han et al 2016 qu et al 2012 it can be seen in fig 2a b and 2e that a significant amount of tyrosine like proteins tryptophan like proteins and hal were generated after the contact of activated sludge to naclo for example the respective amounts produced at the naclo dosage of 5 mg l 1 were 7 9 14 1 and 1 56 times higher than those observed at the same ozone dosage of 5 mg l 1 after chlorination the locations of the peaks related to protein like substances were shifted towards the longer wavelength i e red shift fig s2 the red shift in emission peak is generally associated with the increase of carbonyl hydroxyl alkoxyl amino and carboxyl groups in the structures of fluorophores chen et al 2002 liu et al 2011 hal was the dominant in dom among these five components at naclo dosage of 5 mg l 1 the similar trends were also observed in the permeate of the crossflow microfiltration 3 2 2 lc ocd analysis of released dom in general eem can offer fluorescent information of grouped organic substances thus lc ocd ond was employed to further quantify dom according to molecular weights it appears from fig 3 c that ozone mainly induced the production of hal with mw of about 500 da after the exposure of activated sludge to 5 mg l 1 of ozone hal accounted for 32 of the dom in supernatant followed by lmw neutrals 21 and building blocks 10 however the fraction of proteins with the mw larger than 20 kda was only about 4 2 of the dom produced at 5 mg l 1 of ozone these observations on hal and protein were in good agreement with the results obtained by the eem fri analyses fig 2a b and 2e similar to protein the contents of biopolymer with mw greater than 10 kda in supernatant were also found to decrease from 24 to 14 with increasing the ozone dosage from 0 to 5 mg l 1 it has been known that ozone can enhance the transformation of high mw organic compounds to low mw substances qi et al 2018 for example ozone could break down high mw biopolymers to lower mw hydrophilic substances wei et al 2016 in this study hal building blocks and lmw neutrals with the mw of 500 da or lower accounted for about 82 of the hydrophilic organics i e hi doc suggesting that ozone could effectively high mw biopolymers the fractions of hydrophobic organic carbon ho doc in dom generated by naclo and ozone at a comparable dosage were found to be comparable on the contrary more ho doc was generated in mbr permeate with increasing ozone dosage and nearly 90 of produced ho doc at 5 mg l 1 of ozone was found to pass through the ceramic microfiltration membrane after the exposure of activated sludge to 5 mg l 1 naclo biopolymers with the mw greater than 10 kda and hal became dominant in supernatant accounting for 34 and 29 of total dom respectively fig 3b and c in addition the fractions of biopolymers and hal were 330 and 129 higher than those obtained at the ozone dosage of 5 mg l 1 it should be realized that about 73 87 of biopolymers generated by naclo belonged to proteins the accumulation of dom may also exert negative impacts on biomass activity for instance it could inhibit the activities of nitrosomonas and nitrobacter in mbr li et al 2006 3 3 formation of halogenated byproducts and their toxicity 3 3 1 total organic halogenated byproducts increasing attention has been given to halogenated byproducts due to their potential toxicity and adverse effects on the water ecosystem and human health sharma et al 2017 toxas an indicator of the overall dbp formation can be differentiated into three species i e tocl tobr and toi in this study tocl tobr and toi produced after the contact of activated sludge with ozone and naclo were analyzed it was found that tobr and toi in all the supernatants and mbr permeates were not detectable at the naclo and ozone dosages studied as can be seen in table 1 the tocl concentrations in the supernatants and the mbr permeates were both below the detection limit at the ozone dosages of 0 5 mg l 1 however when the ozone dosage was increased to 5 mg l 1 the tocl concentration in the supernatant was increased to 2 2 μg l 1 but it was still below the detection limit in the mbr permeate these suggested that almost all tocl generated by ozone could be effectively retained by the ceramic membrane used on the other hand it was clearly seen in table 1 that the tocl triggered by naclo was significantly higher than that by ozone for example at the respective ozone and naclo dosages of 5 mg l 1 the concentration of tocl induced by naclo was 10 time higher than that by ozone in the supernatant it should be noted that 19 8 μg l 1 of tocl induced by naclo was found in mbr permeate i e only about 12 8 tocl was removed by the ceramic microfiltration membrane in fact naclo can react with natural organic substances e g hal and fulvic acid to form a wide range of unwanted halogenated organic compounds nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 3 3 2 the comparative developmental toxicity of tocl given extremely low tocl concentrations at sub micro gram level the conventional toxicity assays may not be sufficiently sensitive thus an in vivo assay based on the sensitive embryo larval stages of a widely distributed marine polychaete platynereis dumerilii was employed in this study for evaluating the developmental toxicity of the generated supernatants and mbr permeates after activated sludge exposed to ozone and naclo this method indeed has been widely applied for comparatively assessing the developmental toxicity of drinking water and wastewater effluents yang et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 li et al 2017 fig 4 showed the percentages of the embryo normal development in the supernatants and the mbr permeates generated by ozone and naclo at different dosages the higher normal development percentage is the lower toxicity would be it appeared that the developmental toxicities of the supernatants and the mbr permeates generated tended to increase with increasing in the dosages of ozone and naclo this can be explained by the enhanced production tocl at the higher ozone or naclo dosage table 1 on the other hand it was reasonable to observe that the supernatant and mbr permeate upon the exposure to naclo exhibited the higher developmental toxicity than those by ozone at a similar dosage the normal developmental percentages for the supernatants and the mbr permeates upon the exposure of activated sludge to 0 5 mg l 1 of ozone were comparable with that of the control i e the developmental toxicity induced by ozone at the low concentration was insignificant different from ozone the normal development percentage of the supernatant at 0 5 mg l 1 of naclo was significantly lower than that of the control i e the developmental toxicity in this case was not negligible or even significant on the other hand the supernatant and the mbr permeate at 5 mg l 1 of naclo showed the highest developmental toxicity to the embryos indicated by a zero percent normal development moreover at a similar dosage of 5 mg l 1 the developmental toxicity of byproducts generated by naclo was significantly higher than that by ozone the evidence shows that halogenated byproducts even at low levels can accumulate in human and animal organs causing very serious concern on public health more importantly the accumulation of such substances with a strong recalcitrant nature could be extremely persistent throughout receiving organism s life in addition for mixed halogenated byproducts even at levels below their individual no observed effect concentration the combined toxicity should be much significant on the water ecosystem and human health yang and zhang 2013 consequently these developmental toxicity analyses for the first time reveal the potential adverse effects of halogenated byproducts generated during chemical cleaning of mbr and such a toxicity issue associated with chemical cleaning of mbr should be seriously taken into account as long as the reuse and recycle of the permeate are concerned meanwhile this study clearly suggested that membrane cleaning with ozone is a more environmentally friendly approach against the current practice with naclo 4 conclusions this study examined the potential generation of dom and byproducts after the exposure of activated sludge to ozone and naclo during on line chemical cleaning of ceramic mbr it can be concluded that naclo triggered much more significant release of dom and halogenated byproducts biopolymers with the molecular weight greater than 20 kda and hal constituted the major components of dom generated by naclo on the contrary ozone mainly induced the production of hal with the mw less than 500 da tocl was the principal species of halogenated byproducts generated by both ozone and naclo the supernatant and permeate generated after the exposure to naclo exhibited much higher developmental toxicity to the polychaete embryos than those by ozone consequently this study showed that on line chemical cleaning with ozone should be considered as an eco friendly and safer approach for sustaining permeability of ceramic mbr appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia

19539,this study characterized the dissolved organic matter dom and byproducts generated after the exposure of activated sludge to ozone and naclo in ceramic mbr it was found that naclo triggered more significant release of dom than ozone proteins with the molecular weight greater than 20 kda and humic acid like substances were the principal components of dom generated by naclo while ozone was found to effectively degrade larger biopolymers to low molecular weight substances the results showed that more than 80 of dom generated by naclo and ozone could pass through the 0 2 μm ceramic membrane furthermore total organic chlorine tocl was determined to be the principal species of halogenated byproducts in both cases while the generation of tocl by naclo was much more significant than that by ozone only a small fraction of tocl was removed by the 0 2 μm ceramic membrane more importantly the toxic bioassays further revealed that the supernatant of sludge suspension and permeate in the mbr with naclo cleaning exhibited higher developmental toxicity to the polychaete embryos than those by ozone the results clearly showed that on line chemical cleaning with ozone should be a more eco friendly and safer approach for sustaining long term membrane permeability in ceramic mbr graphical abstract image 1 keywords ceramic membrane bioreactor on line chemical cleaning ozone sodium hypochlorite dissolved organic matter halogenated byproducts 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbr have been commonly used for advanced wastewater reclamation due to its unique features of superb effluent quality low sludge production smaller footprint etc while on line chemical cleaning is essential for sustaining long term membrane permeability in mbr lee et al 2016 during on line cleaning chemical agents are directly injected into the membrane in the reverse direction to the normal filtration while the membranes are still submerged in sludge suspension wang et al 2014 the chemical agents passed through membranes inevitably contact with sludge suspension in mbr sodium hypochlorite naclo is the most popular oxidizing agent used for on line chemical cleaning of mbr at the frequency of weeks to months wei et al 2011 lee et al 2013 park et al 2015 wang et al 2014 recent studies showed that naclo passed through membranes could trigger the generation of dissolved organic matter dom and halogenated byproducts in mbr navarro et al 2016 cai et al 2016 abdullah and bérubé 2013 wang et al 2018 the presence of such products in mbr poses a serious concern on permeate reuse and recycle in contrast to naclo ozone can destruct a considerable fraction of disinfection by products dbp precursors therefore reduce the dbp formation mao et al 2018 as a strong oxidant ozone has been explored for membrane cleaning park et al 2015 qi et al 2018 mascolo et al 2010 you and tsai 2010 an ozone dosage below 5 mg l 1 had been reported to be effective for mitigation of membrane fouling tang et al 2017 song et al 2018 while ozonation of sludge suspension in mbr can also disrupt cells resulting in bacterial lysis and plasma release he et al 2006 however little information is available for the potential generation of dom and byproducts by ozone during on line chemical cleaning of mbr although the oxidation potential of ozone is chemically higher than that of naclo the generation of dom and dbp during chemical cleaning of mbr largely depends on the structure and response of microbial consortium to cleaning chemicals this study thus investigated the potential generation of dom and halogenated byproducts from activated sludge upon the exposure to ozone and naclo at different dosages ceramic microfiltration membrane which has the robust chemical stability and can withstand the severe oxidizing conditions in the presence of ozone and naclo was used in this study the produced dom were characterized by three dimensional excitation emission matrix spectra with fluorescence regional integration technique eem fri and size exclusion chromatography coupled with organic carbon and organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond while the halogenated byproducts were

percentages of the embryo normal development in the supernatants and the mbr permeates generated by ozone and naclo at different dosages the higher normal development percentage is the lower toxicity would be it appeared that the developmental toxicities of the supernatants and the mbr permeates generated tended to increase with increasing in the dosages of ozone and naclo this can be explained by the enhanced production tocl at the higher ozone or naclo dosage table 1 on the other hand it was reasonable to observe that the supernatant and mbr permeate upon the exposure to naclo exhibited the higher developmental toxicity than those by ozone at a similar dosage the normal developmental percentages for the supernatants and the mbr permeates upon the exposure of activated sludge to 0 5 mg l 1 of ozone were comparable with that of the control i e the developmental toxicity induced by ozone at the low concentration was insignificant different from ozone the normal development percentage of the supernatant at 0 5 mg l 1 of naclo was significantly lower than that of the control i e the developmental toxicity in this case was not negligible or even significant on the other hand the supernatant and the mbr permeate at 5 mg l 1 of naclo showed the highest developmental toxicity to the embryos indicated by a zero percent normal development moreover at a similar dosage of 5 mg l 1 the developmental toxicity of byproducts generated by naclo was significantly higher than that by ozone the evidence shows that halogenated byproducts even at low levels can accumulate in human and animal organs causing very serious concern on public health more importantly the accumulation of such substances with a strong recalcitrant nature could be extremely persistent throughout receiving organism s life in addition for mixed halogenated byproducts even at levels below their individual no observed effect concentration the combined toxicity should be much significant on the water ecosystem and human health yang and zhang 2013 consequently these developmental toxicity analyses for the first time reveal the potential adverse effects of halogenated byproducts generated during chemical cleaning of mbr and such a toxicity issue associated with chemical cleaning of mbr should be seriously taken into account as long as the reuse and recycle of the permeate are concerned meanwhile this study clearly suggested that membrane cleaning with ozone is a more environmentally friendly approach against the current practice with naclo 4 conclusions this study examined the potential generation of dom and byproducts after the exposure of activated sludge to ozone and naclo during on line chemical cleaning of ceramic mbr it can be concluded that naclo triggered much more significant release of dom and halogenated byproducts biopolymers with the molecular weight greater than 20 kda and hal constituted the major components of dom generated by naclo on the contrary ozone mainly induced the production of hal with the mw less than 500 da tocl was the principal species of halogenated byproducts generated by both ozone and naclo the supernatant and permeate generated after the exposure to naclo exhibited much higher developmental toxicity to the polychaete embryos than those by ozone consequently this study showed that on line chemical cleaning with ozone should be considered as an eco friendly and safer approach for sustaining permeability of ceramic mbr appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia
