friendly dft and matlab data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the key source of drinking water supply worldwide 1 the occurrence of several types of contamination in groundwater has manifested in multiple diseases which is a global health concern one such naturally occurring ground water toxicant is fluoride affecting millions of populations across the globe including india 2 consumption of fluoride beyond its permissible limit who limit 1 5 mg l 1 through drinking water causes serious health issues such as irreversible demineralization of bone stiffness rheumatism to permanent crippling or skeletal fluorosis and tooth tissues and long term damage to the different key organs 3 as we know prevention is always better than cure the treatment of potable water prior to its consumption is an important health related geo environmental issue therefore search for cost effective and appropriate technology for defluoridation remains very critical in past various techniques have been explored to treat fluoride contaminated water such as coagulation separation precipitation adsorption ion exchange electrolysis electro dialysis electrochemical methods and membrane based separation process 4 among them adsorption is found to be the most significant and widely explored technique owing to its numerous benefits such as its flexibility and effortlessness of design relative ease of operation cost efficient high efficiency ease of operation and scalability etc therefore researchers have explored varieties of metal based materials such as metal oxide hydroxide and metal immobilized matrix for fluoride remediation i e ferric sludge 5 aluminium hydroxide 6 iron and iron oxide 7 mixed binary oxide fe mn etc 8 due to the strong affinity of metal ions towards fluoride though these metal based adsorbents have offered efficient fluoride removal capabilities however some drawbacks were observed with them i e agglomeration localization of metal during doping which reduces the surface area of adsorbent due to pore blockage which in turn affects removal efficiency leaching out of doped metal ions at varying ph conditions the most commonly used activated alumina aa for water remediation also suffers demerits due to the leaching of aluminium during use which has not been recommended for drinking purposes due to the cause of alzheimer 9 considering the drawbacks associated with these metal based adsorbents a new class of metallopolymers is fabricated to deliver high removal efficiency and long term sustainability for real water applications with a non leachable metal ion to avoid secondary pollution and sludge generation as well metallopolymers mps are a class of hybrid materials comprising metallic and polymeric moiety in their backbone that have been used in numerous fields 10 11 the mps are synthesized by polymerizing metal containing monomers mcms which are the effective precursors of polymeric metal complexes wherein the metal ion is anchored in each monomeric unit in a given spatial architecture 12 the mcms have been used in many fields such as the synthesis of optically active compounds hydrogenation and hydroformylation owing to their versatile properties 12 among different metals zirconium has been gaining meticulous attention in the adsorption process due to its versatile characteristics such as its strong affinity towards electronegative ligands non toxicity environmental friendliness and wide distribution in nature 13 the zirconium ions in the hydrated form can generate tetra nuclear and octa nuclear ionic species which are supposed to participate in ligand substitution reactions with the pollutants 14 thus considering the unique properties of zirconium and its extensive utilization as an adsorbent in various forms it has been chosen as one of the elements to fabricate a novel metallo polymeric mps microspheres for fluoride remediation 1 vinylimidazole 1 vim as an essential functional monomer has fascinated significant interest since it provides required properties for example metal chelation ion exchange biocompatibility antimicrobial anti corrosion coatings and protein adsorption etc 15 hence this has been chosen as one of the co monomer therefore in the current study an attempt has been made to synthesize zirconium based functional metallo polymeric microsphere q pzrvim comprising zirconium and 1 vinylimidazole 1 vim moiety in three dimensional shape with porous texture the performance evaluation study of q pzrvim has been preliminarily tested with simulated water at laboratory scale and after that explored with a fluoride containing groundwater sample owing to the unique properties such as high adsorption capacity non toxicity reusability low cost with tuneable architectures the q pzrvim could emerge as a promising water remediation candidate 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and methods the materials used in this study

given in the si s3 2 4 batch adsorption test in batch adsorption a stock solution of fluoride 1000 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving naf in deionized water and the desired concentrations were prepared by diluting it with di water next different amounts of the q pzrvim adsorbent 0 050 to 0 300 g l 1 were added into the beaker and the mixture was kept on constant stirring 150 rpm for a predetermined contact time 10 to 120 min by varying the contact time feed fluoride concentration and dosage of q pzrvim the adsorption of fluoride on q pzrvim was estimated for extreme uptake of fluoride from water by determining the optimum conditions at ambient temperature 30 2 0 c adsorption experiments were performed the fluoride containing q pzrvim was removed for each sample by collecting 10 ml of sample solution and filtering it with a syringe filter 0 22 μm nylon the filtered supernatant was then analyzed with the ion selective electrode to estimate the concentration of fluoride present in it whereas traces of leached zirconium content were followed via ion chromatography finally eq 1 was used for calculating the removal efficiency of fluoride while eq 2 was utilized to determine the equilibrium adsorption capacity 1 removal efficiency co ce x 100 ce 2 adsorption capacity q e co ce mg l 1 x v l m g where co and ce are the feed and equilibrium concentration of fluoride mg l 1 respectively v is the total volume of f solution l and m is the mass of q pzrvim g 2 5 kinetic and isotherm studies the studies of the influence of contact time and initial fluoride concentration provided valuable insights which were utilized to understand the adsorption behaviour of q pzrvim by studying both pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetics models and both langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms by applying pfo and pso models in eqs 3 and 4 orderly the rate of sorption of f was studied and the related kinetics parameter was determined 3 d q t dt k 1 q e q t 4 d q t dt k 2 q e q t 2 where qe is the adsorbed amount of fluoride per unit weight of q pzrvim at equilibrium mg g 1 qt being the adsorbed amount of fluoride per unit weight of q pzrvim mg g 1 at time t min and k1 and k2 being the 1st and 2nd order rate constant for the sorption min 1 correspondingly in the kinetics experiment 0 250 g l 1 of q pzrvim was added into 10 mg l 1 of fluoride solution and 5 0 ml aliquot was collected at different time intervals 10 to 120 min for fluoride analysis 2 6 adsorption isotherm study to understand the association between the adsorbed amount of fluoride on the surface of q pzrvim and its equilibrium concentration within the solution phase at constant temperature and pressure the adsorption isotherms were studied by using langmuir and freundlich isotherm which gives information about monolayer and multilayer 17 18 the initial concentrations of fluoride in between the range 10 to 30 mg l 1 were used to evaluate the isotherms and further the experimental results were plotted using the linear form of langmuir and freundlich isotherm models as described in eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 c e qe 1 b q m 1 q m c e 6 log qe log k f 1 n

capacity mg g 1 kl is the langmuir constant which is related to energy l mg 1 rl is separation factor rl the values of rl satisfies langmuir isotherm condition if it follows the order of 0 rl 1 kf is constants without dimensions which show the relative adsorption capacity and intensity of adsorption respectively 2 7 effect of dose initial fluoride concentrations and agitation time the dosage of an adsorbent and feed concentration is significant parameters to examine the adsorption behaviour of an adsorbent under specific operating conditions dose optimization is a valuable parameter from the economical point of view which offers the notion of maximum adsorption with the minimum quantity of adsorbent usually the rate of adsorption increases with the increase in the quantity of adsorbent due to the availability of active sites therefore the performance of the adsorbent was studied under varying amounts of adsorbent 0 050 g to 0 250 g and feed concentration 10 0 to 30 0 mg l 1 while keeping other parameters fixed the other experimental conditions remained constant in both experiments i e ph 7 0 0 2 contact time 2 h temp 30 2 0 c rpm 150 the time dependent study is an essential factor to assess the performance of the adsorbent the minimum time for adsorbents to attain adsorption equilibrium was determined a batch experiment was carried out to examine the effect of contact time from 10 to 120 min on the fluoride removal efficiency while keeping other parameters fixed ph 7 0 0 2 dose 0 250g l 1 and f 10 mg l 1 2 8 effect of ph on adsorption and point of zero charge phpzc the effect of ph on adsorption efficacy was studied by varying the ph of the solution ranging from 2 0 2 12 0 2 at fixed experimental conditions such as dose 0 250 g l 1 rpm 150 contact time of 2 h temp 30 2 0 c and f 10 mg l 1 phpzc is linked to the surface charge and ph of the material so it affects some properties of suspension materials i e their stability interaction with electrolytes and ion exchange capacity the phpzc of the q pzrvim adsorbent was determined by the drift method 2 9 effect of co existing anions the effect of co ions on the remediation of fluoride ions was investigated with 100 mg l 1 concentration of competitive ions chloride cl nitrate no3 sulphate so4 2 and phosphate po4 3 and bicarbonate hco3 2 under fixed parameters i e f 10 mg l 1 contact time 2 h dose 0 250 g l 1 rpm 150 temp 30 c 2 c the initial ph values of the solutions in presence of different co existing ions were measured as 7 06 0 1 7 01 0 1 7 31 0 2 7 0 0 2 and 8 20 0 2 in the existence of cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 and hco3 2 ions respectively 2 10 desorption and regeneration experiments any methodology which can bring down the operational cost with minimum maintenance would be more attractive and economical therefore the sorption desorption study was carried out after investigating different eluting reagent to desorb fluoride at fixed experimental condition the eluting reagent having maximum desorption efficiency for the specific ions have been chosen for the study 2 11 physicochemical characterization ion exchange capacity iec was evaluated by the titration process by adopting the volhard method 19 the exchange of anions is calculated by the following equation 8 iec meq g 1 blank sample normality of kcns volume of naoh w dry water uptake of the adsorbent is calculated by immersing a specific quantity of adsorbent 0 5 g in distilled water di water for 24 h by the following equation given below 9 w w wet w dry w dry 100 where wwet and wdry are the wet and dry weight of the adsorbent respectively 2 12 computational study the interactions of fluoride with qpzrvim are studied by using the density functional theory dft study all structures are optimized using dft with a hybrid exchange correlation functional theory model b3lyp using a 3 21g basis set all calculations are performed with the gaussian 09 w package 20 the binding energies of the f and i ions with the polymer are computed by using the subsequent relation 21 10 e e complex e polymer e ion whereas δe binding energy e complex total energy of the polymer ion complex e polymer total energy of the polymer e ion total energy of the ion 2 13 adsorption modelling for fixed bed column table 6 represents the characteristics of the q pzrvim particle and bed the particle and porosity were determined by the reported methods 22 continuous fixed bed adsorption was conducted using a perspex column internal diameter 7 cm filled with q pzrvim diameter 0 2 mm adsorbent with a depth of 25 cm a booster pump was used to control the constant flow rate of the inlet fluoride solution 83 ml min 1 in continuous up flow mode to adjust the feed flow rate a bypass line was added the experiments were conducted with groundwater samples collected from thordi district bhavnagar district gujarat having fluoride concentration of 5 0 mg l 1 23 the treated water samples were collected periodically through the output pipe in a container to measure the residual fluoride concentration as a function of time after the experiment the treated water sample was examined 2 13 a pore diffusion model in order to examine the adsorption of fluoride onto q pzrvim the fixed bed break through curves was predicted using the film pore diffusion model the convection diffusion model describes the one dimensional solute transport model in the fixed bed the pore diffusion model is developed based on the basic assumptions listed below 24 25 the flow is uniform throughout the cross sectional region and one dimensional in the axial direction the bed is completely saturated along the column the liquid phase velocity remains constant the column internal bulk fluid fluoride balance is stated as 11 c

differential equations eqs 11 and 14 utilizing the optimization procedure of the interior point algorithm in accordance with the trust region approach the unknown parameters d p d l and k f were identified by minimizing the sum of squared errors between experimental and predicted concentration data the sum of square error was described as 15 s i 1 n exp j 1 k c cal i j c exp i j c exp i j 2 where i is a number of experiments and j is a number of time points in the i th experiment 3 results and discussion the metallo polymeric microsphere of poly zirconyl dimethacrylate co 1 vinyl imidazole network in 3d shape with porous textures was synthesized via suspension polymerization method as reported in section 2 2 by using zrdma 1 vim and egdma the monomer 1 vim and zrdma were varied to prepare the microsphere followed by functionalization with methyl iodide to achieve functionality for high fluoride removal efficiency a batch experiment was carried out to evaluate the performance of both microspheres under similar experimental conditions the detail of the experimental condition and performance study is written in si fig s1 the characteristic features of both microspheres are shown in table 1 the table showed high iec values of 4 1 and 3 4 meq g 1 with q pvim and q zrvim respectively however faster and better defluoridation efficiency was observed with q pzrvim sa 453 m2 g 1 pv 0 51 cm3 g 1 compared to the q pvim sa 38 m2 g 1 pv 0 12 cm3 g 1 which can be ascribed to high surface area and porosity of q pzrvim compared to q pvim fig s1 the surface area and porosity are essential parameters to facilitate the faster and better sorption of ions by the adsorbent therefore q pzrvim has been chosen for further defluoridation study 3 1 characterization of q pzrvim the morphological properties of any polymeric network play an imperative role in adsorption behaviour indeed the large surface area and porous texture of any adsorbent s moiety facilitate the adsorption phenomena the presence of electropositive zirconium ions along with the n ch3i anion functionality in 3d shaped porous q pzrvim network plays a strategic role to facilitate the adsorption of fluoride ions through pores inside the polymer matrix 26 thus the presence of dual functionalities in q pzrvim matrix enables the better adsorption of fluoride ions the presence of well developed porous structures can be visualized by the sem spectra of q pzrvim pre and post adsorbed specimens fig 3 a the q pzrvim exhibits an average pore size is 1 35 μm fig 3a i iv the edx spectrum fig 3a v and electron mapping fig 3a viii and ix of the q pzrvim expressed the existence of fluoride after adsorption concomitantly the of iodine ions reduced from 6 74 to 3 77 wt after fluoride adsorption which indicates the involvement of exchange of anion f from the surrounding medium with i through the quaternary ammonium n ch3i site the uniform distribution of zirconium no pore blockage and no morphological change in sem images of pre and post adsorbed q pzrvim is the attractive feature of the prepared microsphere the diffraction spectra of xrd reveal the presence of zirconium in q pzrvim by the presence of three broad peaks 2θ at 30 85 42 55 and 56 83 jcpds cards no 37 1484 and 17 0923 applying the debye scherrer equation d 0 9λβ cos θ where λ is the wavelength of x ray irradiated β is the full width of line at half the maximum intensity fwhm the average crystalline particle size was estimated as 20 37 43 96 nm and no significant changes were observed in xrd pattern after fluoride adsorption fig s7a the icp ms results showed 31 02 of zirconium in the matrix while nitrogen was found as 4 42 by chns analysis along with other elements c 28 11 h 4 05 and s 0 thus the total inorganic contents zr 31 02 n 4 42 in q pzrvim is almost equivalent to the residual mass 36 01 obtained in tga thermo gram at 800 c fig s7b the structural features of q pzrvim were examined by ftir and in 1h nmr spectra without crosslinker the ftir of the q pzrvim pre and post fluoride adsorption showed the vibrational frequency changes in the function group of the adsorbent the adsorption peak around 3440 cm 1 indicates the existence of hydroxyl groups whereas the bands at 2870 2920 cm 1 are assigned to ch bonds symmetric and asymmetric owing to the methyl carbons ch3 ch2 ch which have been reduced after adsorption of fluoride the peak at 1643 and 1170 is representing co and co functional groups 27 fig 3b the presence of a peak at 806 and 676 cm 1 can be attributed to the bending vibration of the zroh group 28 the intensity of these peaks is reduced after the adsorption of fluoride which is showing the interaction of fluoride with a hydroxyl group i e zroh 29 31 this observation is also compared with the earlier studies 32 35 however interaction with fluoride with zr via the formation of the zrf bond and is still unclear the presence of peaks at around 375 475 cm 1 and 240 350 cm 1 due to zrf and fzrf bond respectively are generally visible in the mid range infrared spectrometer which was beyond the detecting range of ftir spectroscopy hence it could not be seen in the present study 30 in 1h nmr spectra fig 3c the peak belonging to two protons of ch2 group on the main chain has been shifted to around 5 49 and 5 65 δ ppm and the peaks due to one proton of ch group has been shifted to around 6 10 and 6 01 δ ppm the new peak at around 4 1 δ ppm is due to the ch3 group attached to the n atom the peaks between 7 5 8 3 and 9 6 δ ppm appeared due to the aromatic ch group of the imidazole ring which was divided into three peaks because of the electron withdrawing structure of the ammonium group 36 the adsorption phenomena of q pzrvim have also examined uv vis absorption spectra fig s7c wherein no absorption bands of iodide could be observed before adsorption while an intense absorption peak at around 230 nm λ appeared after adsorption of fluoride which indicates the presence of iodide ions in water 37 which can also be correlated with elemental composition of sem edx analysis fig 3 a iv where in iodide ion was present with after adsorption thus the presence of trace amount of iodide ions in the treated from revealed the occurrence of ion exchange phenomena during adsorption with the fluoride ions of the surrounding medium the chemical compositions and adsorptive phenomena of q pzrvim pre and post adsorption of fluoride are studied by xps analysis the wide scan xps image of q pzrvim in fig 3d shows the existence of elements c o i n and zr in the q pzrvim before and along with fluoride f after adsorption a new peak at 685 ev in wide scan xps image of q pzrvim after adsorption indicates the presence of fluoride 38 which has been confirmed by the elaborated f 1s spectrum fig 3e the two peaks sited at 689 45 and 684 30 ev in f 1s photoelectron correlate to inorganic fluoride attributed to metal mfn and organic fluoride bonded to metal rmf m zr respectively the higher binding energy of peak at 689 45 ev compared to 684 30 ev is due to naf suggesting the possible adsorption of fluoride via chemisorption 39 to determine the chemical environment of iodide high resolution xps spectra of the i 3d peaks were examined the i 3d spectra fig 3f showed the presence of two major peaks sited at 618 15 ev and 629 67 ev due to i 3d spin orbit doublet i 3d5 2 and i 3d3 2 respectively before fluoride adsorption which has been disappeared after adsorption of fluoride a similar spectral pattern is observed in full scan spectra of q pzrvim wherein the peak due to iodide ions present in the pre adsorbed form of q pzrvim disappeared after adsorption further the o1 s spectra of q pzrvim fig 3g h deconvolution of o 1s spectra produces two main peaks around 531 5 ev 533 ev the peak around 531 5 ev is assigned to co or zroh 40 the peak around 533 ev is attributed to cho bonding peaks at 531 51 ev due to the zroh before adsorption which after adsorption of fluoride has been shifted towards higher binding energy 531 89 ev this is suggesting the possible interaction of fluoride with zirconium through zrohf therefore it can be observed that both zr bonded hydroxyl group zroh and quaternary ammonium group n ch3i are expected to facilitate the adsorption of fluoride via chemisorption phenomena dft is a computational technique widely used to understand the interactions between molecules at the electronic level 3 therefore the interaction of fluoride ion with q pzrvim was studied through dft the binding energies is calculated from the total energies of ions adsorbent before and after interaction with fluoride using the equation mentioned in the computational method section 20 there is two active site in q pzrvim first one is zroh and second one is imidazolium functional group which play significant role for the adsorption of fluoride the optimized structure of pzrvim shows an s like conformation around the zirconium atom leading to a cage like structure fig 2 which has shown structural changes after the quaternization reaction fig 4 a b after interaction with f ion prominent changes were observed around the zirconium site of q pzrvim due to strong interaction with f ion through electrostatic attraction the effect is reflected in the increase in bond length between zr o from 2 20 å to 2 33 å and zr o from 2 09 å to 2 41 å the addition of f ions near the zirconium atom causes some reorientations in the q pzrvim f complex structure which is revealed in terms of binding energy be the be of the q pzrvim f is calculated as 439 26 kcal mol 1 on the other hand at the imidazolium ring no stable ionic interactions between the positively charged n atom of the imidazolium ring and the counter i ion were observed instead a consistent increase in the distance was observed fig 4b as a result it was revealed that counter i ions were replaced by f ion from the surrounding medium fig 4c however no significant change in bond length and angle or dihedral angle of the imidazolium ring part occurred as a result it was observed that f ions have the ability to replace i ions from q pzrvim near the imidazolium site fig 4c at the same time no significant structural changes were observed in q pzrvim near the zirconium atom therefore the dft study revealed involvement of dual active sites for the adsorption of fluoride fig 4c further the binding energy of q pzrvim after adsorption of fluoride at both active sites was calculated as 533 392 kcal mol 1 thus the difference in binding energies 94 kcal mol between two active sites of q pzrvim 2f e 533 39 kcal mol 1 fig 4c revealed that q pzrvim 2f complex is more stable than q pzrvim f e 439 26 kcal mol 1 3 2 kinetics of adsorption the adsorption of fluoride by q pzrvim was examined as a function of contact time to establish the adsorption kinetics and the adsorption equilibrium time to determine the related adsorption kinetics parameter the commonly used pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso adsorption kinetic models were applied the pfo model predicts that adsorption occurs through the boundary while pso represents the chemisorption adsorption process 18 fig 5 showed that the pso model r2 0 997 is fitted well compared to the pfo model r2 0 994 due to its higher correlation coefficient furthermore the calculated q e cal of pso model q e cal 44 66 mg g 1 is close to the experimental adsorption capacity q e expt 39 16 mg g 1 compared to the pfo model q e cal 32 23 mg g 1 table 2 the higher and closed values of adsorption capacities q e cal 44 66 mg g 1 and q e expt 39 16 mg g 1 for pso adsorption kinetics model suggested that the rate limiting step might occur through chemisorption via formation of covalent bonds either through sharing or exchange of electrons between anion and q pzrvim adsorbent 3 3 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm studies provide information about the equilibrium of the adsorption process in the liquid solids system the experimental data for adsorption isotherms of fluoride were discussed in the previous section 2 6 the results indicated a direct relationship between the adsorbent capacity and fluoride concentration the connection between sorbate and sorbent using q pzrvim the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are studied fig 6a and b 3 3 1 langmuir and freundlich model the results obtained after applying langmuir and freundlich model are represented in table 3 and fig 6 wherein the linear correlation coefficient r2 of the langmuir isotherm model r2 0 997 is much closer to unity in comparison to the freundlich isotherm model r2 0 976 the proximity of r2 value to 1 by applying the langmuir model suggests the adsorption of fluoride onto q pzrvim through homogeneous monolayer formation 17 41 hence q pzrvim could be attributed to having well dispersed homogeneous surface active sites adsorption which might assume to occur through the formation of covalent bonds chemisorption 42 nonetheless the calculated qmax theo obtained was 130 5 mg g 1 the highest in comparison to other adsorbents reported in the literature table 4 3 4 effect of ph the effect of the adsorbent s dose feed concentration and effect of agitation time were optimized the detailed investigation is written in si the ph of a solution is one of the predominant factors which affect the process of adsorption as it influences the degree of ionization and the surface charge of the particles thus fluoride uptake capacity onto the q pzrvim was studied by varying initial ph levels viz 2 0 0 2 to 12 0 0 2 under optimum parameters f 10 mg l 1 contact time 2 h temp 30 2 0 c rpm 150 dose 0 250 g l 1 the ph of the working solution was controlled by adding hcl naoh solutions the effects acquired have been plotted as percentage elimination of the fluoride ion with ph fig 7a the figure revealed 100 removal efficiency in the ph range of 2 0 0 2 to 6 0 0 2 with the adsorption capacity of 40 mg g 1 the higher adsorption of fluoride ion in acidic medium occurred due to the increase in the coulombic force of attraction between positively charged h ions and negatively charged f ions 2 it is observed that most of the reported materials work better under acidic conditions which is not appropriate for the potable purpose 43 thus for potable purposes it is essential to find adsorbents having better efficiency at the neutral ph range in the present study at ph 7 0 0 2 and 8 0 0 2 removal is slightly reduced to 97 9 and 97 8 respectively which decreased on further moving towards basic ph medium at ph 10 0 0 2 and 12 0 0 2 the percent removal is found to reduce to 90 and 80 respectively this is because at basic ph oh and f ions compete with each other both ions are isoelectronic but oh is more active than f and hence oh adsorbs preferably on the positively charged q pzrvim surface fig 8 thereby reducing the fluoride removal efficiency and also there will be electrostatic repulsion between both negatively charged ions this contributes to the decrease in removal efficiency thus the result revealed that q pzrvim could efficiently be brought down the fluoride level up to the who permissible limit in the ph range of 2 0 0 2 to 8 0 0 2 with an almost negligible amount of leached zirconium ions found in treated water fig 7c which curtails the pots adjustment of ph to make it potable when the adsorption capacity is examined it was observed that the capacity decreased with an increase in the ph the adsorption capacity is 40 mg g 1 for ph range of 2 0 0 2 to 6 0 0 2 from ph value 7 0 0 2 to 8 0 0 2 capacity remains almost constant with values 39 16 mg g 1 and 39 12 mg g 1 respectively after ph 8 0 0 2 the capacity is found to be gradually decreasing with values 36 and 32 8 mg g 1 for ph 10 0 0 2 and 12 0 0 2 respectively this trend in the variation of adsorption capacity with increase in ph can also be attributed to the above stated reasons moreover the point of zero charges phpzc of the q pzrvim examined by drift method was found as 7 79 fig 7b which indicates positively charged surface at ph 7 79 and negative above 7 79 44 the above value reveals that the prepared polymeric network is negatively charged 45 which revealed its practical utility for real water treatment generally the potable water from ground water or municipal sources are having ph in the range of 7 0 to 8 0 ph and the prepared adsorbent has shown its high removal efficacy up to ph 8 0 0 2 owe to its surface charge phpzc 7 79 ph range the table 4 represents the comparative performance of reported adsorbents for the removal of fluoride from water which revealed that reported adsorbents has shown high removal efficiency at lower ph range which requires ph adjustment of treated water prior to its consumption however in present work q pzrvim works well at neutral ph range the performance of the q pzrvim was evaluated with the real ground water samples column study which revealed its practical utility for real water treatment moreover the treated water samples were analyzed by ic and icp ms analysis to examine the presence of iodide and zirconium the presence of iodide i in treated water samples suggested that the quaternary amine termini n ch3i facilitate the exchange of counter iodide ion i with fluoride ions f from the surrounding medium while the negligible amount of zirconium present indicates that q pzrvim is ph stable across a wide range thus owing to the unique characteristic of q pzrvim i e phpzc 7 79 the presence and absence of iodide and zirconium respectively represents its high practical efficacy as it can work well at ph of groundwater which lies between ph 6 0 0 2 8 0 0 2 hence its can deliver potable water for direct consumption 3 5 comparative study of adsorbents table 4 represents a list of various adsorbents used for fluoride adsorption which revealed that few adsorbents have shown significant high adsorption capacity in acidic medium hence need post adjustment before the consumption of water which in turn requires an additional step and a skilled person for assurance further while using metal doped immobilized adsorbents leaching of doped metal ions occurs during adsorption which causes secondary pollution and after each cycle of operation reloading of metal ions is needed while utilising q pzrvim no post ph adjustment is necessary to make treated water potable the other experimental analysis ph regeneration revealed the long term durability and reusable of q pzrvim which is advantageous for the field water application 3 6 effect of co existing ions the presence of several co ions in ground water along with fluoride may interfere its adsorption fig s4 shows that chloride cl and nitrate no3 ions exhibited lesser influence on fluoride adsorption due to the formation of weak bonds with the active sites at the outer sphere complex whereas the sulphate ions form both outer sphere and inner sphere surface complexes 53 thus both cl and no3 ions have less while sulphate ions have a substantial interfering effect on the removal of fluoride it is generally observed that phosphate po4 3 ion having a high negative charge compared to other anions needs three close surface groups and it gets adsorbed as inner sphere surface complex on adsorbents this inner spherically adsorbing phosphate can significantly interfere with the fluoride ion which subsequently decreases the percentage of fluoride removal efficiency further bicarbonate hco3 2 being a conjugate base of a weak acid produces hydroxyl ions which acts as primary competing ions against fluoride the produced hydroxyl ions compete against fluoride ions which interns reduce the fluoride uptake efficacy fig s4 53 54 thus results revealed that fluoride adsorption capacity on q pzrvim is influenced by the presence of competing ions which was found in the decreasing order of 96 6 96 5 92 21 41 7 and 26 6 in the presence of cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 and hco3 2 respectively 3 7 desorption and regeneration to find the suitable eluting agent a preliminary desorption study was carried out with different reagents such as hno3 nacl naoh and na2co3 0 1 m each after desorption the recovery of fluoride ions was found as 3 0 48 89 and 98 5 in hno3 nacl naoh and na2co3 reagents respectively fig s5a based on the maximum desorption efficiency with na2co3 solution this was chosen as the eluting agent for the regeneration study followed by treatment with nai 0 1 m and washing with di to get neutral ph the regeneration and recyclability of q pzrvim adsorbent were performed for five consecutive times wherein the decent fluoride removal efficiency was observed with the minor change des1st 97 9 to 86 5 des5st cycle which might be due to experimental error and or some trapped ions fig s5b the high reusability with any material loss suggests the suitability of q pzrvim for field water applications 3 8 thermodynamics study fig s6 revealed as the temperature increased from 293 to 313 k the adsorption of fluoride ions also increased which could be due to the increase in the mobility of the fluoride ions as a result of acquired energy in the system the experimental condition for thermodynamics study was kept constant such as dose 0 250 g l 1 rpm 150 contact time of 2 h and f 10 mg l 1 and ph 7 0 0 2 the calculated values of δh and δs are presented in table s1 the positive values of δh 34 46 and δs 0 144 indicate that adsorption was endothermic and have a strong affinity for the fluoride whereas the negative values of δg 0 799 to 10 88 are suggesting a spontaneous and favourable chemi sorption process 55 other information is available in si 3 9 colum study the column experiment was performed with the field water sample having fluoride in the range of 5 0 mg l 1 along with other ions the collected water was passed through the domestic housing filter dimension length 25 cm internal diameter 7 0 cm filled with the q pzrvim 1 0 kg with the fixed flow rate of 83 ml min 1 till breakthrough at neutral ph for more studies such as the effect of feed concentration on performance have also been studied for this additional quantity of spike solution of fluoride was added to the same fluoride containing groundwater 5 0 mg l 1 to make it fluoride solution of 7 0 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 all these three water samples having varying amount of fluoride 5 0 mg l 1 7 0 mg l 1 and 10 0 mg l 1 while retaining same quantity of other ions were used for the column study fig 9 represents the experimental data along with predicted results using the pore diffusion model the optimization variables in the model i e axial dispersion coefficient d l pore diffusivity d p and mass transfer coefficient k f are tabulated in table 5 feed concentration was varied from 5 mg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 for a constant flow rate 83 ml min 1 it is observed that breakthrough curves shift towards the left as the feed concentration of fluoride increases thus the breakthrough time of the q pzrvim with the breakthrough of 4000 l fluoride free water who permissible limit 1 5 mg l 1 with 5 0 mg l 1 feed concentration was calculated as 926 h for 25 cm bed depth column the breakthrough time was found to deceases to 610 and 413 h for 7 0 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 fluoride feed concentration respectively with same bed depth column the pre and post treated water samples f 5 0 mg l 1 were analyzed the treated water sample has shown the presence of iodide ions in the range of 12 16 μg l 1 as an additional ion table 7 the estimated dietary iodine requirement for adults ranges from 80 to 150 μg day 1 as per the who permissible limit 56 the presence of a trace quantity of iodide ions in treated water would be useful as being disinfectant as well as an essential dietary mineral to avoid metabolic disorders thus treated water can be recommended for direct consumption 3 10 cost estimation the expenses incurred for the preparative process of any adsorbent via multiple steps surface morphology and reusability play a crucial role to consider the cost effective water treatment process the literature is abundant on verities of adsorbent materials but less concerned about the cost the cost calculation of an adsorbent is also influenced by different factors such as the obtainability of precursor processing requirements and treatment environments for water remediation the cost of the developed adsorbent is calculated as rs 800 900 1 0 kg prepared at the scale of 500 g batch which is relatively lower than the commercially available activated charcoal costs around 15 56 usd 1000 inr 56 57 the cost of treated water samples for an average of three cycles of operation was found as 10 12 paisa l including the cost of adsorbent and filter accessories which represent a cost effective process moreover the treatment cost could further be reduced at pilot scale production therefore the q pzrvim may well serve as a proficient and economical adsorbent for defluoridation 3 11 plausible adsorption mechanism the adsorptive phenomena of q pzrvim for the adsorption of fluoride can be studied by xps sem edx and dft analysis xps spectra of the pre and post adsorbed form of q pzrvim revealed successful imprisonment of fluoride on q pzrvim wherein the full scan spectra of q pzrvim showed the presence of a peak at 689 5 ev due to fluoride after adsorption while new peaks appeared at 618 15 ev and 629 67 ev due to i 3d spin orbit doublet i 3d5 2 and i 3d3 2 respectively of iodide this change in spectral pattern indicates the possibility of exchange of iodide ions from polymer matrix with fluoride ions of a surrounding medium during adsorption further the appearance of the peak at 689 5 ev f1s fig 3e indicates the possible interaction of fluoride with q pzrvim through oh zr f at neutral ph during adsorption however in the spectra of o 1s pre and post adsorption fig 3 g h the peak shifted to a slightly higher value 531 51 to 531 89 ev after fluoride adsorption indicating that fluoride was adsorbed with the zroh group the interaction of fluoride through metallic moiety of zirconium zroh group was also proven by dft results thus it can be presumed that both zr bonded hydroxyl group zroh and quaternary ammonium group n ch3i are expected to facilitate the adsorption of fluoride via chemisorption phenomena the exchange phenomena of iodide ions can also be observed by the sem edx wherein the percentage of iodide ions reduced after adsorption due to exchange with fluoride ions during adsorption which was also revealed by the dft analysis moreover the adsorption behaviour can also be associated with the by adsorption isotherm wherein the fluoride removal by q pzrvim followed langmuir isotherm model with pseudo second order fitting which is suggesting the chemisorption behaviour of adsorption fig 10 4 conclusion herein the metallo polymeric microsphere q pzrvim is synthesized via a facile method a systematic study was conducted to understand the adsorption behaviour of fluoride ions the high performance efficiency of 97 9 of fluoride ions was achieved over a wide range of ph from 10 mg l 1 of fluoride in feed water the high adsorption capacity of q pzrvim up to109 6 mg g 1 might be due to the presence of zirconium content in the polymer microsphere having a high surface area of 453 m2 g 1 along with the high anion exchange capacity iec 3 4 meq g 1 the q pzrvim delivers a trace amount 15 μg l 1 of iodide ions in the treated water which would act as a disinfectant and help to avoid metabolic disorder concomitantly the presence of a negligible amount of zirconium in the same water is useful not only to avoid secondary pollution but also can be useful multiple times without materials loss the cost of treated water samples for an average of three cycles of operation was found as 10 12 paisa l including the cost of adsorbent including and filter accessories considering the aforementioned benefits the q pzrvim having a surface charge of 7 79 at 0 1 m nacl solution represents its high practical utility for real field water the binding energy between q pzrvim and fluoride ions by density functional theory was calculated as 533 39 kcal mol 1 which indicates high level of interaction between q pzrvim and fluoride ions at atomic and molecular levels credit authorship contribution statement saroj sharma conceptualization methodology formal

friendly dft and matlab data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the key source of drinking water supply worldwide 1 the occurrence of several types of contamination in groundwater has manifested in multiple diseases which is a global health concern one such naturally occurring ground water toxicant is fluoride affecting millions of populations across the globe including india 2 consumption of fluoride beyond its permissible limit who limit 1 5 mg l 1 through drinking water causes serious health issues such as irreversible demineralization of bone stiffness rheumatism to permanent crippling or skeletal fluorosis and tooth tissues and long term damage to the different key organs 3 as we know prevention is always better than cure the treatment of potable water prior to its consumption is an important health related geo environmental issue therefore search for cost effective and appropriate technology for defluoridation remains very critical in past various techniques have been explored to treat fluoride contaminated water such as coagulation separation precipitation adsorption ion exchange electrolysis electro dialysis electrochemical methods and membrane based separation process 4 among them adsorption is found to be the most significant and widely explored technique owing to its numerous benefits such as its flexibility and effortlessness of design relative ease of operation cost efficient high efficiency ease of operation and scalability etc therefore researchers have explored varieties of metal based materials such as metal oxide hydroxide and metal immobilized matrix for fluoride remediation i e ferric sludge 5 aluminium hydroxide 6 iron and iron oxide 7 mixed binary oxide fe mn etc 8 due to the strong affinity of metal ions towards fluoride though these metal based adsorbents have offered efficient fluoride removal capabilities however some drawbacks were observed with them i e agglomeration localization of metal during doping which reduces the surface area of adsorbent due to pore blockage which in turn affects removal efficiency leaching out of doped metal ions at varying ph conditions the most commonly used activated alumina aa for water remediation also suffers demerits due to the leaching of aluminium during use which has not been recommended for drinking purposes due to the cause of alzheimer 9 considering the drawbacks associated with these metal based adsorbents a new class of metallopolymers is fabricated to deliver high removal efficiency and long term sustainability for real water applications with a non leachable metal ion to avoid secondary pollution and sludge generation as well metallopolymers mps are a class of hybrid materials comprising metallic and polymeric moiety in their backbone that have been used in numerous fields 10 11 the mps are synthesized by polymerizing metal containing monomers mcms which are the effective precursors of polymeric metal complexes wherein the metal ion is anchored in each monomeric unit in a given spatial architecture 12 the mcms have been used in many fields such as the synthesis of optically active compounds hydrogenation and hydroformylation owing to their versatile properties 12 among different metals zirconium has been gaining meticulous attention in the adsorption process due to its versatile characteristics such as its strong affinity towards electronegative ligands non toxicity environmental friendliness and wide distribution in nature 13 the zirconium ions in the hydrated form can generate tetra nuclear and octa nuclear ionic species which are supposed to participate in ligand substitution reactions with the pollutants 14 thus considering the unique properties of zirconium and its extensive utilization as an adsorbent in various forms it has been chosen as one of the elements to fabricate a novel metallo polymeric mps microspheres for fluoride remediation 1 vinylimidazole 1 vim as an essential functional monomer has fascinated significant interest since it provides required properties for example metal chelation ion exchange biocompatibility antimicrobial anti corrosion coatings and protein adsorption etc 15 hence this has been chosen as one of the co monomer therefore in the current study an attempt has been made to synthesize zirconium based functional metallo polymeric microsphere q pzrvim comprising zirconium and 1 vinylimidazole 1 vim moiety in three dimensional shape with porous texture the performance evaluation study of q pzrvim has been preliminarily tested with simulated water at laboratory scale and after that explored with a fluoride containing groundwater sample owing to the unique properties such as high adsorption capacity non toxicity reusability low cost with tuneable architectures the q pzrvim could emerge as a promising water remediation candidate 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and methods the materials used in this study are described in text s1 of the supporting information si 2 2 synthesis of zirconyl dimethacrylate zrdma monomer and functional quaternized poly zirconyl dimethacrylate co 1 vinyl imidazole q pzrvim polymeric microsphere the metal containing monomer zirconyl dimethacrylate zrdma is synthesized via a double decomposition process as per the reported procedure 16 the q pzrvim adsorbent was synthesized by free radical suspension polymerization technique to get 3d spherical shape with porous texture the detailed procedure for the synthesis of zrdma and q pzrvim is given in si the schematic synthesis procedure and characteristic features of q pzrvim are mentation in fig 1 and table 1 respectively 2 3 analytical measurements and methods for analysis the prepared q pzrvim adsorbent was characterized by different instrumental techniques such as ftir solid state 1h nmr sem edx xrd icp ms tga xps bet zeta potential and ph ise detailed information on the instruments is given in the si s3 2 4 batch adsorption test in batch adsorption a stock solution of fluoride 1000 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving naf in deionized water and the desired concentrations were prepared by diluting it with di water next different amounts of the q pzrvim adsorbent 0 050 to 0 300 g l 1 were added into the beaker and the mixture was kept on constant stirring 150 rpm for a predetermined contact time 10 to 120 min by varying the contact time feed fluoride concentration and dosage of q pzrvim the adsorption of fluoride on q pzrvim was estimated for extreme uptake of fluoride from water by determining the optimum conditions at ambient temperature 30 2 0 c adsorption experiments were performed the fluoride containing q pzrvim was removed for each sample by collecting 10 ml of sample solution and filtering it with a syringe filter 0 22 μm nylon the filtered supernatant was then analyzed with the ion selective electrode to estimate the concentration of fluoride present in it whereas traces of leached zirconium content were followed via ion chromatography finally eq 1 was used for calculating the removal efficiency of fluoride while eq 2 was utilized to determine the equilibrium adsorption capacity 1 removal efficiency co ce x 100 ce 2 adsorption capacity q e co ce mg l 1 x v l m g where co and ce are the feed and equilibrium concentration of fluoride mg l 1 respectively v is the total volume of f solution l and m is the mass of q pzrvim g 2 5 kinetic and isotherm studies the studies of the influence of contact time and initial fluoride concentration provided valuable insights which were utilized to understand the adsorption behaviour of q pzrvim by studying both pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetics models and both langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms by applying pfo and pso models in eqs 3 and 4 orderly the rate of sorption of f was studied and the related kinetics parameter was determined 3 d q t dt k 1 q e q t 4 d q t dt k 2 q e q t 2 where qe is the adsorbed amount of fluoride per unit weight of q pzrvim at equilibrium mg g 1 qt being the adsorbed amount of fluoride per unit weight of q pzrvim mg g 1 at time t min and k1 and k2 being the 1st and 2nd order rate constant for the sorption min 1 correspondingly in the kinetics experiment 0 250 g l 1 of q pzrvim was added into 10 mg l 1 of fluoride solution and 5 0 ml aliquot was collected at different time intervals 10 to 120 min for fluoride analysis 2 6 adsorption isotherm study to understand the association between the adsorbed amount of fluoride on the surface of q pzrvim and its equilibrium concentration within the solution phase at constant temperature and pressure the adsorption isotherms were studied by using langmuir and freundlich isotherm which gives information about monolayer and multilayer 17 18 the initial concentrations of fluoride in between the range 10 to 30 mg l 1 were used to evaluate the isotherms and further the experimental results were plotted using the linear form of langmuir and freundlich isotherm models as described in eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 c e qe 1 b q m 1 q m c e 6 log qe log k f 1 n

constants without dimensions which show the relative adsorption capacity and intensity of adsorption respectively 2 7 effect of dose initial fluoride concentrations and agitation time the dosage of an adsorbent and feed concentration is significant parameters to examine the adsorption behaviour of an adsorbent under specific operating conditions dose optimization is a valuable parameter from the economical point of view which offers the notion of maximum adsorption with the minimum quantity of adsorbent usually the rate of adsorption increases with the increase in the quantity of adsorbent due to the availability of active sites therefore the performance of the adsorbent was studied under varying amounts of adsorbent 0 050 g to 0 250 g and feed concentration 10 0 to 30 0 mg l 1 while keeping other parameters fixed the other experimental conditions remained constant in both experiments i e ph 7 0 0 2 contact time 2 h temp 30 2 0 c rpm 150 the time dependent study is an essential factor to assess the performance of the adsorbent the minimum time for adsorbents to attain adsorption equilibrium was determined a batch experiment was carried out to examine the effect of contact time from 10 to 120 min on the fluoride removal efficiency while keeping other parameters fixed ph 7 0 0 2 dose 0 250g l 1 and f 10 mg l 1 2 8 effect of ph on adsorption and point of zero charge phpzc the effect of ph on adsorption efficacy was studied by varying the ph of the solution ranging from 2 0 2 12 0 2 at fixed experimental conditions such as dose 0 250 g l 1 rpm 150 contact time of 2 h temp 30 2 0 c and f 10 mg l 1 phpzc is linked to the surface charge and ph of the material so it affects some properties of suspension materials i e their stability interaction with electrolytes and ion exchange capacity the phpzc of the q pzrvim adsorbent was determined by the drift method 2 9 effect of co existing anions the effect of co ions on the remediation of fluoride ions was investigated with 100 mg l 1 concentration of competitive ions chloride cl nitrate no3 sulphate so4 2 and phosphate po4 3 and bicarbonate hco3 2 under fixed parameters i e f 10 mg l 1 contact time 2 h dose 0 250 g l 1 rpm 150 temp 30 c 2 c the initial ph values of the solutions in presence of different co existing ions were measured as 7 06 0 1 7 01 0 1 7 31 0 2 7 0 0 2 and 8 20 0 2 in the existence of cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 and hco3 2 ions respectively 2 10 desorption and regeneration experiments any methodology which can bring down the operational cost with minimum maintenance would be more attractive and economical therefore the sorption desorption study was carried out after investigating different eluting reagent to desorb fluoride at fixed experimental condition the eluting reagent having maximum desorption efficiency for the specific ions have been chosen for the study 2 11 physicochemical characterization ion exchange capacity iec was evaluated by the titration process by adopting the volhard method 19 the exchange of anions is calculated by the following equation 8 iec meq g 1 blank sample normality of kcns volume of naoh w dry water uptake of the adsorbent is calculated by immersing a specific quantity of adsorbent 0 5 g in distilled water di water for 24 h by the following equation given below 9 w w wet w dry w dry 100 where wwet and wdry are the wet and dry weight of the adsorbent respectively 2 12 computational study the interactions of fluoride with qpzrvim are studied by using the density functional theory dft study all structures are optimized using dft with a hybrid exchange correlation functional theory model b3lyp using a 3 21g basis set all calculations are performed with the gaussian 09 w package 20 the binding energies of the f and i ions with the

polymer e ion total energy of the ion 2 13 adsorption modelling for fixed bed column table 6 represents the characteristics of the q pzrvim particle and bed the particle and porosity were determined by the reported methods 22 continuous fixed bed adsorption was conducted using a perspex column internal diameter 7 cm filled with q pzrvim diameter 0 2 mm adsorbent with a depth of 25 cm a booster pump was used to control the constant flow rate of the inlet fluoride solution 83 ml min 1 in continuous up flow mode to adjust the feed flow rate a bypass line was added the experiments were conducted with groundwater samples collected from thordi district bhavnagar district gujarat having fluoride concentration of 5 0 mg l 1 23 the treated water samples were collected periodically through the output pipe in a container to measure the residual fluoride concentration as a function of time after the experiment the treated water sample was examined 2 13 a pore diffusion model in order to examine the adsorption of fluoride onto q pzrvim the fixed bed break through curves was predicted using the film pore diffusion model the convection diffusion model describes the one dimensional solute transport model in the fixed bed the pore diffusion model is developed based on the basic assumptions listed below 24 25 the flow is uniform throughout the cross sectional region and one dimensional in the axial direction the bed is completely saturated along the column the liquid phase velocity remains constant the column internal bulk fluid fluoride balance is stated as 11 c

identified by minimizing the sum of squared errors between experimental and predicted concentration data the sum of square error was described as 15 s i 1 n exp j 1 k c cal i j c exp i j c exp i j 2 where i is a number of experiments and j is a number of time points in the i th experiment 3 results and discussion the metallo polymeric microsphere of poly zirconyl dimethacrylate co 1 vinyl imidazole network in 3d shape with porous textures was synthesized via suspension polymerization method as reported in section 2 2 by using zrdma 1 vim and egdma the monomer 1 vim and zrdma were varied to prepare the microsphere followed by functionalization with methyl iodide to achieve functionality for high fluoride removal efficiency a batch experiment was carried out to evaluate the performance of both microspheres under similar experimental conditions the detail of the experimental condition and performance study is written in si fig s1 the characteristic features of both microspheres are shown in table 1 the table showed high iec values of 4 1 and 3 4 meq g 1 with q pvim and q zrvim respectively however faster and better defluoridation efficiency was observed with q pzrvim sa 453 m2 g 1 pv 0 51 cm3 g 1 compared to the q pvim sa 38 m2 g 1 pv 0 12 cm3 g 1 which can be ascribed to high surface area and porosity of q pzrvim compared to q pvim fig s1 the surface area and porosity are essential parameters to facilitate the faster and better sorption of ions by the adsorbent therefore q pzrvim has been chosen for further defluoridation study 3 1 characterization of q pzrvim the morphological properties of any polymeric network play an imperative role in adsorption behaviour indeed the large surface area and porous texture of any adsorbent s moiety facilitate the adsorption phenomena the presence of electropositive zirconium ions along with the n ch3i anion functionality in 3d shaped porous q pzrvim network plays a strategic role to facilitate the adsorption of fluoride ions through pores inside the polymer matrix 26 thus the presence of dual functionalities in q pzrvim matrix enables the better adsorption of fluoride ions the presence of well developed porous structures can be visualized by the sem spectra of q pzrvim pre and post adsorbed specimens fig 3 a the q pzrvim exhibits an average pore size is 1 35 μm fig 3a i iv the edx spectrum fig 3a v and electron mapping fig 3a viii and ix of the q pzrvim expressed the existence of fluoride after adsorption concomitantly the of iodine ions reduced from 6 74 to 3 77 wt after fluoride adsorption which indicates the involvement of exchange of anion f from the surrounding medium with i through the quaternary ammonium n ch3i site the uniform distribution of zirconium no pore blockage and no morphological change in sem images of pre and post adsorbed q pzrvim is the attractive feature of the prepared microsphere the diffraction spectra of xrd reveal the presence of zirconium in q pzrvim by the presence of three broad peaks 2θ at 30 85 42 55 and 56 83 jcpds cards no 37 1484 and 17 0923 applying the debye scherrer equation d 0 9λβ cos θ where λ is the wavelength of x ray irradiated β is the full width of line at half the maximum intensity fwhm the average crystalline particle size was estimated as 20 37 43 96 nm and no significant changes were observed in xrd pattern after fluoride adsorption fig s7a the icp ms results showed 31 02 of zirconium in the matrix while nitrogen was found as 4 42 by chns analysis along with other elements c 28 11 h 4 05 and s 0 thus the total inorganic contents zr 31 02 n 4 42 in q pzrvim is almost equivalent to the residual mass 36 01 obtained in tga thermo gram at 800 c fig s7b the structural features of q pzrvim were examined by ftir and in 1h nmr spectra without crosslinker the ftir of the q pzrvim pre and post fluoride adsorption showed the vibrational frequency changes in the function group of the adsorbent the adsorption peak around 3440 cm 1 indicates the existence of hydroxyl groups whereas the bands at 2870 2920 cm 1 are assigned to ch bonds symmetric and asymmetric owing to the methyl carbons ch3 ch2 ch which have been reduced after adsorption of fluoride the peak at 1643 and 1170 is representing co and co functional groups 27 fig 3b the presence of a peak at 806 and 676 cm 1 can be attributed to the bending vibration of the zroh group 28 the intensity of these peaks is reduced after the adsorption of fluoride which is showing the interaction of fluoride with a hydroxyl group i e zroh 29 31 this observation is also compared with the earlier studies 32 35 however interaction with fluoride with zr via the formation of the zrf bond and is still unclear the presence of peaks at around 375 475 cm 1 and 240 350 cm 1 due to zrf and fzrf bond respectively are generally visible in the mid range infrared spectrometer which was beyond the detecting range of ftir spectroscopy hence it could not be seen in the present study 30 in 1h nmr spectra fig 3c the peak belonging to two protons of ch2 group on the main chain has been shifted to around 5 49 and 5 65 δ ppm and the peaks due to one proton of ch group has been shifted to around 6 10 and 6 01 δ ppm the new peak at around 4 1 δ ppm is due to the ch3 group attached to the n atom the peaks between 7 5 8 3 and 9 6 δ ppm appeared due to the aromatic ch group of the imidazole ring which was divided into three peaks because of the electron withdrawing structure of the ammonium group 36 the adsorption phenomena of q pzrvim have also examined uv vis absorption spectra fig s7c wherein no absorption bands of iodide could be observed before adsorption while an intense absorption peak at around 230 nm λ appeared after adsorption of fluoride which indicates the presence of iodide ions in water 37 which can also be correlated with elemental composition of sem edx analysis fig 3 a iv where in iodide ion was present with after adsorption thus the presence of trace amount of iodide ions in the treated from revealed the occurrence of ion exchange phenomena during adsorption with the fluoride ions of the surrounding medium the chemical compositions and adsorptive phenomena of q pzrvim pre and post adsorption of fluoride are studied by xps analysis the wide scan xps image of q pzrvim in fig 3d shows the existence of elements c o i n and zr in the q pzrvim before and along with fluoride f after adsorption a new peak at 685 ev in wide scan xps image of q pzrvim after adsorption indicates the presence of fluoride 38 which has been confirmed by the elaborated f 1s spectrum fig 3e the two peaks sited at 689 45 and 684 30 ev in f 1s photoelectron correlate to inorganic fluoride attributed to metal mfn and organic fluoride bonded to metal rmf m zr respectively the higher binding energy of peak at 689 45 ev compared to 684 30 ev is due to naf suggesting the possible adsorption of fluoride via chemisorption 39 to determine the chemical environment of iodide high resolution xps spectra of the i 3d peaks were examined the i 3d spectra fig 3f showed the presence of two major peaks sited at 618 15 ev and 629 67 ev due to i 3d spin orbit doublet i 3d5 2 and i 3d3 2 respectively before fluoride adsorption which has been disappeared after adsorption of fluoride a similar spectral pattern is observed in full scan spectra of q pzrvim wherein the peak due to iodide ions present in the pre adsorbed form of q pzrvim disappeared after adsorption further the o1 s spectra of q pzrvim fig 3g h deconvolution of o 1s spectra produces two main peaks around 531 5 ev 533 ev the peak around 531 5 ev is assigned to co or zroh 40 the peak around 533 ev is attributed to cho bonding peaks at 531 51 ev due to the zroh before adsorption which after adsorption of fluoride has been shifted towards higher binding energy 531 89 ev this is suggesting the possible interaction of fluoride with zirconium through zrohf therefore it can be observed that both zr bonded hydroxyl group zroh and quaternary ammonium group n ch3i are expected to facilitate the adsorption of fluoride via chemisorption phenomena dft is a computational technique widely used to understand the interactions between molecules at the electronic level 3 therefore the interaction of fluoride ion with q pzrvim was studied through dft the binding energies is calculated from the total energies of ions adsorbent before and after interaction with fluoride using the equation mentioned in the computational method section 20 there is two active site in q pzrvim first one is zroh and second one is imidazolium functional group which play significant role for the adsorption of fluoride the optimized structure of pzrvim shows an s like conformation around the zirconium atom leading to a cage like structure fig 2 which has shown structural changes after the quaternization reaction fig 4 a b after interaction with f ion prominent changes were observed around the zirconium site of q pzrvim due to strong interaction with f ion through electrostatic attraction the effect is reflected in the increase in bond length between zr o from 2 20 å to 2 33 å and zr o from 2 09 å to 2 41 å the addition of f ions near the zirconium atom causes some reorientations in the q pzrvim f complex structure which is revealed in terms of binding energy be the be of the q pzrvim f is calculated as 439 26 kcal mol 1 on the other hand at the imidazolium ring no stable ionic interactions between the positively charged n atom of the imidazolium ring and the counter i ion were observed instead a consistent increase in the distance was observed fig 4b as a result it was revealed that counter i ions were replaced by f ion from the surrounding medium fig 4c however no significant change in bond length and angle or dihedral angle of the imidazolium ring part occurred as a result it was observed that f ions have the ability to replace i ions from q pzrvim near the imidazolium site fig 4c at the same time no significant structural changes were observed in q pzrvim near the zirconium atom therefore the dft study revealed involvement of dual active sites for the adsorption of fluoride fig 4c further the binding energy of q pzrvim after adsorption of fluoride at both active sites was calculated as 533 392 kcal mol 1 thus the difference in binding energies 94 kcal mol between two active sites of q pzrvim 2f e 533 39 kcal mol 1 fig 4c revealed that q pzrvim 2f complex is more stable than q pzrvim f e 439 26 kcal mol 1 3 2 kinetics of adsorption the adsorption of fluoride by q pzrvim was examined as a function of contact time to establish the adsorption kinetics and the adsorption equilibrium time to determine the related adsorption kinetics parameter the commonly used pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso adsorption kinetic models were applied the pfo model predicts that adsorption occurs through the boundary while pso represents the chemisorption adsorption process 18 fig 5 showed that the pso model r2 0 997 is fitted well compared to the pfo model r2 0 994 due to its higher correlation coefficient furthermore the calculated q e cal of pso model q e cal 44 66 mg g 1 is close to the experimental adsorption capacity q e expt 39 16 mg g 1 compared to the pfo model q e cal 32 23 mg g 1 table 2 the higher and closed values of adsorption capacities q e cal 44 66 mg g 1 and q e expt 39 16 mg g 1 for pso adsorption kinetics model suggested that the rate limiting step might occur through chemisorption via formation of covalent bonds either through sharing or exchange of electrons between anion and q pzrvim adsorbent 3 3 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm studies provide information about the equilibrium of the adsorption process in the liquid solids system the experimental data for adsorption isotherms of fluoride were discussed in the previous section 2 6 the results indicated a direct relationship between the adsorbent capacity and fluoride concentration the connection between sorbate and sorbent using q pzrvim the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are studied fig 6a and b 3 3 1 langmuir and freundlich model the results obtained after applying langmuir and freundlich model are represented in table 3 and fig 6 wherein the linear correlation coefficient r2 of the langmuir isotherm model r2 0 997 is much closer to unity in comparison to the freundlich isotherm model r2 0 976 the proximity of r2 value to 1 by applying the langmuir model suggests the adsorption of fluoride onto q pzrvim through homogeneous monolayer formation 17 41 hence q pzrvim could be attributed to having well dispersed homogeneous surface active sites adsorption which might assume to occur through the formation of covalent bonds chemisorption 42 nonetheless the calculated qmax theo obtained was 130 5 mg g 1 the highest in comparison to other adsorbents reported in the literature table 4 3 4 effect of ph the effect of the adsorbent s dose feed concentration and effect of agitation time were optimized the detailed investigation is written in si the ph of a solution is one of the predominant factors which affect the process of adsorption as it influences the degree of ionization and the surface charge of the particles thus fluoride uptake capacity onto the q pzrvim was studied by varying initial ph levels viz 2 0 0 2 to 12 0 0 2 under optimum parameters f 10 mg l 1 contact time 2 h temp 30 2 0 c rpm 150 dose 0 250 g l 1 the ph of the working solution was controlled by adding hcl naoh solutions the effects acquired have been plotted as percentage elimination of the fluoride ion with ph fig 7a the figure revealed 100 removal efficiency in the ph range of 2 0 0 2 to 6 0 0 2 with the adsorption capacity of 40 mg g 1 the higher adsorption of fluoride ion in acidic medium occurred due to the increase in the coulombic force of attraction between positively charged h ions and negatively charged f ions 2 it is observed that most of the reported materials work better under acidic conditions which is not appropriate for the potable purpose 43 thus for potable purposes it is essential to find adsorbents having better efficiency at the neutral ph range in the present study at ph 7 0 0 2 and 8 0 0 2 removal is slightly reduced to 97 9 and 97 8 respectively which decreased on further moving towards basic ph medium at ph 10 0 0 2 and 12 0 0 2 the percent removal is found to reduce to 90 and 80 respectively this is because at basic ph oh and f ions compete with each other both ions are isoelectronic but oh is more active than f and hence oh adsorbs preferably on the positively charged q pzrvim surface fig 8 thereby reducing the fluoride removal efficiency and also there will be electrostatic repulsion between both negatively charged ions this contributes to the decrease in removal efficiency thus the result revealed that q pzrvim could efficiently be brought down the fluoride level up to the who permissible limit in the ph range of 2 0 0 2 to 8 0 0 2 with an almost negligible amount of leached zirconium ions found in treated water fig 7c which curtails the pots adjustment of ph to make it potable when the adsorption capacity is examined it was observed that the capacity decreased with an increase in the ph the adsorption capacity is 40 mg g 1 for ph range of 2 0 0 2 to 6 0 0 2 from ph value 7 0 0 2 to 8 0 0 2 capacity remains almost constant with values 39 16 mg g 1 and 39 12 mg g 1 respectively after ph 8 0 0 2 the capacity is found to be gradually decreasing with values 36 and 32 8 mg g 1 for ph 10 0 0 2 and 12 0 0 2 respectively this trend in the variation of adsorption capacity with increase in ph can also be attributed to the above stated reasons moreover the point of zero charges phpzc of the q pzrvim examined by drift method was found as 7 79 fig 7b which indicates positively charged surface at ph 7 79 and negative above 7 79 44 the above value reveals that the prepared polymeric network is negatively charged 45 which revealed its practical utility for real water treatment generally the potable water from ground water or municipal sources are having ph in the range of 7 0 to 8 0 ph and the prepared adsorbent has shown its high removal efficacy up to ph 8 0 0 2 owe to its surface charge phpzc 7 79 ph range the table 4 represents the comparative performance of reported adsorbents for the removal of fluoride from water which revealed that reported adsorbents has shown high removal efficiency at lower ph range which requires ph adjustment of treated water prior to its consumption however in present work q pzrvim works well at neutral ph range the performance of the q pzrvim was evaluated with the real ground water samples column study which revealed its practical utility for real water treatment moreover the treated water samples were analyzed by ic and icp ms analysis to examine the presence of iodide and zirconium the presence of iodide i in treated water samples suggested that the quaternary amine termini n ch3i facilitate the exchange of counter iodide ion i with fluoride ions f from the surrounding medium while the negligible amount of zirconium present indicates that q pzrvim is ph stable across a wide range thus owing to the unique characteristic of q pzrvim i e phpzc 7 79 the presence and absence of iodide and zirconium respectively represents its high practical efficacy as it can work well at ph of groundwater which lies between ph 6 0 0 2 8 0 0 2 hence its can deliver potable water for direct consumption 3 5 comparative study of adsorbents table 4 represents a list of various adsorbents used for fluoride adsorption which revealed that few adsorbents have shown significant high adsorption capacity in acidic medium hence need post adjustment before the consumption of water which in turn requires an additional step and a skilled person for assurance further while using metal doped immobilized adsorbents leaching of doped metal ions occurs during adsorption which causes secondary pollution and after each cycle of operation reloading of metal ions is needed while utilising q pzrvim no post ph adjustment is necessary to make treated water potable the other experimental analysis ph regeneration revealed the long term durability and reusable of q pzrvim which is advantageous for the field water application 3 6 effect of co existing ions the presence of several co ions in ground water along with fluoride may interfere its adsorption fig s4 shows that chloride cl and nitrate no3 ions exhibited lesser influence on fluoride adsorption due to the formation of weak bonds with the active sites at the outer sphere complex whereas the sulphate ions form both outer sphere and inner sphere surface complexes 53 thus both cl and no3 ions have less while sulphate ions have a substantial interfering effect on the removal of fluoride it is generally observed that phosphate po4 3 ion having a high negative charge compared to other anions needs three close surface groups and it gets adsorbed as inner sphere surface complex on adsorbents this inner spherically adsorbing phosphate can significantly interfere with the fluoride ion which subsequently decreases the percentage of fluoride removal efficiency further bicarbonate hco3 2 being a conjugate base of a weak acid produces hydroxyl ions which acts as primary competing ions against fluoride the produced hydroxyl ions compete against fluoride ions which interns reduce the fluoride uptake efficacy fig s4 53 54 thus results revealed that fluoride adsorption capacity on q pzrvim is influenced by the presence of competing ions which was found in the decreasing order of 96 6 96 5 92 21 41 7 and 26 6 in the presence of cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 and hco3 2 respectively 3 7 desorption and regeneration to find the suitable eluting agent a preliminary desorption study was carried out with different reagents such as hno3 nacl naoh and na2co3 0 1 m each after desorption the recovery of fluoride ions was found as 3 0 48 89 and 98 5 in hno3 nacl naoh and na2co3 reagents respectively fig s5a based on the maximum desorption efficiency with na2co3 solution this was chosen as the eluting agent for the regeneration study followed by treatment with nai 0 1 m and washing with di to get neutral ph the regeneration and recyclability of q pzrvim adsorbent were performed for five consecutive times wherein the decent fluoride removal efficiency was observed with the minor change des1st 97 9 to 86 5 des5st cycle which might be due to experimental error and or some trapped ions fig s5b the high reusability with any material loss suggests the suitability of q pzrvim for field water applications 3 8 thermodynamics study fig s6 revealed as the temperature increased from 293 to 313 k the adsorption of fluoride ions also increased which could be due to the increase in the mobility of the fluoride ions as a result of acquired energy in the system the experimental condition for thermodynamics study was kept constant such as dose 0 250 g l 1 rpm 150 contact time of 2 h and f 10 mg l 1 and ph 7 0 0 2 the calculated values of δh and δs are presented in table s1 the positive values of δh 34 46 and δs 0 144 indicate that adsorption was endothermic and have a strong affinity for the fluoride whereas the negative values of δg 0 799 to 10 88 are suggesting a spontaneous and favourable chemi sorption process 55 other information is available in si 3 9 colum study the column experiment was performed with the field water sample having fluoride in the range of 5 0 mg l 1 along with other ions the collected water was passed through the domestic housing filter dimension length 25 cm internal diameter 7 0 cm filled with the q pzrvim 1 0 kg with the fixed flow rate of 83 ml min 1 till breakthrough at neutral ph for more studies such as the effect of feed concentration on performance have also been studied for this additional quantity of spike solution of fluoride was added to the same fluoride containing groundwater 5 0 mg l 1 to make it fluoride solution of 7 0 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 all these three water samples having varying amount of fluoride 5 0 mg l 1 7 0 mg l 1 and 10 0 mg l 1 while retaining same quantity of other ions were used for the column study fig 9 represents the experimental data along with predicted results using the pore diffusion model the optimization variables in the model i e axial dispersion coefficient d l pore diffusivity d p and mass transfer coefficient k f are tabulated in table 5 feed concentration was varied from 5 mg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 for a constant flow rate 83 ml min 1 it is observed that breakthrough curves shift towards the left as the feed concentration of fluoride increases thus the breakthrough time of the q pzrvim with the breakthrough of 4000 l fluoride free water who permissible limit 1 5 mg l 1 with 5 0 mg l 1 feed concentration was calculated as 926 h for 25 cm bed depth column the breakthrough time was found to deceases to 610 and 413 h for 7 0 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 fluoride feed concentration respectively with same bed depth column the pre and post treated water samples f 5 0 mg l 1 were analyzed the treated water sample has shown the presence of iodide ions in the range of 12 16 μg l 1 as an additional ion table 7 the estimated dietary iodine requirement for adults ranges from 80 to 150 μg day 1 as per the who permissible limit 56 the presence of a trace quantity of iodide ions in treated water would be useful as being disinfectant as well as an essential dietary mineral to avoid metabolic disorders thus treated water can be recommended for direct consumption 3 10 cost estimation the expenses incurred for the preparative process of any adsorbent via multiple steps surface morphology and reusability play a crucial role to consider the cost effective water treatment process the literature is abundant on verities of adsorbent materials but less concerned about the cost the cost calculation of an adsorbent is also influenced by different factors such as the obtainability of precursor processing requirements and treatment environments for water remediation the cost of the developed adsorbent is calculated as rs 800 900 1 0 kg prepared at the scale of 500 g batch which is relatively lower than the commercially available activated charcoal costs around 15 56 usd 1000 inr 56 57 the cost of treated water samples for an average of three cycles of operation was found as 10 12 paisa l including the cost of adsorbent and filter accessories which represent a cost effective process moreover the treatment cost could further be reduced at pilot scale production therefore the q pzrvim may well serve as a proficient and economical adsorbent for defluoridation 3 11 plausible adsorption mechanism the adsorptive phenomena of q pzrvim for the adsorption of fluoride can be studied by xps sem edx and dft analysis xps spectra of the pre and post adsorbed form of q pzrvim revealed successful imprisonment of fluoride on q pzrvim wherein the full scan spectra of q pzrvim showed the presence of a peak at 689 5 ev due to fluoride after adsorption while new peaks appeared at 618 15 ev and 629 67 ev due to i 3d spin orbit doublet i 3d5 2 and i 3d3 2 respectively of iodide this change in spectral pattern indicates the possibility of exchange of iodide ions from polymer matrix with fluoride ions of a surrounding medium during adsorption further the appearance of the peak at 689 5 ev f1s fig 3e indicates the possible interaction of fluoride with q pzrvim through oh zr f at neutral ph during adsorption however in the spectra of o 1s pre and post adsorption fig 3 g h the peak shifted to a slightly higher value 531 51 to 531 89 ev after fluoride adsorption indicating that fluoride was adsorbed with the zroh group the interaction of fluoride through metallic moiety of zirconium zroh group was also proven by dft results thus it can be presumed that both zr bonded hydroxyl group zroh and quaternary ammonium group n ch3i are expected to facilitate the adsorption of fluoride via chemisorption phenomena the exchange phenomena of iodide ions can also be observed by the sem edx wherein the percentage of iodide ions reduced after adsorption due to exchange with fluoride ions during adsorption which was also revealed by the dft analysis moreover the adsorption behaviour can also be associated with the by adsorption isotherm wherein the fluoride removal by q pzrvim followed langmuir isotherm model with pseudo second order fitting which is suggesting the chemisorption behaviour of adsorption fig 10 4 conclusion herein the metallo polymeric microsphere q pzrvim is synthesized via a facile method a systematic study was conducted to understand the adsorption behaviour of fluoride ions the high performance efficiency of 97 9 of fluoride ions was achieved over a wide range of ph from 10 mg l 1 of fluoride in feed water the high adsorption capacity of q pzrvim up to109 6 mg g 1 might be due to the presence of zirconium content in the polymer microsphere having a high surface area of 453 m2 g 1 along with the high anion exchange capacity iec 3 4 meq g 1 the q pzrvim delivers a trace amount 15 μg l 1 of iodide ions in the treated water which would act as a disinfectant and help to avoid metabolic disorder concomitantly the presence of a negligible amount of zirconium in the same water is useful not only to avoid secondary pollution but also can be useful multiple times without materials loss the cost of treated water samples for an average of three cycles of operation was found as 10 12 paisa l including the cost of adsorbent including and filter accessories considering the aforementioned benefits the q pzrvim having a surface charge of 7 79 at 0 1 m nacl solution represents its high practical utility for real field water the binding energy between q pzrvim and fluoride ions by density functional theory was calculated as 533 39 kcal mol 1 which indicates high level of interaction between q pzrvim and fluoride ions at atomic and molecular levels credit authorship contribution statement saroj sharma conceptualization methodology formal

12791,the development of facile and highly efficient materials for oil water separation has recently attracted significant attention herein a novel approach for the development of tungsten oxide based meshes modified with palmitic acid hexadecanoic is reported the stainless steel meshes were first coated with tungsten oxide thin film using a direct current dc sputtering system followed by post annealing treatments at different temperatures specifically at room temperature 200 400 600 and 800 c after that the as fabricated films were chemically functionalized with palmitic acid the fabricated samples were then characterized using sem edx xrd and contact angle measurement their separation efficiency towards oil water separation was evaluated excellent reproducibility was obtained by the functionalized tungsten oxide film treated at 600 c the same sample showed excellent flux up to 30 000 l m 2 h 1 with excellent separation efficacy of around 98 0 1 5 the modified mesh showed excellent separation efficiency even with saline mixtures the reported facile approach can pave the way for more practical utilization of coating nanomaterials for oil water separation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords clean technology water treatment pollutants removal oil adsorption 1 introduction oily contaminants consist of complex organics and tend to have low biodegradability which causes a severe impact on the ecosystem oil contaminants may increase the biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod of the water body and reduce sunlight penetration into the water by forming a layer on the water surface and thus disrupting the aquatic ecosystem 1 3 moreover treating water contaminated with oil and organic pollutants with reverse osmosis membranes could result in fouling 4 accordingly the separation of oil constituents from water is essential to protect the environment and create a more sustainable future several methods have been applied for separating oil spills and pollutants from water including physical 5 8 chemical 9 10 electrochemical 11 12 and biological methods 13 14 these methods have their advantages and drawbacks nevertheless several separation techniques have been extensively studied to address the challenge of removing oil from water recently the surface wettability of materials has drawn considerable attention to deal with oil water separation due to the spreading ability of a liquid on a solid surface 15 16 wettability is defined as the ability of a liquid to adhere to a solid surface it is determined by the balance between the intermolecular interactions of the adhesive type liquid to the surface and cohesive type liquid to liquid forces wettability can be used to study the interaction between liquid and solid surfaces that relates to the surface geometry and chemical composition of the surface 17 the contact angle θ which is formed by the tangent between the solid and the liquid surfaces is measured to represent the wettability of the material surface hydrophobic surfaces have a contact angle that is greater than 90 and while superhydrophobic surfaces have a contact angle that is equal to or greater than 150 on the other hand the solid surface is classified as hydrophilic when the contact angle is lower than 90 while it is classified as super hydrophilic if the contact angle is greater than 0 and less than 10 18 19 materials with special wettability properties have attracted wide applications such as anti bacterial 20 21 anti corrosion 22 23 self cleaning 24 25 anti staining applications 26 27 and oil water separation 28 30 the adoption of such materials is considered one of the best methods to solve oil spills and contaminations these materials may be designed in two forms filtrating materials meshes membranes textiles etc and absorbing materials aerogels sponges particles etc 31 the mesh based hydrophobic surfaces have attracted considerable attention in literature for oil and water separation due to their good chemical and thermal stability and good pore features 32 34 however the selectivity and surface stability of hydrophobic meshes are the main challenges for practical applications hence modification of mesh surfaces for the oil water separation application is essential to enhance their performance in this study a facile approach for fabricating hydrophobic mesh surfaces is reported the tungsten oxide thin films were deposited onto the mesh surface to enhance the meshes performance functionalization of mesh surfaces was chemically performed with palmitic acid to generate an oil selective mesh via chemical grafting the physical and chemical properties of the fabricated samples were characterized by using x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray analysis sem edx and contact angle measurements testing the separation of oil water was performed in terms of efficiency and reusability of hydrophobic surfaces performance 2 experimental 2 1 materials analytical grade reagents and materials were purchased and used as received without any further purification the multi walled carbon

from sinopharm chemical reagent company the tungsten w target purity 99 99 dia 2 in thickness 0 215 in was purchased from aci alloys inc san jose usa 2 2 modification of steel mesh with tungsten oxides the tungsten target was used for the deposition of w thin films on stainless steel mesh substrates at room temperature the deposition of the w thin films was performed via a direct current dc sputtering system nsc4000 nanomaster inc usa the distance between the w target and the substrates was set to 9 cm before deposition the substrates and the target were subsequently cleaned using acetone isopropyl alcohol and then deionized water for 20 min after that the deposition chamber was evacuated to 3 2 10 5 torr and a 2 minute pre sputtering was carried out to further clean the tungsten target surface the w thin films were sputtered for 30 min at a deposition pressure and a working pressure of 50 watts and 3 5 10 3 torr respectively the as deposited w films were then annealed for a dwell time of 3 h in a tube furnace at different temperatures specifically at 200 400 600 and 800 c in atmospheric air to convert sputtered w films to tungsten oxides thin films 2 3 modification of meshes with palmitic acid the hydrophobic meshes were prepared by heating treatment with palmitic hexadecanoic acid pa solution using a round bottom flask 0 5 g of hexadecanoic acid was dissolved into 5 ml of chloroform the prepared meshes were then heated in the solution at a temperature of 70 c under stirring conditions after 5 h the meshes were dried in atmospheric air fig 1 demonstrates the preparation scheme of hydrophobic mesh functionalized with palmitic acid 2 4 measurements and characterisation the microstructures and surface morphologies of the prepared materials were studied using the scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6610lv scanning electron microscope jeol at 20 kv acceleration voltage the structural properties of the synthesized samples were investigated using x ray diffraction xrd rigaku miniflex japan with cu kα1 radiation λ 0 15416 nm a current of 10 ma as well as an accelerating voltage of 30 kv the surface hydrophobicity of the samples was investigated using biolin scientific attension theta flex the water contact angle wca of various samples was measured immediately after the deposition of distilled water onto the substrate the water droplet volume used was 5 μl and at least five separate measurements were carried out on the surface of each sample 2 5 oil water separation test the oil water separation experiments were performed by the following procedure the established pa grafted tungsten modified mesh was fixed in the separation setup volume volume v v mixtures of various pollutants and water were prepared in order to differentiate between water and oil components the water was coloured with methylene blue dye the separation system was assembled in which the mesh mounted between the funnel and the flask then the oil water was decanted in the separation system the mesh separates the oil from water then the oil or pollutants were collected from the flask while the separated water was collected from the funnel the measurement of separation efficacy was determined by using the following equation 7 1 ɳ m c m o 100 the ɳ refers to the percentage of separation efficiency m o refers to the oil mass in the mixture and m c refers to the mass of the recovered oil from the mixture the permeate flux for the separation of the oil from the water was determined as follows 2 j v a t where j refers to the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 a refers to the contact area between the oil and the hydrophobic mesh m2 and t refers to the time h v refers to the volume l of the liquid that passes through the mesh in time t h the effect of salinity on the separation was also evaluated in the gravity driven oil water separation assembly samples with a wide range of salinity 500 12 000 ppm sodium chloride were prepared and used in the separation experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation the morphology of the prepared hydrophobic meshes was observed using sem fig 2 the images show periodical pores on the meshes surface after it was coated with tungsten oxide at all the temperature conditions fig 2 i a e the morphology of tungsten oxide coated mesh exhibits a minor change from the smooth surface morphology of the pristine steel mesh after modification of the coated meshes with palmitic acid the meshes surface has been observed to be rough at low and high magnifications fig 2 ii iii indicating the successful functionalization of palmitic acid on the stainless steel fibers the roughness plays a key role to attain a superhydrophobic surface at high magnification the distribution of palmitic

12791,the development of facile and highly efficient materials for oil water separation has recently attracted significant attention herein a novel approach for the development of tungsten oxide based meshes modified with palmitic acid hexadecanoic is reported the stainless steel meshes were first coated with tungsten oxide thin film using a direct current dc sputtering system followed by post annealing treatments at different temperatures specifically at room temperature 200 400 600 and 800 c after that the as fabricated films were chemically functionalized with palmitic acid the fabricated samples were then characterized using sem edx xrd and contact angle measurement their separation efficiency towards oil water separation was evaluated excellent reproducibility was obtained

excellent separation efficiency even with saline mixtures the reported facile approach can pave the way for more practical utilization of coating nanomaterials for oil water separation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords clean technology water treatment pollutants removal oil adsorption 1 introduction oily contaminants consist of complex organics and tend to have low biodegradability which causes a severe impact on the ecosystem oil contaminants may increase the biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod of the water body and reduce sunlight penetration into the water by forming a layer on the water surface and thus disrupting the aquatic ecosystem 1 3 moreover treating water contaminated with oil and organic pollutants with reverse osmosis membranes could result in fouling 4 accordingly the separation of oil constituents from water is essential to protect the environment and create a more sustainable future several methods have been applied for separating oil spills and pollutants from water including physical 5 8 chemical 9 10 electrochemical 11 12 and biological methods 13 14 these methods have their advantages and drawbacks nevertheless several separation techniques have been extensively studied to address the challenge of removing oil from water recently the surface wettability of materials has drawn considerable attention to deal with oil water separation due to the spreading ability of a liquid on a solid surface 15 16 wettability is defined as the ability of a liquid to adhere to a solid surface it is determined by the balance between the intermolecular interactions of the adhesive type liquid to the surface and cohesive type liquid to liquid forces wettability can be used to study the interaction between liquid and solid surfaces that relates to the surface geometry and chemical composition of the surface 17 the contact angle θ which is formed by the tangent between the solid and the liquid surfaces is measured to represent the wettability of the material surface hydrophobic surfaces have a contact angle that is greater than 90 and while superhydrophobic surfaces have a contact angle that is equal to or greater than 150 on the other hand the solid surface is classified as hydrophilic when the contact angle is lower than 90 while it is classified as super hydrophilic if the contact angle is greater than 0 and less than 10 18 19 materials with special wettability properties have attracted wide applications such as anti bacterial 20 21 anti corrosion 22 23 self cleaning 24 25 anti staining applications 26 27 and oil water separation 28 30 the adoption of such materials is considered one of the best methods to solve oil spills and contaminations these materials may be designed in two forms filtrating materials meshes membranes textiles etc and absorbing materials aerogels sponges particles etc 31 the mesh based hydrophobic surfaces have attracted considerable attention in literature for oil and water separation due to their good chemical and thermal stability and good pore features 32 34 however the selectivity and surface stability of hydrophobic meshes are the main challenges for practical applications hence modification of mesh surfaces for the oil water separation application is essential to enhance their performance in this study a facile approach for fabricating hydrophobic mesh surfaces is reported the tungsten oxide thin films were deposited onto the mesh surface to enhance the meshes performance functionalization of mesh surfaces was chemically

12792,herein an ultralong polypyrrole nanowires coated stainless steel mesh ppy ssm was successfully prepared to cope with the on demand separation of oil water emulsions as well as dyes adsorption via electrodeposition the as prepared ppy ssm could be switched from superhydrophilic to hydrophobic under electric field for at least 50 times benefiting from the high porosity and its selective wettability the ppy ssm exhibited excellent separation efficiency of up to 99 88 and high filtration flux of up to 2984 l m 2 h 1 for both oil in water and water in oil emulsions even for the high viscous crude oil in water emulsion thanks to the surface charge abundant aromatic rings of ppy and porous structure ppy ssm also achieved selective adsorption of cationic or anionic dyes with high efficiency up to 99 28 under diverse ph conditions moreover the ppy ssm also displayed a strong chemical resistance and mechanical stability under harsh conditions such as extreme temperature corrosive environments and various friction tests combined with a simple and environmental friendly fabrication process the high performance membrane ppy ssm has promising applications in the separation of oil water emulsions and the adsorption of dyes keywords polypyrrole nanowires switchable wettability electrodeposition oil water emulsion separation dyes adsorption 1 introduction water pollution caused by oil and organic dyes is now a worldwide concern as a result of fast industrialization 1 6 the excessive discharge of oily wastewater containing dyes endangers the ecological environment and human health because they are toxic and demanding to be biodegraded 7 9 various multifunctional superwetting materials such as sponge 10 12 membrane 13 15 aerogel 16 17 and so forth 18 19 have been developed and used throughout the years to meet the difficulty of treating wastewater that is contaminated with oil and dye the widely accepted strategy is fabricating a filtration material loaded with photocatalyst e g tio2 20 zno 21 and metal organic framework 22 24 because of their selective affinities toward oil and water and strong oxidative free radicals generated by light irradiation these materials can be applied to purify oil water emulsions and dyed wastewater however the limited catalytic activity sites and short wavelength absorption in the ultraviolet region prevent their further industrial applications alternatively adsorption as a convenient and cost effective method has also made tremendous progress in dyed wastewater purification 11 17 however the majority of these adsorption materials can deal with only one kind of oil water emulsion or dye therefore it is urgent to develop a multifunctional material aimed at complicated working conditions conducting polymer such as polypyrrole ppy exhibits excellent reversibly switchable wettability by electricity indicating that they could be utilized to separate water and oil as required 25 28 moreover ppy also possesses numerous adsorption sites compared to photocatalytic materials 29 these advantages bestow upon ppy the promising multifunctional material for water pollution treatment such as oil water separation and dyes adsorption 30 33 although tremendous progress has been made there are still several problems with these ppy based materials most of these materials fail to separate oil water emulsions to address this dilemma guo et al 32 developed a ppy nanoparticles coated stainless steel mesh with underwater superoleophobicity the pore size could be accurately adjusted to realize oil water emulsion separation by increasing the cyclic voltammetry number albeit at the expense of filtration flux in addition these ppy nanoparticles loaded materials possess a relatively low specific area because of the agglomeration of nanoparticles which may result in their low dyes adsorption capacity therefore the key is to increase the specific surface area as much as possible without blocking the of the membrane s pores so as to receive high filtration flux as well as high efficiency herein a simple and ecologically friendly strategy is demonstrated to make ultralong ppy nanowires coated stainless steel mesh ppy ssm with high surface area and high porosity using the electrodeposition method scheme 1 the surface wettability of ppy ssm could be facile turned from superhydrophilic to hydrophobic under electric field combined with the suitable pore size and high porosity the developed ppy ssm was capable of efficiently separating oil in water and water in oil emulsions under gravity with a satisfactory filtration flux and separation efficiency various stability experiments indicated that the as prepared membrane had a superb stability in harsh environments for practical application furthermore at various ph settings the surface of ppy ssm showed distinct charges allowing for the selective adsorption of anionic cationic dyes 2 experimental 2 1 materials

potentials the wettability of the ppy ssm can be altered between superhydrophilic and hydrophobic the redox potentials of ppy ssm were measured using the cyclic voltammetry technique the electrolyte has the same composition as the one used above except that it does not contain pyrrole ppy ssm and graphite sheet were used as working electrode and counter electrode with a saturated calomel electrode serving as the reference electrode the voltage was ranged from 0 8 to 0 3 v and scan velocity was 100 mv s the cyclic voltammetry curves of ppy ssm indicated that the oxidation and reduction potentials were 0 08 v and 0 19 v fig s2 therefore an electrochemical station was used to apply a negative potential 0 3 v or a positive potential 0 3 v for 10 min to obtain hydrophobic ppy ssm ppy ssm or superhydrophilic ppy ssm ppy ssm as shown in fig s3 the treated ppy ssm was then taken out of the station and dried at 60 c in an oven 2 3 emulsion separation 1 ml water 250 ml oil and 0 1 g span80 were mixed to make a water in oil emulsion stabilized by surfactant which was then treated for 12 h under agitation similarly the surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsion was obtained by stirring the mixture containing 1 ml oil 250 ml water and 0 1 g sds for 12 h six kinds of oils include isooctane toluene kerosene petroleum ether crude oil and lubricating oil were used in this preparation process the emulsions did not show stratification in 7 days fig s4 the emulsions were filtrated through the ppy ssm membrane by the homemade device fig s5 eq 1 was used to calculate the emulsion separation efficiency r 1 r 1 n f n o 100 where n f mg l denoted the dispersed phase concentrations in the filtrates and n o mg l represented the dispersed phase concentrations in the original emulsion eq 2 was used to compute the filtration flux 2 m v s t where v l was the volume of filtrate s m2 represented the effective filter area and t was the time of separation process 2 4 dye adsorption to make a dye solution deionized water was mixed with rhb or cgr 10 mg l the ppy ssm 2 0 2 0 cm was submerged in the aforementioned dye solution 50 ml and shaken for 12 h on a shaking table at a speed of 120 rpm to reach adsorption equilibrium the primary ph 3 10 of dye solution was adjusted with hcl or naoh solution eq 3 was applied to compute the membrane s dye rejection 34 3 w q 0 q e q 0 100 where q 0 and q e were the dye concentrations at the start of the experiment and at the end of the experiment respectively 2 5 durability test the durability of ppy ssm was tested under various corrosive conditions hcl naoh and nacl solution at the concentration of 1 m and different temperatures 60 c and 15 c specifically the ppy ssm and ppy ssm were immersed into various corrosive conditions for 5 days and then taken out washed and dried for the subsequent wettability characterization 2 6 characterization the surface structures were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su8220 japan the surface wettability was evaluated by adding 2 μl droplet on the surface and observed by powereach jc2000c1 apparatus chemical composition was determined using energy dispersive spectrometry eds attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir thermo fisher nicolet is10 usa and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps kratos axis dld uk was used to obtain atr ftir and xps spectra of the membrane a dynamic light scattering analyzer dls horiba sz 100 was introduced to compute the size distribution of emulsion droplet optical microscopy images were taken by bx53 microscope olympus japan a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2450 was used to estimate the amounts of cgr and rhb karl fischer titrator zsd 2 was used to determine the water content the electrochemical station chi660e was adapted to obtain the cyclic voltammetry curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface morphology sem was used to study the morphology of ssm before and after being coated with ultralong ppy nanowires the un coated ssm displayed a clean and smooth surface fig 1a no rough structure could be found on a single steel wire as for ppy ssm an interconnected ppy nanofibers porous network covered the ssm uniformly leading to reduced pore size fig 1b c moreover it was noted that each ppy nanofiber was composed of nano ppy particles which made the roughness of the ppy nanofibers increased fig 1d the corresponding elemental mappings of ppy ssm were shown in fig 1e the c n p s and o elements were distributed on the ppy ssm membrane suggesting the uniform ppy nanofibers on the surface of ssm it should be mentioned that the electrodeposition time has great effect on the growth of ppy nanofibers fig s6 when the electrodeposition time was 30 or 60 min the ppy nanofibers network on the surface of the ssm was too sparse which was unfavourable for emulsion separation fig s6a b in contrast as the electrodeposition time increased to 120 min and 180 min the ppy nanofibers were interlaced with each other uniformly and the pore size changed from micro 36 3 μm 50 μm 26 7 μm and 22 μm in fig s6a b to submicron 0 76 μm 0 58 μm and 0 87 μm in fig s6c d longer electrodeposition time will result in a thicker ppy layer which will drastically reduce filtrate flux therefore 120 min was selected as the most suitable electrodeposition time for the following preparation process of the ppy ssm 3 2 chemical composition the surface s functional groups were detected using atr ftir as can be seen from fig 2a no prominent absorption peak could be observed on the surface of ssm blue line as a comparison the adsorption peak of the ppy ssm red line at 1552 cm 1 was due to cc and cc stretching vibration of pyrrole ring as well as the adsorption bands at 858 and 927 cm 1 were assigned to ch 35 the adsorption peaks at 1398 and 3455 cm 1 were characteristic to be associated with ppy s cn and nh stretching the absorption bands at 673 and 1677 cm 1 were assigned to so3 and benzene rings of the doped β nsa 36 moreover phosphate doped in ppy nanofibers to serve as hydrogen bonding crosslinker during the reaction process 37 therefore the adsorption peaks at 962 1025 and 1081 cm 1 which are assigned to po4 3 of the pbs solution also can be found on the red spectrum curve 38 chemical compositions of the pristine ssm blue line and ppy ssm red line were analyzed by xps fig 2b the detailed xps analysis for atomic fraction was shown in table s1 the distinct peaks at 169 3 284 7 400 0 531 8 and 710 7 ev correspond to s 2p c 1s n 1s o 1s and fe 2p respectively compared with the ssm the peak intensity of c 1s s 2p and n 1s were stronger while the fe 2p and o 1s were weaker mainly because the ppy doped with β nsa covered on the ssm successfully fig 2c f were high resolution peak splitting spectra of c 1s n 1s o 1s and s 2p for ppy ssm for c 1s spectrum the main peak at 284 6 ev was attributed to α and β carbons in pyrrole rings and β nsa 39 40 the middle peak at 286 5 ev was fitted to pyrrole s cn and cs bond in the β nsa 41 the highest peak at 288 1 ev belonged to cn in the py ring 41 the n 1s spectrum exhibited three peaks at 398 4 399 7 and 401 2 ev which corresponded to the ppy s deprotonated imine nitrogen atoms n neutral nitrogen atoms nh and protonated nitrogen atoms nh 42 the o 1s signal was splitted into three peaks at 531 0 531 6 and 532 1 ev the lowest and the highest peak were attributed to hpo4 2 and h2po4 in the pbs while the middle peak was due to the so3 in the β nsa 41 the s 2p signal at 167 3 and 168 5 ev was attributed to the so3 in the β nsa 41 3 3 wettability the surface wettability of ppy ssm and ppy ssm was evaluated as a significant element in achieving oil water separation fig 3a showed the water droplet dyed with malachite green gradually spread over the surface of ppy ssm in the atmosphere and the water contact angle wca was 0 the ppy ssm also exhibited underwater superoleophobicity and the under water oil contact angle uwoca was 153 fig 3b the uwoca of various oil on the surface of ppy ssm were all larger than 150 fig 3g indicating its stable underwater superoleophobicity in general great underwater superoleophobicity favours the oil resistance performance as a result anti oil adhesion and underwater oil jet experiments were conducted to determine ppy ssm s antifouling performance as exhibited in fig 3c when a certain pressure was applied to the oil droplet taking dichloroethane as an example to contact the surface of ppy ssm and then lift it the oil could detach entirely from the surface with no oil left further a jet of oil isooctane with high speed was injected into the surface of ppy ssm fig 3d all the oil could bounce off the surface without any oily residue indicating its superior anti fouling property surprisingly the as prepared ppy ssm also showed great anti adhesion property for high viscous oil such as crude oil as can be seen from fig s7a a crude oil droplet could be forced to contact the surface of ppy ssm and then be lifted with no oil droplet retained similarly a crude oil bundle was injected onto the surface of the ppy ssm immersed in water and no oil droplets could be found on the ppy ssm fig s7b suggesting its excellent anti fouling property for high viscous oil unlike ppy ssm the water droplet colored with malachite green on the surface of ppy ssm could keep its spherical form and the wca in the air was 130 fig 3e indicating its hydrophobicity in the air moreover the ppy ssm also exhibited underoil superhydrophobicity and its water contact angles in a series of oils were all 150 fig 3f g by applying different redox potentials on the ppy ssm the wca can be tuned from 0 to 130 from superhydrophilic to hydrophobic in many runs it is defined to apply an oxidation potential and a reduction potential to the ppy ssm or ppy ssm as one cycle as can be seen from fig 3h both ppy ssm and ppy ssm can change their wettability at least 50 times as well as maintain their superwettability the excellent reversible electrochemical properties of ppy ssm are mainly due to the doping ion nsa can move in or out of the backbone of ppy by applying a reduction or oxidation voltage the durability of the wettability is critical for practical daily use therefore the wettability of ppy ssm and ppy ssm under harsh conditions had been systematically studied as can be seen from fig 4a the wcas in the air of ppy ssm and ppy ssm were 0 and 128 respectively in addition the uwocas of ppy ssm and underoil water contact angles uowcas of ppy ssm were all 150 fig 4b compared to the membrane before durability tests the wettability of the tested membrane had no noticeable change indicating their superior stability under various harsh conditions mechanical stability of ppy ssm and ppy ssm was tested by sand impact experiment water impact experiment and sandpaper abrasion experiment as shown in fig 5a both ppy ssm and ppy ssm could maintain their original wettability without significant reduction after being impacted by different mass of sand in a height of 15 cm similar results could also be found in the water impact experiment fig 5b the wca uwoca of ppy ssm and wca uowca of ppy ssm maintained a stable trend even after being impacted by water for 120 min in addition the results of sandpaper abrasion experiment indicated that after 30 cycles abrasion tests ppy ssm could keep superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity while ppy ssm could maintain hydrophobicity and underoil superhydrophobicity all these results had proved the robust mechanical stability of ppy ssm and ppy ssm 3 4 oil water emulsions separation combined with the suitable pore size and the electric responsive wettability the ppy ssm may be utilized to separate oil water emulsions on demand we separated various surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsions with superhydrophilic underwater superhydrophobic ppy ssm to explore its separation performance for example during the toluene in water t w emulsion separation process the ppy ssm could allow for water penetration while keeping toluene movie s1 digital images microscopic photographs and dls analysis of feed emulsion and filtrate could been seen in fig 6a the feed t w emulsion was opaque and milky with many oil droplets ranging in size from 2000 to 40 000 nm after separation by ppy ssm the filtrate became clear and transparent there were no apparent oil droplets in the filtrate according to the microscope photos the size distributions of the oil in the filtrate are undetectable indicating that the t w emulsion was successfully separated additionally the emulsions of kerosene in water petroleum ether in water and isooctane in water denoted as k w p w and i w have been investigated when compared to the milky feed emulsions all of the filtrates were clean as shown in fig 6b d the microscope images and dls results have also proved that most oil droplets have been removed and only nanometers signals could be detected in all the filtrate in addition the ppy ssm can also be used to separate oil in water emulsions prepared by high viscosity oil as can be seen from fig s8a both crude oil in water emulsion and lubricating oil in water emulsion were separated successfully and exhibited a huge difference from troubled liquor to the transparent water optical microscopy images revealed that there were lots of crude oil droplets and lubricating oil droplets in the feed emulsions while no oil droplets could be found in the collected filtrate the dls result also proved the effective removal of oil droplets fig s8b moreover the ppy ssm also showed a high separation efficiency 99 45 and a high filtration flux 1510 l m 2 h 1 for oil in water emulsions prepared by high viscosity oil fig s8c all these results show that the ppy ssm has great separation ability for different oil in water emulsions combined with the suitable pore size and the electric responsive wettability the ppy ssm may be utilized to separate oil water emulsions on demand we separated various surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsions with superhydrophilic underwater superhydrophobic ppy ssm to explore its separation performance for example during the toluene in water t w emulsion

and lubricating oil droplets in the feed emulsions while no oil droplets could be found in the collected filtrate the dls result also proved the effective removal of oil droplets fig s8b moreover the ppy ssm also showed a high separation efficiency 99 45 and a high filtration flux 1510 l m 2 h 1 for oil in water emulsions prepared by high viscosity oil fig s8c all these results show that the ppy ssm has great separation ability for different oil in water emulsions similarly ppy ssm was used to separate different water in oil emulsions the separation of w t emulsion was an example to study the separation performance movie s2 from the optical micrograph fig 6e we could find that the feed emulsion had a lot of small water droplets scattered throughout them but there were none in the filtrate further analysis of the water droplet size distribution revealed that the feed emulsion was dispersed with a broad range of microscale and nanoscale droplets but the filtrate droplet size distribution was restricted to a few nanometers these results indicated that the water droplets in the feed emulsions were removed triumphantly similar results can also be found in the emulsion separation process of water in kerosene w k water in petroleum ether w p and water in isooctane w i from fig 6f h similarly ppy ssm was used to separate different water in oil emulsions the separation of w t emulsion was an example to study the separation performance movie s2 from the optical micrograph fig 6e we could find that the feed emulsion had a lot of small water droplets scattered throughout them but there were none in the filtrate further analysis of the water droplet size distribution revealed that the feed emulsion was dispersed with a broad range of microscale and nanoscale droplets but the filtrate droplet size distribution was restricted to a few nanometers these results indicated that the water droplets in the feed emulsions were removed triumphantly similar results can also be found in the emulsion separation process of water in kerosene w k water in petroleum ether w p and water in isooctane w i from fig 6f h to manifest the superior separation performance of ppy ssm and ppy ssm the filtrate flux and separation efficiency were investigated fig 7a showed that the filtrate flux of oil in water emulsions separated by ppy ssm could reach 2084 l m 2 h 1 the oil contents of the filtrates were 18 ppm and the separation efficiency was up to 99 66 as for water in oil emulsions the filtration fluxes could reach 2984 l m 2 h 1 and the separation efficiencies of all emulsions were all higher than 98 97 i e water content in filtrate of all emulsions is 42 ppm fig 7b cycle t w and w t emulsion separation experiments were done to measure the reusability of ppy ssm and ppy ssm the separation efficiency and filtrate flux after 10 cycles usage can still maintain at 99 30 and 2100 l m 2 h 1 for ppy ssm and 99 28 and 2455 l m 2 h 1 for ppy ssm fig 7c d compared with a series of emulsion separation materials that can separate both oil in water and water in oil emulsions our ppy ssm has a significant improvement table s2 we explored the emulsion separation mechanism of ppy ssm and ppy ssm fig 8 as seen in fig 8a when ppy ssm was in contact with oil in water emulsions a strong attraction between ppy ssm sulfonic acid group and water resulted in the creation of a hydration layer resulting in ppy ssm s underwater superoleophobicity because of the poor oil adhesion qualities the emulsified oil droplets will readily roll over the surface fig 3c in this way the water phase may penetrate while the agglomerated big oil droplets were trapped on the surface of ppy ssm forming a filter cake which could block the membrane s pore and intercept the oil droplet with a size smaller than the membrane pores 43 44 fig 8b illustrates a similar separation procedure for a water in oil emulsion of ppy ssm 3 5 dyes adsorption the ppy ssm can be also used for dyes adsorption in wastewater the ph of the dye solution is critical since it influences the adsorbent s surface charge and adsorption capacity 45 47 fig 9a showed that the zeta potential of ppy ssm was positively charged at ph between 3 and 4 and negatively charged when ph was between 5 and 10 making it potential for selective dyes adsorption via electrostatic interaction therefore the anionic cgr dye and cationic rhb dye were adopted for the dyes adsorption tests under different ph of the dye solution the dyes removal efficiency was investigated fig 9b when the ph value was 3 cgr had a substantially greater dye removal effectiveness than rhb however at ph values of 5 7 and 9 ppy ssm outperformed cgr in terms of rhb removal efficiency moreover the photographs and uv vis spectrum of cgr dye solution ph 4 and rhb dye solution ph 8 before and after adsorption were shown in fig 9c d after being adsorbed by ppy ssm both the red cgr solution and the purple rhb solution turned colourless and the uv vis spectrum showed that the dye concentration was almost negligible in addition the ppy ssm could desorb the adsorbed dyes and exhibited excellent recyclability as can be seen from fig s9a after being adsorbed by ppy ssm the rhb solution turned transparent then the ppy ssm was soaked in hcl solution with a ph of 4 for 12 h the colourless hcl solution turned purple indicating the successful desorption of rhb as shown in fig s9b a similar desorption process of cgr could be achieved when the ppy ssm that has adsorbed the cgr was immersed in a naoh solution ph 8 after the desorption process the ppy ssm was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 c and then used for the cyclic adsorption desorption experiments the adsorption ability of ppy ssm for cgr and rhb was still higher than 94 after 7 cycles of usage fig s9c the slight decrease in adsorption efficiency is mainly due to the incomplete desorption of the adsorbed dyes resulting in several adsorption sites being occupied the abovementioned results demonstrated that the majority of the dye removal was facilitated by the attractive electrostatic interaction between the charged ppy ssm and dye molecules in addition when the ppy ssm and the dye molecules had the same charge the dye removal efficiency was not zero indicating that the electrostatic adsorption was not the only way to remove the dye the π π stacking interaction between the aromatic rings of cgr and rhb and the aromatic rings of ppy also contributes to the dye adsorption 48 4 conclusion in summary a multifunctional ppy ssm was successfully fabricated by the facile electrodeposition method the as prepared membrane can be conveniently switched between superhydrophilicity and hydrophobicity underwater superhydrophobicity and underoil superhydrophobicity the resulted membrane showed remarkable stability and could maintain its superwettability under various severe conditions importantly the ppy ssm could easily separate various oil in water and water in oil emulsions stabilized by surfactant under gravity in terms of a filtrate fluxes of up to 2084 2984 l m 2 h 1 and separation efficiency up to 99 66 99 74 besides owing to the synergistic impact of electrostatic and π π stacking interactions the as prepared ppy ssm also exhibited excellent dye adsorption efficiency 99 under suitable ph conditions therefore the ppy ssm can be practically used for the treatment of oily water and dyes the following are the supplementary data related to this article supplementary material supplementary material supplementary

12792,herein an ultralong polypyrrole nanowires coated stainless steel mesh ppy ssm was successfully prepared to cope with the on demand separation of oil water emulsions as well as dyes adsorption via electrodeposition the as prepared ppy ssm could be switched from superhydrophilic to hydrophobic under electric field for at least 50 times benefiting from the high porosity and its selective wettability the ppy ssm exhibited excellent separation efficiency of up to 99 88 and high filtration flux of up to 2984 l m 2 h 1 for both oil in water and water in oil emulsions even for the high viscous crude oil in water emulsion thanks to the surface charge abundant aromatic rings of ppy and porous structure ppy ssm also achieved selective adsorption of cationic or anionic dyes with high efficiency up to 99 28 under diverse ph conditions moreover the ppy ssm also displayed a strong chemical resistance and mechanical stability under harsh conditions such as extreme temperature corrosive environments and various friction tests combined with a simple and environmental friendly fabrication process the high performance membrane ppy ssm has promising applications in the separation of oil water emulsions and the adsorption of dyes keywords polypyrrole nanowires switchable wettability electrodeposition oil water emulsion separation dyes adsorption 1 introduction water pollution caused by oil and organic dyes is now a worldwide concern as a result of fast industrialization 1 6 the excessive discharge of oily wastewater containing dyes endangers the ecological environment and human health because they are toxic and demanding to be biodegraded 7 9 various multifunctional superwetting materials such as sponge 10 12 membrane 13 15 aerogel 16 17 and so forth 18 19 have been developed and used throughout the years to meet the difficulty of treating wastewater that is contaminated with oil and dye the widely accepted strategy is fabricating a filtration material loaded with photocatalyst e g tio2 20 zno 21 and metal organic framework 22 24 because of their selective affinities toward oil and water and strong oxidative free radicals generated by light irradiation these materials can be applied to purify oil water emulsions and dyed wastewater however the limited catalytic activity sites and short wavelength absorption in the ultraviolet region prevent their further industrial applications alternatively adsorption as a convenient and cost effective method has also made tremendous progress in dyed wastewater purification 11 17 however the majority of these adsorption materials can deal with only one kind of oil water emulsion or dye therefore it is urgent to develop a multifunctional material aimed at complicated working conditions conducting polymer such as polypyrrole ppy exhibits excellent reversibly switchable wettability by electricity indicating that they could be utilized to separate water and oil as required 25 28 moreover ppy also possesses numerous adsorption sites compared to photocatalytic materials 29 these advantages bestow upon ppy the promising multifunctional material for water pollution treatment such as oil water separation and dyes adsorption 30 33 although tremendous progress has been made there are still several problems with these ppy based materials most of these materials fail to separate oil water emulsions to address this dilemma guo et al 32 developed a ppy nanoparticles coated stainless steel mesh with underwater superoleophobicity the pore size could be accurately adjusted to realize oil water emulsion separation by increasing the cyclic voltammetry number albeit at the expense of filtration flux in addition these ppy nanoparticles loaded materials possess a relatively low specific area because of the agglomeration of nanoparticles which may result in their low dyes adsorption capacity therefore the key is to increase the specific surface area as much as possible without blocking the of the membrane s pores so as to receive high filtration flux as well as high efficiency herein a simple and ecologically friendly strategy is demonstrated to make ultralong ppy nanowires coated stainless steel mesh ppy ssm with high surface area and high porosity using the electrodeposition method scheme 1 the surface wettability of ppy ssm could be facile turned from superhydrophilic to hydrophobic under electric field combined with the suitable pore size and high porosity the developed ppy ssm was capable of efficiently separating oil in water and water in oil emulsions under gravity with a satisfactory filtration flux and separation efficiency various stability experiments indicated that the as prepared membrane had a superb stability in harsh environments for practical application furthermore at various ph settings the surface of ppy ssm showed distinct charges allowing for the selective adsorption of anionic cationic dyes 2 experimental 2 1 materials pyrrole β naphthalenesulfonic β nsa na2hpo4 nah2po4 and congo red cgr were obtained from macklin reagent co ltd anhydrous alcohol isooctane 1 2 dichloroethane petroleum ether and toluene were

green and rhodamine b rhb were provided by shanghai aladdin chemistry 2 2 fabrication of ultralong polypyrrole nanowires coated ssm ppy ssm the ultralong polypyrrole nanowires were coated on the ssm through electrochemical polymerization first the ssm 3 0 4 0 cm was rinsed with acetone ethanol hcl and water for 30 min respectively the fabrication process of ppy ssm was performed with a two electrode anodization reaction as shown in fig s1 in detail the ultralong ppy nanowires were deposited galvanostatically on smooth ssm at 1 ma cm2 for different time the anode ppy ssm and cathode graphite plate were 3 cm apart the electrolyte was a phosphate buffer solution pbs 0 5 m ph 6 8 containing 0 2 m pyrrole and 0 01 m β nsa then the ppy ssm was dried at 65 c by applying different redox potentials the wettability of the ppy ssm can be altered between superhydrophilic and hydrophobic the redox potentials of ppy ssm were measured using the cyclic voltammetry technique the electrolyte has the same composition as the one used above except that it does not contain pyrrole ppy ssm and graphite sheet were used as working electrode and counter electrode with a saturated calomel electrode serving as the reference electrode the voltage was ranged from 0 8 to 0 3 v and scan velocity was 100 mv s the cyclic voltammetry curves of ppy ssm indicated that the oxidation and reduction potentials were 0 08 v and 0 19 v fig s2 therefore an electrochemical station was used to apply a negative potential 0 3 v or a positive potential 0 3 v for 10 min to obtain hydrophobic ppy ssm ppy ssm or superhydrophilic ppy ssm ppy ssm as shown in fig s3 the treated ppy ssm was then taken out of the station and dried at 60 c in an oven 2 3 emulsion separation 1 ml water 250 ml oil and 0 1 g span80 were mixed to make a water in oil emulsion stabilized by surfactant which was then treated for 12 h under agitation similarly the surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsion was obtained by stirring the mixture containing 1 ml oil 250 ml water and 0 1 g sds for 12 h six kinds of oils include isooctane toluene kerosene petroleum ether crude oil and lubricating oil were used in this preparation process the emulsions did not show stratification in 7 days fig s4 the emulsions were filtrated through the ppy ssm membrane by the homemade device fig s5 eq 1 was used to calculate the emulsion separation efficiency r 1 r 1 n f n o 100 where n f mg l denoted the dispersed phase concentrations in the filtrates and n o mg l represented the dispersed phase concentrations in the original emulsion eq 2 was used to compute the filtration flux 2 m v s t where v l was the volume of filtrate s m2 represented the effective filter area and t was the time of separation process 2 4 dye adsorption to make a dye solution deionized water was mixed with rhb or cgr 10 mg l the ppy ssm 2 0 2 0 cm was submerged in the aforementioned dye solution 50 ml and shaken for 12 h on a shaking table at a speed of 120 rpm to reach adsorption equilibrium the primary ph 3 10 of dye solution was adjusted with hcl or naoh solution eq 3 was applied to compute the membrane s dye rejection 34 3 w q 0 q e q 0 100 where q 0 and q e were the dye concentrations at the start of the experiment and at the end of the experiment respectively 2 5 durability test the durability of ppy ssm was tested under various corrosive conditions hcl naoh and nacl solution at the concentration of 1 m and different temperatures 60 c and 15 c specifically the ppy ssm and ppy ssm were immersed into various corrosive conditions for 5 days and then taken out washed and dried for the subsequent wettability characterization 2 6 characterization the surface structures were observed using field emission scanning

was used to determine the water content the electrochemical station chi660e was adapted to obtain the cyclic voltammetry curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface morphology sem was used to study the morphology of ssm before and after being coated with ultralong ppy nanowires the un coated ssm displayed a clean and smooth surface fig 1a no rough structure could be found on a single steel wire as for ppy ssm an interconnected ppy nanofibers porous network covered the ssm uniformly leading to reduced pore size fig 1b c moreover it was noted that each ppy nanofiber was composed of nano ppy particles which made the roughness of the ppy nanofibers increased fig 1d the corresponding elemental mappings of ppy ssm were shown in fig 1e the c n p s and o elements were distributed on the ppy ssm membrane suggesting the uniform ppy nanofibers on the surface of ssm it should be mentioned that the electrodeposition time has great effect on the growth of ppy nanofibers fig s6 when the electrodeposition time was 30 or 60 min the ppy nanofibers network on the surface of the ssm was too sparse which was unfavourable for emulsion separation fig s6a b in contrast as the electrodeposition time increased to 120 min and 180 min the ppy nanofibers were interlaced with each other uniformly and the pore size changed from micro 36 3 μm 50 μm 26 7 μm and 22 μm in fig s6a b to submicron 0 76 μm 0 58 μm and 0 87 μm in fig s6c d longer electrodeposition time will result in a thicker ppy layer which will drastically reduce filtrate flux therefore 120 min was selected as the most suitable electrodeposition time for the following preparation process of the ppy ssm 3 2 chemical composition the surface s functional groups were detected using atr ftir as can be seen from fig 2a no prominent absorption peak could be observed on the surface of ssm blue line as a comparison the adsorption peak of the ppy ssm red line at 1552 cm 1 was due to cc and cc stretching vibration of pyrrole ring as well as the adsorption bands at 858 and 927 cm 1 were assigned to ch 35 the adsorption peaks at 1398 and 3455 cm 1 were characteristic to be associated with ppy s cn and nh stretching the absorption bands at 673 and 1677 cm 1 were assigned to so3 and benzene rings of the doped β nsa 36 moreover phosphate doped in ppy nanofibers to serve as hydrogen bonding crosslinker during the reaction process 37 therefore the adsorption peaks at 962 1025 and 1081 cm 1 which are assigned to po4 3 of the pbs solution also can be found on the red spectrum curve 38 chemical compositions of the pristine ssm blue line and ppy ssm red line were analyzed by xps fig 2b the detailed xps analysis for atomic fraction was shown in table s1 the distinct peaks at 169 3 284 7 400 0 531 8 and 710 7 ev correspond to s 2p c 1s n 1s o 1s and fe 2p respectively compared with the ssm the peak intensity of c 1s s 2p and n 1s were stronger while the fe 2p and o 1s were weaker mainly because the ppy doped with β nsa covered on the ssm successfully fig 2c f were high resolution peak splitting spectra of c 1s n 1s o 1s and s 2p for ppy ssm for c 1s spectrum the main peak at 284 6 ev was attributed to α and β carbons in pyrrole rings and β nsa 39 40 the middle peak at 286 5 ev was fitted to pyrrole s cn and cs bond in the β nsa 41 the highest peak at 288 1 ev belonged to cn in the py ring 41 the n 1s spectrum exhibited three peaks at 398 4 399 7 and 401 2 ev which corresponded to the ppy s deprotonated imine nitrogen atoms n neutral nitrogen atoms nh and protonated nitrogen atoms nh 42 the o 1s signal was splitted into three peaks at 531 0 531 6 and 532 1 ev the lowest and the highest peak were attributed to hpo4 2 and h2po4 in the pbs while the middle peak was due to the so3 in the β nsa 41 the s 2p signal at 167 3 and 168 5 ev was attributed to the so3 in the β nsa 41 3 3 wettability the surface wettability of ppy ssm and ppy ssm was evaluated as a significant element in achieving oil water separation fig 3a showed the water droplet dyed with malachite green gradually spread over the surface of ppy ssm in the atmosphere and the water contact angle wca was 0 the ppy ssm also exhibited underwater superoleophobicity and the under water oil contact angle uwoca was 153 fig 3b the uwoca of various oil on the surface of ppy ssm were all larger than 150 fig 3g indicating its stable underwater superoleophobicity in general great underwater superoleophobicity favours the oil resistance performance as a result anti oil adhesion and underwater oil jet experiments were conducted to determine ppy ssm s antifouling performance as exhibited in fig 3c when a certain pressure was applied to the oil droplet taking dichloroethane as an example to contact the surface of ppy ssm and then lift it the oil could detach entirely from the surface with no oil left further a jet of oil isooctane with high speed was injected into the surface of ppy ssm fig 3d all the oil could bounce off the surface without any oily residue indicating its superior anti fouling property surprisingly the as prepared ppy ssm also showed great anti adhesion property for high viscous oil such as crude oil as can be seen from fig s7a a crude oil droplet could be forced to contact the surface of ppy ssm and then be lifted with no oil droplet retained similarly a crude oil bundle was injected onto the surface of the ppy ssm immersed in water and no oil droplets could be found on the ppy ssm fig s7b suggesting its excellent anti fouling property for high viscous oil unlike ppy ssm the water droplet colored with malachite green on the surface of ppy ssm could keep its spherical form and the wca in the air was 130 fig 3e indicating its hydrophobicity in the air moreover the ppy ssm also exhibited underoil superhydrophobicity and its water contact angles in a series of oils were all 150 fig 3f g by applying different redox potentials on the ppy ssm the wca can be tuned from 0 to 130 from superhydrophilic to hydrophobic in many runs it is defined to apply an oxidation potential and a reduction potential to the ppy ssm or ppy ssm as one cycle as can be seen from fig 3h both ppy ssm and ppy ssm can change their wettability at least 50 times as well as maintain their superwettability the excellent reversible electrochemical properties of ppy ssm are mainly due to the doping ion nsa can move in or out of the backbone of ppy by applying a reduction or oxidation voltage the durability of the wettability is critical for practical daily use therefore the wettability of ppy ssm and ppy ssm under harsh conditions had been systematically studied as can be seen from fig 4a the wcas in the air of ppy ssm and ppy ssm were 0 and 128 respectively in addition the uwocas of ppy ssm and underoil water contact angles uowcas of ppy ssm were all 150 fig 4b compared to the membrane before durability tests the wettability of the tested membrane had no noticeable change indicating their superior stability under various harsh conditions mechanical stability of ppy ssm and ppy ssm was tested by sand impact experiment water impact experiment and sandpaper abrasion experiment as shown in fig 5a both ppy ssm and ppy ssm could maintain their original wettability without significant reduction after being impacted by different mass of sand in a height of 15 cm similar results could also be found in the water impact experiment fig 5b the wca uwoca of ppy ssm and wca uowca of ppy ssm maintained a stable trend even after being impacted by water for 120 min in addition the results of sandpaper abrasion experiment indicated that after 30 cycles abrasion tests ppy ssm could keep superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity while ppy ssm could maintain hydrophobicity and underoil superhydrophobicity all these results had proved the robust mechanical stability of ppy ssm and ppy ssm 3 4 oil water emulsions separation combined with the suitable pore size and the electric responsive wettability the ppy ssm may be utilized to separate oil water emulsions on demand we separated various surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsions with superhydrophilic underwater superhydrophobic ppy ssm to explore its separation performance for example during the toluene in water t w emulsion separation process the ppy ssm could allow for water penetration while keeping toluene movie s1 digital images microscopic photographs and dls analysis of feed emulsion and filtrate could been seen in fig 6a the feed t w emulsion was opaque and milky with many oil droplets ranging in size from 2000 to 40 000 nm after separation by ppy ssm the filtrate became clear and transparent there were no apparent oil droplets in the filtrate according to the microscope photos the size distributions of the oil in the filtrate are undetectable indicating that the t w emulsion was successfully separated additionally the emulsions of kerosene in water petroleum ether in water and isooctane in water denoted as k w p w and i w have been investigated when compared to the milky feed emulsions all of the filtrates were clean as shown in fig 6b d the microscope images and dls results have also proved that most oil droplets have been removed and only nanometers signals could be detected in all the filtrate in addition the ppy ssm can also be used to separate oil in water emulsions prepared by high viscosity oil as can be seen from fig s8a both crude oil in water emulsion and lubricating oil in water emulsion were separated successfully and exhibited a huge difference from troubled liquor to the transparent water optical microscopy images revealed that there were lots of crude oil droplets and lubricating oil droplets in the feed emulsions while no oil droplets could be found in the collected filtrate the dls result also proved the effective removal of oil droplets fig s8b moreover the ppy ssm also showed a high separation efficiency 99 45 and a high filtration flux 1510 l m 2 h 1 for oil in water emulsions prepared by high viscosity oil fig s8c all these results show that the ppy ssm has great separation ability for different oil in water emulsions combined with the suitable pore size and the electric responsive wettability the ppy ssm may be utilized to separate oil water emulsions on demand we separated various surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsions with superhydrophilic underwater superhydrophobic ppy ssm to explore its separation performance for example during the toluene in water t w emulsion

ppy ssm also showed a high separation efficiency 99 45 and a high filtration flux 1510 l m 2 h 1 for oil in water emulsions prepared by high viscosity oil fig s8c all these results show that the ppy ssm has great separation ability for different oil in water emulsions similarly ppy ssm was used to separate different water in oil emulsions the separation of w t emulsion was an example to study the separation performance movie s2 from the optical micrograph fig 6e we could find that the feed emulsion had a lot of small water droplets scattered throughout them but there were none in the filtrate further analysis of the water droplet size distribution revealed that the feed emulsion was dispersed with a broad range of microscale and nanoscale droplets but the filtrate droplet size distribution was restricted to a few nanometers these results indicated that the water droplets in the feed emulsions were removed triumphantly similar results can also be found in the emulsion separation process of water in kerosene w k water in petroleum ether w p and water in isooctane w i from fig 6f h similarly ppy ssm was used to separate different water in oil emulsions the separation of w t emulsion was an example to study the separation performance movie s2 from the optical micrograph fig 6e we could find that the feed emulsion had a lot of small water droplets scattered throughout them but there were none in the filtrate further analysis of the water droplet size distribution revealed that the feed emulsion was dispersed with a broad range of microscale and nanoscale droplets but the filtrate droplet size distribution was restricted to a few nanometers these results indicated that the water droplets in the feed emulsions were removed triumphantly similar results can also be found in the emulsion separation process of water in kerosene w k water in petroleum ether w p and water in isooctane w i from fig 6f h to manifest the superior separation performance of ppy ssm and ppy ssm the filtrate flux and separation efficiency were investigated fig 7a showed that the filtrate flux of oil in water emulsions separated by ppy ssm could reach 2084 l m 2 h 1 the oil contents of the filtrates were 18 ppm and the separation efficiency was up to 99 66 as for water in oil emulsions the filtration fluxes could reach 2984 l m 2 h 1 and the separation efficiencies of all emulsions were all higher than 98 97 i e water content in filtrate of all emulsions is 42 ppm fig 7b cycle t w and w t emulsion separation experiments were done to measure the reusability of ppy ssm and ppy ssm the separation efficiency and filtrate flux after 10 cycles usage can still maintain at 99 30 and 2100 l m 2 h 1 for ppy ssm and 99 28 and 2455 l m 2 h 1 for ppy ssm fig 7c d compared with a series of emulsion separation materials that can separate both oil in water and water in oil emulsions our ppy ssm has a significant improvement table s2 we explored the emulsion separation mechanism of ppy ssm and ppy ssm fig 8 as seen in fig 8a when ppy ssm was in contact with oil in water emulsions a strong attraction between ppy ssm sulfonic acid group and water resulted in the creation of a hydration layer resulting in ppy ssm s underwater superoleophobicity because of the poor oil adhesion qualities the emulsified oil droplets will readily roll over the surface fig 3c in this way the water phase may penetrate while the agglomerated big oil droplets were trapped on the surface of ppy ssm forming a filter cake which could block the membrane s pore and intercept the oil droplet with a size smaller than the membrane pores 43 44 fig 8b illustrates a similar separation procedure for a water in oil emulsion of ppy ssm 3 5 dyes adsorption the ppy ssm can be also used for dyes adsorption in wastewater the ph of the dye solution is critical since it influences the adsorbent s surface charge and adsorption capacity 45 47 fig 9a showed that the zeta potential of ppy ssm was positively charged at ph between 3 and 4 and negatively charged when ph was between 5 and 10 making it potential for selective dyes adsorption via electrostatic interaction therefore the anionic cgr dye and cationic rhb dye were adopted for the dyes adsorption tests under different ph of the dye solution the dyes removal efficiency was investigated fig 9b when the ph value was 3 cgr had a substantially greater dye removal effectiveness than rhb however at ph values of 5 7 and 9 ppy ssm outperformed cgr in terms of rhb removal efficiency moreover the photographs and uv vis spectrum of cgr dye solution ph 4 and rhb dye solution ph 8 before and after adsorption were shown in fig 9c d after being adsorbed by ppy ssm both the red cgr solution and the purple rhb solution turned colourless and the uv vis spectrum showed that the dye concentration was almost negligible in addition the ppy ssm could desorb the adsorbed dyes and exhibited excellent recyclability as can be seen from fig s9a after being adsorbed by ppy ssm the rhb solution turned transparent then the ppy ssm was soaked in hcl solution with a ph of 4 for 12 h the colourless hcl solution turned purple indicating the successful desorption of rhb as shown in fig s9b a similar desorption process of cgr could be achieved when the ppy ssm that has adsorbed the cgr was immersed in a naoh solution ph 8 after the desorption process the ppy ssm was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 c and then used for the cyclic adsorption desorption experiments the adsorption ability of ppy ssm for cgr and rhb was still higher than 94 after 7 cycles of usage fig s9c the slight decrease in adsorption efficiency is mainly due to the incomplete desorption of the adsorbed dyes resulting in several adsorption sites being occupied the abovementioned results demonstrated that the majority of the dye removal was facilitated by the attractive electrostatic interaction between the charged ppy ssm and dye molecules in addition when the ppy ssm and the dye molecules had the same charge the dye removal efficiency was not zero indicating that the electrostatic adsorption was not the only way to remove the dye the π π stacking interaction between the aromatic rings of cgr and rhb and the aromatic rings of ppy also contributes to the dye adsorption 48 4 conclusion in summary a multifunctional ppy ssm was successfully fabricated by the facile electrodeposition method the as prepared membrane can be conveniently switched between superhydrophilicity and hydrophobicity underwater superhydrophobicity and underoil superhydrophobicity the resulted membrane showed remarkable stability and could maintain its superwettability under various severe conditions importantly the ppy ssm could easily separate various oil in water and water in oil emulsions stabilized by surfactant under gravity in terms of a filtrate fluxes of up to 2084 2984 l m 2 h 1 and separation efficiency up to 99 66 99 74 besides owing to the synergistic impact of electrostatic and π π stacking interactions the as prepared ppy ssm also exhibited excellent dye adsorption efficiency 99 under suitable ph conditions therefore the ppy ssm can be practically used for the treatment of oily water and dyes the following are the supplementary data related to this article supplementary material supplementary material supplementary

12793,the anammox hap coupling process can simultaneously achieve high efficiency nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery from sewage the composition and physical properties of the byproducts ahap collected in the anammox hap process were analyzed in addition the application potential and mechanisms for cd ii adsorption by ahap in wastewater were investigated the results show that ahap is mainly composed of hydroxyapatite and calcium carbonate having granular structure with honeycombs and pores the ahap shows an adsorption capacity of 21 10 34 80 mg g for cd ii removal and the adsorption behavior is consistent with pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models showing that the rate limiting step is controlled by the chemical reaction of surface complexation ion exchange and precipitation in addition the remaining anammox biomass in ahap can bind cd ii the ahap also shows a ph buffer capacity when the initial ph ranges between 4 10 and 8 46 and the final ph can be stabilized in the range of 6 3 to 8 3 which is suitable for anammox reactions collectively the anammox hap coupling process can not only be used to achieve high efficiency nitrogen and phosphorus removal but its ahap byproduct shows good adsorption properties and ph buffering capacity which meets the requirements of green chemistry and has high economic and environmental benefits

extracellular polymers r2 correlation coefficients keywords anammox hydroxyapatite cd ii adsorption ph buffer adsorption mechanism 1 introduction excessive emission of nitrogen and phosphorus is the main reason for eutrophication of water bodies which will cause algae blooms and destroy the aquatic ecosystem 1 in addition phosphorus is a biologically essential element and nonrenewable resource with global phosphorus demand estimated to exceed supply by 2035 2 approximately 1 3 mt of phosphorus is treated in sewage plants worldwide each year making sewage a potential second source of phosphorus 3 chemical precipitation and induced crystallization are widely used in wastewater treatment plants for phosphorus recovery while these recovery efficiency and process cost are affected by temperature stirring rate reaction time and seed crystals which need to be precisely controlled 4 therefore it is important to develop new processes that can remove nitrogen and recover phosphorus efficiently during water treatment to solve the problem of water pollution and phosphorus crisis in recent years there have been biological induction processes for hydroxyapatite hap in different granular sludge of activated sludge systems and minerals with hap dominant phase have been observed without additional control 5 7 anammox is a new type of biological nitrogen removal process developed in the 1990s 8 compared with the traditional biological denitrification and phosphorus removal process the anammox process requires low aeration low sludge output and low operating cost 9 in the anammox reaction a local alkaline environment is formed which is conducive to hap crystallization the anammox hap coupling process can efficiently remove nitrogen and recover the phosphorus resources in sewage in the form of hydroxyapatite 7 due to its good physics and adsorption properties hap is used as an adsorption material in the treatment of heavy metal wastewater 10 with the rapid development of urbanization and industry the removal of heavy metals from water has become an important environmental issue 11 cadmium has been classified as a human carcinogen and teratogenic affecting lungs kidneys liver and genitalia 12 the ca2 in hap can be substituted with heavy metal ions through ion exchange and surface complexation and the hydroxyl group on the hap surface can be used as an active site for the adsorption material of heavy metal ions in industrial production hap is an important raw material for the production of phosphorus slow release fertilizers and other phosphorus chemical products 13 hap has become a good environmentally functional material due to its biocompatibility calcium replaceability photocatalytic properties and other properties 14 at present chemical methods are commonly used to prepare hap but the cost is high in this study the byproducts of the anammox hap process ahap were recovered from the anammox hap reactor the microstructure and material composition of ahap was analyzed by means of characterization an adsorption experiment for cd ii is used to prove the adsorption capacity of ahap the effect of residual

microstructures of ahap and nhap are shown in fig 1 the ahap recovered from the anammox hap coupling process is composed of gray brown particles with a particle size of 0 1 0 5 cm nhap is composed of white powder with a particle size of 100 nm comparing fig 1c and d it can be found that nhap presents flake crystals without an obvious pore structure while ahap is granular fig 1 a honeycomb and pore structures can be observed on the surface of ahap fig 1 c the formation of honeycomb and pore structures are mainly driven by the growth of anaob and the production of dinitrogen 16 under the effects of mass transfer and shear force of water flow the anammox hap coupling granules present a spherical shape with hap as the core and anaob as the biofilm 17 there is much residual anammox biomass in ahap which is composed of anaob and extracellular polymers eps fig 1e the xrd and ftir patterns of ahap are shown in fig 2 the results show that ahap is mainly composed of ca10 oh 2 po4 6 ca5 po4 3 oh and caco3 fig 2 a that shows that the anammox hap coupling process can recover phosphorus from sewage in the form of hap the formula for ca10 oh 2 po4 6 formation is given as follows 18 9 10 c a 2 6 p o 4 3 2 o h c a 10 p o 4 6 oh 2 ca3co3 is produced during the formation of ahap this is because the sewage contains ca2 seed crystals and hco3 inorganic carbon source as anammox progresses the ph of the solution rises and caco3 precipitates finally the calcium carbonate in ahap has a buffering effect keeping the ph in a range suitable for the growth of anaob within a certain range 19 the ftir spectra for ahap and nhap are compared fig 2 b the absorption peaks for ahap and nhap are relatively consistent the vibration peak of oh is located at 3445 cm 1 the asymmetric stretching vibration peaks of ch3 appear at 2990 5 cm 1 and 2950 5 cm 1 20 the vibration peak of h2o is located at 1643 cm 1 21 the vibration peak of co3 2 is located at 1427 cm 1 and the absorption peak at 1060 cm 1 may be due to the coh stretching vibration and the coc asymmetric stretching vibration in the polysaccharide 22 the asymmetric stretching vibration peak of po4 3 is located at 1043 cm 1 the stretching vibration peak of po4 3 is located at 563 cm 1 and 604 cm 1 16 the absorption peak of the cooh functional group is located at 867 cm 1 23 the results show that ahap and nhap both contain functional groups such as oh and po4 3 and ahap contains external functional groups such as coc and cooh the coc and oh functional groups in monosaccharides can play important roles in the process of binding to cd ii 22 24 3 2 ph influence on adsorption behavior of ahap the ph value of the solution is a critical parameter that can affect the adsorption process the form of hap in solution and the anammox reaction the effect of ph on cd ii adsorption and phosphorus release from ahap is shown in fig 3 fig 3 a shows that when the initial ph ranges between 4 10 and 8 46 the ph will remain at approximately 8 3 after the adsorption is complete and we call this initial ph range the ph buffer zone the ph buffering ability of hap has been found in previous studies and the starting point of ph buffering is always approximately 4 but the final ph through buffering is different the ph value obtained in other studies is approximately 5 8 or 7 4 25 26 in our study the final ph value through buffering is found to be approximately 8 3 this is because the hap formed by our reactor contains more caco3 when the initial ph is 4 10 the final ph increases with the initial ph increasing because of the dissolution of caco3 and hap eqs 10 and 11 under acidic condition we found that when the initial ph decreases from 4 10 to 1 15 the phosphorus release increases from 0 84 mg g to 103 00 mg g fig 3 b indicating dissolution the adsorption capacity of cd ii sharply increased from 0 37 to 8 65 mg g with the increase of ph from 1 15 to 1 87 and when ph 1 87 the adsorption capacity of cd ii basically remains at 8 58 8 67 mg g this is because h can occupy the active sites on the ahap surface in a strong acid environment which weakens the adsorption effect of cd ii the hydroxyl on the surface undergoes protonation with h resulting in the surface of the adsorbent being positively charged and repelling cd ii 27 when the ph rises cd ii dominates the competition of adsorption potential and the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent increases eqs 12 and 13 the ph of the solution increases with the complexation of cd ii with the surface hydroxyl group 10 ca co 3 2 h ca 2 h 2 o co 2 11 ca 10 p o

formation is favorable under alkaline conditions therefore when the influent ph is controlled to range between 4 10 and 8 46 a stable anammox reaction and phosphorus recovery with ahap as the main product can be achieved ahap can achieve a relatively high cd ii adsorption capacity over a wide ph range with little effect of the influent ph therefore it has a good buffer capacity for application 3 3 adsorption kinetics and isothermals to understand the adsorption process and determine the leading factors for the adsorption reaction kinetic and thermodynamic experiments were designed the kinetic process for the adsorption of cd ii by ahap is shown in fig 4 fig 4 a shows that a rapid adsorption of cd ii occurs within the first 50 min followed by a slow adsorption until the adsorbed cd ii reaches the equilibrium value at the beginning of the adsorption reaction there are many active sites on the hap surface which is conducive to adsorption as the reaction progresses the cd ii in the solution is gradually adsorbed and the number of active sites on the ahap surface also gradually decrease due to the adsorption of cd ii resulting in a decrease in the adsorption rate until equilibrium is gradually reached the adsorption kinetics parameters and correlation coefficients r2 calculated from the three models are listed in table 1 it is found that the values of r2 for the pseudo first order kinetic model are relatively low which indicates that the pseudo first order kinetic model cannot adequately describe the adsorption of cd ii onto ahap the pseudo second order kinetic model is more in line with the adsorption process for cd ii and the calculated qe values agree very well with the experimental values showing good linearity with r2 above 0 99 this result suggests that the rate limiting step in adsorption is controlled by chemical processes in previous studies hap adsorption of cd ii can be divided into ion exchange surface complexation dissolution of hap and precipitation 29 30 it can be found in the fitting curve for intra particle diffusion that the adsorption of cd ii by ahap is bilinear indicating that the adsorption process can be divided into two stages fig 4 d in the first stage cd ii rapidly diffuses to the surface of ahap within 90 min after that the adsorption rate decreases and adsorption lasts longer suggesting that intra particle diffusion is the limiting step for adsorption if the fitted curve passes through the origin it indicates that diffusion within the particle is the only rate control step otherwise it suggests that the adsorption process is also affected by boundary layer diffusion 31 all the trend lines under the conditions of 50 100 150 mg l cd ii do not pass through the origin indicating that the adsorption process may be affected by factors such as surface diffusion and particle internal diffusion this is consistent with the whole adsorption process for cd ii by normal hap which is divided into two steps 30 32 i cd ii can be adsorbed at the hap surface ii cd ii diffuses into hap and step ii is the rate limiting step in this study langmuir freundlich and sips isotherm adsorption models were used to fit the adsorption thermodynamic process for cd ii adsorption onto ahap the fitting parameters for the three thermodynamic models are shown in table 2 the results show that the r2 for the sips isotherm is higher than those for the langmuir and freundlich isotherms indicating that the distribution of cd ii adsorption sites on the hap surface is heterogeneous the adsorption of cd ii onto ahap is increased from 20 67 to 33 33 mg g as the temperature is increased from 298 to 318 k at an initial concentration of 500 mg l indicating that an increased temperature is beneficial to the adsorption process we compared the adsorption capacities of several other types of hap for cd ii as shown in table 3 although the adsorption capacity of ahap is lower than that in other studies it is mostly modified or has a nanoscale particle size the ahap used in this study is a phosphorus recovery product in the wastewater treatment of an anammox hap coupling system which has the advantages of low raw material costs and high environmental benefits in addition the crystal structure and morphology with a flexible frame are conducive to better ion exchange and surface complexation the channels for easy infiltration and diffusion are conducive to the internal diffusion of solids and the maximum surface area is conducive to physical adsorption and surface complexation 33 therefore whether ahap can have a higher adsorption capacity after modification or other treatments still needs follow up research 3 4 particle size and remaining anammox biomass influence the ahap adsorption capacity the particle size of the adsorbent material is a key factor affecting the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent material which is usually considered to change the specific surface area of the adsorbent material 40 the specific surface area pore volume and average pore diameter of ahap with different particle sizes are shown in table 4 the ahap of 10 mesh was obtained through screening and the ahap of 60 120 and 200 mesh were prepared by grinding the ahap specific surface areas of the 10 60 120 and 200 meshes are 26 83 6 39 4 94 and 3 51 m2 g respectively the results show that grinding reduces the specific surface area of ahap increases the average pore diameter and decreases the pore volume the bet adsorption isotherm of ahap is shown in fig 5 according to the standard of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the bet adsorption curve for ahap 10 mesh belongs to the type iv adsorption isotherm and its hysteresis loop is of the h4 type indicating that the structure of ahap is composed of a mixture of micropores 2 nm and mesopores 2 50 nm grinding reduces the specific surface area of ahap and changes the hysteresis ring type for ahap from h4 to h3 which may be due to the destruction for the micropore structure in ahap 41 the influence of particle size on the anammox biomass is shown in fig 6 a in this study the amount of protein on the ahap surface was estimated by the folin reagent method which was used to characterize the amount of anammox biomass the result shows that the amount of anammox biomass on the ahap surface increases with decreasing particle size after adsorption the anammox biomass of ahap under different particle sizes is decreased from 2 11 7 93 9 23 and 9 44 mg g to 1 96 3 91 4 03 and 4 66 mg g respectively the influence of particle size on the cd ii removal rate is shown in fig 6 b although the specific surface area of ahap decreases after grinding the cd ii removal rate increases these results indicate that grinding can lead to the release of anammox biomass in ahap and the biomass can play a role in cd ii adsorption which is reflected in the reduction of biomass after adsorption combined with the results of anammox biomass release part of the anammox biomass remains on the surface and inside of ahap and grinding results in the release of inside anammox biomass and an increase in available protein content in the solution which enhances the adsorption capacity of ahap for cd ii 3 5 summary of the adsorption mechanism and application prospects for ahap 3 5 1 adsorption mechanism in an anammox hap coupled system ahap is recovered as a phosphorus recovery product which shows good adsorption performance for cd ii adsorption kinetics experiments show that the rate limiting step for adsorption is controlled by a chemical process consisting of two steps first cd ii is rapidly adsorbed onto the ahap surface and then the internal diffusion of cd ii in ahap particles occurs internal diffusion is the main rate limiting step the experiment for the initial ph on adsorption indicates that ahap can dissolve and show a cd ii adsorption ability under acidic conditions adsorption thermodynamic experiments show that the adsorption of cd ii on the ahap surface is heterogeneous and the adsorption capacity increases with increasing temperature the adsorption thermodynamic experiments indicate that the adsorption capacity of cd ii on the ahap surface is uneven according to the changes of protein content in ahap before and after adsorption it can be concluded that the residual anammox biomass is also due to the adsorption of cd ii therefore adsorption can be divided into adsorption induced by inorganic materials and biomass fig 7 i the adsorption induced by inorganic materials hap the xdr atlas confirmed that ahap is mainly composed of ca10 po4 2 po4 6 and caco3 and the adsorption of ahap on inorganic materials is mainly due to ca10 po4 2 po4 6 the adsorption of cd ii by hap can be divided into two stages the first stage is surface complexation ftir confirms the existence of oh and cooh functional groups in ahap cd ii can replace the h in these functional groups on the ahap surface and the complexation reaction occurs eqs 12 and 14 the second stage is internal diffusion followed by ion exchange with ca2 eq 15 and partial dissolution and precipitation with subsequent precipitation of a cd containing hydroxyapatite 29 eqs 11 and 16 ① surface complexation 12 hap oh c d aq 2 hap o c d h aq 14 hap cooh c d aq 2 hap coo 2 cd 2 h aq ② ion exchange 15 c a 10 p o 4 6 oh 2

adsorption induced by anammox biomass the biomass induced adsorption process is caused by the residual anammox biomass which has active functional groups such as oh cooh and nh2 and these active functional groups can bind with cd ii 42 the ahap surface is heterogeneous and there is a small amount of anammox biomass with contains the above functional groups that can undergo surface complexation with cd ii in addition anammox biomass in ahap is released after grinding which enhances the adsorption capacity of ahap for cd ii 3 5 2 application prospects first ahap has a ph buffering ability maintaining the final ph at a certain value to fit anammox growth when the initial ph is 1 87 it has a high cd ii adsorption capacity therefore ahap has a wide range of ph tolerance and does not require much ph regulation in practical applications second heavy metal pollution occurs in the wastewater of many industries including cd ii pb ii cr ii and hg ii 43 from an economic perspective adsorption is an attractive method traditional absorption materials include activated carbon silica gel ferro oxide and carbon nanofiber but with disadvantages of easy oxidization and aggregation limited adsorption capacity high cost and low selectivity 44 however hap can effectively remove cd ii pb ii co ii ni ii zn ii and other heavy metal ions in aqueous solution and can promote the adsorption of metal ions through modification such as impregnation magnetic modification acid or alkali modification and loading of other adsorbents 45 in this study the adsorption capacity of cd ii at 318 k is determined to be 34 80 mg g from the point of view of resource recovery phosphorus in sewage can be recovered in the form of hap and hap can be used as phosphate fertilizer 46 studies have found that hap at 200 nm and 20 nm can significantly promote the seedling height stem diameter and biomass of seedlings and hydroxyapatite can improve the bioavailability of phosphorus 47 on the other hand traditional adsorption materials are difficult to separate and recycle previous studies have found that magnetically modified hydroxyapatite particles have the characteristics of convenient separation and can be used to desorb hap after heavy metal adsorption by edta hcl ca no3 2 and naoh to promote the reuse of materials and have a good regeneration ability 37 48 4 conclusions this study proves that the byproducts of ahap harvested from the anammox hap coupling process can be used as adsorption materials in the treatment of heavy metal wastewater ahap composed of ca10 oh 2 po4 6 and caco3 has a large specific surface area and abundant pore structure which can adsorb heavy metals by surface complexation ion exchange and dissolution and precipitation the remaining anammox biomass in ahap can promote the combination of ahap and cd ii and enhance the adsorption capacity of ahap this study provides a reference for the development of new water treatment processes with high

12793,the anammox hap coupling process can simultaneously achieve high efficiency nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery from sewage the composition and physical properties of the byproducts ahap collected in the anammox hap process were analyzed in addition the application potential and mechanisms for cd ii adsorption by ahap in wastewater were investigated the results show that ahap is mainly composed of hydroxyapatite and calcium carbonate having granular structure with honeycombs and pores the ahap shows an adsorption capacity of 21 10 34 80 mg g for cd ii removal and the adsorption behavior is consistent with pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models showing that the rate limiting step is controlled by the chemical reaction of surface complexation ion exchange and precipitation in addition the remaining anammox biomass in ahap can bind cd ii the ahap also shows a ph buffer capacity when the initial ph ranges between 4 10 and 8 46 and the final ph can be stabilized in the range of 6 3 to 8 3 which is suitable for anammox reactions collectively the anammox hap coupling process can not only be used to achieve high efficiency nitrogen and phosphorus removal but its ahap byproduct shows good adsorption properties and ph buffering capacity which meets the requirements of green chemistry and has high economic and environmental benefits

main reason for eutrophication of water bodies which will cause algae blooms and destroy the aquatic ecosystem 1 in addition phosphorus is a biologically essential element and nonrenewable resource with global phosphorus demand estimated to exceed supply by 2035 2 approximately 1 3 mt of phosphorus is treated in sewage plants worldwide each year making sewage a potential second source of phosphorus 3 chemical precipitation and induced crystallization are widely used in wastewater treatment plants for phosphorus recovery while these recovery efficiency and process cost are affected by temperature stirring rate reaction time and seed crystals which need to be precisely controlled 4 therefore it is important to develop new processes that can remove nitrogen and recover phosphorus efficiently during water treatment to solve the problem of water pollution and phosphorus crisis in recent years there have been biological induction processes for hydroxyapatite hap in different granular sludge of activated sludge systems and minerals with hap dominant phase have been observed without additional control 5 7 anammox is a new type of biological nitrogen removal process developed in the 1990s 8 compared with the traditional biological denitrification and phosphorus removal process the anammox process requires low aeration low sludge output and low operating cost 9 in the anammox reaction a local alkaline environment is formed which is conducive to hap crystallization the anammox hap coupling process can efficiently remove nitrogen and recover the phosphorus resources in sewage in the form of hydroxyapatite 7 due to its good physics and adsorption properties hap is used as an adsorption material in the treatment of heavy metal wastewater 10 with the rapid development of urbanization and industry the removal of heavy metals from water has become an important environmental issue 11 cadmium has been classified as a human carcinogen and teratogenic affecting lungs kidneys liver and genitalia 12 the ca2 in hap can be substituted with heavy metal ions through ion exchange and surface complexation and the hydroxyl group on the hap surface can be used as an active site for the adsorption material of heavy metal ions in industrial production hap is an important raw material for the production of phosphorus slow release fertilizers and other phosphorus chemical products 13 hap has become a good environmentally functional material due to its biocompatibility calcium replaceability photocatalytic properties and other properties 14 at present chemical methods are commonly used to prepare hap but the cost is high in this study the byproducts of the anammox hap process ahap were recovered from the anammox hap reactor the microstructure and material composition of ahap was analyzed by means of characterization an adsorption experiment for cd ii is used to prove the adsorption capacity of ahap the effect of residual

micromeritics america 2 4 adsorption experiment fitting 2 4 1 kinetic models to better understand the adsorption mechanism and kinetics three kinetic models including pseudo first order pseudo second

microstructures of ahap and nhap are shown in fig 1 the ahap recovered from the anammox hap coupling process is composed of gray brown particles with a particle size of 0 1 0 5 cm nhap is composed of white powder with a particle size of 100 nm comparing fig 1c and d it can be found that nhap presents flake crystals without an obvious pore structure while ahap is granular fig 1 a honeycomb and pore structures can be observed on the surface of ahap fig 1 c the formation of honeycomb and pore structures are mainly driven by the growth of anaob and the production of dinitrogen 16 under the effects of mass transfer and shear force of water flow the anammox hap coupling granules present a spherical shape with hap as the core and anaob as the biofilm 17 there is much residual anammox biomass in ahap which is composed of anaob and extracellular polymers eps fig 1e the xrd and ftir patterns of ahap are shown in fig 2 the results show that ahap is mainly composed of ca10 oh 2 po4 6 ca5 po4 3 oh and caco3 fig 2 a that shows that the anammox hap coupling process can recover phosphorus from sewage in the form of hap the formula for ca10 oh 2 po4 6 formation is given as follows 18 9 10 c a 2 6 p o 4 3 2 o h c a 10 p o 4 6 oh 2 ca3co3 is produced during the formation of ahap this is because the sewage contains ca2 seed crystals and hco3 inorganic carbon source as anammox progresses the ph of the solution rises and caco3 precipitates finally the calcium carbonate in ahap has a buffering effect keeping the ph in a range suitable for the growth of anaob within a certain range 19 the ftir spectra for ahap and nhap are compared fig 2 b the absorption peaks for ahap and nhap are relatively consistent the vibration peak of oh is located at 3445 cm 1 the asymmetric stretching vibration peaks of ch3 appear at 2990 5 cm 1 and 2950 5 cm 1 20 the vibration peak of h2o is located at 1643 cm 1 21 the vibration peak of co3 2 is located at 1427 cm 1 and the absorption peak at 1060 cm 1 may be due to the coh stretching vibration and the coc asymmetric stretching vibration in the polysaccharide 22 the asymmetric stretching vibration peak of po4 3 is located at 1043 cm 1 the stretching vibration peak of po4 3 is located at 563 cm 1 and 604 cm 1 16 the absorption peak of the cooh functional group is located at 867 cm 1 23 the results show that ahap and nhap both contain functional groups such as oh and po4 3 and ahap contains external functional groups such as coc and cooh the coc and oh functional groups in monosaccharides can play important roles in the process of binding to cd ii 22 24 3 2 ph influence on adsorption behavior of ahap the ph value of the solution is a critical parameter that can affect the adsorption process the form of hap in solution and the anammox reaction the effect of ph on cd ii adsorption and phosphorus release from ahap is shown in fig 3 fig 3 a shows that when the initial ph ranges between 4 10 and 8 46 the ph will remain at approximately 8 3 after the adsorption is complete and we call this initial ph range the ph buffer zone the ph buffering ability of hap has been found in previous studies and the starting point of ph buffering is always approximately 4 but the final ph through buffering is different the ph value obtained in other studies is approximately 5 8 or 7 4 25 26 in our study the final ph value through buffering is found to be approximately 8 3 this is because the hap formed by our reactor contains more caco3 when the initial ph is 4 10 the final ph increases with the initial ph increasing because of the dissolution of caco3 and hap eqs 10 and 11 under acidic condition we found that when the initial ph decreases from 4 10 to 1 15 the phosphorus release increases from 0 84 mg g to 103 00 mg g fig 3 b indicating dissolution the adsorption capacity of cd ii sharply increased from 0 37 to 8 65 mg g with the increase of ph from 1 15 to 1 87 and when ph 1 87 the adsorption capacity of cd ii basically remains at 8 58 8 67 mg g this is because h can occupy the active sites on the ahap surface in a strong acid environment which weakens the adsorption effect of cd ii the hydroxyl on the surface undergoes protonation with h resulting in the surface of the adsorbent being positively charged and repelling cd ii 27 when the ph rises cd ii dominates the competition of adsorption potential and the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent increases eqs 12 and 13 the ph of the solution increases with the complexation of cd ii with the surface hydroxyl group 10 ca co 3 2 h ca 2 h 2 o co 2 11 ca 10 p o

formation is favorable under alkaline conditions therefore when the influent ph is controlled to range between 4 10 and 8 46 a stable anammox reaction and phosphorus recovery with ahap as the main product can be achieved ahap can achieve a relatively high cd ii adsorption capacity over a wide ph range with little effect of the influent ph therefore it has a good buffer capacity for application 3 3 adsorption kinetics and isothermals to understand the adsorption process and determine the leading factors for the adsorption reaction kinetic and thermodynamic experiments were designed the kinetic process for the adsorption of cd ii by ahap is shown in fig 4 fig 4 a shows that a rapid adsorption of cd ii occurs within the first 50 min followed by a slow adsorption until the adsorbed cd ii reaches the equilibrium value at the beginning of the adsorption reaction there are many active sites on the hap surface which is conducive to adsorption as the reaction progresses the cd ii in the solution is gradually adsorbed and the number of active sites on the ahap surface also gradually decrease due to the adsorption of cd ii resulting in a decrease in the adsorption rate until equilibrium is gradually reached the adsorption kinetics parameters and correlation coefficients r2 calculated from the three models are listed in table 1 it is found that the values of r2 for the pseudo first order kinetic model are relatively low which indicates that the pseudo first order kinetic model cannot adequately describe the adsorption of cd ii onto ahap the pseudo second order kinetic model is more in line with the adsorption process for cd ii and the calculated qe values agree very well with the experimental values showing good linearity with r2 above 0 99 this result suggests that the rate limiting step in adsorption is controlled by chemical processes in previous studies hap adsorption of cd ii can be divided into ion exchange surface complexation dissolution of hap and precipitation 29 30 it can be found in the fitting curve for intra particle diffusion that the adsorption of cd ii by ahap is bilinear indicating that the adsorption process can be divided into two stages fig 4 d in the first stage cd ii rapidly diffuses to the surface of ahap within 90 min after that the adsorption rate decreases and adsorption lasts longer suggesting that intra particle diffusion is the limiting step for adsorption if the fitted curve passes through the origin it indicates that diffusion within the particle is the only rate control step otherwise it suggests that the adsorption process is also affected by boundary layer diffusion 31 all the trend lines under the conditions of 50 100 150 mg l cd ii do not pass through the origin indicating that the adsorption process may be affected by factors such as surface diffusion and particle internal diffusion this is consistent with the whole adsorption process for cd ii by normal hap which is divided into two steps 30 32 i cd ii can be adsorbed at the hap surface ii cd ii diffuses into hap and step ii is the rate limiting step in this study langmuir freundlich and sips isotherm adsorption models were used to fit the adsorption thermodynamic process for cd ii adsorption onto ahap the fitting parameters for the three thermodynamic models are shown in table 2 the results show that the r2 for the sips isotherm is higher than those for the langmuir and freundlich isotherms indicating that the distribution of cd ii adsorption sites on the hap surface is heterogeneous the adsorption of cd ii onto ahap is increased from 20 67 to 33 33 mg g as the temperature is increased from 298 to 318 k at an initial concentration of 500 mg l indicating that an increased temperature is beneficial to the adsorption process we compared the adsorption capacities of several other types of hap for cd ii as shown in table 3 although the adsorption capacity of ahap is lower than that in other studies it is mostly modified or has a nanoscale particle size the ahap used in this study is a phosphorus recovery product in the wastewater treatment of an anammox hap coupling system which has the advantages of low raw material costs and high environmental benefits in addition the crystal structure and morphology with a flexible frame are conducive to better ion exchange and surface complexation the channels for easy infiltration and diffusion are conducive to the internal diffusion of solids and the maximum surface area is conducive to physical adsorption and surface complexation 33 therefore whether ahap can have a higher adsorption capacity after modification or other treatments still needs follow up research 3 4 particle size and remaining anammox biomass influence the ahap adsorption capacity the particle size of the adsorbent material is a key factor affecting the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent material which is usually considered to change the specific surface area of the adsorbent material 40 the specific surface area pore volume and average pore diameter of ahap with different particle sizes are shown in table 4 the ahap of 10 mesh was obtained through screening and the ahap of 60 120 and 200 mesh were prepared by grinding the ahap specific surface areas of the 10 60 120 and 200 meshes are 26 83 6 39 4 94 and 3 51 m2 g respectively the results show that grinding reduces the specific surface area of ahap increases the average pore diameter and decreases the pore volume the bet adsorption isotherm of ahap is shown in fig 5 according to the standard of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the bet adsorption curve for ahap 10 mesh belongs to the type iv adsorption isotherm and its hysteresis loop is of the h4 type indicating that the structure of ahap is composed of a mixture of micropores 2 nm and mesopores 2 50 nm grinding reduces the specific surface area of ahap and changes the hysteresis ring type for ahap from h4 to h3 which may be due to the destruction for the micropore structure in ahap 41 the influence of particle size on the anammox biomass is shown in fig 6 a in this study the amount of protein on the ahap surface was estimated by the folin reagent method which was used to characterize the amount of anammox biomass the result shows that the amount of anammox biomass on the ahap surface increases with decreasing particle size after adsorption the anammox biomass of ahap under different particle sizes is decreased from 2 11 7 93 9 23 and 9 44 mg g to 1 96 3 91 4 03 and 4 66 mg g respectively the influence of particle size on the cd ii removal rate is shown in fig 6 b although the specific surface area of ahap decreases after grinding the cd ii removal rate increases these results indicate that grinding can lead to the release of anammox biomass in ahap and the biomass can play a role in cd ii adsorption which is reflected in the reduction of biomass after adsorption combined with the results of anammox biomass release part of the anammox biomass remains on the surface and inside of ahap and grinding results in the release of inside anammox biomass and an increase in available protein content in the solution which enhances the adsorption capacity of ahap for cd ii 3 5 summary of the adsorption mechanism and application prospects for ahap 3 5 1 adsorption mechanism in an anammox hap coupled system ahap is recovered as a phosphorus recovery product which shows good adsorption performance for cd ii adsorption kinetics experiments show that the rate limiting step for adsorption is controlled by a chemical process consisting of two steps first cd ii is rapidly adsorbed onto the ahap surface and then the internal diffusion of cd ii in ahap particles occurs internal diffusion is the main rate limiting step the experiment for the initial ph on adsorption indicates that ahap can dissolve and show a cd ii adsorption ability under acidic conditions adsorption thermodynamic experiments show that the adsorption of cd ii on the ahap surface is heterogeneous and the adsorption capacity increases with increasing temperature the adsorption thermodynamic experiments indicate that the adsorption capacity of cd ii on the ahap surface is uneven according to the changes of protein content in ahap before and after adsorption it can be concluded that the residual anammox biomass is also due to the adsorption of cd ii therefore adsorption can be divided into adsorption induced by inorganic materials and biomass fig 7 i the adsorption induced by inorganic materials hap the xdr atlas confirmed that ahap is mainly composed of ca10 po4 2 po4 6 and caco3 and the adsorption of ahap on inorganic materials is mainly due to ca10 po4 2 po4 6 the adsorption of cd ii by hap can be divided into two stages the first stage is surface complexation ftir confirms the existence of oh and cooh functional groups in ahap cd ii can replace the h in these functional groups on the ahap surface and the complexation reaction occurs eqs 12 and 14 the second stage is internal diffusion followed by ion exchange with ca2 eq 15 and partial dissolution and precipitation with subsequent precipitation of a cd containing hydroxyapatite 29 eqs 11 and 16 ① surface complexation 12 hap oh c d aq 2 hap o c d h aq 14 hap cooh c d aq 2 hap coo 2 cd 2 h aq ② ion exchange 15 c a 10 p o 4 6 oh 2 xc d 2 c a 10 x c d x p o 4 6 oh 2 xc a 2 ③ dissolution and precipitation 11 ca 10 p o 4 6 oh 2 14 h 10 c a 2 6 h 2 p o 4 2 h 2 o 16 10 c d 2 6 h 2 p o 4 2 h 2 o cd 10 p o 4 6 oh 2 14 h i the adsorption induced by anammox biomass the biomass induced adsorption process is caused by the residual anammox biomass which has active functional groups such as oh cooh and nh2 and these active functional groups can bind with cd ii 42 the ahap surface is heterogeneous and there is a small amount of anammox biomass with contains the above functional groups that can undergo surface complexation with cd ii in addition anammox biomass in ahap is released after grinding which enhances the adsorption capacity of ahap for cd ii 3 5 2 application prospects first ahap has a ph buffering ability maintaining the final ph at a certain value to fit anammox growth when the initial ph is 1 87 it has a high cd ii adsorption capacity therefore ahap has a wide range of ph tolerance and does not require much ph regulation in practical applications second heavy metal pollution occurs in the wastewater of many industries including cd ii pb ii cr ii and hg ii 43 from an economic perspective adsorption is an attractive method traditional absorption materials include activated carbon silica gel ferro oxide and carbon nanofiber but with disadvantages of easy oxidization and aggregation limited adsorption capacity high cost and low selectivity 44 however hap can effectively remove cd ii pb ii co ii ni ii zn ii and other heavy metal ions in aqueous solution and can promote the adsorption of metal ions through modification such as impregnation magnetic modification acid or alkali modification and loading of other adsorbents 45 in this study the adsorption capacity of cd ii at 318 k is determined to be 34 80 mg g from the point of view of resource recovery phosphorus in sewage can be recovered in the form of hap and hap can be used as phosphate fertilizer 46 studies have found that hap at 200 nm and 20 nm can significantly promote the seedling height stem diameter and biomass of seedlings and hydroxyapatite can improve the bioavailability of phosphorus 47 on the other hand traditional adsorption materials are difficult to separate and recycle previous studies have found that magnetically modified hydroxyapatite particles have the characteristics of convenient separation and can be used to desorb hap after heavy metal adsorption by edta hcl ca no3 2 and naoh to promote the reuse of materials and have a good regeneration ability 37 48 4 conclusions this study proves that the byproducts of ahap harvested from the anammox hap coupling process can be used as adsorption materials in the treatment of heavy metal wastewater ahap composed of ca10 oh 2 po4 6 and caco3 has a large specific surface area and abundant pore structure which can adsorb heavy metals by surface complexation ion exchange and dissolution and precipitation the remaining anammox biomass in ahap can promote the combination of ahap and cd ii and enhance the adsorption capacity of ahap this study provides a reference for the development of new water treatment processes with high

high stresses 50 100 mpa 11 13 these extreme conditions which are caused by the collapse of cavitation bubbles contribute to water pyrolysis forming hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen radicals 14 15 the collaboration of physical and chemical effects can effectively rupture cell walls and organic matters 16 17 lee et al 18 studied the impacts of hc on the sludge disintegration degree and found that hc produced the decrease of sludge disintegration degree jung et al 11 found that hc treatment could decrease the sludge particle size mancuso et al 1 found that hc system could increase the solubilization and biodegradability of sludge these investigations have proven that hc could significantly change sludge properties which provides a potential novel way for sludge disposals therefore it is necessary to explore the limitation of hc in the sludge reduction field for promoting its potential application development however previous studies mainly focused on the effect of hc on sludge particle size disintegration degree and biodegradability etc and little information has been pursued to assess the limit of sludge amount reduction by hc the work main purposes were i to evaluate the effects of hc on sludge reduction ii to assess the changes in the organic matters dissolution and disintegration degree in sludge with the increasing hc treatment time iii to state the variations of sludge particle size and stability caused by hc iv to analyze the effect of hc on extracellular polymers eps compositions iv to explore the sludge reduction process by hc 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sources the sludge came from the aeration tank in the northern sewage treatment plant shenyang china the sludge was filtered with a 24 meshes screens to exclude impurities additionally the sludge supernatant also needs be removed after 2 h settlement for the thicken of sludge 2 2 hc equipment hc setup was a circulating system consisted of main and bypass lines hc setup diagram was shown in fig 1 the main line included 1 a water pump 1 5 kw power wzb 1500a rijin pump co ltd china allowing the liquid to circulate in hc system 2 an orifice plate with 20 holes of 2 mm in diameter generating hc effect 3 a pressure gauge measuring the pressure in the main line 4 a flowmeter quantifying the flow rate 5 a 20 l holding tank with a cooling water system meanwhile the bypass line could regulate the flow and pressure in the main line the control group was run without hc generator device orifice plates and the hc group was operated with orifice plates when sludge was passed through the orifice plate on the main line by the self priming pump the flow rate could be increased and the pressure would be dropped below the steam pressure this would produce a large numbers of cavitation bubbles and then the cavitation bubble collapsed and caused the hc effect 12 13 hc group with the orifice plate was performed with an inlet pressure of 3 bar and control group without the orifice plate were operated for excluding the interference of other factors the sludge samples in hc group and in control group were collected at 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 and 240 min and were subjected to further analysis 2 3 analytical methods mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss in mixed sludge liquor were detected in the light of methods 19 the chemical oxygen demand cod and soluble cod scod of sludge were gauged in line with the method hach 8000 14 the scod measurement need to be filtered with a 0 2 μm membrane 18 the sludge particle size distribution was analyzed by the particle size analyzer malvern co mastersizer 2000 in the light of iso 13320 1 the loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps extraction protocol follows the method in li and yang 20 determination of protein and carbohydrate in extracted eps by lowry folin method 21 and the phenol sulfuric method 22 respectively 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra was measured according to wang et al 23 sludge morphology was viewed by a scanning electron microscope sem merlin zeiss germany according to cai et al 24 disintegration degree ddscod was calculated using the equation below eq 1 according to lee et al 18 1 dd scod scod t scod 0 cod scod 0 100 where cod and scod0 mg l were the initial levels of chemical oxygen demand and soluble chemical oxygen demand respectively scodt mg l was scod level at t minute 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on sludge reduction to determine the impact of hc on sludge reduction the variations of mlss and mlvss were analyzed fig 2 in hc group and in control group mlss and mlvss decreased first and then increased as the increase of time the lowest mlss in the hc group was 756 86 mg l at 120 min while it in the control group was 1026 12 mg l at 150 min the decrease of mlss in the control group was related to the disintegration of sludge by shear stress of water pump mechanical action 25 compared with control group mlss in hc group was lower and the time required to reach the lowest mlss values was shorter the results suggested both shear stress and hc played an effective role in reducing mlss from sludge and hc could promote the mlss decrease caused by shear stress of water pump mechanical action kim et al 14 found similar results that hc had a better contribution to sludge disintegration than shear stress mlvss change trends in hc group and in control group were same as mlss and the lowest mlvss were also found at 120 min and 150 min corresponding to hc group and control group in hc group the highest reduction rates of mlvss and mlss were 42 13 and 41 57 at 120 min respectively while in the control group they exhibited 19 13 and 20 05 at 120 min respectively in hc group and in control group mlvss decreased rates were similar to mlss suggesting that hc or shear stress had analogous disintegration abilities to volatile suspended solid and involatile suspended solid in sludge it is interesting that when the reaction time crossed the inflection point 120 min in the hc group and 150 min in the control group mlss and mlvss values of sludge increased gradually with the time increase at 240 min mlss and mlvss in the hc group were 1018 14 and 538 21 mg l respectively and they in the control group reached to 1243 00 and 582 46 mg l respectively compared to 120 min in the hc group mlss and mlvss at 240 min increased by 34 52 and 55 56 respectively and their raised levels in the control group at 240 min were 21 14 and 22 18 compared to 150 min respectively the increase of mlss and mlvss in hc group and in control group suggested a phenomenon of fake increase hc and shear stress could severely damage to the structure of sludge resulting in the reduction of sludge particles size 14 26 the small particles sludge was more likely to absorb moisture 24 leading to increased sludge viscosity 1 5 the sludge viscosity increase was not propitious to the penetration of sludge through filter membrane 24 27 showing the illusion of re increasing mlss and mlvss of sludge compared to control group fake increase of mlss and mlvss in the hc group was more obvious which was related to the enhancement of sludge disintegration by hc although the longer time of hc treatment resulted in more false increase in mlss and mlvss the mlss and mlvss values were always lower in hc group compared to control group the changes indicated that the sludge reduction could be enhanced by hc 3 2 effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on sludge organic matters dissolution to determine the influences of hc on sludge organic matters dissolution the variations of scod and ddscod in hc and control group were analyzed as shown in fig 3a the scod concentration in hc group and in control group both increased with the treatment time and they at 240 min were 319 66 and 227 46 mg l respectively the increases of scod in hc group and in control group were mainly attributed to the dissolution of solid phase substances matter due to hc and shear stress 14 28 in generally the increase of organic matter and eps in aqueous phase could contribute to the increase of cod level the increase in the strength of hc or shear stress could result in the solid phase substances matter disassembly which caused the concentration increase of organic matter and eps 12 14 these could explain why the scod levels in hc group and in control group increased as the time to further delve the effects of hc on sludge organic matters dissolution the disintegration degree changes in hc group and in control group were analyze ddscod was the ratio in the concentration changes of scod to cod and it had been widely used to estimate the change of sludge disintegration degree 12 as shown in fig 3b ddscod in hc group and in control group increased by 22 98 and 13 18 as the increase of time respectively ddscod in hc group was higher than in control group suggesting that hc promoted sludge disintegration hc could generate stronger shear stress that damaged bacterial cell walls due to higher velocity turbulence and partial pressure variations 1 12 this could explain why the sludge disintegration in hc group was higher than in control group the scod and ddscod level were always higher in hc group compared to control group indicating that hc played a much stronger role in cell disruption and sludge solubilization than shear stress 3 3 effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on sludge characteristics fig 4 shows the changes of sludge particle size with and without hc treatment process sludge particle size reduced with time in group and in control group to analyze the sludge particle reduction quantitatively the particle size percentiles were explored under hc group and control group table 1 the median sludge particle size d 0 5 was about 20 μm in untreated sample in hc group and in control group d 0 5 decreased as the increase of time and they were 4 45 and 11 85 μm at 240 min respectively the decreased degree of d 0 5 in hc group was higher than in control group the d 0 1 in hc group was two orders lower than in control group the results indicated hc and shear stress could result in the reduce of sludge particle diameter by destroying aggregates and flocs of sludge 14 29 kim et al 14 found that shear stress influenced only aggregates and flocs of sludge whereas hc influenced both sludge flocs decomposition and cell walls destruction this explained why d 0 1 in hc group was far less than in control group fig 5 showed the influence of hc on vss ss ratio changes vss ss ratio could represent bioorganic matters to total solid ratio 30 31 the higher the vss ss ratio was the sludge stability was weaker 32 vss ss ratio increased with time and the vss ss ratio in hc group and in control group at 240 min reached to 0 53 and 0 47 respectively the results showed that hc decreased the sludge stability more significantly than shear stress at 240 min d 0 1 value in hc group was significantly decreased only 0 04 μm suggesting that more cells might be destroyed by hc 14 24 the damage of cells caused the leakage of intracellular substances 33 which could result in the increase of biological organic matters 12 33 and the decrease of stability in sludge 16 24 34 3 4 effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on extracellular polymers components extracellular polymers eps are some high polymers produced by microbes outside the cells 12 which comprises loosely lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps 23 eps has notable influence on the sludge flocs surface properties the aggregation of microbial cells and the stabilization of floc structure 5 24 35 36 proteins and carbohydrates are the indicative components of eps in sludge 25 hence to systemically explore mechanisms of sludge reduction by hc and shear stress the proteins and carbohydrates from eps were characterized fig 6 shows the effects of hc on the proteins and carbohydrates concentrations in lb and tb eps as depicted in fig 6a the protein concentration of tb eps in hc group and in control group decreased from 35 74 to 1 42 mg vss and 36 00 to 5 85 mg vss with the increasing treatment from 0 to 240 min respectively meanwhile the protein in lb eps showed a decreasing tendency first and then gradually increasing one the pn concentration of lb eps in the hc group decreased from 12 76 0 min to 1 08 120 min and then increased to 4 25 mg vss 240 min and that from the control group reduced from 12 76 0 min to 7 49 120 min and then raised to 10 53 mg vss 240 min respectively hc could destroy the protein structure through hydroxyl free radicals and hydrogen free radicals generated by cavitation which resulted in the decrease of protein concentration in lb and tb eps 24 this explained why the total protein consistence in lb and tb eps in hc group was lower than in control group protein consistence of tb eps in hc group always decreased as the increase of time from 0 to 240 min while that from lb eps decreased as the time increase from 0 to 120 min and increased with the time increase from 120 to 240 min the free protein from fracted cells in solutions could be adsorbed by living cells 37 38 considering that tb eps and cells were located closer than lb eps 39 these proteins would first undergo lb eps when adsorbed by cells this might be one of the reasons that under the significant increase of sludge disintegration degree from 120 to 240 min the protein concentration in lb eps raised with the time the carbohydrate consistence in lb and tb eps expressed a trend of increase first and then decrease with the increase of treatment time fig 6b the increase was related to the disintegration of fucose rhamnose and arabinose etc in sludge 40 42 the carbohydrate concentration in hc group was higher than in control group implying that hc had a more destructive impact on sludge components than shearing force compared to protein the changed degrees of carbohydrate as the hc treatment time increase were lower suggesting that hc had a more destructive impact on protein than carbohydrate 3 5 effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on 3d eem in extracellular polymeric substances fig 7 illustrates the impacts of hc on the changes of 3d eem in lb and tb eps base on the consistent coverage of excitation and emission wavelength 3d eem was classified into 5 regions regions a and b were associated with aromatic proteins tyrosine and tryptophan respectively region c was related to fulvic acid region d was described as humic substances and region e corresponded to tyrosine and tryptophan proteins in soluble microbial products like substances 24 43 45 in control group the peaks from lb and tb eps were mainly concentrated in regions b and e at different treatment time indicating that protein in lb and tb eps was constituted of tyrosine and tryptophan mainly as the increase of time the peaks in regions b and e were always found in lb and tb eps while their strengths were reduced the changes suggested that in the control group the treatment time increase did not change protein composition in lb ans tb eps while decreased the protein levels in the hc group at 0 min the peaks from lb eps were mainly concentrated in regions b and e while those in tb eps were attributed to regions a and e as the increase of time in hc group the peaks in region b from lb eps at 120 min and in region a from tb eps at 240 min disappeared suggesting that the hc treatment time increase significantly changed protein composition in lb and tb eps the changes were related to the fact that the increase of free radical levels along with the production of high temperature and pressure produced by hc could destroyed protein composition and structure 5 46 in the hc group at 240 min the peaks in lb eps were still attributed to regions a and e compared to that at 0 min this was similar to the increase of protein levels in lb eps from 120 to 240 min in hc group which might be explained by the free protein from fracted cells in solutions would first be adsorbed by lb eps considering that tb eps and cells were located closer than lb eps 3 6 process of hc on sludge reduction the increase of hole in sludge sem fig a 1 and the decrease of mlss and mlvss values and sludge particle diameter suggested a sludge floc structure destruction by hc and the reduction of proteins and carbohydrates and the increase of scod and ddscod values indicated that hc caused eps destructions and cell elongations the increased proteins levels in lb eps might suggest that an increase of cellular permeability by hc the sum of proteins and carbohydrates contents from lb and tb eps always reduced with hc time suggesting that hc could destroy the intracellular materials leaking due to increased cell permeability based on the above changes we inferred that the process of hc on sludge reduction should be that hc firstly caused a sludge floc structure destruction and then eps destructions and cell elongations and finally cell wall destructions fig 8 previous studies found that hc could cause the increase of free radical levels along with the production of high temperature and high pressure 5 12 47 suggesting that those above factors might be the important driving force about the process of hc on sludge reduction the mechanism needed to be further studied the increase of hole in sludge sem fig a 1 and the decrease of mlss and mlvss values and sludge particle diameter suggested a sludge floc structure destruction by hc and the reduction of proteins and carbohydrates and the increase of scod and ddscod values indicated that hc caused eps destructions and cell elongations the increased proteins levels in lb eps might suggest that an increase of cellular permeability by hc the sum of proteins and carbohydrates contents from lb and tb eps always reduced with hc time suggesting that hc could destroy the intracellular materials leaking due to increased cell permeability based on the above changes we inferred that the process of hc on sludge reduction should be that hc firstly caused a sludge floc structure destruction and then eps destructions and cell elongations and finally cell wall destructions fig 8 previous studies found that hc could cause the increase of free radical levels along with the production of high temperature and high pressure 5 12 47 suggesting that those above factors might be the important driving force about the process of hc on sludge reduction the mechanism needed to be further studied 4 conclusion hc treatment caused the sludge reduction at 120 min while there was a fake increase of mlss and mlvss levels with hc time during 120 240 min the increase of hydrodynamic cavitation time could result in the increase of disintegration degree and organic matters dissolution in sludge and the decrease of sludge particle sizes the protein level in tb eps always decreased with the increasing hydrodynamic cavitation time while that in lb eps decreased firstly and then gradually increased hydrodynamic cavitation could destroy tryptophan and tyrosine protein in lb and tb eps the following is the supplementary data related to this article fig a 1 sem of sludge in hc group at different time a 0 min b 60 min c 120 min d 240 min fig a 1

it is necessary to explore the limitation of hc in the sludge reduction field for promoting its potential application development however previous studies mainly focused on the effect of hc on sludge particle size disintegration degree and biodegradability etc and little information has been pursued to assess the limit of sludge amount reduction by hc the work main purposes were i to evaluate the effects of hc on sludge reduction ii to assess the changes in the organic matters dissolution and disintegration degree in sludge with the increasing hc treatment time iii to state the variations of sludge particle size and stability caused by hc iv to analyze the effect of hc on extracellular polymers eps compositions iv to explore the sludge reduction process by hc 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sources the sludge came from the aeration tank in the northern sewage treatment plant shenyang china the sludge was filtered with a 24 meshes screens to exclude impurities additionally the sludge supernatant also needs be removed after 2 h settlement for the thicken of sludge 2 2 hc equipment hc setup was a circulating system consisted of main and bypass lines hc setup diagram was shown in fig 1 the main line included 1 a water pump 1 5 kw power wzb 1500a rijin pump co ltd china allowing the liquid to circulate in hc system 2 an orifice plate with 20 holes of 2 mm in diameter generating hc effect 3 a pressure gauge measuring the pressure in the main line 4 a flowmeter quantifying the flow rate 5 a 20 l holding tank with a cooling water system meanwhile the bypass line could regulate the flow and pressure in the main line the control group was run without hc generator device orifice plates and the hc group was operated with orifice plates when sludge was passed through the orifice plate on the main line by the self priming pump the flow rate could be increased and the pressure would be dropped below the steam pressure this would produce a large numbers of cavitation bubbles and then the cavitation bubble collapsed and caused the hc effect 12 13 hc group with the orifice plate was performed with an inlet pressure of 3 bar and control group without the orifice plate were operated for excluding the interference of other factors the sludge samples in hc group and in control group were collected at 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 and 240 min and were subjected to further analysis 2 3 analytical methods mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss in mixed sludge liquor were detected in the light of methods 19 the chemical oxygen demand cod and soluble cod scod of sludge were gauged in line with the method hach 8000 14 the scod measurement need to be filtered with a 0 2 μm membrane 18 the sludge particle size distribution was analyzed by the particle size analyzer malvern co mastersizer 2000 in the light of iso 13320 1 the loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps extraction protocol follows the method in li and yang 20 determination of protein and carbohydrate in extracted eps by lowry folin method 21 and the phenol sulfuric method 22 respectively 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra was measured according to wang et al 23 sludge morphology was viewed by a scanning electron microscope sem merlin zeiss germany according to cai et al 24 disintegration degree ddscod was calculated using the equation below eq 1 according to lee et al 18 1 dd scod scod t scod 0 cod scod 0 100 where cod and scod0 mg l were the initial levels of chemical oxygen demand and soluble chemical oxygen demand respectively scodt mg l was scod level at t minute 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on sludge reduction to determine the impact of hc on sludge reduction the variations of mlss and mlvss were analyzed fig 2 in hc group and in control group mlss and mlvss decreased first and then increased as the increase of time the lowest mlss in the hc group was 756 86 mg l at 120 min while it in the control group was 1026 12 mg l at 150 min the decrease of mlss in the control group was related to the disintegration of sludge by shear stress of water pump mechanical action 25 compared with control group mlss in hc group was lower and the time required to reach the lowest mlss values was shorter the results suggested both shear stress and hc played an effective role in reducing mlss from sludge and hc could promote the mlss decrease caused by shear stress of water pump mechanical action kim et al 14 found similar results that hc had a better contribution to sludge disintegration than shear stress mlvss change trends in hc group and in control group were same as mlss and the lowest mlvss were also found at 120 min and 150 min corresponding to hc group and control group in hc group the highest reduction rates of mlvss and mlss were 42 13 and 41 57 at 120 min respectively while in the control group they exhibited 19 13 and 20 05 at 120 min respectively in hc group and in control group mlvss decreased rates were similar to mlss suggesting that hc or shear stress had analogous disintegration abilities to volatile suspended solid and involatile suspended solid in sludge it is interesting that when the reaction time crossed the inflection point 120 min in the hc group and 150 min in the control group mlss and mlvss values of sludge increased gradually with the time increase at 240 min mlss and mlvss in the hc group were 1018 14 and 538 21 mg l respectively and they in the control group reached to 1243 00 and 582 46 mg l respectively compared to 120 min in the hc group mlss and mlvss at 240 min increased by 34 52 and 55 56 respectively and their raised levels in the control group at 240 min were 21 14 and 22 18 compared to 150 min respectively the increase of mlss and mlvss in hc group and in control group suggested a phenomenon of fake increase hc and shear stress could severely damage to the structure of sludge resulting in the reduction of sludge particles size 14 26 the small particles sludge was more likely to absorb moisture 24 leading to increased sludge viscosity 1 5 the sludge viscosity increase was not propitious to the penetration of sludge through filter membrane 24 27 showing the illusion of re increasing mlss and mlvss of sludge compared to control group fake increase of mlss and mlvss in the hc group was more obvious which was related to the enhancement of sludge disintegration by hc although the longer time of hc treatment resulted in more false increase in mlss and mlvss the mlss and mlvss values were always lower in hc group compared to control group the changes indicated that the sludge reduction could be enhanced by hc 3 2 effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on sludge organic matters dissolution to determine the influences of hc on sludge organic matters dissolution the variations of scod and ddscod in hc and control group were analyzed as shown in fig 3a the scod concentration in hc group and in control group both increased with the treatment time and they at 240 min were 319 66 and 227 46 mg l respectively the increases of scod in hc group and in control group were mainly attributed to the dissolution of solid phase substances matter due to hc and shear stress 14 28 in generally the increase of organic matter and eps in aqueous phase could contribute to the increase of cod level the increase in the strength of hc or shear stress could result in the solid phase substances matter disassembly which caused the concentration increase of organic matter and eps 12 14 these could explain why the scod levels in hc group and in control group increased as the time to further delve the effects of hc on sludge organic matters dissolution the disintegration degree changes in hc group and in control group were analyze ddscod was the ratio in the concentration changes of scod to cod and it had been widely used to estimate the change of sludge disintegration degree 12 as shown in fig 3b ddscod in hc group and in control group increased by 22 98 and 13 18 as the increase of time respectively ddscod in hc group was higher than in control group suggesting that hc promoted sludge disintegration hc could generate stronger shear stress that damaged bacterial cell walls due to higher velocity turbulence and partial pressure variations 1 12 this could explain why the sludge disintegration in hc group was higher than in control group the scod and ddscod level were always higher in hc group compared to control group indicating that hc played a much stronger role in cell disruption and sludge solubilization than shear stress 3 3 effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on sludge characteristics fig 4 shows the changes of sludge particle size with and without hc treatment process sludge particle size reduced with time in group and in control group to analyze the sludge particle reduction quantitatively the particle size percentiles were explored under hc group and control group table 1 the median sludge particle size d 0 5 was about 20 μm in untreated sample in hc group and in control group d 0 5 decreased as the increase of time and they were 4 45 and 11 85 μm at 240 min respectively the decreased degree of d 0 5 in hc group was higher than in control group the d 0 1 in hc group was two orders lower than in control group the results indicated hc and shear stress could result in the reduce of sludge particle diameter by destroying aggregates and flocs of sludge 14 29 kim et al 14 found that shear stress influenced only aggregates and flocs of sludge whereas hc influenced both sludge flocs decomposition and cell walls destruction this explained why d 0 1 in hc group was far less than in control group fig 5 showed the influence of hc on vss ss ratio changes vss ss ratio could represent bioorganic matters to total solid ratio 30 31 the higher the vss ss ratio was the sludge stability was weaker 32 vss ss ratio increased with time and the vss ss ratio in hc group and in control group at 240 min reached to 0 53 and 0 47 respectively the results showed that hc decreased the sludge stability more significantly than shear stress at 240 min d 0 1 value in hc group was significantly decreased only 0 04 μm suggesting that more cells might be destroyed by hc 14 24 the damage of cells caused the leakage of intracellular substances 33 which could result in the increase of biological organic matters 12 33 and the decrease of stability in sludge 16 24 34 3 4 effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on extracellular polymers components extracellular polymers eps are some high polymers produced by microbes outside the cells 12 which comprises loosely lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps 23 eps has notable influence on the sludge flocs surface properties the aggregation of microbial cells and the stabilization of floc structure 5 24 35 36 proteins and carbohydrates are the indicative components of eps in sludge 25 hence to systemically explore mechanisms of sludge reduction by hc and shear stress the proteins and carbohydrates from eps were characterized fig 6 shows the effects of hc on the proteins and carbohydrates concentrations in lb and tb eps as depicted in fig 6a the protein concentration of tb eps in hc group and in control group decreased from 35 74 to 1 42 mg vss and 36 00 to 5 85 mg vss with the increasing treatment from 0 to 240 min respectively meanwhile the protein in lb eps showed a decreasing tendency first and then gradually increasing one the pn concentration of lb eps in the hc group decreased from 12 76 0 min to 1 08 120 min and then increased to 4 25 mg vss 240 min and that from the control group reduced from 12 76 0 min to 7 49 120 min and then raised to 10 53 mg vss 240 min respectively hc could destroy the protein structure through hydroxyl free radicals and hydrogen free radicals generated by cavitation which resulted in the decrease of protein concentration in lb and tb eps 24 this explained why the total protein consistence in lb and tb eps in hc group was lower than in control group protein consistence of tb eps in hc group always decreased as the increase of time from 0 to 240 min while that from lb eps decreased as the time increase from 0 to 120 min and increased with the time increase from 120 to 240 min the free protein from fracted cells in solutions could be adsorbed by living cells 37 38 considering that tb eps and cells were located closer than lb eps 39 these proteins would first undergo lb eps when adsorbed by cells this might be one of the reasons that under the significant increase of sludge disintegration degree from 120 to 240 min the protein concentration in lb eps raised with the time the carbohydrate consistence in lb and tb eps expressed a trend of increase first and then decrease with the increase of treatment time fig 6b the increase was related to the disintegration of fucose rhamnose and arabinose etc in sludge 40 42 the carbohydrate concentration in hc group was higher than in control group implying that hc had a more destructive impact on sludge components than shearing force compared to protein the changed degrees of carbohydrate as the hc treatment time increase were lower suggesting that hc had a more destructive impact on protein than carbohydrate 3 5 effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on 3d eem in extracellular polymeric substances fig 7 illustrates the impacts of hc on the changes of 3d eem in lb and tb eps base on the consistent coverage of excitation and emission wavelength 3d eem was classified into 5 regions regions a and b were associated with aromatic proteins tyrosine and tryptophan respectively region c was related to fulvic acid region d was described as humic substances and region e corresponded to tyrosine and tryptophan proteins in soluble microbial products like substances 24 43 45 in control group the peaks from lb and tb eps were mainly concentrated in regions b and e at different treatment time indicating that protein in lb and tb eps was constituted of tyrosine and tryptophan mainly as the increase of time the peaks in regions b and e were always found in lb and tb eps while their strengths were reduced the changes suggested that in the control group the treatment time increase did not change protein composition in lb ans tb eps while decreased the protein levels in the hc group at 0 min the peaks from lb eps were mainly concentrated in regions b and e while those in tb eps were attributed to regions a and e as the increase of time in hc group the peaks in region b from lb eps at 120 min and in region a from tb eps at 240 min disappeared suggesting that the hc treatment time increase significantly changed protein composition in lb and tb eps the changes were related to the fact that the increase of free radical levels along with the production of high temperature and pressure produced by hc could destroyed protein composition and structure 5 46 in the hc group at 240 min the peaks in lb eps were still attributed to regions a and e compared to that at 0 min this was similar to the increase of protein levels in lb eps from 120 to 240 min in hc group which might be explained by the free protein from fracted cells in solutions would first be adsorbed by lb eps considering that tb eps and cells were located closer than lb eps 3 6 process of hc on sludge reduction the increase of hole in sludge sem fig a 1 and the decrease of mlss and mlvss values and sludge particle diameter suggested a sludge floc structure destruction by hc and the reduction of proteins and carbohydrates and the increase of scod and ddscod values indicated that hc caused eps destructions and cell elongations the increased proteins levels in lb eps might suggest that an increase of cellular permeability by hc the sum of proteins and carbohydrates contents from lb and tb eps always reduced with hc time suggesting that hc could destroy the intracellular materials leaking due to increased cell permeability based on the above changes we inferred that the process of hc on sludge reduction should be that hc firstly caused a sludge floc structure destruction and then eps destructions and cell elongations and finally cell wall destructions fig 8 previous studies found that hc could cause the increase of free radical levels along with the production of high temperature and high pressure 5 12 47 suggesting that those above factors might be the important driving force about the process of hc on sludge reduction the mechanism needed to be further studied the increase of hole in sludge sem fig a 1 and the decrease of mlss and mlvss values and sludge particle diameter suggested a sludge floc structure destruction by hc and the reduction of proteins and carbohydrates and the increase of scod and ddscod values indicated that hc caused eps destructions and cell elongations the increased proteins levels in lb eps might suggest that an increase of cellular permeability by hc the sum of proteins and carbohydrates contents from lb and tb eps always reduced with hc time suggesting that hc could destroy the intracellular materials leaking due to increased cell permeability based on the above changes we inferred that the process of hc on sludge reduction should be that hc firstly caused a sludge floc structure destruction and then eps destructions and cell elongations and finally cell wall destructions fig 8 previous studies found that hc could cause the increase of free radical levels along with the production of high temperature and high pressure 5 12 47 suggesting that those above factors might be the important driving force about the process of hc on sludge reduction the mechanism needed to be further studied 4 conclusion hc treatment caused the sludge reduction at 120 min while there was a fake increase of mlss and mlvss levels with hc time during 120 240 min the increase of hydrodynamic cavitation time could result in the increase of disintegration degree and organic matters dissolution in sludge and the decrease of sludge particle sizes the protein level in tb eps always decreased with the increasing hydrodynamic cavitation time while that in lb eps decreased firstly and then gradually increased hydrodynamic cavitation could destroy tryptophan and tyrosine protein in lb and tb eps the following is the supplementary data related to this article fig a 1 sem of sludge in hc group at different time a 0 min b 60 min c 120 min d 240 min fig a 1
