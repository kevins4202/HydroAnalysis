24660,meriones shawi m shawi is the main reservoir host for zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis zcl in central tunisia the incorporation of environmental and climatic effects on the spread of zcl in m shawi remains difficult this study presents an agent based model abm to overcome these difficulties and examine the impact of environment i e vegetation cover and climate i e temperature on m shawi movement and prevalence the model simulation considers two agent types rodent agent and field unit agent we tested the model according to two types of rodent movement random and thoughtful we integrated time dependent normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in order to test the land cover effects on rodent movement and zcl transmission the results confirmed that the spread of the disease depends on rodent movement we observed that prevalence and distribution are the closest to field data when the vegetation cover is highest and that rodents go for thoughtful movement in addition we found that the nature of movement random or thoughtful and prevalence depends strongly on minimum food detection keywords agent based model zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis meriones shawi ndvi temperature entropy 1 introduction infectious diseases are a global public health problem it is estimated that 75 of human infectious diseases originate from an animal reservoir and the majority are caused by viruses bacteria or parasites taylor et al 2001 among these diseases leishmaniasis is predominantly observed where 350 million people are at risk of contracting it and approximately 2 million new cases are reported each year arenas et al 2017 cutaneous leishmaniasis cl is a cutaneous infection caused by a unicellular parasite leishmania transmitted by the bites of a female insect called phlebotome or sandfly dedet 2009 in tunisia zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis zcl is caused by the parasite leishmania major l major ben ismail et al 1986 with its vector phlebotomus papatasi p papatasi killick kendrick 1999 the latter s reservoir species include rodents psammomys obesus cretzschmar 1828 meriones shawi duvernoy 1842 and meriones libycus lichtenstein 1823 the spatial dynamics of rodent populations involve several endogenous processes such as the availability of food resources or exogenous processes such as environmental and climatic processes chaves and hernandez 2004 bellali et al 2017 2019 according to the literature p obesus is known for its dietary restrictions and feeds mainly on chenopodiaceae ghawar et al 2011 it is considered a sedentary rodent with small home ranges daly and daly 1975 ghawar et al 2011 furthermore m shawi is an opportunistic rodent that is able to adapt to its diet according to the development of cultivated cereals adamou djerbaoui et al 2013 it is considered more mobile compared to p obesus ghawar et al 2015 the geographic information system gis data and machine learning are important for the management of epidemics because they allow the collection analysis and display of epidemic spatiotemporal information tabasi and alesheikh 2019 mollalo et al 2018 these approaches were used to study the distribution of rodent reservoirs and sandfly in particular the effect of the environment on the distribution of zcl has extensively investigated various studies have been conducted to describe the niche suitability of vectors hanafi bojd et al 2015 reservoirs gholamrezaei et al 2016 or both shiravand et al 2018 2019 using the maxent algorithm model particularly hanafi bojd et al 2015 proved that moisture precipitation and temperature are determining factors when assessing sandfly density furthermore bellali et al 2017 and talmoudi et al 2017 have shown a significant correlation between climate variables precipitation and temperature and the incidence of zcl and rodent and sandfly density one possible explanation for the latter observation is the correlation between that rodents and chenopodiaceous densities toumi et al 2012 various deterministic models have already been developed for epidemics of leishmaniasis from different perspectives carpenter et al 1992 and burattini et al 1998 developed structured models for canine leishmaniasis considering human and sandflies chaves and hernandez 2004 presented a model for the dynamics of transmission of american cutaneous leishmaniasis they obtained expressions that allow computing the threshold conditions for the persistence of the infection roy et al 2015 used the same approach but rather considered the effect of the time lag between the biting of a sandfly and the human infection in the other hand nadeem et al 2019 proposed a mathematical model of zcl concerning humans reservoirs and sandflies they describe zcl transmission and estimate the basic reproduction number r 0 using the next generation matrix threshold condition in addition they tested different strategies to control the disease based on the indices of parameters even though numerous studies were conducted on this topic rarely those who considered the temperature as a factor influencing the zcl transmission up to our knowledge only bacaër and guernaoui 2006 and mejhed et al 2009 have integrated this factor in their deterministic models in all these mathematical models the population and individual interactions are considered homogeneous this assumption results in difficulties in representing the variants of individual microscopic attributes and behaviors and implicitly assumes that all individuals are subject to the same process duan et al 2015 hunter et al 2018 an agent based model abm is an integrative approach that takes into account the individual behavior diversity the model is defined as a system comprising several entities or agents e g individual that operate in an environment in which they are located this agent is characterized by attributes behaviors capacities of perception and communication treuil et al 2008 grignard 2015 in this context abm makes it possible to represent and link different levels of detail such as the effect of the spatial dynamics of the reservoir on the transmission of vector borne diseases grimm et al 2006 or the integration of the metapopulation model in the context of rodent dynamics marilleau et al 2018 rajabi et al 2016 used an abm with two types of agents which are the sandfly and the human in a structured environment road land cover river knowing that the infection probability depends on the environmental they were able to confirm that desertification zones are the main source of zcl and the local populations are the most exposed to sandflies recently rajabi et al 2018 used an abm to simulate authority interventions on rhombomys opimus rodent reservoir of zcl in iran population to minimize zcl incidence they showed the impact of habitat configurations and human made changes on rodent communities and their dynamics more recently tabasi et al 2020 used an abm to represent the complete cycle of zcl disease i e human sandfly rodent and environmental behaviors using an hybrid model they showed that the spread of zcl is important in some regions like the desert low altitude areas and riverside population centers they also confirmed that restricted human movement is an important factor contributing to the reduction of transmission frequency in our study we developed an abm to determine how the rodents i e m shawi movement types can affect transmission zcl transmission taking into account time dependent environmental i e vegetation cover and climate constraints i e temperature indeed we assumed that vegetation cover is updated each month using ndvi values and may vary depending on rodent consumption in addition we supposed that rodents decisions e g decision to move choice of directions are affected by the vegetation cover mollalo et al 2014 ghawar et al 2015 we simulated two types of rodents movement a random movement and a so called thoughtful movement where rodents can choose their direction after evaluating the state of vegetation based on their memories in addition we have tested ndvi effects on the transmission of the epidemic in section 2 we present the background and hypothesis used in the model in section 3 we describe the model according to the overview design concepts and details odd protocol grimm et al 2010 to standardize its description in section 4 we present the main results in section 5 we discuss our results finally in section 6 we present the conclusion of our work 2 background climatic and environmental factors impact rodents distribution hamidi et al 2018 in fact the rodents reproductive cycle is indirectly influenced by climatic conditions as the latter influence such as the resource availability stenseth 1999 2003 marstona et al 2007 and chidodo et al 2020 showed a correlation between vegetation cover and rodent distribution when the resource is abundant rodents tend to be close to foraging areas otherwise their movement is random when the food became rare ghawar et al 2015 this is probably resulting from rodents ability to assess to food through the information they have on the occupied area at the vector level sandflies are characterized as thermophilic requiring high temperatures for their development and survival koch et al 2017 see fig 1 at the parasite level l major an increase in temperature increases the rate at which parasites approach maturity and multiply which promotes transmission of the infection clémence 2009 however when the parasite is in the intestine of infected sandflies it remains at the same temperature as his host zilberstein and shapira 1994 which considered as the environment temperature see fig 1 considering temperature or humidity explicitly in the population dynamics model through the sandfly life cycle is difficult to overcome this we assumed that there is a positive correlation between ndvi and temperature on the one hand wang et al 2003 and infection probability on the other mollalo et al 2014 shiravand et al 2018 more precisely we suppose that the zcl infection probability depends linearly on the sandfly density which depends on temperature via a bell like function the height of the bell depends on ndvi this hypothesis is not meaningless as mollalo et al 2015 garni et al 2014 and shiravand et al 2018 developed a model to discuss the associations between ndvi and the incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis therefore temperature and ndvi can be considered as good proxies for the presence probability of both vectors and reservoirs shiravand et al 2018 our study presents a simulation of m shawi activity in a spatially heterogeneous environment incorporating individual based interactions we used empirical data on rodents and their habitat and zcl incidence in el manara region average altitude 80 8483 m lat 35 1 2 3 6 n long 9 4 9 1 4 e in nasrallah kairouan central tunisia see fig 2 the area is a semiarid plain located at an altitude of 205 1304 m and is composed of arthrophytum sp retama sp ziziphus mound and opuntia hedges ghawar et al 2011 additionally el manara has long been known as one of the most important endemic areas of zcl bettaieb et al 2014 and m shawi is the main reservoir host of zcl in this area the annual incidence rate in kairouan has been high in recent decades including approximately 34 4 100 000 inhabits and the disease has recently emerged in non endemic regions of the province chraiet rezgani et al 2016 our model does not incorporate humans as agents however human induced changes are included to explore the consequences of disease evolution among rodent population dynamics as such the model can be a useful tool for informing healthcare authorities in planning intervention strategies to control the spread of zcl 3 the model the model description follows odd protocol for describing agent based models grimm et al 2010 in the remainder of this section and after a brief overview of the model components and process see section 3 1 the key concepts of model design including emergence objective sensing adaptation stochasticity and observation are described see section 3 2 next the details of the model implementation are presented see section 3 3 3 1 overview our main objective is to design a spatial abm of the zcl spread among rodents including environmental and climatic data and agent objects the model was developed in the gama 1 7 platform taillandier et al 2019 3 1 1 purpose the model was developed to provide a spatiotemporal simulation of the spread of zcl between rodents m shawi we assumed two types of movement random and thoughtful the thoughtful movement depends on the vegetation density where the rodent is able to evaluate the best destination the model includes climatic factors e g temperature and environmental e g ndvi factors influence the movement and spread of the zcl between rodents 3 1 2 entity state variables and scales there are two types of agents in the model rodent agent and field unit agent representing part of the space see fig 3 the rodent agents they are described by their identifier position and epidemiological status concerning zcl susceptible or infected and by two matrices m i n f o and m f o o d see table 1 the field unit agents they form the grid and represent the environment of the abm they are attributed by their identifier and by f c e l l representing the quantity of food present in the cell it changes according to the quantity consumed by the rodent agent and is updated each month according to the integrated ndvi values the grid contains 1530 field units the area of each unit is 895 m 2 and its surface is 1 37 km 2 the choice of the value is based on our observations on the field for a project to be conducted in 2012 ghawar et al 2015 regarding temporal resolution the time step of the simulation was fixed to 1 h the model has been designed to perform simulations for up to 5 years 3 1 3 process overview and scheduling the simulation time step represents one hour except for the recovery process which is operated every week rodent agent first rodent agents appear in the landscape at different random locations then rodent agents are processed using the consumption process under particular conditions when the quantity of food becomes insufficient the rodent agents choose a destination and move to another cell then the matrix update process is activated subsequently the memory loss process is operated see fig 4 field unit agent first the field unit values are updated according to the environmental parameters ndvi at each time step the values of the quantity of food decrease according to the number of rodent agents present in the cell and their consumption speed a f c o n s u m at each month the field unit values are re updated according to the values of the integrated ndvi the model simulates the interactions between rodent agents on the one hand and between rodent agents and field unit agents on the other hand over time the infected agent rodents perceive susceptible rodents in the same cell then the infection process is activated subsequently and at each week the recovery process is performed see figs 5 and 6 3 2 design concepts 3 2 1 emergence depending on the evolution of f c e l l we observe a spread of the epidemic that takes into account the mobility interactions and characteristics of the rodent agents 3 2 2 objective the objective of the agent is to find and consume food the way to find food depends on the type of rodents movement random or thoughtful 3 2 3 sensing rodent agents know how to identify suitable habitats within the environment and they perceive the cell information status from m f o o d in addition they can perceive other rodent agents located in the same field unit 3 2 4 adaptation the agents adapt their type of movement random or thoughtful to the amount of food in cells this adaptation depends on the value of minimum food detection a f m i n 3 2 5 stochasticity the agents move randomly through space by one spatial unit e g grid cells and they choose one of the cells in the proximity the infection probability follows a gaussian law in the recovery process the agent choice of the direction all includes elements of stochasticity 3 2 6 observation spatiotemporal variations in the rodent level process have been observed in the model these included the number of susceptible and infected rodents at each step of the time we also monitored the number of times the rodent agents passed through each agent cell moreover at the end of each simulation we reported the infected density prevalence as p n i n f n 0 and the susceptible density noted s n s n 0 n i n f is the number of infected rodent agents n s is the number of susceptible rodents and n 0 is the total number of rodent agents we also report the entropy h of the occupied site distribution we assumed that the random variable x x 1 x m where x i is the number of times the site i m is visited random variable follows a multinomial distribution of parameter n p 1 p m where m is the site number m 1531 x 1 x m n n is the total number of rodent movements and p i i m is the probability that a rodent has occupied site i we have i 1 m p i 1 therefore we have 1 f x 1 x k n p 1 p k pr x 1 x 1 and and x k x k 2 n x 1 x k p 1 x 1 p k x k when i 1 k x i n 0 otherwise in the case where sites are chosen equiprobably e g no food on site and rodents have no sensory organs or memory and move randomly the law is an equi distributed multinomial and p i p 1 m we have 3 f x 1 x k n p p pr x 1 x 1 and and x k x k 4 n x 1 x k p n when i 1 k x i n 0 otherwise to evaluate the values of p i and as each simulation has a different total number of movements we normalize n to 5000 a good estimator of p i is p i n i n where n i is the normalized number of site visits i calculated from either field observation data or simulation data 3 3 details 3 3 1 initialization 50 rodents were randomly created throughout the environment with a susceptible status only one infected rodent were randomly selected the initial values of m f o o d and m i n f o were 0 table 2 represents the model initialization parameters 3 3 2 input data at the beginning of each month a satellite map is included containing the ndvi values of each cell representing the amount of resources produced the maps with a surface area of 1 37 km 2 were downloaded for each month using the l a n d s a t 8 sensor 30 m resolution and processed in arcgis 10 3 we calculated the monthly ndvi values for each cell between 0 and 1 to test their effects on the model simulation we integrated three types of ndvi n d v i m a x these are the maximum monthly values of the ndvi collected on 2014 whose plant density is considered the highest n d v i m e a n these are the average monthly values of the ndvi between 2013 and 2017 n d v i m i n these are the minimum monthly values of the ndvi collected on 2015 whose plant density is considered the lowest average monthly temperatures were obtained from a weather forecasting station that was implemented in the study area in 2012 data not shown 3 3 3 submodels consumption submodel if f c e l l is a f m i n the rodent agent consumes food with a consumption rate of a f c o n s u m the variation in food quantity f c e l l is governed by the following equation 5 f c e l l t δ t f c e l l t min f c e l l a f c o n s u m matrices update process for each time step the following algorithm which describes the matrices update is run movement submodel we performed the two scenarios of movement by setting parameters that affect the type of movement random versus thoughtful a f c o n s u m a f m i n and l m e m o r y two different dispersal behaviors were identified random the rodent agent moves cell by cell from a cell the rodent randomly chooses the next neighboring cells this behavior is applied to each agent at each step when a f m i n is high a f m i n 0 7 in this case the minimum quantity of food that the agent must detect in order to move is greater than that available in neighboring cells so the rodent moves randomly thoughtful the rodent agent makes a selection of a neighboring cell this choice is made with regard to the values of m f o o d and m i n f o rodent moves according to the information collected on the vegetation status of neighboring cells the cell chosen is the one that maximizes the forward term product of the two matrices m i n f o and m f o o d if this maximum is less than a certain value previously set noted v m i n the movement will be random memory loss submodel in the model we assumed that the rodent agent can forget information about a cell that has visited before for this purpose the values of the m f o o d matrix are multiplied by a previously set rate l m e m o r y infection submodel at every step susceptible rodent agents can be contaminated with an infection probability p that depends on the temperature and ndvi since these two factors have an impact on the transmission of the epidemic p follows a gaussian law based on the assumption that plants grow if the temperature increases except that above a set value plant density decreases on the other hand we supposed that each susceptible agent observes at the infected agents in its proximity at a distance of r i n f e c t i o n set at 0 we assumed that the transmission of the epidemic can only occur if a susceptible and an infected agent occupy the same cell 6 p α ndvi σ 2 π exp t t o p t i m a l 2 2 σ 2 where σ t m a x t o p t i m a l 2 t m i n t o p t i m a l 2 2 t is the field temperature t o p t i m a l is the average temperature t m a x is the maximum temperature t m i n is the minimum temperature and α is the infection factor recovery submodel at the end of each week infected rodents can be recovered with a fixed recovery probability γ food evolution submodel the evolution of f c e l l is related to the values of the integrated ndvi which represents the initial quantity of food at the beginning of each month f c e l l ndvi ndvi is integrated in the form of a monthly satellite map of the el manara region these images provide us with information on the vegetation status of the field this process is operated every month once the consumption process is activated f c e l l decreases with the agent consumption 4 results simulations were performed using the gama 1 7 0 platform to develop the agent based simulator python 3 to generate the experiment plan and sensitivity analysis to see the movement effect ı e random or thoughtful and the ndvi choice ı e n d v i m i n n d v i m e a n and n d v i m a x on the spread of the epidemic i e the infected versus susceptible rodents we performed a simulation of 50 agents over 5 years each simulation was repeated 30 times we have represented on figs 7 and 8 the average of infected density and susceptible density on the simulations in the thoughtful movement we set a f c o n s u m 0 001 a f m i n 0 2 and l m e m o r y 0 8 however to obtain a random movement we fixed a f m i n 0 7 we tested the model using an exhaustive method that consists all the possible combinations of the parameters basic and modified and reviewing those that give prevalence close to that of reality to the best of our knowledge there is only one study in central tunisia that demonstrated the prevalence of l major infection among m shawi rodents ghawar et al 2011 the prevalence of l major for indirect fluorescent antibody test was 0 33 we noted that the type of movement affects the variation in infected density in the random movement case all rodents become infected see fig 7 the same behavior can also be observed in the case of n d v i m i n when the movement is thoughtful fig 8c in the n d v i m e a n case thoughtful movement the majority of rodents are infected between 94 and 98 we also observed a slight decrease in the infected density over the last 2 years see fig 8b in n d v i m a x case when the movement is thoughtful fig 8a there is a small increase in the infected density with a stability at the end of the simulation 30 of rodents are infected we calculated the average prevalence in the last 3 years that p m a x p m e a n and p m i n corresponding to n d v i m a x n d v i m e a n and n d v i m i n respectively it can be seen that they are greater in the first scenario random movement thus we noticed that the average prevalence is inversely proportional to the ndvi values in the case of thoughtful movement see table 3 to examine the distribution of rodents in the cells and compare them with those in the field we calculated the entropies noted h m a x r h m e a n r and h m i n r corresponding to the first scenario random movement and h m a x t h h m e a n t h and h m i n t h corresponding to the second scenario thoughtful movement we calculated the entropy ratio r h h f i e l d h f i e l d is the entropy of the real distribution of rodents in the field to compare the model entropies and field data fig 9 the results showed that when the movement is random the entropy ratio is almost equal to the maximum entropy ratio r u n i f o r m the most disordered state moreover we noted that when the movement is thoughtful the entropy ratio is close to that of the field the value of the entropy ratio closest to that of the field is in the case of ndvi n d v i m a x and it has been noted that if the simulation time is greater the ratio entropy r m a x t h is close to the value 1 r f i e l d finally we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the parameters that could influence the prevalence this analysis was applied in the thoughtful movement case when the ndvi was maximum thus we used the one factor at a time cariboni et al 2007 saltelli et al 2008 sensitivity analysis method that consists of selecting a base parameter setting and varying one parameter by 10 at a time while keeping all other parameters fixed each simulation was repeated 30 times the infection factor α recovery probability γ consumption rate a f c o n s u m minimum food detected a f m i n and loss memory rate l m e m o r y parameters were tested fig 10 shows the variations in prevalence and standard deviation according to the modified parameters in addition a linear regression analysis was performed for each case we estimated the coefficient of determination slope and intercept for each curve table 4 the results show the effect of seasonality on the variation in prevalence and standard deviation in addition we noted that practically all the curves have the same slope which is very low in the order of 10 4 this weakness can be explained by the stability of prevalence in the last 3 years in addition we noted the impact of the parameters on prevalence and sd values for example in fig 10c when the recovery probability γ is high the prevalence value becomes lower in the figure when a f c o n s u m is high the prevalence value increases see table 5 we then performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of the 5 parameters on the mean prevalence over the last 3 years we observe that the minimum food detected a f m i n has a major effect on the mean prevalence which increases by 0 2 the minimum food detected a f m i n and the loss memory rate l m e m o r y have a positive effect however the recovery probability γ has a negative effect see figs 11a and 11b 5 discussion our results highlight the importance of considering the type of movement random or thoughtful of reservoir rodents considering their influence on the transmission of the epidemic in the first scenario random movement the prevalence values were higher than those in the second scenario this difference can be explained by the activity of rodents who forage randomly the fact that the movement is random implies that the probability of an encounter is a product of the frequencies of the infected and susceptible rodents i e mass action law thus in this case our model is close to an sis model susceptible infected susceptible epidemiological model the term close refers to the fact that rodents spend the maximum of their time foraging i e the case where n d v i n d v i m e a n and n d v i n d v i m i n in the case where n d v i n d v i m a x the fluctuations may be due to the fact that rodents spend more time consuming food thus there is a lower possibility of being infected in the second scenario when rodents accessed food more rapidly the risk of infection was reduced because the probability of an encounter was lower this explanation is supported by the fact that in the case where ndvi is weak ı e n d v i n d v i m i n the number of infected rodents becomes high again if food is scarce the information on feeding sites is low therefore the rodents adopt random movement regarding temperature its effect can only appear through the infection probability p see formula 6 note that the effect of ndvi also appears through the movement of rodents which influences the probability of encounter in the model the simulations show that ndvi has a more dominant effect than temperature moreover in the second scenario we noticed that the effect of temperature is observed in the fluctuations in figs 8a and 8b additionally when ndvi increases the prevalence decreases fig 8 this result was also observed by shirzadi et al 2015 and shiravand et al 2018 which showed that the incidence of leishmaniasis increased in areas where vegetation coverage was low in the same context mollalo et al 2014 showed that the decrease of the vegetation cover is accompanied by an increase of epidemic occurrence and vice versa the prevalence and rodents strategies that provides closest results to those observed in the field are when the rodents movement is thoughtful and when n d v i n d v i m a x ghawar et al 2011 moreover fig 9 demonstrated that the thoughtful movement is similar to the field rodents motion these results are consistent with rajabi et al 2018 the latter found that rodents adapt their direction and movement depending on food suitability and availability field observation of ghawar et al 2015 showed that the higher vegetation cover is the more new actives burrows are detected indicating that m shawi can assess the vegetation abundance even though relevant findings are reported in this current study a more comprehensive multispecies model which includes human and sandflies parameters would provide a deeper understanding of the zcl transmission cycle the lack of data on sandfly densities in tunisia and on its association with plant density ndvi makes such the achievement of such study currently difficult moreover no studies have been conducted on the demographic processes births deaths in rodent reservoirs other climatic factors such as rainfall and humidity which influence the transmission of zcl are also important however in our case these data were insufficient thus we used ndvi as an environmental factor which depends on rainfall and humidity it can be used when climate data as well as environmental characteristics of the site are not available gaudart et al 2009 6 conclusion in conclusion our study provides an overview of the effects of climate i e temperature and environmental i e ndvi parameters on the rodents movements in a limited geographical area by using an abm in order to simulate the transmission of zcl among rodents we considered two types of rodents movement random or thoughtful we observed that ndvi has a more dominant effect than temperature and the transmission of zcl was increased by decreasing the value of ndvi the findings reported in this current study would improve comprehension of the zcl spread dynamics in larger areas and thus to be subsequently used to implement prevention and control strategies of the epidemic credit authorship

24660,meriones shawi m shawi is the main reservoir host for zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis zcl in central tunisia the incorporation of environmental and climatic effects on the spread of zcl in m shawi remains difficult this study presents an agent based model abm to overcome these difficulties and examine the impact of environment i e vegetation cover and climate i e temperature on m shawi movement and prevalence the model simulation considers two agent types rodent agent and field unit agent we tested the model according to two types of rodent movement random and thoughtful we integrated time dependent normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in order to test the land cover effects on rodent movement and zcl transmission the results confirmed that the spread of the disease depends on rodent movement we observed that prevalence and distribution are the closest to field data when the vegetation cover is highest and that rodents go for thoughtful movement in addition we found that the nature of movement random or thoughtful and prevalence depends strongly on minimum food detection keywords agent based model zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis meriones shawi ndvi temperature entropy 1 introduction infectious diseases are a global public health problem it is estimated that 75 of human infectious diseases originate from an animal reservoir and the majority are caused by viruses bacteria or parasites taylor et al 2001 among these diseases leishmaniasis is predominantly observed where 350 million people are at risk of contracting it and approximately 2 million new cases are reported each year arenas et al 2017 cutaneous leishmaniasis cl is a cutaneous infection caused by a unicellular parasite leishmania transmitted by the bites of a female insect called phlebotome or sandfly dedet 2009 in tunisia zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis zcl is caused by the parasite leishmania major l major ben ismail et al 1986 with its vector phlebotomus papatasi p papatasi killick kendrick 1999 the latter s reservoir species include rodents psammomys obesus cretzschmar 1828 meriones shawi duvernoy 1842 and meriones libycus lichtenstein 1823 the spatial dynamics of rodent populations involve several endogenous processes such as the availability of food resources or exogenous processes such as environmental and climatic processes chaves and hernandez 2004 bellali et al 2017 2019 according to the literature p obesus is known for its dietary restrictions and feeds mainly on chenopodiaceae ghawar et al 2011 it is considered a sedentary rodent with small home ranges daly and daly 1975 ghawar et al 2011 furthermore m shawi is an opportunistic rodent that is able to adapt to its diet according to the development of cultivated cereals adamou djerbaoui et al 2013 it is considered more mobile compared to p obesus ghawar et al 2015 the geographic information system gis data and machine learning are important for the management of epidemics because they allow the collection analysis and display of epidemic spatiotemporal information tabasi and alesheikh 2019 mollalo et al 2018 these approaches were used to study the distribution of rodent reservoirs and sandfly in particular the effect of the environment on the distribution of zcl has extensively investigated various studies have been conducted to describe the niche suitability of vectors hanafi bojd et al 2015 reservoirs gholamrezaei et al 2016 or both shiravand et al 2018 2019 using the maxent algorithm model particularly hanafi bojd et al 2015 proved that moisture precipitation and temperature are determining factors when assessing sandfly density furthermore bellali et al 2017 and talmoudi et al 2017 have shown a significant correlation between climate variables precipitation and temperature and the incidence of zcl and rodent and sandfly density one possible explanation for the latter observation is the correlation between that rodents and chenopodiaceous densities toumi et al 2012 various deterministic models have already been developed for epidemics of leishmaniasis from different perspectives carpenter et al 1992 and burattini et al 1998 developed structured models for canine leishmaniasis considering human and sandflies chaves and hernandez 2004 presented a model for the dynamics of transmission of american cutaneous leishmaniasis they obtained expressions that allow computing the threshold conditions for the persistence of the infection roy et al 2015 used the same approach but rather considered the effect of the time lag between the biting of a sandfly and the human infection in the other hand nadeem et al 2019 proposed a mathematical model of zcl concerning humans reservoirs and sandflies they describe zcl transmission and estimate the basic reproduction number r 0 using the next generation matrix threshold condition in addition they tested different strategies to control the disease based on the indices of parameters even though numerous studies were conducted on this topic rarely those who considered the temperature as a factor influencing the zcl transmission up to our knowledge only bacaër and guernaoui 2006 and mejhed et al 2009 have integrated this factor in their deterministic models in all these mathematical models the population and individual interactions are considered homogeneous this assumption results in difficulties in representing the variants of individual microscopic attributes and behaviors and implicitly assumes that all individuals are subject to the same process duan et al 2015 hunter et al 2018 an agent based model abm is an integrative approach that takes into account the individual behavior diversity the model is defined as a system comprising several entities or agents e g individual that operate in an environment in which they are located this agent is characterized by attributes behaviors capacities of perception and communication treuil et al 2008 grignard 2015 in this context abm makes it possible to represent and link different levels of detail such as the effect of the spatial dynamics of the reservoir on the transmission of vector borne diseases grimm et al 2006 or the integration of the metapopulation model in the context of rodent dynamics marilleau et al 2018 rajabi et al 2016 used an abm with two types of agents which are the sandfly and the human in a structured environment road land cover river knowing that the infection probability depends on the environmental they were able to confirm that desertification zones are the main source of zcl and the local populations are the most exposed to sandflies recently rajabi et al 2018 used an abm to simulate authority interventions on rhombomys opimus rodent reservoir of zcl in iran population to minimize zcl incidence they showed the impact of habitat configurations and human made changes on rodent communities and their dynamics more recently tabasi et al 2020 used an abm to represent the complete cycle of zcl disease i e human sandfly rodent and environmental behaviors using an hybrid model they showed that the spread of zcl is important in some regions like the desert low altitude areas and riverside population centers they also confirmed that restricted human movement is an important factor contributing to the reduction of transmission frequency in our study we developed an abm to determine how the rodents i e m shawi movement types can affect transmission zcl transmission taking into account time dependent environmental i e vegetation cover and climate constraints i e temperature indeed we assumed that vegetation cover is updated each month using ndvi values and may vary depending on rodent consumption in addition we supposed that rodents decisions e g decision to move choice of directions are affected by the vegetation cover mollalo et al 2014 ghawar et al 2015 we simulated two types of rodents movement a random movement and a so called thoughtful movement where rodents can choose their direction after evaluating the state of vegetation based on their memories in addition we have tested ndvi effects on the transmission of the epidemic in section 2 we present the background and hypothesis used in the model in section 3 we describe the model according to the overview design concepts and details odd protocol grimm et al 2010 to standardize its description in section 4 we present the main results in section 5 we discuss our results finally in section 6 we present the conclusion of our work 2 background climatic and environmental factors impact rodents distribution hamidi et al 2018 in fact the rodents reproductive cycle is indirectly influenced by climatic conditions as the latter influence such as the resource availability stenseth 1999 2003 marstona et al 2007 and chidodo et al 2020 showed a correlation between vegetation cover and rodent distribution when the resource is abundant rodents tend to be close to foraging areas otherwise their movement is random when the food became rare ghawar et al 2015 this is probably resulting from rodents ability to assess to food through the information they have on the occupied area at the vector level sandflies are characterized as thermophilic requiring high temperatures for their development and survival koch et al 2017 see fig 1 at the parasite level l major an increase in temperature increases the rate at which parasites approach maturity and multiply which promotes transmission of the infection clémence 2009 however when the parasite is in the intestine of infected sandflies it remains at the same temperature as his host zilberstein and shapira 1994 which considered as the environment temperature see fig 1 considering temperature or humidity explicitly in the population dynamics model through the sandfly life cycle is difficult to overcome this we assumed that there is a positive correlation between ndvi and temperature on the one hand wang et al 2003 and infection probability on the other mollalo et al 2014 shiravand et al 2018 more precisely we suppose that the zcl infection probability depends linearly on the sandfly density which depends on temperature via a bell like function the height of the bell depends on ndvi this hypothesis is not meaningless as mollalo et al 2015 garni et al 2014 and shiravand et al 2018 developed a model to discuss the associations between ndvi and the incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis therefore temperature and ndvi can be considered as good proxies for the presence probability of both vectors and reservoirs shiravand et al 2018 our study presents a simulation of m shawi activity in a spatially heterogeneous environment incorporating individual based interactions we used empirical data on rodents and their habitat and zcl incidence in el manara region average altitude 80 8483 m lat 35 1 2 3 6 n long 9 4 9 1 4 e in nasrallah kairouan central tunisia see fig 2 the area is a semiarid plain located at an altitude of 205 1304 m and is composed of arthrophytum sp retama sp ziziphus mound and opuntia hedges ghawar et al 2011 additionally el manara has long been known as one of the most important endemic areas of zcl bettaieb et al 2014 and m shawi is the main reservoir host of zcl in this area the annual incidence rate in kairouan has been high in recent decades including approximately 34 4 100 000 inhabits and the disease has recently emerged in non endemic regions of the province chraiet rezgani et al 2016 our model does not incorporate humans as agents however human induced changes are included to explore the consequences of disease evolution among rodent population dynamics as such the model can be a useful tool for informing healthcare authorities in planning intervention strategies to control the spread of zcl 3 the model the model description follows odd protocol for describing agent based models grimm et al 2010 in the remainder of this section and after a brief overview of the model components and process see section 3 1 the key concepts of model design including emergence objective sensing adaptation stochasticity and observation are described see section 3 2 next the details of the model implementation are presented see section 3 3 3 1 overview our main objective is to design a spatial abm of the zcl spread among rodents including environmental and climatic data and agent objects the model was developed in the gama 1 7 platform taillandier et al 2019 3 1 1 purpose the model was developed to provide a spatiotemporal simulation of the spread of zcl between rodents m shawi we assumed two types of movement random and thoughtful the thoughtful movement depends on the vegetation density where the rodent is able to evaluate the best destination the model includes climatic factors e g temperature and environmental e g ndvi factors influence the movement and spread of the zcl between rodents 3 1 2 entity state variables and scales there are two types of agents in the model rodent agent and field unit agent representing part of the space see fig 3 the rodent agents they are described by their identifier position and epidemiological status concerning zcl susceptible or infected and by two matrices m i n f o and m f o o d see table 1 the field unit agents they form the grid and represent the environment of the abm they are attributed by their identifier and by f c e l l representing the quantity of food present in the cell it changes according to the quantity consumed by the rodent agent and is updated each month according to the integrated ndvi values the grid contains 1530 field units the area of each unit is 895 m 2 and its surface is 1 37 km 2 the choice of the value is based on our observations on the field for a project to be conducted in 2012 ghawar et al 2015 regarding temporal resolution the time step of the simulation was fixed to 1 h the model has been designed to perform simulations for up to 5 years 3 1 3 process overview and scheduling the simulation time step represents one hour except for the recovery process which is operated every week rodent agent first rodent agents appear in the landscape at different random locations then rodent agents are processed using the consumption process under particular conditions when the quantity of food becomes insufficient the rodent agents choose a destination and move to another cell then the matrix update process is activated subsequently the memory loss process is operated see fig 4 field unit agent first the field unit values are updated according to the environmental parameters ndvi at each time step the values of the quantity of food decrease according to the number of rodent agents present in the cell and their consumption speed a f c o n s u m at each month the field unit values are re updated according to the values of the integrated ndvi the model simulates the interactions between rodent agents on the one hand and between rodent agents and field unit agents on the other hand over time the infected agent rodents perceive susceptible rodents in the same cell then the infection process is activated subsequently and at each week the recovery process is performed see figs 5 and 6 3 2 design concepts 3 2 1 emergence depending on the evolution of f c e l l we observe a spread of the epidemic that takes into account the mobility interactions and characteristics of the rodent agents 3 2 2 objective the objective of the agent is to find and consume food the way to find food depends on the type of rodents movement random or thoughtful 3 2 3 sensing rodent agents know how to identify suitable habitats within the environment and they perceive the cell information status from m f o o d in addition they can perceive other rodent agents located in the same field unit 3 2 4 adaptation the agents adapt their type of movement random or thoughtful to the amount of food in cells this adaptation depends on the value of minimum food detection a f m i n 3 2 5 stochasticity the agents move randomly through space by one spatial unit e g grid cells and they choose one of the cells in the proximity the infection probability follows a gaussian law in the recovery process the agent choice of the direction all includes elements of stochasticity 3 2 6 observation spatiotemporal variations in the rodent level process have been observed in the model these included the number of susceptible and infected rodents at each step of the time we also monitored the number of times the rodent agents passed through each agent cell moreover at the end of each simulation we reported the infected density prevalence as p n i n f n 0 and the susceptible density noted s n s n 0 n i n f is the number of infected rodent agents n s is the number of susceptible rodents and n 0 is the total number of rodent agents we also report the entropy h of the occupied site distribution we assumed that the random variable x x 1 x m where x i is the number of times the site i m is visited random variable follows a multinomial distribution of parameter n p 1 p m where m is the site number m 1531 x 1 x m n n is the total number of rodent movements and p i i m is the probability that a rodent has occupied site i we have i 1 m p i 1 therefore we have 1 f x 1 x k n p 1 p k pr x 1 x 1 and and x k x k 2 n x 1 x k p 1 x 1 p k x k when i 1 k x i n 0 otherwise in the case where sites are chosen equiprobably e g no food on site and rodents have no sensory organs or memory and move randomly the law is an equi distributed multinomial and p i p 1 m we have 3 f x 1 x k n p p pr x 1 x 1 and and x k x k 4 n x 1 x k p n when i 1 k x i n 0 otherwise to evaluate the values of p i and as each simulation has a different total number of movements we normalize n to 5000 a good estimator of p i is p i n i n where n i is the normalized number of site visits i calculated from either field observation data or simulation data 3 3 details 3 3 1 initialization 50 rodents were randomly created throughout the environment with a susceptible status only one infected rodent were randomly selected the initial values of m f o o d and m i n f o were 0 table 2 represents the model initialization parameters 3 3 2 input data at the beginning of each month a satellite map is included containing the ndvi values of each cell representing the amount of resources produced the maps with a surface area of 1 37 km 2 were downloaded for each month using the l a n d s a t 8 sensor 30 m resolution and processed in arcgis 10 3 we calculated the monthly ndvi values for each cell between 0 and 1 to test their effects on the model simulation we integrated three types of ndvi n d v i m a x these are the maximum monthly values of the ndvi collected on 2014 whose plant density is considered the highest n d v i m e a n these are the average monthly values of the ndvi between 2013 and 2017 n d v i m i n these are the minimum monthly values of the ndvi collected on 2015 whose plant density is considered the lowest average monthly temperatures were obtained from a weather forecasting station that was implemented in the study area in 2012 data not shown 3 3 3 submodels consumption submodel if f c e l l is a f m i n the rodent agent consumes food with a consumption rate of a f c o n s u m the variation in food quantity f c e l l is governed by the following equation 5 f c e l l t δ t f c e l l t min f c e l l a f c o n s u m matrices update process for each time step the following algorithm which describes the matrices update is run movement submodel we performed the two scenarios of movement by setting parameters that affect the type of movement random versus thoughtful a f c o n s u m a f m i n and l m e m o r y two different dispersal behaviors were identified random the rodent agent moves cell by cell from a cell the rodent randomly chooses the next neighboring cells this behavior is applied to each agent at each step when a f m i n is high a f m i n 0 7 in this case the minimum quantity of food that the agent must detect in order to move is greater than that available in neighboring cells so the rodent moves randomly thoughtful the rodent agent makes a selection of a neighboring cell this choice is made with regard to the values of m f o o d and m i n f o rodent moves according to the information collected on the vegetation status of neighboring cells the cell chosen is the one that maximizes the forward term product of the two matrices m i n f o and m f o o d if this maximum is less than a certain value previously set noted v m i n the movement will be random memory loss submodel in the model we assumed that the rodent agent can forget information about a cell that has visited before for this purpose the values of the m f o o d matrix are multiplied by a previously set rate l m e m o r y infection submodel at every step susceptible rodent agents can be contaminated with an infection probability p that depends on the temperature and ndvi since these two factors have an impact on the transmission of the epidemic p follows a gaussian law based on the assumption that plants grow if the temperature increases except that above a set value plant density decreases on the other hand we supposed that each susceptible agent observes at the infected agents in its proximity at a distance of r i n f e c t i o n set at 0 we assumed that the transmission of the epidemic can only occur if a susceptible and an infected agent occupy the same cell 6 p α ndvi σ 2 π exp t t o p t i m a l 2 2 σ 2 where σ t m a x t o p t i m a l 2 t m i n t o p t i m a l 2 2 t is the field temperature t o p t i m a l is the average temperature t m a x is the maximum temperature t m i n is the minimum temperature and α is the infection factor recovery submodel at the end of each week infected rodents can be recovered with a fixed recovery probability γ food evolution submodel the evolution of f c e l l is related to the values of the integrated ndvi which represents the initial quantity of food at the beginning of each month f c e l l ndvi ndvi is integrated in the form of a monthly satellite map of the el manara region these images provide us with information on the vegetation status of the field this process is operated every month once the consumption process is activated f c e l l decreases with the agent consumption 4 results simulations were performed using the gama 1 7 0 platform to develop the agent based simulator python 3 to generate the experiment plan and sensitivity analysis to see the movement effect ı e random or thoughtful and the ndvi choice ı e n d v i m i n n d v i m e a n and n d v i m a x on the spread of the epidemic i e the infected versus susceptible rodents we performed a simulation of 50 agents over 5 years each simulation was repeated 30 times we have represented on figs 7 and 8 the average of infected density and susceptible density on the simulations in the thoughtful movement we set a f c o n s u m 0 001 a f m i n 0 2 and l m e m o r y 0 8 however to obtain a random movement we fixed a f m i n 0 7 we tested the model using an exhaustive method that consists all the possible combinations of the parameters basic and modified and reviewing those that give prevalence close to that of reality to the best of our knowledge there is only one study in central tunisia that demonstrated the prevalence of l major infection among m shawi rodents ghawar et al 2011 the prevalence of l major for indirect fluorescent antibody test was 0 33 we noted that the type of movement affects the variation in infected density in the random movement case all rodents become infected see fig 7 the same behavior can also be observed in the case of n d v i m i n when the movement is thoughtful fig 8c in the n d v i m e a n case thoughtful movement the majority of rodents are infected between 94 and 98 we also observed a slight decrease in the infected density over the last 2 years see fig 8b in n d v i m a x case when the movement is thoughtful fig 8a there is a small increase in the infected density with a stability at the end of the simulation 30 of rodents are infected we calculated the average prevalence in the last 3 years that p m a x p m e a n and p m i n corresponding to n d v i m a x n d v i m e a n and n d v i m i n respectively it can be seen that they are greater in the first scenario random movement thus we noticed that the average prevalence is inversely proportional to the ndvi values in the case of thoughtful movement see table 3 to examine the distribution of rodents in the cells and compare them with those in the field we calculated the entropies noted h m a x r h m e a n r and h m i n r corresponding to the first scenario random movement and h m a x t h h m e a n t h and h m i n t h corresponding to the second scenario thoughtful movement we calculated the entropy ratio r h h f i e l d h f i e l d is the entropy of the real distribution of rodents in the field to compare the model entropies and field data fig 9 the results showed that when the movement is random the entropy ratio is almost equal to the maximum entropy ratio r u n i f o r m the most disordered state moreover we noted that when the movement is thoughtful the entropy ratio is close to that of the field the value of the entropy ratio closest to that of the field is in the case of ndvi n d v i m a x and it has been noted that if the simulation time is greater the ratio entropy r m a x t h is close to the value 1 r f i e l d finally we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the parameters that could influence the prevalence this analysis was applied in the thoughtful movement case when the ndvi was maximum thus we used the one factor at a time cariboni et al 2007 saltelli et al 2008 sensitivity analysis method that consists of selecting a base parameter setting and varying one parameter by 10 at a time while keeping all other parameters fixed each simulation was repeated 30 times the infection factor α recovery probability γ consumption rate a f c o n s u m minimum food detected a f m i n and loss memory rate l m e m o r y parameters were tested fig 10 shows the variations in prevalence and standard deviation according to the modified parameters in addition a linear regression analysis was performed for each case we estimated the coefficient of determination slope and intercept for each curve table 4 the results show the effect of seasonality on the variation in prevalence and standard deviation in addition we noted that practically all the curves have the same slope which is very low in the order of 10 4 this weakness can be explained by the stability of prevalence in the last 3 years in addition we noted the impact of the parameters on prevalence and sd values for example in fig 10c when the recovery probability γ is high the prevalence value becomes lower in the figure when a f c o n s u m is high the prevalence value increases see table 5 we then performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of the 5 parameters on the mean prevalence over the last 3 years we observe that the minimum food detected a f m i n has a major effect on the mean prevalence which increases by 0 2 the minimum food detected a f m i n and the loss memory rate l m e m o r y have a positive effect however the recovery probability γ has a negative effect see figs 11a and 11b 5 discussion our results highlight the importance of considering the type of movement random or thoughtful of reservoir rodents considering their influence on the transmission of the epidemic in the first scenario random movement the prevalence values were higher than those in the second scenario this difference can be explained by the activity of rodents who forage randomly the fact that the movement is random implies that the probability of an encounter is a product of the frequencies of the infected and susceptible rodents i e mass action law thus in this case our model is close to an sis model susceptible infected susceptible epidemiological model the term close refers to the fact that rodents spend the maximum of their time foraging i e the case where n d v i n d v i m e a n and n d v i n d v i m i n in the case where n d v i n d v i m a x the fluctuations may be due to the fact that rodents spend more time consuming food thus there is a lower possibility of being infected in the second scenario when rodents accessed food more rapidly the risk of infection was reduced because the probability of an encounter was lower this explanation is supported by the fact that in the case where ndvi is weak ı e n d v i n d v i m i n the number of infected rodents becomes high again if food is scarce the information on feeding sites is low therefore the rodents adopt random movement regarding temperature its effect can only appear through the infection probability p see formula 6 note that the effect of ndvi also appears through the movement of rodents which influences the probability of encounter in the model the simulations show that ndvi has a more dominant effect than temperature moreover in the second scenario we noticed that the effect of temperature is observed in the fluctuations in figs 8a and 8b additionally when ndvi increases the prevalence decreases fig 8 this result was also observed by shirzadi et al 2015 and shiravand et al 2018 which showed that the incidence of leishmaniasis increased in areas where vegetation coverage was low in the same context mollalo et al 2014 showed that the decrease of the vegetation cover is accompanied by an increase of epidemic occurrence and vice versa the prevalence and rodents strategies that provides closest results to those observed in the field are when the rodents movement is thoughtful and when n d v i n d v i m a x ghawar et al 2011 moreover fig 9 demonstrated that the thoughtful movement is similar to the field rodents motion these results are consistent with rajabi et al 2018 the latter found that rodents adapt their direction and movement depending on food suitability and availability field observation of ghawar et al 2015 showed that the higher vegetation cover is the more new actives burrows are detected indicating that m shawi can assess the vegetation abundance even though relevant findings are reported in this current study a more comprehensive multispecies model which includes human and sandflies parameters would provide a deeper understanding of the zcl transmission cycle the lack of data on sandfly densities in tunisia and on its association with plant density ndvi makes such the achievement of such study currently difficult moreover no studies have been conducted on the demographic processes births deaths in rodent reservoirs other climatic factors such as rainfall and humidity which influence the transmission of zcl are also important however in our case these data were insufficient thus we used ndvi as an environmental factor which depends on rainfall and humidity it can be used when climate data as well as environmental characteristics of the site are not available gaudart et al 2009 6 conclusion in conclusion our study provides an overview of the effects of climate i e temperature and environmental i e ndvi parameters on the rodents movements in a limited geographical area by using an abm in order to simulate the transmission of zcl among rodents we considered two types of rodents movement random or thoughtful we observed that ndvi has a more dominant effect than temperature and the transmission of zcl was increased by decreasing the value of ndvi the findings reported in this current study would improve comprehension of the zcl spread dynamics in larger areas and thus to be subsequently used to implement prevention and control strategies of the epidemic credit authorship

24661,human activities have significantly changed the global nitrogen cycle and its underlying processes many scholars have studied flows of reactive nitrogen at a range of spatial and temporal scales however due to the complexity of the research subject the diversified research content and methods and the wide range of research scales there has been no systematic synthesis of the research in this field to provide that synthesis we performed a literature search in the web of science core collection then used the citespace bibliometric visualization software to summarize the evolution of this field of research from 1962 to march 2020 and visualize both the evolution of and the relationships within these data we found that the number of publications in the field of reactive nitrogen flows in macroscopic systems exploded after 1990 the co occurrence author cooperation network 1194 scholars showed a distribution with many groups and cornell university s research team r w howarth d p swaney and e w boyer has been among the biggest contributors to the field due to the team s large number of publications cluster analysis showed that urban metabolism denitrification atmospheric deposition and nitrogen budget are not only research hotspots but also important knowledge bases in addition based on our analysis we predict that the impact of urbanization on the flows of reactive nitrogen a single process with clearer flow links and more detailed accounting parameters and relevant studies serving the goal of efficient and low pollution management of reactive nitrogen will become hotspots our results provide a historical reference and suggest new frontiers for future research in the field of reactive nitrogen flows keywords reactive nitrogen flows macroscopic systems bibliometric methods citespace co occurrence analysis co citation analysis 1 introduction the evolution and development of human civilization has greatly altered the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen galloway et al 2004 nitrogen accounting has revealed the resulting imbalances and metabolic disruptions caused by human activities and the serious ecological and environmental problems that have resulted from these problems which threaten human health and survival brown et al 2006 davidson 2009 in this context scholars have calculated the nitrogen flows into aquatic ecosystems since the mid 20th century to quantify the impact of human activities on the associated nitrogen cycle dugdale and dugdale 1962 after more than 50 years of development since that early study research on reactive nitrogen flows has expanded to include many different perspectives such as nitrogen budgets nitrogen cycles and nitrogen metabolism the field has also increasingly diversified to include research on indexes and indicators system boundary definitions research methods models and a range of research scales therefore it is necessary to synthesize the current state of our knowledge to clarify the field s evolution and potential for its future directions bibliometric methods can be used to solve this challenge as they permit a quantitative analysis of the structure characteristics and underlying relationships among the publications in a field qiu 1988 data visualization and analysis software can present these results objectively and clearly the most commonly used information visualization and analysis software includes arnetminer www aminer org download paperlens www cs umd edu hcil paperlens and citespace cluster cis drexel edu cchen citespace qin et al 2014 the citespace software was developed by dr chaomei chen a scholar at the school of information science and technology drexel university this software intuitively visualizes the publications in a given field of research by drawing a knowledge map for the field s development that identifies key publications research hotspots and future frontiers chen 2004 compared with the other visual analysis software citespace offers the advantages of a clear development context effective visualizations of relationships and comprehensive analysis and presentation of the bibliometric information in the present study we investigated the research on reactive nitrogen using data obtained from a literature search in the web of science http wokinfo com core collection database from 1960 to march 2020 we used the bibliometric methods provided by citespace to study the evolution of the number of publications and to identify research cooperation networks and key subject categories so as to summarize the overall characteristics of this field we also identified research hotspots and future frontiers through analysis of keyword co occurrence and clustering and developed a knowledge base for this field through analysis of co citations clustering and identification of the most frequently cited publications the results of these analyses reveal the historical development knowledge structure and potential future directions for this field 2 database and methods 2 1 database research on reactive nitrogen flows involves a wide range of topics which includes publications in nearly 100 subjects such as ecological environment medicine physics and microbiology we mainly focus on the research of reactive nitrogen flows in forest agriculture watershed city country region global and other macroscopic systems related to the ecological environment so we constrained our literature search to focus on reactive nitrogen flows in macroscopic systems to obtain comprehensive and accurate data we searched the literature from january 1960 to march 2020 in the core collection of the web of science database we entered the following search terms nitrogen input or nitrogen output or nitrogen flow or nitrogen cycle or nitrogen balance this search found 17 358 publications then we excluded studies in the fields of medicine physics microbiology and other subjects related to engineering material production pharmaceutical inventions etc as well as studies that focused on biological individuals or groups such as humans animals plants and microorganisms these irrelevant research articles accounted for a large proportion of the total so excluding them left a total of 326 publications about reactive nitrogen flows in macroscopic systems after the screening table s1 2 2 analytical model we used version 16 0 of excel www microsoft com and version 5 7r2 of citespace to conduct a bibliographic analysis of the 326 publications as citespace is a visual literature analysis model we need to define a series of model functions before using it for literature analysis performing a cooperative analysis of the country institution and author can help us understand the distribution of research power in a given field of research whereas performing a co occurrence analysis of subject categories can reveal the internal relations among various subjects by constructing a subject association network performing co occurrence analysis of keywords can reflect the research hotspots in a field and their evolution over time to accomplish these goals we selected the node types country author institution category and keyword in the software s network configuration module and generated co occurrence maps in the software we set time slicing to 1960 to march 2020 and the selection strategy of node threshold was top n per slice in addition because there are too many nodes involved in the keyword co occurrence analysis map we made the network map obtained from operation of the model reflect the most important information clearly and accurately by adopting the minimum spanning tree algorithm to simplify the result map the description of the algorithm is as follows in the network graph g v e select vertex u and v v where w u v represents the weight of edge u v e if there is a generated subgraph t v te such that te e and t lacks a loop so that t has a minimum weight w t u v t e w u v then t is a minimum spanning tree for g in the minimum spanning tree algorithm provided by citespace start with a certain vertex u 0 v and set u u 0 te i e the empty set at the initial step in the calculation and then iterate the following algorithm find the edge with the smallest weight uk vk in all edges u v e of u u v vu and merge it into te then merge vk into u until u v and continue the iteration until the algorithm produces the minimum spanning tree t v te chen et al 2014 we also performed in depth analysis of the 14 246 co cited references in the 326 publications conducted a knowledge based analysis based on keyword clustering and identified the most frequently co cited references to reveal the studies that formed the field s foundation in contrast with the model development in the previous co occurrence analysis we adopted the path finding network algorithm pfnet to simplify the graph obtained by the co citation analysis the description of the algorithm is as follows in the graph g v e v is a set of vertices n 1 n 2 n n where v n represents the number of nodes in v e is a set of edges that connect a pair of vertices in v the association between all edges in e can be described in the adjacent n m matrix eg where m also represents the number of nodes in v 1 eg e 11 e 1 m e n 1 e n m w h e r e 1 i a n d j n the path finding network is a simplified network based on the original network eg it has the same number of nodes but fewer edges than the original network we can express the path finding network as the matrix pf where pij is the weight of eij i and j represent vertexes v 2 pf p 11 p 1 m p n 1 p n m w h e r e 1 i a n d j n there are three rules for the pfnet algorithm 1 the distance from any node to itself is 0 2 the distance matrix of networks with non directional edges is symmetric but the distance matrix of networks with directional edges is asymmetric 3 if the nodes in the network are regarded as an independent concept or entity object the edges between nodes are regarded as connections between concepts and the weight of the edges indicates the degree of difference in connections edges with a high weight indicate highly similar concepts the pfnet generated according to the network under these constraints eliminates unnecessary node connections ensuring that the closest connections between nodes are retained in pfnet chen et al 2014 3 literature analysis 3 1 quantitative analysis of the publications research on reactive nitrogen flows began in 1962 fig 1 shows the number of publications in each decade during our study period which spans nearly 60 years there appears to be an obvious dividing point in 1990 with few publications and slow development from 1962 to 1990 we found only 14 publications in this 30 year period which accounts for only 4 of the 326 publications however after 1990 this field grew rapidly and a large number of publications began to emerge the number of publications increased sharply from 48 between 1991 and 2000 to 158 between 2011 and march 2020 the number of publications averaged 104 per decade which was nearly 22 times the average before 1991 therefore this research field has become a hot topic since 1990 3 2 analysis of cooperation networks our analysis of cooperation networks focused on the importance and relevance of the authors institutions and countries for the field it revealed the distribution of research power and the distribution and intensity of cooperation among different nodes of the global research network since 1962 when the united states launched the first study of reactive nitrogen flows into lakes the research in this field has spread to include 474 institutions in 57 countries fig 2 among them the united states 95 publications and china 75 publications were the two countries with the largest research output which resulted from participation of multiple institutions this includes institutions such as the u s environmental protection agency 9 publications dc 0 09 dc is the degree of centrality a measure of the connecting role of a node in the overall network the nodes with large centrality are often the key nodes in the network cornell university 9 publications dc 0 07 and the university of georgia 8 publications dc 0 01 the university of the chinese academy of sciences 40 publications dc 0 2 tsinghua university 7 publications dc 0 01 china agricultural university 6 publications dc 0 01 and beijing normal university 5 publications dc 0 01 these institutions have been the core research centers in this field and therefore had a high frequency of publications and high dc the united states has developed extensive cooperative relationships with the u k japan germany france italy and other countries and this has given it the highest centrality in this field dc 0 58 although china s number of publications 75 is nearly 6 times that of the u k 13 publications its centrality dc 0 20 was lower than that of the u k dc 0 23 reflecting the fact that chinese scholars have worked more independently the distribution of national and institutional cooperation networks is relatively concentrated but the co occurrence author cooperation network 1194 scholars shows a distribution with many groups fig 3 among them r w howarth and d p swaney both of whom belong to the research team at cornell university occupied the core position in this field due to their large number of publications 8 they have formed the largest network group in this field in close cooperation with e w boyer j n galloway g billen and others in addition howarth and swaney have also cooperated with bongghi hong from cornell university and chinese scholars such as yuguo han xuyong li and wangshou zhang from the chinese academy of sciences to form a large sub network of researchers who focus on urban reactive nitrogen flows in addition the scattered distribution of small groups reflects the rich research methods and extensive research scales in this field including sub networks for yan zhang hanjing lu and yanxian li at beijing normal university who focus on urban nitrogen metabolism and sub networks with chaopu ti xiaoyuan yan and yongqiu xia at the chinese academy of sciences who focus on watershed and national nitrogen budgets fig 3 3 3 co occurrence analysis for subject categories the network of subject categories reflects the integration of subjects in a field and the evolution of mainstream subjects over time fig 4 the subject categories in the field of reactive nitrogen flow reflect the evolution from the initial natural science field to engineering and technology for example from marine and freshwater ecology water resources and environmental sciences to agriculture and forestry subsequently the focus shifted to the medium such as soil science meteorology and atmospheric sciences and finally to management such as sustainability science this evolution shows a change from focus on a single subject to the integration of multiple subjects and from the overall ecological environment to more specific categories such as water soil and atmosphere before integrating some or all of these subjects within a management practice 3 3 1 water resources the rise of industrial civilization has greatly altered the natural nitrogen balance as an important sink of anthropogenic nitrogen water often accumulates large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus leading to serious eutrophication that directly threatens the survival of aquatic organisms and human water security in addition the nitrogen content of water is easy to measure so the earliest study of reactive nitrogen flows appeared with the subject of marine and freshwater biology subsequently with the acceleration of industrialization the impact of human activities on the nitrogen cycle of natural ecosystems became more and more obvious creating many nitrogen pollution problems which attracted the attention of scholars related studies gradually developed into ecology and environmental science with a large number of publications environmental science ecology 242 publications dc 0 30 and environmental science 203 publications dc 0 47 subsequently emerged with high frequency and centrality other scholars focused on repairing the damaged environment and on engineering 37 publications dc 0 06 and on environmental engineering 31 publications dc 0 02 and the evolution continued to include other subjects 3 3 2 agriculture and soils with the development and extensive use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers the nitrogen flux from farmland and soils increased creating problems such as soil nitrogen enrichment and nitrogen pollution in farmland watersheds which attracted additional attention agriculture became a hot field for reactive nitrogen flow and soil science 33 publications dc 0 02 agriculture 53 publications dc 0 26 and related subjects gradually emerged and began to generate a large number of publications after 1988 more and more industrial production consumed fossil fuels especially in the developing world due to incomplete combustion most of the waste nitrogen was discharged into the atmosphere in the form of nitrogen oxides the increased emissions of these greenhouse gasses directly affected biogeochemical cycles and humans leading to increasing attention to these nitrogen outputs the subject of meteorology and atmospheric sciences 39 publications dc 0 04 appeared by the 1990s research expanded to include natural nitrogen flows in mountains forests and other geographies and geological research gradually flourished geology 57 publications dc 0 11 and multidisciplinary geosciences 57 publications dc 0 11 became frequent and popular topics with high centrality 3 3 3 policy and management during later stages of the field s development increased awareness of environmental protection strengthening public management and promotion of sustainable development of resources and the environment have become common goals of all countries studies related to management therefore began to emerge and subjects such as public environment occupational health 3 publications dc 0 03 and science and technology 8 publications dc 0 01 appeared but because they appeared only recently there have been relatively few publications 4 research frontier analysis 4 1 keyword co occurrence analysis co occurrence analysis can reveal the development of a field particularly when it focuses on keyword frequency this reveals research frontiers and hot spots in a certain period fig 5 shows that we found 276 common keywords that appeared 3 or more times in the studies we analyzed table s2 we grouped them into five aspects of research research objective research contents research methods impact analysis and management goals we then analyzed them by dividing the study period into four periods before 1991 based on the distribution in fig 1 and three subsequent 10 year periods to reveal changes over time from 1960 to 1990 reactive nitrogen flow research developed slowly with only 14 publications and only one common keyword n budget this indicates that scholars in the early stages of the field mainly focused on nitrogen budgets as the number of publications increased and the research deepened and became more diverse a large number of keywords related to new research subjects and research contents appeared between 1991 and 2000 these included n input atmospheric deposition organic nitrogen nitrogen accumulation nitrogen flow nitrogen cycling and nitrogen output a trend of diversification of research contents was obvious but the research subjects still mainly focused on bodies of water e g catchment area the north sea and on certain regions e g north america the number of common keywords increased further from 2001 to 2010 and the many new keywords during this period caused it to account for the largest proportion of the total 74 in addition to the keywords for research content that appeared in the previous period new research hotspots appeared in large numbers such as inorganic nitrogen nitrogen loads nitrogen cycle nitrogen in agricultural activities including agricultural practices food production chemical fertilizer residual n atmospheric nitrogen such as n2o emissions nitrogen balances temporal variation and spatial distribution of nitrogen the keywords for the research subjects were also more diverse and agriculture e g agricultural soils agricultural lands farming system paddy field forest e g forest soils country e g south korea city e g urban area and rural area became new key research subjects in addition a small number of keywords about research methods e g network environ analysis seven compartment model influence analysis e g indirect effects environmental effects and management objectives e g good agreement began to appear the largest number of frequent keywords 150 appeared from 2011 to march 2020 which was is the most prosperous period in the research on reactive nitrogen flows with a sharp increase from 95 in the previous period the research subjects and contents included all the categories of keywords from previous periods but nitrogen metabolism also became an important common keyword the research methods mainly included material flow analysis e g substance flow analysis which has become a mainstream method of nitrogen research since 2011 in addition the number of keywords for influence factors related to human activities and urban development increased e g human activity anthropogenic activity rapid urbanization but keywords for management goals still accounted for a small proportion of the total 2 during this period mainly involving environmental management and food security 4 2 keyword clustering analysis keyword co occurrence analysis can reveal research hotspots but keyword clustering analysis highlights the relationships between research directions and keywords our cluster analysis revealed eight clusters urban metabolism nitrogen deposition fluxes denitrification anthropogenic nitrous oxide budget and network environ analysis fig 6 these clusters cover three aspects research perspective research content and research method urban metabolism was the largest cluster although it appears relatively late in the study period 2001 march 2020 it reflects the process perspective that became important in reactive nitrogen research at the beginning of the 21st century many scholars focused on reactive nitrogen metabolism at a city scale for example baker et al 2001 calculated the nitrogen balance in natural and socioeconomic activities in phoenix usa and established a nitrogen budget model that included both natural and anthropogenic nitrogen fixation the nitrogen input items considered in their model included wet deposition surface water biological fixation food livestock feed fossil fuels inorganic fertilizers and chemical products whereas nitrogen outputs included exports of animal and plant products sewage discharge waste gas discharge and denitrification this was the earliest study of reactive nitrogen flows at a city scale subsequently forkes 2007 focused on processes related to the urban food metabolism and calculated the balance of food nitrogen input storage and output in toronto canada while accounting for the recycling of nitrogen from food wastes similarly gierlinger 2015 calculated the nitrogen flows in food and livestock feed in vienna austria during the city s industrial transformation from the perspective of urban metabolism based on previous studies zhang et al 2016a b considered all urban compartments involved in nitrogen transfer calculated the nitrogen flow along each metabolic pathway and constructed a relatively complete urban nitrogen metabolism network model in addition singh and kennedy 2018 developed a new response model to analyze the impact of urban metabolic processes on carbon and nitrogen cycles and biodiversity and applied this model in a case study of shanghai china nitrogen deposition was the second largest cluster and spanned 22 years 1996 2018 reflecting the importance of accounting for nitrogen deposition as early as 1988 derwent et al 1988 had accounted for nitrogen deposition in their nitrogen budget study in the united kingdom and northwestern europe however because early publications usually had no keywords this publication was not included in the keyword clustering map subsequent studies on nitrogen input he et al 2007 nitrogen cycles yang and gruber 2016 nitrogen metabolism zhang et al 2016a b nitrogen accumulation han et al 2011 nitrogen balance baker et al 2001 and nitrogen budgets singh and våje 1998 all included nitrogen deposition as an essential accounting item for example the widely cited toolbox developed by hong et al 2011 for calculating net anthropogenic nitrogen input considers atmospheric nitrogen deposition as an important accounting item in addition many scholars investigated the parameters related to nitrogen deposition for example du et al 2008 monitored the inorganic nitrogen deposition in subtropical evergreen mixed forests in central and southern china he et al 2010 estimated the total nitrogen deposition in the agricultural ecosystem in northern china during the wheat growing season and lu et al 2012 studied the spatial and temporal changes of nitrogen deposition in china and their effects on carbon budgets additional clusters included fluxes 2000 2019 denitrification 1995 2018 anthropogenic 1996 2015 nitrous oxide 1995 2017 and budget 1997 2018 which we have listed in order of the cluster size this reflects the refinement brion et al 2008 david et al 2006 and quantification shindo 2012 of descriptions of biochemical nitrogen cycling processes while fully considering the impacts of human activities on the nitrogen cycle kirchner et al 2005 zhou et al 2014 the final cluster was network environ analysis this cluster is small and appeared relatively late in the study period 2002 2019 related keywords appeared in large numbers in 2002 but were sporadically distributed in other years this method has been mostly applied in analyses of metabolic processes and has been applied at multiple scales such as watersheds forès et al 1994 whipple et al 2007 and cities zhang et al 2016a b 5 knowledge base analysis 5 1 co citation cluster analysis co occurrence analysis can reveal the development context current situation and research hotspots of a field but co citation analysis reveals the knowledge base and developmental background of the field reference co citation refers to the phenomenon in which two references are cited by the same publication we found 14 246 co cited references in the 326 publications from 1954 to 2019 by setting the threshold for the co citation frequency to 2 and clustering the references by keywords we obtained eight clusters fig 7 which mainly reflected three aspects research content research perspective and research subject if we compare the maps of co occurrence clustering fig 6 and co citation clustering fig 7 we can see high similarity between the two maps both include urban metabolism denitrification atmospheric deposition and nitrogen budget clusters indicating that these research aspects are not only research hotspots but also important knowledge bases however the time span in the clustering of co cited publications is larger due to the larger number of cited publications and the wider research content involved for example the co citation clusters also focus on the research content of nitrogen cycling and the word clusters of industrial production and urban ecology emerged which more fully reflect the knowledge support from different disciplines such as economics urbanism and ecology and the increasingly interdisciplinary characteristics of this field nitrogen as a basic element in this field became the largest co cited cluster and the time span of the publications was from 2002 to 2008 nitrogen budget and atmospheric deposition also formed relatively large clusters in the co cited publications and both clusters appeared earlier than in the co occurrence clustering 1994 2002 and 1986 1995 respectively the occurrence of the atmospheric deposition cluster in the co citation clustering map was earlier than the similar nitrogen deposition cluster 1995 2018 in the co occurrence keyword clustering map which reflects how the early research on atmospheric nitrogen deposition laid a solid theoretical and methodological foundation for subsequent research on nitrogen deposition in addition the co citation clusters nitrogen cycling and denitrification had a small cluster size and appeared later in 2002 2015 and 2009 2018 respectively and most references to them were consistent with the co occurrence analysis the clusters named after research subjects were industrial production and urban ecology industrial production was the second largest cluster in the co citation clusters but appeared relatively late in the study period 2008 2018 this is because more and more scholars began focusing on nitrogen accounting in socioeconomic systems during the later stages of the study period as a key link in nitrogen utilization and conversion industrial production has become a key knowledge base as the urban ecosystem is a region where human activities are highly concentrated nitrogen flows in cities have attracted more and more attention from scholars the urban ecology literature also provides methods and theoretical support for the development of research on reactive nitrogen flows in addition the co citation clustering map also has the research perspective cluster urban metabolism that appeared in the keyword co occurrence clustering map this shows that urban metabolism is not only a research hotspot but also an important knowledge base comparing the city to an organism and exploring the processes of urban nitrogen transfer from the perspective of metabolism provides a new method and new perspective for the analysis of reactive nitrogen flows 5 2 analysis of the most frequently co cited publications through co citation analysis we identified the 15 papers with the highest citation frequency a citation frequency 10 these mainly involve the knowledge bases of case studies and modeling methods among them 86 7 of the most frequently co cited references were publications involved in the research frontier analysis table 1 there were 13 case studies among the 15 most frequently cited publications which involved nitrogen cycles nitrogen outputs nitrogen budgets nitrogen fixation nitrogen flows and the impact of urbanization the most frequently cited publication was galloway et al s 2008 study on the global nitrogen cycle 22 citations dc 0 24 this publication appeared in the top academic journal science and analyzed the trends in global nitrogen production their spatial distribution and nitrogen transfers in trade from 1860 to 2005 it also answered questions such as the ultimate fate of nitrogen how climate change affects nitrogen creation how reactive nitrogen affects human health and how the development of biofuels will change the n cycle and proposes possible solutions this paper has been widely cited because of its comprehensive content and the many research issues it addressed similarly galloway et al s 2004 paper nitrogen cycles past present and future was also heavily cited this paper had the highest centrality 17 citations dc 0 28 of all the most frequently cited references it compared the differences between natural and anthropogenic nitrogen creation analyzed the global nitrogen cycle from 1860 to the 1990s and predicted the global nitrogen creation in 2050 in addition studies related to the nitrogen cycle included case studies that focused on the impact of human activities erisman et al 2013 12 citations the nitrogen cycle in the 21st century fowler et al 2013 11 citations and the nitrogen cycle from an earth systems perspective gruber and galloway 2008 10 citations and together these accounted for the largest proportion 38 5 of the 13 most frequently cited case studies thereby representing an important knowledge base in the field of reactive nitrogen flow co cited case studies related to watershed nitrogen output accounted for 23 1 of the most frequently cited studies these studies used field monitoring data to carry out large scale research from multiple perspectives for example boyer et al 2002 compared the nitrogen inputs and outputs of 16 watersheds in the united states and accounted for the influence of climate on the nitrogen budget of a watershed 13 citations similarly howarth et al 2006 calculated the average nitrogen flux of 16 major watersheds in the northeastern united states from 1988 to 1993 to determine how climate affected the nitrogen flux in rivers 10 citations in addition howarth et al 1996 estimated the total nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes in the north atlantic basin 14 regional rivers in north america south america europe and africa and analyzed the effects of population density anthropogenic nitrogen input and regional differences in the total nitrogen fluxes in the basin 10 citations high frequency co cited publications on the impact of human activities accounted for 26 7 of the total among them gu et al 2012 studied the influence of long term urbanization 1952 2004 on nitrogen form and dynamics in the greater shanghai area focusing on the driving factors behind the changes in nitrogen budget at an urban scale 14 citations at a national scale ti et al 2012 estimated the nitrogen inputs and outputs of mainland china based on a land use map and the latest statistical data and compared these values with the nitrogen budgets of other countries 13 citations gu et al 2015 studied the circulation and loss of reactive nitrogen in 14 subsystems in china and found that excessive growth of reactive nitrogen threatened human health farmland sustainability and the ecological environment 10 citations in addition smil 1999 focused on the nitrogen balance at a global agricultural scale and emphasized the impact of fertilizer application on the agricultural nitrogen balance 10 citations moreover it is worth mentioning that a paper that described a modeling method and a book on nitrogen estimation in europe also appeared in the most frequently cited publications leach et al 2012 developed a national nitrogen footprint calculation model which can provide information on the processes responsible for losses of reactive nitrogen into the environment caused by individual or collective activities and provided a tool and knowledge base for the analysis of reactive nitrogen flows at the output end of a cycle 12 citations sutton et al 2011 conducted an in depth study of reactive nitrogen in europe from three perspectives sources impacts and policy outlook they compiled their findings into a book that provides an important reference for regional scale research on reactive nitrogen flows and the book has been widely cited 15 citations 6 conclusions and prospects by analyzing the literature on reactive nitrogen at a macro scale we defined the foundational knowledge and characterized the rapid development of this research its evolution towards multidisciplinary research and the diversity of the research nitrogen deposition denitrification and other natural nitrogen processes have always been the focus of attention with the gradual strengthening of awareness of the significant impact of human activities on the nitrogen cycle the nitrogen metabolism of cities and nitrogen balances more and more scholars have begun to pay attention to reactive nitrogen flows in global cycles industrial and agricultural production processes and the urban areas where human activities are highly concentrated in addition researchers have increasingly acknowledged the importance of sustainable and healthy development of the ecological environment leading to increasing research emphasis on the factors that influence nitrogen flows and management of nitrogen related processes further diversifying the research based on our analysis we predict that reactive nitrogen research will continue to diversify and deepen with the following four directions becoming new research hotspots 1 based on our analysis of the research frontiers and our knowledge base analysis research on urban metabolism and urban ecology appear likely to remain important in combination with the emergence of a large number of keywords such as metropolitan area rapid urbanization and urban sustainability in recent years research at an urban scale appears likely to attract increasing attention from scholars and the impact of urbanization on the flows of reactive nitrogen will become a continuing research topic this is especially pertinent in light of the united nations sustainable development goals on cities and communities 2 combined with the co occurrence analysis we found that keywords such as sewage treatment plants food flow and solid waste treatment have recently appeared in large numbers this suggests that treating reactive nitrogen flows as a single process with clearer flow links and more detailed accounting parameters is attracting increasing attention from scholars increasing the accuracy of the research results through this tighter focus and ensuring the refinement of the research methods will therefore become important agricultural cycles mark another avenue of intersection of nitrogen in nature and human well being that will garner needed attention in future research 3 existing research on reactive nitrogen flows comprises mostly reviews case studies and methodology development or application with relatively few studies about the factors that influence these flows and future regulatory measures to reduce flows of reactive nitrogen which are topics that began to appear in the later stages of our study period this shows that with the gradual strengthening of human ecological and environmental awareness and of the concept of sustainable development scholars are beginning to explore the reasons behind the related problems and finding solutions to these problems relevant studies serving the goal of efficient and low pollution management of reactive nitrogen will therefore become hotspots 4 in addition with the development of human society the global climate has undergone significant changes mainly manifested in three aspects acid rain climate warming and ozone layer destruction nitrogen emission is an important cause of nitric acid rain nox is one of the greenhouse gasses that cause global warming and it also has strong interactions with the carbon cycle that can have global scale effects on atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane galloway 2008 therefore a new line of research perhaps not evident yet in this review is the role of nitrogen in the climate equation studies of reactive nitrogen flows in macroscopic systems can provide theoretical support for reducing nitrogen consumption at the source and improving nitrogen utilization efficiency in processes thus reducing nitrogen emission and mitigating climate change declaration

24661,human activities have significantly changed the global nitrogen cycle and its underlying processes many scholars have studied flows of reactive nitrogen at a range of spatial and temporal scales however due to the complexity of the research subject the diversified research content and methods and the wide range of research scales there has been no systematic synthesis of the research in this field to provide that synthesis we performed a literature search in the web of science core collection then used the citespace bibliometric visualization software to summarize the evolution of this field of research from 1962 to march 2020 and visualize both the evolution of and the relationships within these data we found that the number of publications in the field of reactive nitrogen flows in macroscopic systems exploded after 1990 the co occurrence author cooperation network 1194 scholars showed a distribution with many groups and cornell university s research team r w howarth d p swaney and e w boyer has been among the biggest contributors to the field due to the team s large number of publications cluster analysis showed that urban metabolism denitrification atmospheric deposition and nitrogen budget are not only research hotspots but also important knowledge bases in addition based on our analysis we predict that the impact of urbanization on the flows of reactive nitrogen a single process with clearer flow links and more detailed accounting parameters and relevant studies serving the goal of efficient and low pollution management of reactive nitrogen will become hotspots our results provide a historical reference and suggest new frontiers for future research in the field of reactive nitrogen flows keywords reactive nitrogen flows macroscopic systems bibliometric methods citespace co occurrence analysis co citation analysis 1 introduction the evolution and development of human civilization has greatly altered the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen galloway et al 2004 nitrogen accounting has revealed the resulting imbalances and metabolic disruptions caused by human activities and the serious ecological and environmental problems that have resulted from these problems which threaten human health and survival brown et al 2006 davidson 2009 in this context scholars have calculated the nitrogen flows into aquatic ecosystems since the mid 20th century to quantify the impact of human activities on the associated nitrogen cycle dugdale and dugdale 1962 after more than 50 years of development since that early study research on reactive nitrogen flows has expanded to include many different perspectives such as nitrogen budgets nitrogen cycles and nitrogen metabolism the field has also increasingly diversified to include research on indexes and indicators system boundary definitions research methods models and a range of research scales therefore it is necessary to synthesize the current state of our knowledge to clarify the field s evolution and potential for its future directions bibliometric methods can be used to solve this challenge as they permit a quantitative analysis of the structure characteristics and underlying relationships among the publications in a field qiu 1988 data visualization and analysis software can present these results objectively and clearly the most commonly used information visualization and analysis software includes arnetminer www aminer org download paperlens www cs umd edu hcil paperlens and citespace cluster cis drexel edu cchen citespace qin et al 2014 the citespace software was developed by dr chaomei chen a scholar at the school of information science and technology drexel university this software intuitively visualizes the publications in a given field of research by drawing a knowledge map for the field s development that identifies key publications research hotspots and future frontiers chen 2004 compared with the other visual analysis software citespace offers the advantages of a clear development context effective visualizations of relationships and comprehensive analysis and presentation of the bibliometric information in the present study we investigated the research on reactive nitrogen using data obtained from a literature search in the web of science http wokinfo com core collection database from 1960 to march 2020 we used the bibliometric methods provided by citespace to study the evolution of the number of publications and to identify research cooperation networks and key subject categories so as to summarize the overall characteristics of this field we also identified research hotspots and future frontiers through analysis of keyword co occurrence and clustering and developed a knowledge base for this field through analysis of co citations clustering and identification of the most frequently cited publications the results of these analyses reveal the historical development knowledge structure and potential future directions for this field 2 database and methods 2 1 database research on reactive nitrogen flows involves a wide range of topics which includes publications in nearly 100 subjects such as ecological environment medicine physics and microbiology we mainly focus on the research of reactive nitrogen flows in forest agriculture watershed city country region global and other macroscopic systems related to the ecological environment so we constrained our literature search to focus on reactive nitrogen flows in macroscopic systems to obtain comprehensive and accurate data we searched the literature from january 1960 to march 2020 in the core collection of the web of science database we entered the following search terms nitrogen input or nitrogen output or nitrogen flow or nitrogen cycle or nitrogen balance this search found 17 358 publications then we excluded studies in the fields of medicine physics microbiology and other subjects related to engineering material production pharmaceutical inventions etc as well as studies that focused on biological individuals or groups such as humans animals plants and microorganisms these irrelevant research articles accounted for a large proportion of the total so excluding them left a total of 326 publications about reactive nitrogen flows in macroscopic systems after the screening table s1 2 2 analytical model we used version 16 0 of excel www microsoft com and version 5 7r2 of citespace to conduct a bibliographic analysis of the 326 publications as citespace is a visual literature analysis model we need to define a series of model functions before using it for literature analysis performing a cooperative analysis of the country institution and author can help us understand the distribution of research power in a given field of research whereas performing a co occurrence analysis of subject categories can reveal the internal relations among various subjects by constructing a subject association network performing co occurrence analysis of keywords can reflect the research hotspots in a field and their evolution over time to accomplish these goals we selected the node types country author institution category and keyword in the software s network configuration module and generated co occurrence maps in the software we set time slicing to 1960 to march 2020 and the selection strategy of node threshold was top n per slice in addition because there are too many nodes involved in the keyword co occurrence analysis map we made the network map obtained from operation of the model reflect the most important information clearly and accurately by adopting the minimum spanning tree algorithm to simplify the result map the description of the algorithm is as follows in the network graph g v e select vertex u and v v where w u v represents the weight of edge u v e if there is a generated subgraph t v te such that te e and t lacks a loop so that t has a minimum weight w t u v t e w u v then t is a minimum spanning tree for g in the minimum spanning tree algorithm provided by citespace start with a certain vertex u 0 v and set u u 0 te i e the empty set at the initial step in the calculation and then iterate the following algorithm find the edge with the smallest weight uk vk in all edges u v e of u u v vu and merge it into te then merge vk into u until u v and continue the iteration until the algorithm produces the minimum spanning tree t v te chen et al 2014 we also performed in depth analysis of the 14 246 co cited references in the 326 publications conducted a knowledge based analysis based on keyword clustering and identified the most frequently co cited references to reveal the studies that formed the field s foundation in contrast with the model development in the previous co occurrence analysis we adopted the path finding network algorithm pfnet to simplify the graph obtained by the co citation analysis the description of the algorithm is as follows in the graph g v e v is a set of vertices n 1 n 2 n n where v n represents the number of nodes in v e is a set of edges that connect a pair of vertices in v the association between all edges in e can be described in the adjacent n m matrix eg where m also represents the number of nodes in v 1 eg e 11 e 1 m e n 1 e n m w h e r e 1 i a n d j n the path finding network is a simplified network based on the original network eg it has the same number of nodes but fewer edges than the original network we can express the path finding network as the matrix pf where pij is the weight of eij i and j represent vertexes v 2 pf p 11 p 1 m p n 1 p n m w h e r e 1 i a n d j n there are three rules for the pfnet algorithm 1 the distance from any node to itself is 0 2 the distance matrix of networks with non directional edges is symmetric but the distance matrix of networks with directional edges is asymmetric 3 if the nodes in the network are regarded as an independent concept or entity object the edges between nodes are regarded as connections between concepts and the weight of the edges indicates the degree of difference in connections edges with a high weight indicate highly similar concepts the pfnet generated according to the network under these constraints eliminates unnecessary node connections ensuring that the closest connections between nodes are retained in pfnet chen et al 2014 3 literature analysis 3 1 quantitative analysis of the publications research on reactive nitrogen flows began in 1962 fig 1 shows the number of publications in each decade during our study period which spans nearly 60 years there appears to be an obvious dividing point in 1990 with few publications and slow development from 1962 to 1990 we found only 14 publications in this 30 year period which accounts for only 4 of the 326 publications however after 1990 this field grew rapidly and a large number of publications began to emerge the number of publications increased sharply from 48 between 1991 and 2000 to 158 between 2011 and march 2020 the number of publications averaged 104 per decade which was nearly 22 times the average before 1991 therefore this research field has become a hot topic since 1990 3 2 analysis of cooperation networks our analysis of cooperation networks focused on the importance and relevance of the authors institutions and countries for the field it revealed the distribution of research power and the distribution and intensity of cooperation among different nodes of the global research network since 1962 when the united states launched the first study of reactive nitrogen flows into lakes the research in this field has spread to include 474 institutions in 57 countries fig 2 among them the united states 95 publications and china 75 publications were the two countries with the largest research output which resulted from participation of multiple institutions this includes institutions such as the u s environmental protection agency 9 publications dc 0 09 dc is the degree of centrality a measure of the connecting role of a node in the overall network the nodes with large centrality are often the key nodes in the network cornell university 9 publications dc 0 07 and the university of georgia 8 publications dc 0 01 the university of the chinese academy of sciences 40 publications dc 0 2 tsinghua university 7 publications dc 0 01 china agricultural university 6 publications dc 0 01 and beijing normal university 5 publications dc 0 01 these institutions have been the core research centers in this field and therefore had a high frequency of publications and high dc the united states has developed extensive cooperative relationships with the u k japan germany france italy and other countries and this has given it the highest centrality in this field dc 0 58 although china s number of publications 75 is nearly 6 times that of the u k 13 publications its centrality dc 0 20 was lower than that of the u k dc 0 23 reflecting the fact that chinese scholars have worked more independently the distribution of national and institutional cooperation networks is relatively concentrated but the co occurrence author cooperation network 1194 scholars shows a distribution with many groups fig 3 among them r w howarth and d p swaney both of whom belong to the research team at cornell university occupied the core position in this field due to their large number of publications 8 they have formed the largest network group in this field in close cooperation with e w boyer j n galloway g billen and others in addition howarth and swaney have also cooperated with bongghi hong from cornell university and chinese scholars such as yuguo han xuyong li and wangshou zhang from the chinese academy of sciences to form a large sub network of researchers who focus on urban reactive nitrogen flows in addition the scattered distribution of small groups reflects the rich research methods and extensive research scales in this field including sub networks for yan zhang hanjing lu and yanxian li at beijing normal university who focus on urban nitrogen metabolism and sub networks with chaopu ti xiaoyuan yan and yongqiu xia at the chinese academy of sciences who focus on watershed and national nitrogen budgets fig 3 3 3 co occurrence analysis for subject categories the network of subject categories reflects the integration of subjects in a field and the evolution of mainstream subjects over time fig 4 the subject categories in the field of reactive nitrogen flow reflect the evolution from the initial natural science field to engineering and technology for example from marine and freshwater ecology water resources and environmental sciences to agriculture and forestry subsequently the focus shifted to the medium such as soil science meteorology and atmospheric sciences and finally to management such as sustainability science this evolution shows a change from focus on a single subject to the integration of multiple subjects and from the overall ecological environment to more specific categories such as water soil and atmosphere before integrating some or all of these subjects within a management practice 3 3 1 water resources the rise of industrial civilization has greatly altered the natural nitrogen balance as an important sink of anthropogenic nitrogen water often accumulates large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus leading to serious eutrophication that directly threatens the survival of aquatic organisms and human water security in addition the nitrogen content of water is easy to measure so the earliest study of reactive nitrogen flows appeared with the subject of marine and freshwater biology subsequently with the acceleration of industrialization the impact of human activities on the nitrogen cycle of natural ecosystems became more and more obvious creating many nitrogen pollution problems which attracted the attention of scholars related studies gradually developed into ecology and environmental science with a large number of publications environmental science ecology 242 publications dc 0 30 and environmental science 203 publications dc 0 47 subsequently emerged with high frequency and centrality other scholars focused on repairing the damaged environment and on engineering 37 publications dc 0 06 and on environmental engineering 31 publications dc 0 02 and the evolution continued to include other subjects 3 3 2 agriculture and soils with the development and extensive use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers the nitrogen flux from farmland and soils increased creating problems such as soil nitrogen enrichment and nitrogen pollution in farmland watersheds which attracted additional attention agriculture became a hot field for reactive nitrogen flow and soil science 33 publications dc 0 02 agriculture 53 publications dc 0 26 and related subjects gradually emerged and began to generate a large number of publications after 1988 more and more industrial production consumed fossil fuels especially in the developing world due to incomplete combustion most of the waste nitrogen was discharged into the atmosphere in the form of nitrogen oxides the increased emissions of these greenhouse gasses directly affected biogeochemical cycles and humans leading to increasing attention to these nitrogen outputs the subject of meteorology and atmospheric sciences 39 publications dc 0 04 appeared by the 1990s research expanded to include natural nitrogen flows in mountains forests and other geographies and geological research gradually flourished geology 57 publications dc 0 11 and multidisciplinary geosciences 57 publications dc 0 11 became frequent and popular topics with high centrality 3 3 3 policy and management during later stages of the field s development increased awareness of environmental protection strengthening public management and promotion of sustainable development of resources and the environment have become common goals of all countries studies related to management therefore began to emerge and subjects such as public environment occupational health 3 publications dc 0 03 and science and technology 8 publications dc 0 01 appeared but because they appeared only recently there have been relatively few publications 4 research frontier analysis 4 1 keyword co occurrence analysis co occurrence analysis can reveal the development of a field particularly when it focuses on keyword frequency this reveals research frontiers and hot spots in a certain period fig 5 shows that we found 276 common keywords that appeared 3 or more times in the studies we analyzed table s2 we grouped them into five aspects of research research objective research contents research methods impact analysis and management goals we then analyzed them by dividing the study period into four periods before 1991 based on the distribution in fig 1 and three subsequent 10 year periods to reveal changes over time from 1960 to 1990 reactive nitrogen flow research developed slowly with only 14 publications and only one common keyword n budget this indicates that scholars in the early stages of the field mainly focused on nitrogen budgets as the number of publications increased and the research deepened and became more diverse a large number of keywords related to new research subjects and research contents appeared between 1991 and 2000 these included n input atmospheric deposition organic nitrogen nitrogen accumulation nitrogen flow nitrogen cycling and nitrogen output a trend of diversification of research contents was obvious but the research subjects still mainly focused on bodies of water e g catchment area the north sea and on certain regions e g north america the number of common keywords increased further from 2001 to 2010 and the many new keywords during this period caused it to account for the largest proportion of the total 74 in addition to the keywords for research content that appeared in the previous period new research hotspots appeared in large numbers such as inorganic nitrogen nitrogen loads nitrogen cycle nitrogen in agricultural activities including agricultural practices food production chemical fertilizer residual n atmospheric nitrogen such as n2o emissions nitrogen balances temporal variation and spatial distribution of nitrogen the keywords for the research subjects were also more diverse and agriculture e g agricultural soils agricultural lands farming system paddy field forest e g forest soils country e g south korea city e g urban area and rural area became new key research subjects in addition a small number of keywords about research methods e g network environ analysis seven compartment model influence analysis e g indirect effects environmental effects and management objectives e g good agreement began to appear the largest number of frequent keywords 150 appeared from 2011 to march 2020 which was is the most prosperous period in the research on reactive nitrogen flows with a sharp increase from 95 in the previous period the research subjects and contents included all the categories of keywords from previous periods but nitrogen metabolism also became an important common keyword the research methods mainly included material flow analysis e g substance flow analysis which has become a mainstream method of nitrogen research since 2011 in addition the number of keywords for influence factors related to human activities and urban development increased e g human activity anthropogenic activity rapid urbanization but keywords for management goals still accounted for a small proportion of the total 2 during this period mainly involving environmental management and food security 4 2 keyword clustering analysis keyword co occurrence analysis can reveal research hotspots but keyword clustering analysis highlights the relationships between research directions and keywords our cluster analysis revealed eight clusters urban metabolism nitrogen deposition fluxes denitrification anthropogenic nitrous oxide budget and network environ analysis fig 6 these clusters cover three aspects research perspective research content and research method urban metabolism was the largest cluster although it appears relatively late in the study period 2001 march 2020 it reflects the process perspective that became important in reactive nitrogen research at the beginning of the 21st century many scholars focused on reactive nitrogen metabolism at a city scale for example baker et al 2001 calculated the nitrogen balance in natural and socioeconomic activities in phoenix usa and established a nitrogen budget model that included both natural and anthropogenic nitrogen fixation the nitrogen input items considered in their model included wet deposition surface water biological fixation food livestock feed fossil fuels inorganic fertilizers and chemical products whereas nitrogen outputs included exports of animal and plant products sewage discharge waste gas discharge and denitrification this was the earliest study of reactive nitrogen flows at a city scale subsequently forkes 2007 focused on processes related to the urban food metabolism and calculated the balance of food nitrogen input storage and output in toronto canada while accounting for the recycling of nitrogen from food wastes similarly gierlinger 2015 calculated the nitrogen flows in food and livestock feed in vienna austria during the city s industrial transformation from the perspective of urban metabolism based on previous studies zhang et al 2016a b considered all urban compartments involved in nitrogen transfer calculated the nitrogen flow along each metabolic pathway and constructed a relatively complete urban nitrogen metabolism network model in addition singh and kennedy 2018 developed a new response model to analyze the impact of urban metabolic processes on carbon and nitrogen cycles and biodiversity and applied this model in a case study of shanghai china nitrogen deposition was the second largest cluster and spanned 22 years 1996 2018 reflecting the importance of accounting for nitrogen deposition as early as 1988 derwent et al 1988 had accounted for nitrogen deposition in their nitrogen budget study in the united kingdom and northwestern europe however because early publications usually had no keywords this publication was not included in the keyword clustering map subsequent studies on nitrogen input he et al 2007 nitrogen cycles yang and gruber 2016 nitrogen metabolism zhang et al 2016a b nitrogen accumulation han et al 2011 nitrogen balance baker et al 2001 and nitrogen budgets singh and våje 1998 all included nitrogen deposition as an essential accounting item for example the widely cited toolbox developed by hong et al 2011 for calculating net anthropogenic nitrogen input considers atmospheric nitrogen deposition as an important accounting item in addition many scholars investigated the parameters related to nitrogen deposition for example du et al 2008 monitored the inorganic nitrogen deposition in subtropical evergreen mixed forests in central and southern china he et al 2010 estimated the total nitrogen deposition in the agricultural ecosystem in northern china during the wheat growing season and lu et al 2012 studied the spatial and temporal changes of nitrogen deposition in china and their effects on carbon budgets additional clusters included fluxes 2000 2019 denitrification 1995 2018 anthropogenic 1996 2015 nitrous oxide 1995 2017 and budget 1997 2018 which we have listed in order of the cluster size this reflects the refinement brion et al 2008 david et al 2006 and quantification shindo 2012 of descriptions of biochemical nitrogen cycling processes while fully considering the impacts of human activities on the nitrogen cycle kirchner et al 2005 zhou et al 2014 the final cluster was network environ analysis this cluster is small and appeared relatively late in the study period 2002 2019 related keywords appeared in large numbers in 2002 but were sporadically distributed in other years this method has been mostly applied in analyses of metabolic processes and has been applied at multiple scales such as watersheds forès et al 1994 whipple et al 2007 and cities zhang et al 2016a b 5 knowledge base analysis 5 1 co citation cluster analysis co occurrence analysis can reveal the development context current situation and research hotspots of a field but co citation analysis reveals the knowledge base and developmental background of the field reference co citation refers to the phenomenon in which two references are cited by the same publication we found 14 246 co cited references in the 326 publications from 1954 to 2019 by setting the threshold for the co citation frequency to 2 and clustering the references by keywords we obtained eight clusters fig 7 which mainly reflected three aspects research content research perspective and research subject if we compare the maps of co occurrence clustering fig 6 and co citation clustering fig 7 we can see high similarity between the two maps both include urban metabolism denitrification atmospheric deposition and nitrogen budget clusters indicating that these research aspects are not only research hotspots but also important knowledge bases however the time span in the clustering of co cited publications is larger due to the larger number of cited publications and the wider research content involved for example the co citation clusters also focus on the research content of nitrogen cycling and the word clusters of industrial production and urban ecology emerged which more fully reflect the knowledge support from different disciplines such as economics urbanism and ecology and the increasingly interdisciplinary characteristics of this field nitrogen as a basic element in this field became the largest co cited cluster and the time span of the publications was from 2002 to 2008 nitrogen budget and atmospheric deposition also formed relatively large clusters in the co cited publications and both clusters appeared earlier than in the co occurrence clustering 1994 2002 and 1986 1995 respectively the occurrence of the atmospheric deposition cluster in the co citation clustering map was earlier than the similar nitrogen deposition cluster 1995 2018 in the co occurrence keyword clustering map which reflects how the early research on atmospheric nitrogen deposition laid a solid theoretical and methodological foundation for subsequent research on nitrogen deposition in addition the co citation clusters nitrogen cycling and denitrification had a small cluster size and appeared later in 2002 2015 and 2009 2018 respectively and most references to them were consistent with the co occurrence analysis the clusters named after research subjects were industrial production and urban ecology industrial production was the second largest cluster in the co citation clusters but appeared relatively late in the study period 2008 2018 this is because more and more scholars began focusing on nitrogen accounting in socioeconomic systems during the later stages of the study period as a key link in nitrogen utilization and conversion industrial production has become a key knowledge base as the urban ecosystem is a region where human activities are highly concentrated nitrogen flows in cities have attracted more and more attention from scholars the urban ecology literature also provides methods and theoretical support for the development of research on reactive nitrogen flows in addition the co citation clustering map also has the research perspective cluster urban metabolism that appeared in the keyword co occurrence clustering map this shows that urban metabolism is not only a research hotspot but also an important knowledge base comparing the city to an organism and exploring the processes of urban nitrogen transfer from the perspective of metabolism provides a new method and new perspective for the analysis of reactive nitrogen flows 5 2 analysis of the most frequently co cited publications through co citation analysis we identified the 15 papers with the highest citation frequency a citation frequency 10 these mainly involve the knowledge bases of case studies and modeling methods among them 86 7 of the most frequently co cited references were publications involved in the research frontier analysis table 1 there were 13 case studies among the 15 most frequently cited publications which involved nitrogen cycles nitrogen outputs nitrogen budgets nitrogen fixation nitrogen flows and the impact of urbanization the most frequently cited publication was galloway et al s 2008 study on the global nitrogen cycle 22 citations dc 0 24 this publication appeared in the top academic journal science and analyzed the trends in global nitrogen production their spatial distribution and nitrogen transfers in trade from 1860 to 2005 it also answered questions such as the ultimate fate of nitrogen how climate change affects nitrogen creation how reactive nitrogen affects human health and how the development of biofuels will change the n cycle and proposes possible solutions this paper has been widely cited because of its comprehensive content and the many research issues it addressed similarly galloway et al s 2004 paper nitrogen cycles past present and future was also heavily cited this paper had the highest centrality 17 citations dc 0 28 of all the most frequently cited references it compared the differences between natural and anthropogenic nitrogen creation analyzed the global nitrogen cycle from 1860 to the 1990s and predicted the global nitrogen creation in 2050 in addition studies related to the nitrogen cycle included case studies that focused on the impact of human activities erisman et al 2013 12 citations the nitrogen cycle in the 21st century fowler et al 2013 11 citations and the nitrogen cycle from an earth systems perspective gruber and galloway 2008 10 citations and together these accounted for the largest proportion 38 5 of the 13 most frequently cited case studies thereby representing an important knowledge base in the field of reactive nitrogen flow co cited case studies related to watershed nitrogen output accounted for 23 1 of the most frequently cited studies these studies used field monitoring data to carry out large scale research from multiple perspectives for example boyer et al 2002 compared the nitrogen inputs and outputs of 16 watersheds in the united states and accounted for the influence of climate on the nitrogen budget of a watershed 13 citations similarly howarth et al 2006 calculated the average nitrogen flux of 16 major watersheds in the northeastern united states from 1988 to 1993 to determine how climate affected the nitrogen flux in rivers 10 citations in addition howarth et al 1996 estimated the total nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes in the north atlantic basin 14 regional rivers in north america south america europe and africa and analyzed the effects of population density anthropogenic nitrogen input and regional differences in the total nitrogen fluxes in the basin 10 citations high frequency co cited publications on the impact of human activities accounted for 26 7 of the total among them gu et al 2012 studied the influence of long term urbanization 1952 2004 on nitrogen form and dynamics in the greater shanghai area focusing on the driving factors behind the changes in nitrogen budget at an urban scale 14 citations at a national scale ti et al 2012 estimated the nitrogen inputs and outputs of mainland china based on a land use map and the latest statistical data and compared these values with the nitrogen budgets of other countries 13 citations gu et al 2015 studied the circulation and loss of reactive nitrogen in 14 subsystems in china and found that excessive growth of reactive nitrogen threatened human health farmland sustainability and the ecological environment 10 citations in addition smil 1999 focused on the nitrogen balance at a global agricultural scale and emphasized the impact of fertilizer application on the agricultural nitrogen balance 10 citations moreover it is worth mentioning that a paper that described a modeling method and a book on nitrogen estimation in europe also appeared in the most frequently cited publications leach et al 2012 developed a national nitrogen footprint calculation model which can provide information on the processes responsible for losses of reactive nitrogen into the environment caused by individual or collective activities and provided a tool and knowledge base for the analysis of reactive nitrogen flows at the output end of a cycle 12 citations sutton et al 2011 conducted an in depth study of reactive nitrogen in europe from three perspectives sources impacts and policy outlook they compiled their findings into a book that provides an important reference for regional scale research on reactive nitrogen flows and the book has been widely cited 15 citations 6 conclusions and prospects by analyzing the literature on reactive nitrogen at a macro scale we defined the foundational knowledge and characterized the rapid development of this research its evolution towards multidisciplinary research and the diversity of the research nitrogen deposition denitrification and other natural nitrogen processes have always been the focus of attention with the gradual strengthening of awareness of the significant impact of human activities on the nitrogen cycle the nitrogen metabolism of cities and nitrogen balances more and more scholars have begun to pay attention to reactive nitrogen flows in global cycles industrial and agricultural production processes and the urban areas where human activities are highly concentrated in addition researchers have increasingly acknowledged the importance of sustainable and healthy development of the ecological environment leading to increasing research emphasis on the factors that influence nitrogen flows and management of nitrogen related processes further diversifying the research based on our analysis we predict that reactive nitrogen research will continue to diversify and deepen with the following four directions becoming new research hotspots 1 based on our analysis of the research frontiers and our knowledge base analysis research on urban metabolism and urban ecology appear likely to remain important in combination with the emergence of a large number of keywords such as metropolitan area rapid urbanization and urban sustainability in recent years research at an urban scale appears likely to attract increasing attention from scholars and the impact of urbanization on the flows of reactive nitrogen will become a continuing research topic this is especially pertinent in light of the united nations sustainable development goals on cities and communities 2 combined with the co occurrence analysis we found that keywords such as sewage treatment plants food flow and solid waste treatment have recently appeared in large numbers this suggests that treating reactive nitrogen flows as a single process with clearer flow links and more detailed accounting parameters is attracting increasing attention from scholars increasing the accuracy of the research results through this tighter focus and ensuring the refinement of the research methods will therefore become important agricultural cycles mark another avenue of intersection of nitrogen in nature and human well being that will garner needed attention in future research 3 existing research on reactive nitrogen flows comprises mostly reviews case studies and methodology development or application with relatively few studies about the factors that influence these flows and future regulatory measures to reduce flows of reactive nitrogen which are topics that began to appear in the later stages of our study period this shows that with the gradual strengthening of human ecological and environmental awareness and of the concept of sustainable development scholars are beginning to explore the reasons behind the related problems and finding solutions to these problems relevant studies serving the goal of efficient and low pollution management of reactive nitrogen will therefore become hotspots 4 in addition with the development of human society the global climate has undergone significant changes mainly manifested in three aspects acid rain climate warming and ozone layer destruction nitrogen emission is an important cause of nitric acid rain nox is one of the greenhouse gasses that cause global warming and it also has strong interactions with the carbon cycle that can have global scale effects on atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane galloway 2008 therefore a new line of research perhaps not evident yet in this review is the role of nitrogen in the climate equation studies of reactive nitrogen flows in macroscopic systems can provide theoretical support for reducing nitrogen consumption at the source and improving nitrogen utilization efficiency in processes thus reducing nitrogen emission and mitigating climate change declaration

24662,demography is at the core of ecology evolution and conservation biology the simple recognition that individuals in a given population contribute to its dynamics in different ways revolutionised the ways in which demographers approach data collection analyses and interpretation of their study populations from bacteria to humans matrix population models discrete time discrete state i e individuals are categorised into discrete categories based on traits such as age or stage were first introduced to the scientific community by patrick leslie 75 years ago since then the applications of matrix population models to ecology evolution and conservation biology have strongly been running strong and in parallel with its robust mathematical development this special feature contains 14 novel contributions that represent some the cutting edge mathematical formulations and applications of this powerful demographic tool in addition to highlighting the key contributions of this manuscripts we provide suggestions to some of the challenges that researchers using matrix population models must overcome in the coming decades to truly unlock the potential of this analytical demographic tool keywords comparative biology data gaps matrix averaging population ecology potential growth indicators population viability stochastic growth rate 1 introduction the 1945 publication on the use of matrices in certain population mathematics by patrick h leslie has revolutionised mathematical demography and population ecology this manuscript together with many others produced throughout leslie s prolific career 1948 caswell 2001 and refs therein marked the inception of the vastly rich world of matrix population models mpms hereafter now at the 75th anniversary of the publication of this seminal contribution mpms have moved from being an exclusively useful exercise in certain population mathematics to a powerful frequently used tool across numerous disciplines including ecology e g crone et al 2011 evolution e g van tienderen 1995 and conservation biology e g morris and doak 2002 mpms have been applied to a wide range of taxonomic groups from humans nicol harper et al 2018 to whales chiquet et al 2013 penguins jenouvrier et al 2012 plants salguero gómez et al 2016 bacteria watve et al 2006 and even viruses wallace 2004 indeed mpms have become as equally popular among field ecologists as they continue to be among theoretical ecologists even now leslie s pioneering work motivates new developments in the mathematical theory of nonnegative matrices li and schneider 2002 tuljapurkar and haridas 2006 protasov and logofet 2014 logofet 2018 2019a razzhevaikin and tyrtyshnikov 2020 a single mathematical basis of diverse applications mpms

2007 depending on the data source and organism under study mpms face interesting analytical challenges but also provide unique research and methodological opportunities the special issue theory and practice in matrix population modelling in ecological modelling aims to reflect the current state of the art in the theory and practice of matrix population modelling together the special feature includes 14 contributions marked hereafter with si that address topics at the frontiers of mpm s development and applications our goal here is to outline some of the next frontiers in the theory and praxis of the mpm world while highlighting how each of these publications makes a clear contribution to these areas 2 1 exploring taxonomic ecoregion biases although the usage of mpm across a wide range of species and regions has become a reality important biases remain in the demographic literature conde et al 2019 these biases are preventing researchers from examining the validity of general rules see next section for instance even though most of the terrestrial biodiversity worldwide is found in tropical ecoregions tomašových 2019 wang et al 2019 loiseau et al 2020 most of the studies that have used mpms on terrestrial animals and plants have taken place in grasslands and temperate ecoregions salguero gómez et al 2015a b from this angle the following manuscripts in this special feature make contributions to expanding our demographic knowledge across the tree of life and the planet pinto et al 2020 si make an important contribution to our understanding of the demography of insects insects are the most specious animal groups with an estimated 1 million species zhang 2013 yet very little is known about their demography particularly using mpms this dearth of insect data contrasts with their rather discrete life cycles which renders them particularly amenable to modelling via mpms caswell 2001 these authors explore the demographic and performance effects of alternative host usage by a neotropical treehopper alchisme grossa to examine whether these effects exert a selective pressure sufficient for the evolution of species divergence in the bolivian yungas forests the subsocial treehopper hemiptera membracidae utilises two sympatric hosts brugmansia suaveolens and solanum ursinum adults use their natal host species and females take care of nymphs e g feeding facilitation antidepredatory defense during their development on both hosts however the duration of pre imaginal development differs markedly between the host species but two corresponding stage structured mpms have not revealed any statistical difference in their λ1s hence individuals of a grossa though hatching to different hosts still belong to a single species population thus the contribution opens a new direction for resolving the eternal dialectics of population dynamics vs evolution another important contribution from the angle of ecoregion representativeness is that by santostasi et al 2020 si who developed and introduced a framework to examine the role of hybridisation for two case studies with one of them being in marine species below this is particularly important as most of our demographic understanding across the tree of lie is constrained to terrestrial ecosystems despite our dependence on the resources and ecosystem services that aquatic ecosystems provide tallis and kareiva 2005 2 2 finding generality in ecology evolution and conservation biology using big data ecology evolution and conservation biology are ideally positioned to tackle and provide solutions to the current biodiversity crisis of the anthropocene proctor 2013 however most ecological evolutionary and conservation biology research that has been carried out to date with mpms has been local in spatial extent and focus on single species all species from escherichia coli to blue whales balaenoptera musculus have in common the fact that individuals in their populations must invest to a certain degree in four key demographic vital rates survival development reproduction and recruitment notably however there is a great deal of variation in how individuals fine tune the investment of the limited energy via trade offs in each of these vital rates gaillard et al 1989 salguero gómez et al 2016 healy et al 2019 however despite the vast amount of life history strategy variation that emerges from this differential investment in vital rates these vital rates ultimately allow species to persist and adapt to their local environments stearns 1992 the last decades have witnessed the utilisation of ever growing volumes of published mpms from open access databases salguero gómez et al 2015a b to tackle questions regarding the universality of the evolution of senescence jones et al 2014 salguero gómez 2017 the link between functional traits and demographic performance adler et al 2014 the predictive power of demographic schedules for species presence and absence csergő et al 2017 the examination of main axes of variation in life history strategies salguero gomez et al 2016 healy et al 2019 or responses of organisms to climate change herrando perez s 2013 decomposition analyses in demographic studies such as life table response experiments ltre caswell 2000 have become a common powerful way to examine ways in which experimental treatments affect the overall dynamics of a population via its underlying vital rates these solutions have now been developed both for deterministic caswell 2000 as well as stochastic environments caswell 2010 2019 davison et al 2010 davison et al 2019 si apply stochastic ltre sltre tools to a subset of 220 populations from 62 species archived in comadre and compadre they find that stochasticity drives 28 of fitness effects exceeding the mean effects by 7 78 and thus further evidencing the need to describe populations and their abiotic effects in stochastic rather than deterministic terms together these novel contributions accentuate the promise of using large volumes of demographic data to find generality in ecology evolution and conservation biology 2 3 eco evolutionary dynamics classically evolution i e the change in phenotypes in populations linked to their heritability via natural selection and ecology i e the interactions of individuals with their own kind other species and their local environments have been treated as self contained disciplines acting in their separate silos the main argument for their separation was a temporal one under the assumption that evolution occurs at much longer time scales than ecology however research in the last decade has revealed that evolution can and oftentimes does shape individual performance and community dynamics at relatively short time scales e g via rapid evolution hart et al 2019 similarly ecological interactions can have long lasting repercussions that place them right at the same temporal scale as classical evolutionary thinking hendry 2017 power et al 2018 demographic tools allow for the reconciliation of eco evolutionary dynamics in a single robust framework govaert et al 2019 takada and shefferson 2018 shefferson and salguero gómez 2015 santostasi et al 2020 si use a novel approach via matrix population models to examine the extinction of specific genomes in hybridizing populations this approach is extremely relevant to our understanding of conservation biology as hybridization is a main mechanism of biodiversity loss in their paper the authors model the breeding of two parental groups as separate components they apply this model to two case studies regarding terrestrial the wolf canis lupus and its domestic counterpart canis lupus familiaris and marine species the striped dolphin stenella coeruleoalba and the common dolphin delphinus delphis facing hybridization this article presents original utilisations of the matrix based demographic machinery to advance our understanding of eco evolutionary dynamics 2 4 testing and overcoming classical assumptions in demographic modelling since the rigid postulates of leslie s demographic model testing and overcoming classical assumptions have been representing the main course of the mathematical developments of mpms lefkovitch 1965 cohen 1979 tuljapurkar 1990 2013 logofet 1993 2018 cushing and yicang 1994 caswell 2001 and refs therein li and schneider 2002 logofet 2013 2018 the following contributions make important progress along this course de vries et al 2020 si barraquand and gimenez 2019 si and takada and kawai 2020 si the contribution by de vries et al 2020 si provides methods to overcome two classical assumptions in mpms first motivated by application to pesticide resistance in the flour beetle tribolium castaneum the authors add genotype as the second basis to classify individuals a rarely considered yet important trait but see coulson et al 2011 thus expanding the classical formalism to a general framework for the stage and genotype structured population second when the classical linearity of demography meets the classical nonlinearity of population genetics the ppm becomes a nonlinear density dependent operator governing selection in this kind of population the jacobian matrix of this operator enables obtaining the stability conditions of homozygous equilibria in particular those of pesticide resistance domination these results are useful for the pest management theory and they open a novel dimension in studying eco evolutionary dynamic barraquand and gimenez 2019 si have overcome the classical mpm paradigm of single species population dynamics by introducing a stage structured model for a predator prey community in which the populations are represented by juveniles and adults predation is stage specific and the juvenile prey density positively affects predator fecundity estimating the parameters of species interaction in this framework requires a combination of traditional and novel ways to integrate data for single species demography thus leading to integrated community models icms in a sense this returns to the second birth of population dynamic models i e the classical lotka volterra prey predator equations lotka 1925 volterra 1931 our authors assessed the value of different data sources using simulations of icms under different scenarios contrasting data availability and the presence absence of intraspecific density dependent effects combining all the data types capture recapture counts and reproduction surveys allows the estimation of both demographic and interaction parameters unlike count only data which typically generate high bias and low precision in the interaction parameter estimates for short time series as an accurate representation of stage structure in community dynamics the icms open a wide spectrum of research perspectives from the development of efficient observational study designs for monitoring communities in the field to the analysis of more sophisticated stage structured mpms takada and kawai 2020 si avail from the large volume of mpms stored in the compadre plant matrix database salguero gómez 2015a to examine the most optimal way to analyse and depict elasticities of population growth rate with respect to vital rates in a comparative framework elasticities i e the relative impacts of different demographic processes on the overall dynamics of a population de kroon et al 1986 2000 remain one of the most widely ways to quantify demographic processes impacts on the viability of species morris and doak 2002 however the ways in which they have been quantified and visualised e g enright et al 1995 franco and silvertown 2004 has not been free of criticism e g shea et al 1994 franco and silvertown 1994 specifically takada and kawai use 68 mpms from semelparous plant species in compadre to examine the biologically meaningful patterns that should emerged from their elasticity vectors when presented in a ternary plot then they contrast these results to those of randomly generated mpms with the same life history strategy their analyses help explain why when the elasticities to survival growth and reproduction of plant species are plotted on a ternary plot the overall pattern shows a strong curvature with a gap in the ternary plot that is not invadable 2 5 novel contributions to stochastic demography examining stochastic demographic properties by means of mpms is typically done when more than one a time series of ppms annual ppms exist for a single population this approach has become popular in ecology as most ecological systems are characterised by oscillatory environmental conditions salguero gómez and de kroon 2010 and climate change projects are likely to make natural systems suffer from a high frequency of climatic anomalies ipcc 2020 in this approach the stochastic growth rate λ s is typically defined via an infinite sequence of annual ppms chosen at random from the given finite set of annual ppms and it is generally used as a proxy to population viability in the stochastic environment in the special case of permanent non stochastic environment λ s coincides with λ 1 the asymptotic growth rate on the one hand theoretical approximations of λ s exist that require certain additional assumptions regarding the given set of ppms such as the deviations from an average ppm with known temporal auto covariances of the vital rates tuljapurkar 1990 caswell 2001 section 14 3 6 3 on the other hand once a rule for the random choice of matrices such as the i i d independent identically distributed matrices ibid the simplest and most popular rule e g cohen 1979 caswell 2001 buckley et al 2010 has been accepted but see paniw et al 2018 the λ s can be estimated from a series of monte carlo simulations of the long enough random sequence unfortunately the assumptions of both theoretical estimates of λ s and monte carlo simulations may often not be accepted in practice the challenge is therefore to attenuate those assumptions in response to theoretical and practical needs a key paper in this regard is by sanz 2019 si in it the author considers minimal and maximal vital rates among the given ppms and obtains four new lower and upper bounds for the stochastic growth rate these bounds enable calculating the sufficient conditions for population growth or population extinction the author illustrates those conditions with a hypothetical random environment toggling between poor and rich situations practical needs dictate rejecting the assumption of modelling stochastic dynamics of a natural population according to i i d instead a more realistic approximation is to arrange the simulations in a way that reflect ways in which the natural environment oscillates through time ipcc 2020 since the i i d assumption represents a particular degenerate case of the time homogeneous markov chain logofet et al 2020c an important challenge for future research is to construct a governing markov chain whose states would correspond to different types of environmental conditions and to calibrate its transition matrix from real data on those conditions the metapopulation environments may change randomly as well as that of a single population in this special issue sanz and bravo de la parra 2019 si analyse the situation where the migrations between patches and demographic processes proceed at different time scales the former being k times faster than the latter common formalisms for discrete structured populations suggest that these two kinds of event occur sequentially one after the other so that the combined effect of both processes can be described by the product of the slow process matrix times the k th power of the fast process matrix in nature however the processes may act simultaneously the authors alternatively included survival into the fast process and approximated its effect during the fast time unit referring to such an approach as the re scaling of survival to the fast time scale they adapt their original method of re scaling to the proposed stochastic models and compared the asymptotic behaviour of the model populations with and without re scaled survival the outcome of principal importance is that the corresponding stochastic growth rates may appear qualitatively different for the same vital rate values while the former predicts exponential growth the latter indicates extinction so the order of events does matter in the mpm formalism for metapopulation dynamics in the stochastic environment the both versions are ready in theory and now it is the turn of real migrating populations to migrate right here van daalen and caswell 2020 si introduce a framework to simultaneously quantify the variance components in demographic vs environmental stochasticity in life history outcomes using matrix population models the introduced mathematical machinery allows for the calculation of such effects in a general manner the authors further illustrate the power of their approach using frailty analyses of fruit flies and explicitly quantifying survival reproduction trade offs in a plant study this approach has the great potential to understand the extent to which demographic stochasticity vs environmental stochasticity shape population outcomes worldwide as regards climate change romanov and masterov 2020 si compare the effects of adult survival and productivity on the persistence of the steller s sea eagle haliaeetus pelagicus populations the authors simulated the corresponding mpm under several scenarios in a stochastic environment and found that the fecundity alone varying within broad limits can lead to population decline in this charismatic species although the population growth is less sensitive to the fecundity than to adult survival the authors argue that the former is more appropriate as a target of conservation management 2 6 averaging the ppms an alternative way to assess population viability in stochastic environments from a given set of annual ppms is to calculate λ 1 g the dominant eigenvalue of the average matrix g however in contrast to nonnegative numbers it is not trivial to average several given nonnegative matrices unless the average is arithmetic or weighted arithmetic due to the linearity of matrices as operators in the vector space arithmetic average might make sense when the matrices to be averaged represent a metapopulation distributed among several habitats at the same moment of time but it does not make sense when we have a time series of m 2 ppms from the initial moment of observation l 1 to the final one l m if we want the average matrix g to project population vectors in the exactly same manner as the annual ppms do then it has to be their multiplicative or geometric by the analogy with numbers average logofet 2018 logofet et al 2018a b which suggests extracting the m th root of the matrix product to find a unique nonnegative matrix root is a matter of nontrivial calculations with a serious theory behind polity popolizio 2014 2015 a practical sufficient condition for the unique principal root a 1 m to exist for a given matrix a is the lack of negative zero eigenvalues in the spectrum of a ibid and the routine can really succeed in this case however what the routine returns will hardly have the same matrix pattern as the ppms to be averaged it will rather be positive valued at best or complex valued in general the both cases making no sense as an average ppm that should correspond to the same lcg as the given ppms to be averaged this requirement motivated a new concept of matrix average namely the pattern geometric average logofet 2018 or pattern multiplicative average to be pedantic meaning the same matrix pattern of the average matrix g as of those to be averaged it is also logical that each element of g lies within the bounds of this element known from the set of given ppms mathematically finding the pattern multiplicative average of a given set of annual ppms reduces to a kind of constrained optimization problem and this problem was efficiently solved for some practical cases logofet 2018 logofet et al 2018a b 2019 but theoretical issues are still to be investigated in what concerns the uniqueness and accuracy of the optimal solution the λ s and λ 1 g these two measures of viability assessment generate the question of how they correlate quantitatively when applied in real cases and dmitrii logofet has tried to give an answer 2019b si two former case studies of alpine red book perennials eritrichium caucasicum and androsace albana resulted in respectively two sets of 8 annual ppms based on which both λ s estimates and λ 1 g values are reported these both measures of population viability turn out fairly close each other in both case studies but e caucasicum λ s estimates are unambiguously less than λ 1 g whereas those for a albana are certainly greater than λ 1 g the reason for this difference is not yet known which gives one more incentive to further developing both the λ s and λ 1 g methods 2 7 uses and abuses as with any research tool that is both highly technical and popular matrix population models are not free of accidental mis usage we are not the first ones to call for caution in the construction analysis and interpretation of mpms e g caswell 2001 our hope here is to be the last ones in this special feature nguyen et al 2019 si and kendall et al 2019 si provide invaluable advices on how to use this tool as well as the vast amount of demographic data available in the format of an mpm nguyen et al 2019 si highlight once again doak et al 2002 the importance of getting the basic life cycle right before parameterising the pertinent matrix population model there is a wealth of mpms for species across the tree of life werner and caswell 1977 caswell 2001 salguero gómez 2015a b however some of the models particularly in plants may not contain all or the most key life cycle stages in the case of some plant species permanent seed banks do occur but are often not included due to logistical practicalities of the fieldwork nguyen et al s work show that their inclusion exclusion can have very important repercussions for the ways we assess the deterministic and stochastic dynamics of the populations under study importantly the emerging message therein is that the ways in which ignoring cryptic life stages affects our estimates of population performance are not systematically biased in a specific way rendering generalisations with these key data rather limiting kendall et al 2019 si present a summary of a subset of published mpms in animal species the authors highlight three errors commonly encountered in published mpms 1 failing to include survival in the fertility coefficient 2 introducing a one year delay in the age at first reproduction and 3 incorrectly calculating the growth rate out of a stage class the first two errors are found in 34 and 62 respectively of the published studies collected in comadre of the studies where stages may last longer than one time step 53 constructed the growth rate using inappropriate formulas for estimating the asymptotic population growth rate or its sensitivity to demographic parameters kendall et al review the sources of such errors and reveal their impact on model predictions using lionfish and american alligator models as examples these results suggest that further efforts are required to educate biologists on the construction of mpms and many studies that are based on mpms may need to be re examined synthetic studies using the comadre database need to be accompanied by careful examination of the underlying knowledge and data luckily the researchers curating large demographic datasets are well aware of these issues and are expediently working together with the demographic community to help the users of big data overcome these challenges the solutions are already discussed in the response to kendall et al s paper in a complementary response by che castaldo et al 2020 2 8 how many bases to classify individuals what is mentioned above concerns mostly what to do with ready mpms but to get them ready given some knowledge of data on a particular population is not a self evident nor a simple task historically the certain population mathematics adopted highly rigid postulates about the population age structure and proposed a highly specific pattern of the leslie matrix leslie 1945 then the postulates were attenuated and the pattern expanded to the stage structure lefkovitch 1965 and to the generalised stage structure that suggested a classification of individuals by any observable measurable trait such as size weight etc caswell 2001 soon a single trait became insufficient to practical demands where data on two traits such as age and developmental stage logofet et al 2006 2014 2016 caswell salguero gómez 2013 stage and space hunter caswell 2005 or stage and genotype de vries et al 2019 si were available and the model formalism was expanded to block structured ppms ibid caswell 2012 more samples of pairs in roth and caswell 2016 the block structured ppms appear also in the single trait metapopulation model with migrations among the local habitats sanz bravo de la parra 2019 si here the issue of time scale difference between demographic and migration processes needs further investigation today we witness an attempt to formalise an mpm for multi trait population data a 3 trait case in coste and pavard 2020 si the ppm transforms now to a 3d array of vital rates which is called a tensor in mathematics authors have not yet dared to launch this term to the field of mpms but it will perhaps become common for the future generations of matrix modellers note however that a hyperstate matrix model a competing term has already been launched by roth and caswell 2016 with a general formalism for many bases 3 concluding remarks the diversity of topics presented above are sufficient to recognize the mpm as a powerful multi tool for modeling the population and community dynamics however the range of topics covered in this editorial does not represent the wide spectrum of mpm applications in ecology evolution and conservation science below we discuss two of many potential areas of further enquiry where mpms have much to offer to researchers 3 1 potential growth indicators among the current challenges of mpms studying their mathematical foundations is a key one in particular the most commonly used outcome of an mpm is λ 1 l its dominant eigenvalue i e the asymptotic population growth rate which is interpreted as a measure of population adaptation that is local in space and time matrix modellers are so focused on λ 1 that they frequently forget its subscript 1 in the notation and what the subscript means itself in fact the subscript originated from the standard of nonnegative matrix theory to order all the eigenvalues of a given l by their decreasing absolute values so that the dominant eigenvalue which is always positive by the perron frobenius theorem becomes λ 1 however recent findings have revealed λ 2 l to be important too specifically if λ 2 is positive and less than 1 then a simple function of matrix elements r 1 l 1 det i l can serve as a potential growth indicator hereafter pgi in other words under these conditions the pgi always locates at the same side of λ 1 as λ 1 l does protasov logofet 2014 logofet 2019a there are certain merits of indication prior to the calculation of λ 1 in particular r 1 l has turned out useful in solving calibration problems under data uncertainty logofet 2013 another more senior pgi instance is the well known net reproductive rate r 0 l ρ f i t 1 where ρ denotes the spectral radius the largest absolute value of matrix eigenvalues and l t f the sum of its transition and fertility parts cushing yicang 1994 caswell 2001 however calculating the spectral radius is in general much more difficult than the determinant in r 1 l the problem with r 1 l is that its pgi property is proved for a less general class of ppm patterns than r 0 l is valid for a recent expansion of the classical perron frobenius theory namely the theory of rank 1 corrections of nonnegative matrices protasov logofet 2014 has enabled proving the pgi property of r 1 l when the rank of fertility part f equals 1 for instance when f has only one nonzero row or column of fertility rates meaning a single recruiting or a single generative stage in the lcg respectively can this wide yet not universal class of ppms be expanded some particular examples give a positive answer but theoretical justification is still a target for future efforts 3 2 integer valued formalism the identified individuals a standard for stage structured demographic models caswell 2001 p 134 can often provide the calibration of ppms in a unique way since all the events of transitions along the lcg links are inherent in the data the transition rates are just the frequencies of the corresponding events hence the rates are certain rational numbers according to the arithmetic way of calculation naturally the number of recruited individuals is always integer however the tradition is to treat the basic calibration equation of the mpm as an equation in real numbers in spite the rational valued ppm does project x t an integer valued population vector into the integer valued x t 1 the old tradition to deal with real numbers did make certain sense in the last century when computers had only been dealing with binary representations of all numbers including the machine approximations of the irrational roots of the characteristic polynomials however modern systems of mathematical software such as r or matlab with its symbolic algebra toolbox mathworks 2020 enable algebraic manipulations with the rational integer valued numbers as symbols thus avoiding the machine round off errors and providing for the absolute logical accuracy of calculations also the existence of strong computational support enables us to validate each step of the calibration or manipulation in other related problems e g backward prediction clutton brock and sheldon 2010 ehrlén et al 2016 nater et al 2018 logofet et al 2020a or uncertainties in the dynamics of cryptic stages paniw et al 2017 nguen et al 2019 si logofet et al 2020b si the calibration equation or other pertinent expressions hold true with the absolute accuracy for the integer or rational valued parameters unlike the approximate real values to be found from the classical least squares procedures of curve fitting this approach helps solve at least some of the persistent problems in the construction of matrix population models and we encourage matrix modellers to incorporate them in their demographic enterprises acknowledgements dl was supported by the russian foundation for basic research grant 19 04 01227 rs g was supported by a nerc independent

24662,demography is at the core of ecology evolution and conservation biology the simple recognition that individuals in a given population contribute to its dynamics in different ways revolutionised the ways in which demographers approach data collection analyses and interpretation of their study populations from bacteria to humans matrix population models discrete time discrete state i e individuals are categorised into discrete categories based on traits such as age or stage were first introduced to the scientific community by patrick leslie 75 years ago since then the applications of matrix population models to ecology evolution and conservation biology have strongly been running strong and in parallel with its robust mathematical development this special feature contains 14 novel contributions that represent some the cutting edge mathematical formulations and applications of this powerful demographic tool in addition to highlighting the key contributions of this manuscripts we provide suggestions to some of the challenges that researchers using matrix population models must overcome in the coming decades to truly unlock the potential of this analytical demographic tool keywords comparative biology data gaps matrix averaging population ecology potential growth indicators population viability stochastic growth rate 1 introduction the 1945 publication on the use of matrices in certain population mathematics by patrick h leslie has revolutionised mathematical demography and population ecology this manuscript together with many others produced throughout leslie s prolific career 1948 caswell 2001 and refs therein marked the inception of the vastly rich world of matrix population models mpms hereafter now at the 75th anniversary of the publication of this seminal contribution mpms have moved from being an exclusively useful exercise in certain population mathematics to a powerful frequently used tool across numerous disciplines including ecology e g crone et al 2011 evolution e g van tienderen 1995 and conservation biology e g morris and doak 2002 mpms have been applied to a wide range of taxonomic groups from humans nicol harper et al 2018 to whales chiquet et al 2013 penguins jenouvrier et al 2012 plants salguero gómez et al 2016 bacteria watve et al 2006 and even viruses wallace 2004 indeed mpms have become as equally popular among field ecologists as they continue to be among theoretical ecologists even now leslie s pioneering work motivates new developments in the mathematical theory of nonnegative matrices li and schneider 2002 tuljapurkar and haridas 2006 protasov and logofet 2014 logofet 2018 2019a razzhevaikin and tyrtyshnikov 2020 a single mathematical basis of diverse applications mpms

practice in matrix population modelling in ecological modelling aims to reflect the current state of the art in the theory and practice of matrix population modelling together the special feature includes 14 contributions marked hereafter with si that address topics at the frontiers of mpm s development and applications our goal here is to outline some of the next frontiers in the theory and praxis of the mpm world while highlighting how each of these publications makes a clear contribution to these areas 2 1 exploring taxonomic ecoregion biases although the usage of mpm across a wide range of species and regions has become a reality important biases remain in the demographic literature conde et al 2019 these biases are preventing researchers from examining the validity of general rules see next section for instance even though most of the terrestrial biodiversity worldwide is found in tropical ecoregions tomašových 2019 wang et al 2019 loiseau et al 2020 most of the studies that have used mpms on terrestrial animals and plants have taken place in grasslands and temperate ecoregions salguero gómez et al 2015a b from this angle the following manuscripts in this special feature make contributions to expanding our demographic knowledge across the tree of life and the planet pinto et al 2020 si make an important contribution to our understanding of the demography of insects insects are the most specious animal groups with an estimated 1 million species zhang 2013 yet very little is known about their demography particularly using mpms this dearth of insect data contrasts with their rather discrete life cycles which renders them particularly amenable to modelling via mpms caswell 2001 these authors explore the demographic and performance effects of alternative host usage by a neotropical treehopper alchisme grossa to examine whether these effects exert a selective pressure sufficient for the evolution of species divergence in the bolivian yungas forests the subsocial treehopper hemiptera membracidae utilises two sympatric hosts brugmansia suaveolens and solanum ursinum adults use their natal host species and females take care of nymphs e g feeding facilitation antidepredatory defense during their development on both hosts however the duration of pre imaginal development differs markedly between the host species but two corresponding stage structured mpms have not revealed any statistical difference in their λ1s hence individuals of a grossa though hatching to different hosts still belong to a single species population thus the contribution opens a new direction for resolving the eternal dialectics of population dynamics vs evolution another important contribution from the angle of ecoregion representativeness is that by santostasi et al 2020 si who developed and introduced a framework to examine the role of hybridisation for two case studies with one of them being in marine species below this is particularly important as most of our demographic understanding across the tree of lie is constrained to terrestrial ecosystems despite our dependence on the resources and ecosystem services that aquatic ecosystems provide tallis and kareiva 2005 2 2 finding generality in ecology evolution and conservation biology using big data ecology evolution and conservation biology are ideally positioned to tackle and provide solutions to the current biodiversity crisis of the anthropocene proctor 2013 however most ecological evolutionary and conservation biology research that has been carried out to date with mpms has been local in spatial extent and focus on single species all species from escherichia coli to blue whales balaenoptera musculus have in common the fact that individuals in their populations must invest to a certain degree in four key demographic vital rates survival development reproduction and recruitment notably however there is a great deal of variation in how individuals fine tune the investment of the limited energy via trade offs in each of these vital rates gaillard et al 1989 salguero gómez et al 2016 healy et al 2019 however despite the vast amount of life history strategy variation that emerges from this differential investment in vital rates these vital rates ultimately allow species to persist and adapt to their local environments stearns 1992 the last decades have witnessed the utilisation of ever growing volumes of published mpms from open access databases salguero gómez et al 2015a b to tackle questions regarding the universality of the evolution of senescence jones et al 2014 salguero gómez 2017 the link between functional traits and demographic performance adler et al 2014 the predictive power of demographic schedules for species presence and absence csergő et al 2017 the examination of main axes of variation in life history strategies salguero gomez et al 2016 healy et al 2019 or responses of organisms to climate change herrando perez s 2013 decomposition analyses in demographic studies such as life table response experiments ltre caswell 2000 have become a common powerful way to examine ways in which experimental treatments affect the overall dynamics of a population via its underlying vital rates these solutions have now been developed both for deterministic caswell 2000 as well as stochastic environments caswell 2010 2019 davison et al 2010 davison et al 2019 si apply stochastic ltre sltre tools to a subset of 220 populations from 62 species archived in comadre and compadre they find that stochasticity drives 28 of fitness effects exceeding the mean effects by 7 78 and thus further evidencing the need to describe populations and their abiotic effects in stochastic rather than deterministic terms together these novel contributions accentuate the promise of using large volumes of demographic data to find generality in ecology evolution and conservation biology 2 3 eco evolutionary dynamics classically evolution i e the change in phenotypes in populations linked to their heritability via natural selection and ecology i e the interactions of individuals with their own kind other species and their local environments have been treated as self contained disciplines acting in their separate silos the main argument for their separation was a temporal one under the assumption that evolution occurs at much longer time scales than ecology however research in the last decade has revealed that evolution can and oftentimes does shape individual performance and community dynamics at relatively short time scales e g via rapid evolution hart et al 2019 similarly ecological interactions can have long lasting repercussions that place them right at the same temporal scale as classical evolutionary thinking hendry 2017 power et al 2018 demographic tools allow for the reconciliation of eco evolutionary dynamics in a single robust framework govaert et al 2019 takada and shefferson 2018 shefferson and salguero gómez 2015 santostasi et al 2020 si use a novel approach via matrix population models to examine the extinction of specific genomes in hybridizing populations this approach is extremely relevant to our understanding of conservation biology as hybridization is a main mechanism of biodiversity loss in their paper the authors model the breeding of two parental groups as separate components they apply this model to two case studies regarding terrestrial the wolf canis lupus and its domestic counterpart canis lupus familiaris and marine species the striped dolphin stenella coeruleoalba and the common dolphin delphinus delphis facing hybridization this article presents original utilisations of the matrix based demographic machinery to advance our understanding of eco evolutionary dynamics 2 4 testing and overcoming classical assumptions in demographic modelling since the rigid postulates of leslie s demographic model testing and overcoming classical assumptions have been representing the main course of the mathematical developments of mpms lefkovitch 1965 cohen 1979 tuljapurkar 1990 2013 logofet 1993 2018 cushing and yicang 1994 caswell 2001 and refs therein li and schneider 2002 logofet 2013 2018 the following contributions make important progress along this course de vries et al 2020 si barraquand and gimenez 2019 si and takada and kawai 2020 si the contribution by de vries et al 2020 si provides methods to overcome two classical assumptions in mpms first motivated by application to pesticide resistance in the flour beetle tribolium castaneum the authors add genotype as the second basis to classify individuals a rarely considered yet important trait but see coulson et al 2011 thus expanding the classical formalism to a general framework for the stage and genotype structured population second when the classical linearity of demography meets the classical nonlinearity of population genetics the ppm becomes a nonlinear density dependent operator governing selection in this kind of population the jacobian matrix of this operator enables obtaining the stability conditions of homozygous equilibria in particular those of pesticide resistance domination these results are useful for the pest management theory and they open a novel dimension in studying eco evolutionary dynamic barraquand and gimenez 2019 si have overcome the classical mpm paradigm of single species population dynamics by introducing a stage structured model for a predator prey community in which the populations are represented by juveniles and adults predation is stage specific and the juvenile prey density positively affects predator fecundity estimating the parameters of species interaction in this framework requires a combination of traditional and novel ways to integrate data for single species demography thus leading to integrated community models icms in a sense this returns to the second birth of population dynamic models i e the classical lotka volterra prey predator equations lotka 1925 volterra 1931 our authors assessed the value of different data sources using simulations of icms under different scenarios contrasting data availability and the presence absence of intraspecific density dependent effects combining all the data types capture recapture counts and reproduction surveys allows the estimation of both demographic and interaction parameters unlike count only data which typically generate high bias and low precision in the interaction parameter estimates for short time series as an accurate representation of stage structure in community dynamics the icms open a wide spectrum of research perspectives from the development of efficient observational study designs for monitoring communities in the field to the analysis of more sophisticated stage structured mpms takada and kawai 2020 si avail from the large volume of mpms stored in the compadre plant matrix database salguero gómez 2015a to examine the most optimal way to analyse and depict elasticities of population growth rate with respect to vital rates in a comparative framework elasticities i e the relative impacts of different demographic processes on the overall dynamics of a population de kroon et al 1986 2000 remain one of the most widely ways to quantify demographic processes impacts on the viability of species morris and doak 2002 however the ways in which they have been quantified and visualised e g enright et al 1995 franco and silvertown 2004 has not been free of criticism e g shea et al 1994 franco and silvertown 1994 specifically takada and kawai use 68 mpms from semelparous plant species in compadre to examine the biologically meaningful patterns that should emerged from their elasticity vectors when presented in a ternary plot then they contrast these results to those of randomly generated mpms with the same life history strategy their analyses help explain why when the elasticities to survival growth and reproduction of plant species are plotted on a ternary plot the overall pattern shows a strong curvature with a gap in the ternary plot that is not invadable 2 5 novel contributions to stochastic demography examining stochastic demographic properties by means of mpms is typically done when more than one a time series of ppms annual ppms exist for a single population this approach has become popular in ecology as most ecological systems are characterised by oscillatory environmental conditions salguero gómez and de kroon 2010 and climate change projects are likely to make natural systems suffer from a high frequency of climatic anomalies ipcc 2020 in this approach the stochastic growth rate λ s is typically defined via an infinite sequence of annual ppms chosen at random from the given finite set of annual ppms and it is generally used as a proxy to population viability in the stochastic environment in the special case of permanent non stochastic environment λ s coincides with λ 1 the asymptotic growth rate on the one hand theoretical approximations of λ s exist that require certain additional assumptions regarding the given set of ppms such as the deviations from an average ppm with known temporal auto covariances of the vital rates tuljapurkar 1990 caswell 2001 section 14 3 6 3 on the other hand once a rule for the random choice of matrices such as the i i d independent identically distributed matrices ibid the simplest and most popular rule e g cohen 1979 caswell 2001 buckley et al 2010 has been accepted but see paniw et al 2018 the λ s can be estimated from a series of monte carlo simulations of the long enough random sequence unfortunately the assumptions of both theoretical estimates of λ s and monte carlo simulations may often not be accepted in practice the challenge is therefore to attenuate those assumptions in response to theoretical and practical needs a key paper in this regard is by sanz 2019 si in it the author considers minimal and maximal vital rates among the given ppms and obtains four new lower and upper bounds for the stochastic growth rate these bounds enable calculating the sufficient conditions for population growth or population extinction the author illustrates those conditions with a hypothetical random environment toggling between poor and rich situations practical needs dictate rejecting the assumption of modelling stochastic dynamics of a natural population according to i i d instead a more realistic approximation is to arrange the simulations in a way that reflect ways in which the natural environment oscillates through time ipcc 2020 since the i i d assumption represents a particular degenerate case of the time homogeneous markov chain logofet et al 2020c an important challenge for future research is to construct a governing markov chain whose states would correspond to different types of environmental conditions and to calibrate its transition matrix from real data on those conditions the metapopulation environments may change randomly as well as that of a single population in this special issue sanz and bravo de la parra 2019 si analyse the situation where the migrations between patches and demographic processes proceed at different time scales the former being k times faster than the latter common formalisms for discrete structured populations suggest that these two kinds of event occur sequentially one after the other so that the combined effect of both processes can be described by the product of the slow process matrix times the k th power of the fast process matrix in nature however the processes may act simultaneously the authors alternatively included survival into the fast process and approximated its effect during the fast time unit referring to such an approach as the re scaling of survival to the fast time scale they adapt their original method of re scaling to the proposed stochastic models and compared the asymptotic behaviour of the model populations with and without re scaled survival the outcome of principal importance is that the corresponding stochastic growth rates may appear qualitatively different for the same vital rate values while the former predicts exponential growth the latter indicates extinction so the order of events does matter in the mpm formalism for metapopulation dynamics in the stochastic environment the both versions are ready in theory and now it is the turn of real migrating populations to migrate right here van daalen and caswell 2020 si introduce a framework to simultaneously quantify the variance components in demographic vs environmental stochasticity in life history outcomes using matrix population models the introduced mathematical machinery allows for the calculation of such effects in a general manner the authors further illustrate the power of their approach using frailty analyses of fruit flies and explicitly quantifying survival reproduction trade offs in a plant study this approach has the great potential to understand the extent to which demographic stochasticity vs environmental stochasticity shape population outcomes worldwide as regards climate change romanov and masterov 2020 si compare the effects of adult survival and productivity on the persistence of the steller s sea eagle haliaeetus pelagicus populations the authors simulated the corresponding mpm under several scenarios in a stochastic environment and found that the fecundity alone varying within broad limits can lead to population decline in this charismatic species although the population growth is less sensitive to the fecundity than to adult survival the authors argue that the former is more appropriate as a target of conservation management 2 6 averaging the ppms an alternative way to assess population viability in stochastic environments from a given set of annual ppms is to calculate λ 1 g the dominant eigenvalue of the average matrix g however in contrast to nonnegative numbers it is not trivial to average several given nonnegative matrices unless the average is arithmetic or weighted arithmetic due to the linearity of matrices as operators in the vector space arithmetic average might make sense when the matrices to be averaged represent a metapopulation distributed among several habitats at the same moment of time but it does not make sense when we have a time series of m 2 ppms from the initial moment of observation l 1 to the final one l m if we want the average matrix g to project population vectors in the exactly same manner as the annual ppms do then it has to be their multiplicative or geometric by the analogy with numbers average logofet 2018 logofet et al 2018a b which suggests extracting the m th root of the matrix product to find a unique nonnegative matrix root is a matter of nontrivial calculations with a serious theory behind polity popolizio 2014 2015 a practical sufficient condition for the unique principal root a 1 m to exist for a given matrix a is the lack of negative zero eigenvalues in the spectrum of a ibid and the routine can really succeed in this case however what the routine returns will hardly have the same matrix pattern as the ppms to be averaged it will rather be positive valued at best or complex valued in general the both cases making no sense as an average ppm that should correspond to the same lcg as the given ppms to be averaged this requirement motivated a new concept of matrix average namely the pattern geometric average logofet 2018 or pattern multiplicative average to be pedantic meaning the same matrix pattern of the average matrix g as of those to be averaged it is also logical that each element of g lies within the bounds of this element known from the set of given ppms mathematically finding the pattern multiplicative average of a given set of annual ppms reduces to a kind of constrained optimization problem and this problem was efficiently solved for some practical cases logofet 2018 logofet et al 2018a b 2019 but theoretical issues are still to be investigated in what concerns the uniqueness and accuracy of the optimal solution the λ s and λ 1 g these two measures of viability assessment generate the question of how they correlate quantitatively when applied in real cases and dmitrii logofet has tried to give an answer 2019b si two former case studies of alpine red book perennials eritrichium caucasicum and androsace albana resulted in respectively two sets of 8 annual ppms based on which both λ s estimates and λ 1 g values are reported these both measures of population viability turn out fairly close each other in both case studies but e caucasicum λ s estimates are unambiguously less than λ 1 g whereas those for a albana are certainly greater than λ 1 g the reason for this difference is not yet known which gives one more incentive to further developing both the λ s and λ 1 g methods 2 7 uses and abuses as with any research tool that is both highly technical and popular matrix population models are not free of accidental mis usage we are not the first ones to call for caution in the construction analysis and interpretation of mpms e g caswell 2001 our hope here is to be the last ones in this special feature nguyen et al 2019 si and kendall et al 2019 si provide invaluable advices on how to use this tool as well as the vast amount of demographic data available in the format of an mpm nguyen et al 2019 si highlight once again doak et al 2002 the importance of getting the basic life cycle right before parameterising the pertinent matrix population model there is a wealth of mpms for species across the tree of life werner and caswell 1977 caswell 2001 salguero gómez 2015a b however some of the models particularly in plants may not contain all or the most key life cycle stages in the case of some plant species permanent seed banks do occur but are often not included due to logistical practicalities of the fieldwork nguyen et al s work show that their inclusion exclusion can have very important repercussions for the ways we assess the deterministic and stochastic dynamics of the populations under study importantly the emerging message therein is that the ways in which ignoring cryptic life stages affects our estimates of population performance are not systematically biased in a specific way rendering generalisations with these key data rather limiting kendall et al 2019 si present a summary of a subset of published mpms in animal species the authors highlight three errors commonly encountered in published mpms 1 failing to include survival in the fertility coefficient 2 introducing a one year delay in the age at first reproduction and 3 incorrectly calculating the growth rate out of a stage class the first two errors are found in 34 and 62 respectively of the published studies collected in comadre of the studies where stages may last longer than one time step 53 constructed the growth rate using inappropriate formulas for estimating the asymptotic population growth rate or its sensitivity to demographic parameters kendall et al review the sources of such errors and reveal their impact on model predictions using lionfish and american alligator models as examples these results suggest that further efforts are required to educate biologists on the construction of mpms and many studies that are based on mpms may need to be re examined synthetic studies using the comadre database need to be accompanied by careful examination of the underlying knowledge and data luckily the researchers curating large demographic datasets are well aware of these issues and are expediently working together with the demographic community to help the users of big data overcome these challenges the solutions are already discussed in the response to kendall et al s paper in a complementary response by che castaldo et al 2020 2 8 how many bases to classify individuals what is mentioned above concerns mostly what to do with ready mpms but to get them ready given some knowledge of data on a particular population is not a self evident nor a simple task historically the certain population mathematics adopted highly rigid postulates about the population age structure and proposed a highly specific pattern of the leslie matrix leslie 1945 then the postulates were attenuated and the pattern expanded to the stage structure lefkovitch 1965 and to the generalised stage structure that suggested a classification of individuals by any observable measurable trait such as size weight etc caswell 2001 soon a single trait became insufficient to practical demands where data on two traits such as age and developmental stage logofet et al 2006 2014 2016 caswell salguero gómez 2013 stage and space hunter caswell 2005 or stage and genotype de vries et al 2019 si were available and the model formalism was expanded to block structured ppms ibid caswell 2012 more samples of pairs in roth and caswell 2016 the block structured ppms appear also in the single trait metapopulation model with migrations among the local habitats sanz bravo de la parra 2019 si here the issue of time scale difference between demographic and migration processes needs further investigation today we witness an attempt to formalise an mpm for multi trait population data a 3 trait case in coste and pavard 2020 si the ppm transforms now to a 3d array of vital rates which is called a tensor in mathematics authors have not yet dared to launch this term to the field of mpms but it will perhaps become common for the future generations of matrix modellers note however that a hyperstate matrix model a competing term has already been launched by roth and caswell 2016 with a general formalism for many bases 3 concluding remarks the diversity of topics presented above are sufficient to recognize the mpm as a powerful multi tool for modeling the population and community dynamics however the range of topics covered in this editorial does not represent the wide spectrum of mpm applications in ecology evolution and conservation science below we discuss two of many potential areas of further enquiry where mpms have much to offer to researchers 3 1 potential growth indicators among the current challenges of mpms studying their mathematical foundations is a key one in particular the most commonly used outcome of an mpm is λ 1 l its dominant eigenvalue i e the asymptotic population growth rate which is interpreted as a measure of population adaptation that is local in space and time matrix modellers are so focused on λ 1 that they frequently forget its subscript 1 in the notation and what the subscript means itself in fact the subscript originated from the standard of nonnegative matrix theory to order all the eigenvalues of a given l by their decreasing absolute values so that the dominant eigenvalue which is always positive by the perron frobenius theorem becomes λ 1 however recent findings have revealed λ 2 l to be important too specifically if λ 2 is positive and less than 1 then a simple function of matrix elements r 1 l 1 det i l can serve as a potential growth indicator hereafter pgi in other words under these conditions the pgi always locates at the same side of λ 1 as λ 1 l does protasov logofet 2014 logofet 2019a there are certain merits of indication prior to the calculation of λ 1 in particular r 1 l has turned out useful in solving calibration problems under data uncertainty logofet 2013 another more senior pgi instance is the well known net reproductive rate r 0 l ρ f i t 1 where ρ denotes the spectral radius the largest absolute value of matrix eigenvalues and l t f the sum of its transition and fertility parts cushing yicang 1994 caswell 2001 however calculating the spectral radius is in general much more difficult than the determinant in r 1 l the problem with r 1 l is that its pgi property is proved for a less general class of ppm patterns than r 0 l is valid for a recent expansion of the classical perron frobenius theory namely the theory of rank 1 corrections of nonnegative matrices protasov logofet 2014 has enabled proving the pgi property of r 1 l when the rank of fertility part f equals 1 for instance when f has only one nonzero row or column of fertility rates meaning a single recruiting or a single generative stage in the lcg respectively can this wide yet not universal class of ppms be expanded some particular examples give a positive answer but theoretical justification is still a target for future efforts 3 2 integer valued formalism the identified individuals a standard for stage structured demographic models caswell 2001 p 134 can often provide the calibration of ppms in a unique way since all the events of transitions along the lcg links are inherent in the data the transition rates are just the frequencies of the corresponding events hence the rates are certain rational numbers according to the arithmetic way of calculation naturally the number of recruited individuals is always integer however the tradition is to treat the basic calibration equation of the mpm as an equation in real numbers in spite the rational valued ppm does project x t an integer valued population vector into the integer valued x t 1 the old tradition to deal with real numbers did make certain sense in the last century when computers had only been dealing with binary representations of all numbers including the machine approximations of the irrational roots of the characteristic polynomials however modern systems of mathematical software such as r or matlab with its symbolic algebra toolbox mathworks 2020 enable algebraic manipulations with the rational integer valued numbers as symbols thus avoiding the machine round off errors and providing for the absolute logical accuracy of calculations also the existence of strong computational support enables us to validate each step of the calibration or manipulation in other related problems e g backward prediction clutton brock and sheldon 2010 ehrlén et al 2016 nater et al 2018 logofet et al 2020a or uncertainties in the dynamics of cryptic stages paniw et al 2017 nguen et al 2019 si logofet et al 2020b si the calibration equation or other pertinent expressions hold true with the absolute accuracy for the integer or rational valued parameters unlike the approximate real values to be found from the classical least squares procedures of curve fitting this approach helps solve at least some of the persistent problems in the construction of matrix population models and we encourage matrix

24663,agent based and gis based models of human elephant interactions were developed and integrated to evaluate and recommend the best management mitigation strategies to either reduce or eradicate the adverse impacts of human elephant interactions in the bunda district tanzania the model estimated the appropriate minimum elephant and human populations and geographical distances from the edges of protected areas rivers and conservation corridors the model results from each modelling scenario were analysed for comparative performance where minimal recorded incidents of crop damage human deaths elephant deaths and hidden impacts were the primary focus selection of the best performing scenario based on the magnitude of the reduction and eradication of adverse impact s however for each selection of the best scenario s there were costs that a model user must incur as there was no cost free scenario reduction of any of the adverse impacts may run counter to fiscal conservation land and socioeconomic policies therefore the model user may select the best scenario within the constraints of these policies it is recommended that the adoption of the best scenario should not rely solely on the type of adverse impacts but also tolerance and resilience level of elephants and the well being of the affected people therefore the capabilities of people elephants and conservationists to accept tolerate and ultimately to recover from a certain level o keywords human elephant conflicts serengeti national park ecological modelling agentbased models african elephant bunda district 1 introduction human elephant interactions hei like other forms of human wildlife interactions hwi cause several socio economic problems to communities residing near elephants natural ranges granados 2011 parker et al 2007 hwi is one of the main global conservation challenges next to commercial poaching thouless et al 2016 ladan 2014 there are many types of hei and those can occur whenever humans and elephants come into conflict ladan 2010 as an example as human populations grow and expand they come into physical contact with elephants more frequently this can sometimes lead to conflict the common types of conflicts are crop damage infrastructure damage human and elephant deaths and a range of hidden impacts mduma et al 2010 the frequency and severity of these impacts are increasing and will continue to do so for the immediate future due to growing human population and unpredictable climate change madden 2004 thouless et al 2016 in africa farmers regard the african elephant loxodonta africana africana as the most dangerous herbivore and the biggest threat to agricultural development desai riddle 2015 hidden or secondary impacts also known as socio economic opportunity costs hoare 2007 refer to the state of psycho social wellbeing stemming from hei barua et al 2013 hidden impacts include but are not limited to fear of injury or death restriction on human movement particularly at night competition for water resources poor health and nutrition status and competition for livestock grazing ground less obvious impacts include reduced school attendance for children due to fear of encountering elephants and increased exposure to diseases such as malaria while guarding crops or property at night barua et al 2013 parker et al 2007 in africa most of the victims of hei are poor subsistence farmers the adverse impacts of hei often outweigh the socio economic and environmental benefits elephants provide to humans messmer 2000 like many problems in wildlife conservation humans are responsible for many adverse impacts on elephants bandara tisdell 2002 many socio economic impacts emanating from hei such as agricultural losses fatalities and infrastructural damage have been quantified mutanga adjorlolo 2008 unfortunately the geographical configuration of hei is not often recorded elephant conservation stakeholders have adopted farm based and modern mitigation measures which include crop guarding noise fire alarm repellents fences and ditches to reduce or eliminate the adverse impacts of hei with little or no success at all desai riddle 2015 there is hardly a farm based mitigation that can stand alone as a universal solution for effective hei mitigation as elephants simply habituate to them in bunda district tanzania elephants are habituated to most farm based techniques including the recent innovations of chillies and stinging bees most farm based techniques are also unsafe as the techniques often require farmers to come closer into contact with elephants e g via fire alarms etc which may put both them and elephants at increased risk of death and or injury nelson et al 2003 this is because the exact drivers of hei are not always understood making it difficult to plan mitigation the appropriate strategies mutanga adjorlolo 2008 our study adopted agent based modelling abm to identify anthropogenic and non anthropogenic determinants of hei in the similar manner the study adopted a gis based model to describe and represent the spatial context of hei while providing detailed simulation environments of causality dynamics and mechanisms behind the interactions johnston 2013 abm acts as a virtual laboratory for experimenting and critically analysing complex and vibrant interactions in space and time castle 2006 it enables an understanding of how micro patterns of hei occur to form macro patterns mclane et al 2011 as well as the mechanisms and the causality of adverse impacts johnston 2013 while also providing a way to test the effectiveness of different mitigation scenarios abm can also include space heterogeneity flexibility and independence of agents which all are important in analysing hei other studies have applied abms to hwi burton et al 2013 applied abm to help eradicate wild pigs sus scrofa as agricultural pests in the us because of excessive agricultural damage of nearly 1 billion us dollars every year the model recommended that the combination of an administration of an immune contraceptive program and lethal control through hunting would be a more effective eradication measure than either approach used alone however this model did not predict the extent of crop damage and interactions between farmers and pigs ascensão et al 2013 applied abm to understand whether partial fences are more effective than full fencing in reducing road mortality as well as in increasing genetic diversity their model suggested that fences are much more effective than passages at mitigating the effects of road mortality on abundance in addition musiani et al 2010 applied abm to explore the wolf human interactions in banff and kootenay national parks in western canada the study aimed to understand potential scenarios for guiding decision makers in designing management strategies for wolf canis lupus the model highlighted that the presence of humans significantly affects the movements and behaviours of the wolves in terms of prey hunting prey consumption and attendance of pups marley et al 2017 used an agent based modelling approach to analyse the effects of human education on the reduction of conflicts between humans and bears ursus americanus in canada according to the model for each percent of the population that is taught about waste management and bear deterrence methods there is a 5 decrease in the probability that a bear becomes a conflict bear moreover neil et al 2020 deployed abm as a tool for elephant poaching mitigation an exploratory model was developed to predict how interactions between african elephants poachers and law enforcement affect poaching levels within a virtual protected area for development of a useful management support tool to be applied to real world scenarios for a proper decision making most studies examine hei in the context of crop damage elephant deaths and human deaths rather than hidden impacts prasad et al 2011 smith kasiki 2000 wilson et al 2013 spatial studies conclude that hei incidents usually occur in landscapes that are close to rivers protected areas and other environmental features kyale et al 2011 prasad et al 2011 such studies conclude that the closer farms are to rivers protected areas or corridors the more likely it is that damage to farms will occur prasad et al 2011 socio economic studies conclude that human and elephant population sizes affect the frequency and magnitude of hei ladan 2014 lamarque et al 2009 mduma et al 2010 as human and elephant populations become larger the frequency of hei incidents increases lee graham 2006 most existing spatial and socio economic studies provide a clear insight into factors affecting hei occurrences but lack precise measurements for each factor for either reducing or eradicating the incidents identification and control of the responsible factors can possibly reduce or eradicate hei incidents granados 2011 prasad et al 2011 wilson et al 2013 however understanding the precise measurements for each factor is difficult as it requires long term experiments and replication of experiments in the study area for instance experimental farms could be established at several distances from rivers protected areas and conservation corridors the farms could be guarded and crop damage incidents routinely measured and recorded annually allowing the gradual change of horizontal distance between the protected area and the farm until the crop damage incidents are either eradicated or reduced likewise there could be other independent experiments investigating precise measurements for either human or elephant population size in reality most of those field experiments are impractical and unethical however it is still important to provide elephant conservation stakeholders with crucial information for designing and adopting appropriate hei mitigation measures considering the importance of the information in eradicating hei incidents our study integrated geographic information systems gis and abm approaches to evaluate a set of mitigation measures of hei spatial data on the locations of hei instances and environmental conditions were collected through interviews and mapped within a gis while an abm model was used to understand how and why those incidents occurred since hei is variable in time and space the integration of gis and abm aided with understanding the dynamics of hei the model acts as an abstract and ethical laboratory by enabling an identification of the responsible factor s and provision of precise measurement s for each incident without practically affecting the real world wilensky rand 2015 and adjustment calibration of human and elephant populations in a digital environment without violating any human or elephant ethics in this study the abm approach was used to examine the relative influence of several different model parameters on hei incidents in the bunda district of tanzania an understanding of the distribution concentration and geographical distribution of hei incidents is crucial as most management decisions about hei have spatial contexts prasad et al 2011 such information usually helps conservation authorities acquire a suitable geographical outlook and may also facilitate timely and accurate decisions a the study modeled and simulated the bunda district which has more than 25 ethnic groups the main economic activity within the region is subsistence agriculture which accounts for about 80 of the local annual income kideghesho mtoni 2008 farmers normally grow maize millet cassava and sorghum as food crops and cotton as cash crops furthermore people keep sheep goats and cattle walpole et al 2004 the majority of inhabitants are subsistence farmers fisherman livestock keepers and small scale traders bunda has the highest human population density in tanzania with about 200 people per km2 an annual population growth of about 3 0 and about 600 000 people urt 2013 it is in the western region of the serengeti ecosystem covering 3 088 km2 fig 1 moreover the majority of households lack indoor plumbing system which requires them to travel to water sources to fetch water this heightens the chance of humans to encounter elephants at the water sources additionally locals encounter elephants when searching for non timber forest products such as vegetable fruits mushrooms and medicinal plants outside the protected landscapes mduma et al 2010 b the district has contributed a large part of its land surface to wildlife conservation lake victoria occupies about 200 km2 of the area and the serengeti national park occupies 480 km2 about 40 of the district s surface area fig 1 according to a recent elephant census the district hosts about 127 elephants tawiri kws 2014 unplanned human settlements conversion of elephant habitats into cash and food crop fields and development projects are the main drivers of hei in the district ladan 2014 rahman et al 2010 also the impacts of climate change such as floods unreliable rainfall patterns droughts and temperature contribute significantly to hei ladan 2014 hoare 1999 parker et al 2007 asserted that rapid change in human and elephant populations increases the rate of hei in areas next to protected areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description a computational model was developed to study the hei its description follows the odd d overview design concepts detail protocol grimma et al 2006 müllera et al 2013 because the it entails an explicit description of the theoretical background and important details of the model implementation groeneveld et al 2012 the description of theoretical or conceptual background in odd d prevents the audience from misinterpreting the model groeneveld et al 2012 model aims to advance the formulation of proactive and policy based hei mitigation measures and in particular to develop and evaluate a set of mitigation scenarios such as reduction of human and elephant populations smith kasiki 1999 wilson et al 2013 and distancing of anthropogenic activities from the protected areas conservation corridors and rivers granados 2011 prasad et al 2011 wilson et al 2013 it aims to quantitatively reproduce and explain the mitigation management options of hei in the bunda district the model is designed for use by conservationists ecologists modellers and researchers interested in hei 2 1 1 entities state variables and scales the model consists of a landscape with reflecting borders rather than toroidal individuals at one edge of the space cannot jump to cells on the opposite edge and was occupied solely by human and elephants ascensão et al 2013 it consists of two types of entities 600 humans and 127 elephants represented as mobile individuals while the landscape is represented as an environment for humans and elephants to interact within fig 2 all entities are characterized by corresponding state variables online appendix a according to mduma et al 2010 and a field survey from the study area the majority 60 of respondents encountered elephants every day therefore one time step represented one day and the model ran for 365 days one year it was a spatially explicit model constructed by using the vector based gis data layers representing the bunda district the spatial extent of the model was 16 35 patches n 560 each 1000 m x 1000 m in size 100 ha which was imported into the model at the beginning of each simulation fig 2 when moving human and elephant could move into a new grid cell every day depending on their internal and external states the maximum travel distance covered by wild african elephants was 30 000 m per day dswf 2013 in other words elephants moved 30 steps per day covering up to 10 950 grid cells every year the maximum travelling distance covered by humans was 8 000 m per day tudor locke 2011 thus human moved eight steps per day covering up to 2 920 grid cells per year 2 1 2 process overview and scheduling optimal foraging theory guides the development of agents decision making processes on where to begin or end foraging movements and balance energy gained against energy expended tang bennett 2010 since the model proceeds in one day time steps within each time step at least one of the six phases are processed in the following order 1 elephant searches for ecological resources in the protected areas for consumption 2 in the absence of resources elephant moves to the nearest conservation corridor searching for resources 3 a deficiency of resources causes the elephant to move to the nearest crop farm 4 unguarded crops attract elephant crop damage 5 crop farms guarded by humans result in either crop damage human death or elephant death and 6 several incidents of crop damage human death and elephant encounters result in hidden impacts fig 3 2 1 3 design concepts 2 1 3 1 theoretical and empirical background our model assumed that an agent s information processing capacity was limited and that they had only partial information about their habitats including availability of food and water arnold 2010 model agents relied on heuristics that guide their behaviour cabrera et al 2010 the entities were risk takers that above a certain minimum energy level engaged in trial and error to maximise their survival rate dumont david 2004 the decision model for agents was a simplified representation of decision making observations from field surveys conducted by the authors in 2018 interviews literature reviews and optimal foraging theory assumptions tang bennett 2010 spatial data on elevation rivers farms protected areas and conservation corridors characterized the model landscape a farm vector layer provided a landscape for growing crops where humans could guard crops obtain food and interact with elephants as well as for elephants to eat crops the rivers layer provided areas for humans and elephants to obtain water and also provided nutrients and moisture content for crops and vegetation growth the protected areas layer provided the landscape for vegetation growth and elephants to obtain ecological resources das at al 2014 conservation corridors were the primary locations that hei might occur and consisted of a human landscape elephant habitat and migratory routes outside the core protected areas parker et al 2007 thouless et al 2016 the agents interacted in a 1000 m x 1000 m spatial grid resource distribution map where each grid cell contained ecological resources wild plants farm crops and water in the scale between 0 no resource and 5 most resources depending on the agent s current location in a cell on the map valcu kempenaers 2010 in each map grid cell rules governed transitions of scales between ecological resources frances et al 2016 the values of the grid cells were spatially autocorrelated meaning that the value of each cell was related to that of neighboring cells valcu kempenaers 2010 secondary data were adopted to determine elephant and human demographics and location in the model according to tawiri and kws 2014 there were 11 herds or families of elephants one herd with 27 individuals and 10 herds with nine individuals each based on these data the model accommodated up to 127 elephants in total which was regarded as the elephant carrying capacity in the bunda district the age composition of elephant populations was categorised into young sub adult or adult elephants young are elephants below 6 years sub adults were between 6 and 24 years while adults were older than 24 years mduma et al 2010 age structure was as per lindeque 1991 where young constituted 25 sub adults represented 24 and adult elephants constituted 51 of the elephant population therefore the model consisted of 52 male and 55 female elephants in 1 1 sex ratio kioko et al 2013 in the case of humans data on individuals were unavailable due to confidentiality and ethical issues a monte carlo sampling approach was adopted to generate a synthetic population with demographic attributes closely related to the real population of the bunda district it created human agents with age gender and socio economic activity such human attributes were used for modelling and simulation to determine what human could and could not do the human population in the 12 villages under study was approximately 30 661 and spread over 3 000 households urt 2013 it was impossible to model all 10 000 people who annually interacted with elephants in the bunda district walpole et al 2004 instead 600 humans were selected as a representative sample therefore the synthetic generator generated uniformly distributed random number of humans between 0 and 601 in microsoft excel rainwater and rivers were the major sources of water for natural vegetation plants crops and elephants in the model millington et al 2010 since the study area experiences rainy and dry seasons inclusion of dry and rainy seasons in the model was desirable therefore wet and dry seasons determined specific sources of water for each timestep rivers were the major sources in dry seasons while both rivers and rainwater were the major sources in rainy seasons the river vector layer consisted of five segments the 3d analyst extension was deployed to determine the maximum and minimum heights of each river segments by using a digital elevation model dem as a base layer which assisted in identification of grid cells with highest and lowest elevation useya 2013 this helped in the identification of rivers flow and rain water in the model hillerislambers et al 2001 the grand canyon model was extended to prototype rainwater and rivers flow it is a built in example in netlogo wilensky 2006 at the initial timestep rains were created randomly in the modelling environment depending on the rain rate parameter which determined the amount of rain in a particular timestep the drops ran to the neighbouring grid cell with the lowest elevation if the rain could not find a neighbouring grid cell with the lower elevation it remained where it was and became water when rain ran to the edge of the map it was removed from the map in this model green grid cells indicated crops yellow squares indicated natural vegetation plants black grid cells indicated bare soil blue grid cells indicated soil water availability and brown indicated dry soil not suitable for vegetation and crops 2 1 3 2 emergence the spatial distribution of humans and elephants emerged from the adaptive behavior and traits they used to make decisions about moving between protected and unprotected landscapes the spatial distribution varied depending on the initial location of humans and elephants as a result the locations where crop damage human and elephant deaths occurred varied depending on the spatial location of the humans and elephants in the model 2 1 3 3 fitness the model agents maintained and monitored their energy levels as fitness levels the maximum energy level was set to 100 points and a minimum of 0 agents gained energy points after eating food and drinking water and lost energy after performing certain activities however there were interspecific and intraspecific variations in energy expenditure and gain among model agents when the energy level reached zero the model agent died 2 1 3 4 learning human and elephant agents behaved as cognitive or conscious agents having mental awareness of their natural environments in which they move live eat and drink in this model agents never learned 2 1 3 5 individual prediction predicting future conditions was also not considered in the model 2 1 3 6 heterogeneity there was heterogeneity of agents due to the presence of more than one type of conscious agent as consequences both human and elephant agents were heterogeneous in their decision making 2 1 3 7 individual sensing african elephants recognised other elephants sex age unique identifications and their energy levels as well as external elements such as protected areas conservation corridor farms rivers and humans african elephants were the permanent residents of protected areas and occasional visitors to human landscapes similarly humans recognised human gender human id protected areas conservation corridor farms rivers and elephants human were the permanent residents of conservation corridors but never resided or visited the protected areas kideghesho mtoni 2008 2 1 3 8 interactions the interactions in the model depended on the location of the agent in relation to other agents elephants interacted with humans farms rivers protected areas conservation corridors crop farms and other elephants while humans interacted with other humans farms rivers crops conservation corridors and elephants but not the protected areas kideghesho mtoni 2008 2 1 3 9 individual decision making the agents were resource consuming entities and started the simulation at their respective map positions elephants in protected areas and humans in households at each time step agents could either remain in their current grid cell or move to one of the eight neighboring cells diagonal moves were allowed frances et al 2016 after moving each agent collected from its current cell an amount of resources water vegetation or crops which were distributed between 0 and 5 after collection of the resources agents consumed them if the total amount of resources accumulated by an agent was zero the agent moved to another cell while if the amount of resource was above one the agent consumed it and increased their energy level by that amount the agents used a tree decision making method similar to those used in lucita where choices are modelled as the outcome of a series of if then conditions arranged in a hierarchy allowing agents to quickly make decisions based on the evaluation of the available options schreinemachers berger 2011 distance coverage resources consumption and other agents activities stemmed from logical or empirical rules in the form of if then structure deangelis diaz 2019 elephants executed decisions on how and where to consume ecological resources and crops while humans executed decisions on where to eat and how to guard crops against elephants elephants attained the objectives of locating resources it could eat with less resistance similarly human attained their objective of locating food water and guarding crops farm with uncertainty social norms and cultural values were excluded in decision making however spatial and temporal aspects influenced the outcome müllera et al 2013 the decision on where to obtain ecological resources was highly influenced by the energy level and geographical distance between an agent s current grid cell and the potential resources in that cell 2 1 3 10 agent objectives the objective of african elephants was to locate an adequate quantity of food and water to maintain or increase their survival rates they behaved in accordance to optimal foraging theory which demonstrates that animals select patches that maximise their energy efficiency in a cost benefit manner dumont david 2004 the objective of humans was to guard and consume crops as well as drinking water to maximise their survival rates 2 1 3 11 stochasticity we ran a non deterministic model due to the uncertainty in its outputs the probability concept was used in modelling an agent s properties methods and environment there were two main sources of stochasticity in the model first the initial settings of the model particularly the initial location for elephants number of elephants vegetation and crop growth rates geographical distance of agents to farms conservation corridors and rivers were assigned randomly second during each run the number of human deaths elephant deaths crop acreage damaged by elephants agent fitness level and number of incidents of hidden impacts were also modelled randomly 2 1 3 12 collectives agents did not belong to or form any collectives 2 1 3 13 observation for each modelling scenario the total number of human deaths elephant deaths total number of hectares damaged by elephants and the total number of people with hidden impacts were recorded each scenario was individually analysed for the extent of hidden impacts human deaths elephant deaths and crop damage protected areas rivers farms and conservation corridors were initialized at the beginning of each model run the gis layers making up rivers protected areas conservation corridors and farms were imported from a file containing the gis vector data elephants and humans were also initialized at the start of each model run all elephants were randomly initialized in the protected areas the elephants were considered not to be in the human areas and be completely healthy with a random elephant energy level between 50 and 100 units similarly all humans were initialized in their respective households as completely healthy agents with a random human energy level between 50 and 100 units it is important to clarify that a household in the model means a group of people living together within the same homestead often owning and managing their farms together nkedianye et al 2020 therefore no physical houses were included in this model but a piece of land managed by people as a household 2 1 4 implementation details the model was implemented in the netlogo integrated development environment ide wilensky rand 2015 each model simulation ran for 365 time steps with each step representing one day of real world time the initial settings were broadly varied to fit the need of different scenarios to explore the impact of combining different model setting parameter and parameter values of 18 specific scenarios were designed to explore the possibility of either reducing or eradication hei incidents online appendix a the choice of the initial values was driven by the design of a specific scenario for proper moderation of landscape stochasticity and also the variability of model outputs parameter combinations and values each scenario was re run 10 times to obtain a mean value for each output after a year 365 iterations the total number of human deaths elephant deaths total number hectares of crop damage and the total number of people with hidden impacts were recorded model did not use input data to represent time varying processes as the model did not contain processes that changed over time 2 1 5 sub models nineteen parameters were used in this model online appendix a which have been discussed in detail in the corresponding sub models elephant movement in this model 1 0 one elephant step represented 1000 m before the elephant moved a certain amount of energy was deducted from its overall energy level in this model elephants moved 30 steps every day covering up to 10 950 grid cells every year since the actual daily energy consumption of elephant movement was unknown and probably variable it was assumed that one unit of energy was consumed by elephant per each step arnold 2010 the direction of elephant movement depended on the availability of resources and proximity of humans in the neighborhood at the beginning of each step elephant examined neighboring squares and detected different entities the distance determined the ability of elephants in detecting humans vegetation water and crops thus elephants travelled across different landscapes when detecting other entities the parameter river distance corridor distance and protectedarea distance were distances elephants used to detect humans and crops in rivers corridors and protected areas the maximum travelling distance covered by elephants was 8 000 m per day tudor locke 2011 thus elephant moved eight steps per day covering up to 2 920 grid cells per year elephant foraging vegetation african elephants usually feed on natural vegetation in the form of bark leaves wood roots twigs fruits seeds and grasses to survive campos arceiz blake 2011 osborn 2004 santra et al 2008 in this model all natural plants were collectively regarded as vegetation elephants usually spend at least 20 hours a day foraging das et al 2014 dswf 2013 therefore it was assumed that elephants were active for 24 hours since elephants are a highly mobile species it was assumed that elephants are always able to find food and therefore no elephant died of starvation after eating vegetation elephant energy increased by 50 points the amount energy accrued from consuming vegetation matched the average digestibility coefficient 50 of the elephant from vegetation clauss et al 2003 elephant drinking water african elephants usually drink more than 200 liters of water every day dswf 2013 in this model elephants obtained water from streams and rivers the model excluded the probabilistic events of obtaining water from other sources such as wells and taps because the spatial data about such sources were unavailable since elephants are highly mobile the model elephants had high probability of obtaining water when the parameter elephant water chance was initially set to 0 92 nearly 25 of elephants died of dehydration in that case the mortality rate seemed to be high it was therefore changed to 0 99 and decreased the mortality rate to less than 1 which seemed to be reasonable for elephant population since vegetation intake adds more fitness points 50 points to elephant energy than water it was assumed that 20 points of energy would be added after drinking water arnold 2010 elephants damaging crops crop farms were opportunistic sources of energy for elephants because of their high nutrients and low chemical and physical defenses osborn 2004 crop damage occurred in the farms near conservation corridors rivers and protected areas prasad et al 2011 smith kasiki 1999 wilson et al 2013 in this model adult sub adult and young elephants were all responsible for crop damage chiyo cochrane 2005 the distance between the current elephant location and crop farms determined crop damage prasad et al 2011 the parameters protectedarea distance corridor distance and river distance determined the distance between farm and the current elephant location when corridor distance was set to 0 meter conservation corridor to 0 meter and protectedarea distance to 0 meter nearly 8 560 acres of crops were damaged by elephants the damaged acreages seemed to be more than those specified in the secondary data obtained from the bunda district council the parameters values were therefore changed to 0 meter for corridor distance 256 meters for river distance and 200 meters for protectedarea distance to 200 meters and decreased crop damage to 560 acres which seemed to be realistic for the bunda district these are the parameter values used in the baseline scenario specifically and were obtained from the field survey it was assumed that crop consumption activated elephant energy by 70 points because crops usually contain more energy than natural vegetation and water das et al 2014 elephant death the model excluded deaths from dehydration starvation road accidents and poaching elephant death occurs when elephants damage crops in the guarded farms okello et al 2014 based on the field survey when an elephant damages a crop in a guarded farm either the human runs away 75 4 an elephant death occurs 1 5 the elephant moves away 17 7 or there is some other result 5 4 human fainted for fear elephant injured human did nothing thus the probability of elephant mortality rate when an elephant damages a crop was fixed to 1 5 mamboleo et al 2019 setting the parameter elephant mortality rate to 0 015 resulted into 4 elephant deaths in 10 years which emulates the secondary data obtained from the bunda district council human movement the more a human move the more human energy they consume each human spends 1 0 energy for each step 1000 m in this model humans moved eight steps every day covering up to 2 920 grid cells every year the direction of human movement depended on the availability of food water and proximity of elephants in the neighborhood before an initiation of each step a human agent assesses the direction of movement with the primary objective of safeguarding crops and locating food to eat and water to drink human eating food crops are the primary source of energy for humans humans energy demands vary according to age gender weight and physical activity when a human consumed a crop their energy level eventually increased up to 68 points das et al 2014 studies estimate that humans obtain 68 of energy from food consumption while the rest is obtained from non food sources such as water mishra et al 2012 therefore 68 of human energy equivalent to 68 points came from the crops human guarding crops humans guard crops to reduce elephant crop damage human agents guarded crops near rivers protected areas and conservation corridors as they are frequently damaged by elephants in these areas desai riddle 2015 when the surrounding grid cells were occupied by elephants human moved either towards or away from them the human energy and the state of the grid cell determined his her movements parker et al 2003 based on the field survey in most cases 60 human will move away from an elephant less often human either kills an elephant or is killed by an elephant desai riddle 2015 lamarque et al 2009 according to our field survey the probability of human to successfully scare away elephants from the crops farm was 0 14 in that case the parameter crops guarding success was set to 0 14 human drinking water humans usually drink 2 to 3 liters of water every day to survive cbd 2010 in our model human obtained water from streams and rivers the probabilistic events for getting water from other sources such as lakes and wells are not part of this model since humans are intelligent and highly mobile creatures it was assumed that humans had a high chance of obtaining enough water when the parameter human get water chance was initially set to 87 nearly 11 of humans died of dehydration this mortality rate seemed to be high it was therefore changed to 99 and decreased the mortality rate to less than 1 2 which seemed to be reasonable for this population to survive cbd 2010 there was no information on how much human energy is activated each time a human drinks water it was assumed 20 points of energy would be added to human energy after drinking water hidden impacts barua et al 2013 found a number of indirect impacts including disruption of family bonds elevated poverty opportunity costs health and nutritional status and interrupted school attendance for children humans residing near conservation corridors protected areas and rivers are susceptible to hidden impacts granados 2011 hoare 1999 khumalo yung 2015 the impacts occur due to repetitive observations of human deaths elephant encounters and elephant crop damage khumalo yung 2015 kuriyan 2002 based on our field survey hidden impacts occur to humans above four years but farmers and school children were mostly affected badola 1998 barua et al 2013 hill 2004 the field survey showed the probability that a human acquires hidden impacts is 0 6 setting the parameter to 0 6 resulted in 342 incidents which seemed to be reasonable for human population and emulated the field survey data obtained from the bunda district human death the model excluded natural death and other forms of human death such as disease robbery dehydration and poaching related deaths death in this model occurs after preventing elephant from damaging crops in this model human deaths were rare walpole et al 2004 elephants mostly killed farmers residing in conservation corridors mduma lobora foley jones 2010 based on the field survey one human death occurs every 10 years to humans aged four years and above but farmers and school children are most affected badola 1998 barua et al 2013 hill 2004 according to our field survey the probability of human mortality rate when human guarding crops was 0 12 setting the parameter value human mortality rate to 0 12 resulted into the desired mortality rate of 1 human death in 10 years which replicates the secondary data from the bunda district vegetation growth at the initial timestep plants were randomly established all over the protected area regardless of water availability at each time step soil water availability was calculated based upon the location rain rate and density of plants new plant established on a bare patch with sufficient soil water a soil water content parameter determined where a new plant would grow in each timestep hillerislambers et al 2001 the plant grew in bare patches with sufficient water availability the parameter possessed 0 no water and 1 water values millington et al 2010 once the plant was eaten by elephants it would only regrow after 120 timesteps equivalent to four months walpole et al 2004 the plants were placed randomly with equal probability on any bare patch with sufficient water availability crop growth at the initial timestep crops were randomly established in farms not in protected areas regardless of water availability at each time step water availability in crop soil was calculated based upon the patch location and rain rate hillerislambers et al 2001 a new crop was raised on a bare patch with sufficient water and during rainy season after 90 timesteps equivalent to three months kideghesho mtoni 2008 the soil water content parameter possessed 0 no water and 1 water values millington et al 2010 once the crop was eaten by either elephants or humans it regrew after 90 timesteps 2 2 data analysis the baseline scenario was run for 365 iterations under business as usual conditions no changing of model parameters this provided the baseline information on current mitigation treatments of hei in the bunda district with which to compare outcomes emerging from other modelling scenarios the analysis evaluated the effects of 18 modelling scenarios which were formed as possible combinations of the model settings and parameter values online appendix a this enabled the examination of relationships between various model parameters and the behaviours for selection of the best scenario each model simulation ran for 365 time steps with each step representing one day of real world time the model outputs were used to compare emerging outcomes from each scenario for proper moderation of landscape stochasticity and also the variability of model outputs parameter combinations and values for each scenario were run 5 times to obtain a mean value for each output after a year 365 iterations the total number of human deaths elephant deaths total number hectares of crop damage and the total number of people with hidden impacts were recorded from each scenario model results with the total number of human deaths the total number of elephant deaths a total number of acreages of crop damage and a total number of people with hidden impacts were exported for statistical and graphical analysis the data analysis was performed using an anova single factor analysis in microsoft excel each scenario was individually analysed for the extent of hidden impacts human deaths elephant deaths and crop damage against main model variables 2 3 model calibration and validation the model parameter values were obtained from a geospatial survey conducted in the bunda district from march to october 2018 the values included 600 humans 126 elephants corridor distance 0 meters protectedarea distance 200 meters and river distance 252 meters were used for model calibration and validation also a graphical user interface gui from netlogo ide was used for visual verification of humans elephants and their patches in the model moreover parameter sensitivity tests were conducted to determine the change in model outputs in response to changing model parameter values the tests revealed strong relationships between several model parameters and outputs parameter variability involved the human population elephant population river distance protectedarea distance and corridor distance as main parameters the main outputs recorded for model validation and verification were human and elephant deaths crop damage and hidden impacts furthermore comparisons between observed data survey data and model outputs were conducted to validate the model according to the data from survey one elephant and four human deaths were recorded in ten years which correlated well with model outputs also a comparison between survey and model outputs on crop damage showed a close resemblance except for an overestimation of 10 52 hectares for four years in the model moreover a comparison between survey data and model outputs on hidden impacts showed a close comparison except for an overestimation of 16 incidents the full descriptions figure tables and statistics entailing model calibration and validation are presented in the online appendix a3 presents the anova single factor statistical results for the significance of each independent variable with respect to the type of modelling scenario at the end of the simulation these are statistically significant outcomes hidden impacts human deaths crop damage and elephant deaths from the simulation of 18 modelling scenarios involving the combinations of five independent variables of elephant population human population distance from rivers distance from conservation corridors and distance from protected areas the majority 63 out of 67 of hei incidents in all modelling scenarios have p values below 0 05 except human deaths in hees protectedarea hees corridor hees river protect corridor and hidden impact in elephant effect scenario tab 1 and thus the majority of independent variables have a significant impact on the hei incidents in three modelling scenarios human deaths have na p values because the respective scenarios eradicated human deaths since statistical results p values provided insufficient information on a trend of each incident when independent variables were changed between the lowest and highest values thus each incident was graphically analysed to identify its trend overall 26 out of 67 hei incidents with p values below 0 05 were successfully reduced 37 out of 67 incidents with p values below 0 05 were unsuccessfully reduced 1 out of 67 incidents with p value above 0 05 was unsuccessfully reduced and 3 out of 67 incidents with p values below 0 05 were successfully eradicated when the independent variables were changed between the lowest and highest values the full set of the results anova single factor statistical results and descriptions entailing what each scenario means are presented in the supplementary material online appendix a2 3 discussion a spatially explicit and non deterministic agent based model was developed to evaluate the relative performance of different modelling scenarios for reducing or eradicating adverse impacts emanating from hei in the bunda district of tanzania the model simulated adverse impacts in particular the magnitude and frequency of crop damage human deaths hidden impacts and elephant deaths human population elephant population river conservation corridor and protected areas were the main model variables hidden impacts seemed to be the most difficult incidents to reduce as only four out of the 18 scenarios managed to significantly reduce them in those four successful scenarios the main variables were either distance from rivers human population or both in that situation human population size was one of the main determinants of hidden impacts caused by elephants as hidden impacts increased linearly with number of humans in the human effects scenario in the other words the more the human population the more the possibility of humans to interact with elephants in the village land however the hidden impacts increased constantly with increased number of elephants in the model that is to say hidden impact is indirectly inflicted to humans by elephants regardless to elephant population size according to the model for successful minimization of hidden impacts human population size should be reduced or humans should relocate their residents and farms further away from rivers fig 4 however it is important to note that rural residents in the bunda district lack reliable water supply and indoor plumbing systems additionally there is inadequate water quality and quantity in the serengeti national park and grumeti game reserve for elephants particularly in the drought seasons gereta wolanski 1998 all these heighten the interactions between human and elephants because both species depend on the same rivers as the main source of water human deaths were the easiest incidents to reduce as 15 out of 18 modelling scenarios significantly reduced the human fatalities reduction in the human population significantly reduced human deaths in the human effect scenario fig 4 in that situation human population is one of the main determinants of human deaths caused by elephants however it was possible to reduce human deaths without changing the human population as evidenced in ens river protect corridor and elephant effects scenarios which significantly reduced human deaths the model suggests that human deaths may be reduced by lowering the elephant population and also by distancing anthropogenic activities to at least 6 000 meters away from rivers conservation corridors and protected areas in other words it is difficult to reduce human deaths without lowering the human population size hes and human elephant environmental effects scenarios showed zero incidences of human deaths after including human elephant and environment as model variables in short the model offers several options to select from for either reducing or eliminating human death than other incidents also the model reveals that elephant death is one of the most difficult incidents to reduce and eradicate as only six out of 18 modelling scenarios significantly reduced the elephant fatalities in those scenarios elephant population was one of the model variables the model recommends reduction of the elephant population size as one of the mitigation options in reducing elephant deaths it was possible to reduce elephant deaths without changing human population size though eradication of elephant deaths required reduction in human population size for instance the ens river protect corridor scenario reduced elephant deaths without lowering the human population size moreover the model offers eight modelling scenarios to reduce elephant crop damage the majority of those scenarios included river distances or elephant population as one of their main variables the model suggests that most of the crop damage incidents occur within 1000 meters from rivers according to the model human population size is not the only determinant of elephant crop damage fig 5 implementation of human environmental effects and human elephant environmental effects scenarios which included human component in simulation reduced the incidents of elephant crop damage fig 5 the elephant effects scenario shows that elephant crop damage may be reduced without affecting the human population size it also suggests that it is likely to decrease elephant crop damage without distancing the farms from rivers likewise it is possible to reduce crop damage without lowering the elephant population size by adopting the environmental and human environmental effects scenarios however it was impossible to eradicate the crop damage incidents in the model through the adopting of any of 18 modelling scenarios according to the model reducing either human or elephant population could only reduce but not eliminate any of hei incidents as a comparison the elephant effects scenario reduced all adverse impacts except hidden impacts whereas the human effects scenario reduced only hidden impacts it was also possible to reduce or eliminate human deaths without affecting elephant population size by adopting the hes river protect corridor scenario fig 5 but it was unlikely to eradicate any of the incidents without reducing human population size fig 5 in reality the model shows that hei emanates from an amalgamation of several factors beyond just humans and elephants according to graham et al 2010 geographical factors are another determinant of hei as an illustration implementation of the hes river protect corridor scenario suggested that distancing human settlements from rivers corridors and protected areas could reduce all incidents except elephant deaths fig 4 in short many conservation related problems are heavily influenced by a human component bandara tisdell 2002 implementation of the hes river protect corridor scenario by distancing anthropogenic activities away from environmental features river protected areas or corridor eradicated human deaths fig 5 the scenario also reduced hidden impacts but failed to reduce elephant deaths a fair amount of elephant deaths but low incidents of elephant crop damage after 3000 meters from environmental variables means humans can hardly tolerate any level of elephant crop damage and also crop damage is not the only cause for elephant deaths from hei but also human deaths and hidden impacts maiden 2004 lamarque et al 2009 mduma et al 2010 also high amount of elephant deaths after 9000 meters entails that elephants utilize human landscape not only as a foraging ground but also as a migratory corridor where they are likely to encounter humans when migrating mduma et al 2010 the elephant effect scenario is capable of reducing all incidents except hidden impacts this scenario demonstrates how the elephant population size may influence hei occurrences to ascertain the impacts of elephants and environment features on hei the elephant environmental effects scenario was implemented and reduced all incidents except elephant deaths fig 6 the elephant environmental effects scenario is suitable for reducing human deaths hidden impacts and crop damage but not elephant deaths the human environmental effects elephant effects human effects and elephant environment effects scenarios were ineffective at either reducing or eradicating all hei occurrences in this model several modelling scenarios are only useful in reducing or eradicating a particular incident not all incidents the collective impacts of human elephant and environment model variables on hei was investigated by implementing the human elephant environmental effects scenario the modelling scenario unveiled that it was unlikely to reduce or eradicate any of the hei incident by just lowering human and elephant populations together with distancing human activities from one of environmental features river protected areas or corridor the lowering of human and elephant populations and distancing of human activities from all environmental features rivers protected areas and corridors reduced hidden impacts and eliminated human and elephant deaths in the model in the hees river protect corridor scenario the total disappearance of most hidden impacts and elephant crop damage occurred after 8000 meters from rivers corridor and protected areas fig 6 a noticeable reduction of incidents in the human elephant environmental effects scenario happened beyond 5000 meters from edges of protected areas fig 7 areas up to 5000 meters from protected areas are usually considered a buffer zone where governmental and customary laws regulate resource utilisation biodiversitya z 2015 strategic resource management of buffer zones usually aims at enhancing positive impacts while minimising negative ones on neighbouring communities and sustainable conservation ebregt greve 2000 environmentally destructive activities such as farming deforestation infrastructure development and livestock keeping are highly discouraged within a buffer zone governments encourage ecologically friendly activities such as reforestation collection of non timber forest products and ecotourism activities and regard them as an integral part of sustainable rural development policy and environmental conservation programs the magnitude of human and wildlife interactions in a buffer zone is high because of their proximity to core wildlife reserves for people to coexist with wildlife in a buffer zone adoption of the highest degree of tolerance for the problem is required as an alternative people should relocate their settlements and socio economic activities away and use a buffer zone as an area for ecological friendly activities such as worshipping activities environmental conservation and tourism selection of the best performing scenario was based on the magnitude of the reduction of adverse impact s stemming from hei however it is important to understand that for each selection of the best scenario s there are costs that a governing body must incur for successful implementation it is beyond the scope of this study to estimate the cost for each scenario however there was no cost free scenario if the aim is to eradicate elephant and human deaths and reduce hidden impacts and crop damage then the human elephant environmental effects scenario hees river protect corridor is the best scenario this scenario recorded the lowest incidence of human death people with hidden impacts elephant death and the number of hectares of crops damaged by elephants the scenario eradicated human deaths and elephant deaths beyond 0 meters from protected areas and rivers moreover it significantly reduced the hidden impacts and elephant crop damage with the total disappearance of incidents occurred beyond 7000 meters from the rivers corridors and protected areas the elephant effects and elephant environmental effects scenarios hees river protect corridor were the next best performing scenarios reducing three out of four factors despite the effectiveness in eradicating and reducing incidents the governing body should also consider in advance fiscal conservation land and socio economic policies before the adoption of the suggested scenarios as they may seriously challenge the implementation of the human elephant environmental effects scenario the problem is that the scenario requires a substantial reduction of the elephant population which may contradict conservation policies laws and international conservation agreements the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites recognises african elephants as an endangered species in tanzania similarly in some parts of the country the commercial ivory poaching has reduced elephant populations close to local extinction in those situations reduction or translocation of elephant populations is ecologically financially and legally impractical as a substitute to the elephant related scenario the human environmental effects scenario is a good choice as it eliminated human deaths and reduced hidden impacts but not elephant deaths and crop damage since the primary focus of many conservation organisations is to maintain a healthy elephant population while protecting the welfare of people this can also be an improper choice as elephant death and crop damage are still present based on priorities and policies if the model user prioritizes the reduction of hei occurrences without affecting the integrity of humans and elephants the environmental effects scenario ens river protect corridor is the best choice it reduces all incidents except elephant deaths implementation of this scenario requires distancing crops farm to beyond 7000 meters from rivers corridors and protected areas for that reason depending on the land ownership of the area compensation for land and property before moving people to other locations may be required it may also depend on people s willingness to move this scenario also will not reduce elephant deaths the model user may choose to reduce elephant and human deaths only without affecting elephant and human population sizes in that case the environmental effects scenario ens protectedarea would be the most effective choice this scenario recommends distancing human settlement to 10000 meters from the edge of protected areas however the scenario does not end the hidden impacts and elephant crop damage alternately the manager may decide to reduce crop damage and human deaths only without affecting elephant and human population sizes in that case the environmental effects scenario ens river is the best choice the scenario recommends distancing of human activities to more than 8000 meters from rivers and streams the adoption of the best scenario should not rely solely on the type of adverse impact tolerance and resilience level of elephants but also the well being of the affected people the capabilities of people elephants and conservationists to accept tolerate and ultimately to recover from a certain level of adverse impacts may determine the selection of the most important scenario making decisions about total eradication or reduction of adverse impacts is situational the scenarios with the lowest incidents are highly recommended as the best scenarios in addition the model recommends that before selecting the best scenario consideration of financial policies conservation policies and social policies and legal framework is undertaken legal and policy dimensions may complicate the implementation of the best scenario when not taken into consideration finally the human elephant environmental effects hees river protect corridor would be recommended as the best scenario for the total eradication of negative impacts and environmental effects ens river protect corridor scenario as the best for substantial reduction of hei occurrences with minimal impacts on the integrity of elephants and humans 3 1 further model developments or directions our model could have been more effective if it had incorporated the detailed dynamics of indirect or hidden impacts hidden impacts were modelled and simulated as a single combined output in reality there are many types of hidden impacts including suffering from disease marriage problems psychological problems debts and restricted movements it was not possible to model each of them as an individual impact due to insufficient coverage of data for development and validation with adequate data on hidden impacts the model would be able to highlight the extent and severity of each category of the hidden impacts in the district we would recommend a comprehensive study to identify and quantify specific hidden impacts in the district french et al 2019 asserted that the way animals utilize the joint space is the function of many factors in that case a time series approach for joint space analysis could have been adopted in this study to incorporate all driving factors behind human elephant interactions in computation modelling it is our recommendation to the future modelers to consider this approach when modelling human wildlife interactions our model could be redeveloped to make it flexible and portable for users from different protected areas with active elephants to apply it without any modification on the configuration of the model this would make its application possible locally and internationally it would also assist both african and asian elephants its application would also be possible to other problem animals in the world including wild pigs eland lions wild dogs and primates additionally our model could be redeveloped to answer this question would changing the number of elephants from 127 individuals to 11 herds lessen the severity of conflict if the herds were acting as one entity against if acting separately the model opens a new chapter for both elephant management and hei mitigation measures it allows conservationists to design test and prescribe tested actions that can reduce hei occurrences application of this approach is possible to all countries with active elephant ranges worldwide once modified implementation of any modelling scenarios necessitates concerted action and coordinated commitments it is therefore essential for conservation agencies to seek the political and public will to make a modelling approach work a successful outcome only happens when the government and public stakeholders speak in the same language stakeholders must be willing to recognise and understand hei occurrences as complex problems more importantly stakeholders must also agree on the positive and negative impacts of the suggested mitigation measure implementation of the mitigation measures can also be very demanding as most of them necessitate both parties to sacrifice property and or other resources locals may have to sacrifice their property and social justice while the government may sacrifice financial resources and elephant lives governments and local communities must be aware of the cost and benefit for each recommended mitigation measures in addition the reformation of the legal and policy framework is inevitable before implementation the reformation will provide a smooth implementation of the agreed mitigation measures between the government and the public model aimed to suggest the best option to either minimise or reduce adverse impacts of hei in the bunda district it evaluated 18 modelling scenarios and recommended the hees river protect corridor based on the magnitude of the reduction of adverse impact s stemming from hei the model advocates that there is no single cause of hei incidents in other words hei is caused by myriads of factor including anthropogenic and non anthropogenic living and non living factors reduction in either human or elephant population size may only reduce to certain extent but not eradicate the adverse impacts of hei also lowering of elephant and human populations may only either reduce or eradicate some but not all annoying incidents of hei the model remains important in the provision of geographical and scientific details about hei occurrences as mitigation measures can be scientifically and socially tested before their adoption since different environmental conservation agencies adopt different criteria policies and priorities to decide on appropriate hei interventions this model provides myriads of options that conservation agencies can choose from to reduce any of the adverse impacts of hei such flexibility makes the modelling approach user friendly and multipurpose in addition the model substantially reduces the costs and time of carrying out similar field experiments it is not practical to implement this model in other areas unless significant adaptations are made to local conditions decisions made by elephants and humans depend on a myriad of factors that are area specific including psychology preferences culture geography and irrational behaviours of individual agents which are too difficult to measure for humans and elephants this model is specifically applicable to bunda district as it replicates the environment and behaviours of agents specific to district this model serves a specific not a general purpose tool implementation of the best recommended scenarios from the model to areas inside or outside tanzania should be exercised with extreme caution as such areas always have local factors that affect hei in very different ways however this model still serves as the learning platform for conservation stakeholders to understand hei occurrences better by interacting with it and modifying the specifications to fit their local areas it can at least form a null hypothesis for expectations around hei the implementation of the model to other areas requires changes in the densities of elephants and humans in the models as well as their attributes and the environmental characteristics of new areas in addition there must be changes in interaction rules to reflect the hei dynamics of the areas of interest specific to local populations the magnitude of hei culture experience conservation policies and laws poverty level and species of elephants determine the interaction rules humans from different areas may have different experiences and responses toward elephants and so different species and subspecies of elephants may react differently to humans moreover before adopting the model to other areas adapting the environmental components and set up to reflect the area of interest is essential environmental components such as farms protected areas households rivers and conservation corridor used in the model differ hugely compared to other areas other areas may have more or less similar environmental components to the bunda district since such components are the backbone of the interaction interface it is important to assure that the environmental setup and ingredients are in the right order furthermore it is also necessary to consider the purpose of the model the model aims at controlling four adverse impacts of hei and any change in this purpose may affect the components and setup and interaction rules it may also affect the number and type of agents involved lastly but also importantly the availability of reliable data for calibration validation and verification of the suggested model is crucial the validation and verification of the model hinged on the specific data from the bunda

24663,agent based and gis based models of human elephant interactions were developed and integrated to evaluate and recommend the best management mitigation strategies to either reduce or eradicate the adverse impacts of human elephant interactions in the bunda district tanzania the model estimated the appropriate minimum elephant and human populations and geographical distances from the edges of protected areas rivers and conservation corridors the model results from each modelling scenario were analysed for comparative performance where minimal recorded incidents of crop damage human deaths elephant deaths and hidden impacts were the primary focus selection of the best performing scenario based on the magnitude of the reduction and eradication of adverse impact s however for each selection of the best scenario s there were costs that a model user must incur as there was no cost free scenario reduction of any of the adverse impacts may run counter to fiscal conservation land and socioeconomic policies therefore the model user may select the best scenario within the constraints of these policies it is recommended that the adoption of the best scenario should not rely solely on the type of adverse impacts but also tolerance and resilience level of elephants and the well being of the affected people therefore the capabilities of people elephants and conservationists to accept tolerate and ultimately to recover from a certain level o keywords human elephant conflicts serengeti national park ecological modelling agentbased models african elephant bunda district 1 introduction human elephant interactions hei like other forms of human wildlife interactions hwi cause several socio economic problems to communities residing near elephants natural ranges granados 2011 parker et al 2007 hwi is one of the main global conservation challenges next to commercial poaching thouless et al 2016 ladan 2014 there are many types of hei and those can occur whenever humans and elephants come into conflict ladan 2010 as an example as human populations grow and expand they come into physical contact with elephants more frequently this can sometimes lead to conflict the common types of conflicts are crop damage infrastructure damage human and elephant deaths and a range of hidden impacts mduma et al 2010 the frequency and severity of these impacts are increasing and will continue to do so for the immediate future due to growing human population and unpredictable climate change madden 2004 thouless et al 2016 in africa farmers regard the african elephant loxodonta africana africana as the most dangerous herbivore and the biggest threat to agricultural development desai riddle 2015 hidden or secondary impacts also known as socio economic opportunity costs hoare 2007 refer to the state of psycho social wellbeing stemming from hei barua et al 2013 hidden impacts include but are not limited to fear of injury or death restriction on human movement particularly at night competition for water resources poor health and nutrition status and competition for livestock grazing ground less obvious impacts include reduced school attendance for children due to fear of encountering elephants and increased exposure to diseases such as malaria while guarding crops or property at night barua et al 2013 parker et al 2007 in africa most of the victims of hei are poor subsistence farmers the adverse impacts of hei often outweigh the socio economic and environmental benefits elephants provide to humans messmer 2000 like many problems in wildlife conservation humans are responsible for many adverse impacts on elephants bandara tisdell 2002 many socio economic impacts emanating from hei such as agricultural losses fatalities and infrastructural damage have been quantified mutanga adjorlolo 2008 unfortunately the geographical configuration of hei is not often recorded elephant conservation stakeholders have adopted farm based and modern mitigation measures which include crop guarding noise fire alarm repellents fences and ditches to reduce or eliminate the adverse impacts of hei with little or no success at all desai riddle 2015 there is hardly a farm based mitigation that can stand alone as a universal solution for effective hei mitigation as elephants simply habituate to them in bunda district tanzania elephants are habituated to most farm based techniques including the recent innovations of chillies and stinging bees most farm based techniques are also unsafe as the techniques often require farmers to come closer into contact with elephants e g via fire alarms etc which may put both them and elephants at increased risk of death and or injury nelson et al 2003 this is because the exact drivers of hei are not always understood making it difficult to plan mitigation the appropriate strategies mutanga adjorlolo 2008 our study adopted agent based modelling abm to identify anthropogenic and non anthropogenic determinants of hei in the similar manner the study adopted a gis based model to describe and represent the spatial context of hei while providing detailed simulation environments of causality dynamics and mechanisms behind the interactions johnston 2013 abm acts as a virtual laboratory for experimenting and critically analysing complex and vibrant interactions in space and time castle 2006 it enables an understanding of how micro patterns of hei occur to form macro patterns mclane et al 2011 as well as the mechanisms and the causality of adverse impacts johnston 2013 while also providing a way to test the effectiveness of different mitigation scenarios abm can also include space heterogeneity flexibility and independence of agents which all are important in analysing hei other studies have applied abms to hwi burton et al 2013 applied abm to help eradicate wild pigs sus scrofa as agricultural pests in the us because of excessive agricultural damage of nearly 1 billion us dollars every year the model recommended that the combination of an administration of an immune contraceptive program and lethal control through hunting would be a more effective eradication measure than either approach used alone however this model did not predict the extent of crop damage and interactions between farmers and pigs ascensão et al 2013 applied abm to understand whether partial fences are more effective than full fencing in reducing road mortality as well as in increasing genetic diversity their model suggested that fences are much more effective than passages at mitigating the effects of road mortality on abundance in addition musiani et al 2010 applied abm to explore the wolf human interactions in banff and kootenay national parks in western canada the study aimed to understand potential scenarios for guiding decision makers in designing management strategies for wolf canis lupus the model highlighted that the presence of humans significantly affects the movements and behaviours of the wolves in terms of prey hunting prey consumption and attendance of pups marley et al 2017 used an agent based modelling approach to analyse the effects of human education on the reduction of conflicts between humans and bears ursus americanus in canada according to the model for each percent of the population that is taught about waste management and bear deterrence methods there is a 5 decrease in the probability that a bear becomes a conflict bear moreover neil et al 2020 deployed abm as a tool for elephant poaching mitigation an exploratory model was developed to predict how interactions between african elephants poachers and law enforcement affect poaching levels within a virtual protected area for development of a useful management support tool to be applied to real world scenarios for a proper decision making most studies examine hei in the context of crop damage elephant deaths and human deaths rather than hidden impacts prasad et al 2011 smith kasiki 2000 wilson et al 2013 spatial studies conclude that hei incidents usually occur in landscapes that are close to rivers protected areas and other environmental features kyale et al 2011 prasad et al 2011 such studies conclude that the closer farms are to rivers protected areas or corridors the more likely it is that damage to farms will occur prasad et al 2011 socio economic studies conclude that human and elephant population sizes affect the frequency and magnitude of hei ladan 2014 lamarque et al 2009 mduma et al 2010 as human and elephant populations become larger the frequency of hei incidents increases lee graham 2006 most existing spatial and socio economic studies provide a clear insight into factors affecting hei occurrences but lack precise measurements for each factor for either reducing or eradicating the incidents identification and control of the responsible factors can possibly reduce or eradicate hei incidents granados 2011 prasad et al 2011 wilson et al 2013 however understanding the precise measurements for each factor is difficult as it requires long term experiments and replication of experiments in the study area for instance experimental farms could be established at several distances from rivers protected areas and conservation corridors the farms could be guarded and crop damage incidents routinely measured and recorded annually allowing the gradual change of horizontal distance between the protected area and the farm until the crop damage incidents are either eradicated or reduced likewise there could be other independent experiments investigating precise measurements for either human or elephant population size in reality most of those field experiments are impractical and unethical however it is still important to provide elephant conservation stakeholders with crucial information for designing and adopting appropriate hei mitigation measures considering the importance of the information in eradicating hei incidents our study integrated geographic information systems gis and abm approaches to evaluate a set of mitigation measures of hei spatial data on the locations of hei instances and environmental conditions were collected through interviews and mapped within a gis while an abm model was used to understand how and why those incidents occurred since hei is variable in time and space the integration of gis and abm aided with understanding the dynamics of hei the model acts as an abstract and ethical laboratory by enabling an identification of the responsible factor s and provision of precise measurement s for each incident without practically affecting the real world wilensky rand 2015 and adjustment calibration of human and elephant populations in a digital environment without violating any human or elephant ethics in this study the abm approach was used to examine the relative influence of several different model parameters on hei incidents in the bunda district of tanzania an understanding of the distribution concentration and geographical distribution of hei incidents is crucial as most management decisions about hei have spatial contexts prasad et al 2011 such information usually helps conservation authorities acquire a suitable geographical outlook and may also facilitate timely and accurate decisions a the study modeled and simulated the bunda district which has more than 25 ethnic groups the main economic activity within the region is subsistence agriculture which accounts for about 80 of the local annual income kideghesho mtoni 2008 farmers normally grow maize millet cassava and sorghum as food crops and cotton as cash crops furthermore people keep sheep goats and cattle walpole et al 2004 the majority of inhabitants are subsistence farmers fisherman livestock keepers and small scale traders bunda has the highest human population density in tanzania with about 200 people per km2 an annual population growth of about 3 0 and about 600 000 people urt 2013 it is in the western region of the serengeti ecosystem covering 3 088 km2 fig 1 moreover the majority of households lack indoor plumbing system which requires them to travel to water sources to fetch water this heightens the chance of humans to encounter elephants at the water sources additionally locals encounter elephants when searching for non timber forest products such as vegetable fruits mushrooms and medicinal plants outside the protected landscapes mduma et al 2010 b the district has contributed a large part of its land surface to wildlife conservation lake victoria occupies about 200 km2 of the area and the serengeti national park occupies 480 km2 about 40 of the district s surface area fig 1 according to a recent elephant census the district hosts about 127 elephants tawiri kws 2014 unplanned human settlements conversion of elephant habitats into cash and food crop fields and development projects are the main drivers of hei in the district ladan 2014 rahman et al 2010 also the impacts of climate change such as floods unreliable rainfall patterns droughts and temperature contribute significantly to hei ladan 2014 hoare 1999 parker et al 2007 asserted that rapid change in human and elephant populations increases the rate of hei in areas next to protected areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description a computational model was developed to study the hei its description follows the odd d overview design concepts detail protocol grimma et al 2006 müllera et al 2013 because the it entails an explicit description of the theoretical background and important details of the model implementation groeneveld et al 2012 the description of theoretical or conceptual background in odd d prevents the audience from misinterpreting the model groeneveld et al 2012 model aims to advance the formulation of proactive and policy based hei mitigation measures and in particular to develop and evaluate a set of mitigation scenarios such as reduction of human and elephant populations smith kasiki 1999 wilson et al 2013 and distancing of anthropogenic activities from the protected areas conservation corridors and rivers granados 2011 prasad et al 2011 wilson et al 2013 it aims to quantitatively reproduce and explain the mitigation management options of hei in the bunda district the model is designed for use by conservationists ecologists modellers and researchers interested in hei 2 1 1 entities state variables and scales the model consists of a landscape with reflecting borders rather than toroidal individuals at one edge of the space cannot jump to cells on the opposite edge and was occupied solely by human and elephants ascensão et al 2013 it consists of two types of entities 600 humans and 127 elephants represented as mobile individuals while the landscape is represented as an environment for humans and elephants to interact within fig 2 all entities are characterized by corresponding state variables online appendix a according to mduma et al 2010 and a field survey from the study area the majority 60 of respondents encountered elephants every day therefore one time step represented one day and the model ran for 365 days one year it was a spatially explicit model constructed by using the vector based gis data layers representing the bunda district the spatial extent of the model was 16 35 patches n 560 each 1000 m x 1000 m in size 100 ha which was imported into the model at the beginning of each simulation fig 2 when moving human and elephant could move into a new grid cell every day depending on their internal and external states the maximum travel distance covered by wild african elephants was 30 000 m per day dswf 2013 in other words elephants moved 30 steps per day covering up to 10 950 grid cells every year the maximum travelling distance covered by humans was 8 000 m per day tudor locke 2011 thus human moved eight steps per day covering up to 2 920 grid cells per year 2 1 2 process overview and scheduling optimal foraging theory guides the development of agents decision making processes on where to begin or end foraging movements and balance energy gained against energy expended tang bennett 2010 since the model proceeds in one day time steps within each time step at least one of the six phases are processed in the following order 1 elephant searches for ecological resources in the protected areas for consumption 2 in the absence of resources elephant moves to the nearest conservation corridor searching for resources 3 a deficiency of resources causes the elephant to move to the nearest crop farm 4 unguarded crops attract elephant crop damage 5 crop farms guarded by humans result in either crop damage human death or elephant death and 6 several incidents of crop damage human death and elephant encounters result in hidden impacts fig 3 2 1 3 design concepts 2 1 3 1 theoretical and empirical background our model assumed that an agent s information processing capacity was limited and that they had only partial information about their habitats including availability of food and water arnold 2010 model agents relied on heuristics that guide their behaviour cabrera et al 2010 the entities were risk takers that above a certain minimum energy level engaged in trial and error to maximise their survival rate dumont david 2004 the decision model for agents was a simplified representation of decision making observations from field surveys conducted by the authors in 2018 interviews literature reviews and optimal foraging theory assumptions tang bennett 2010 spatial data on elevation rivers farms protected areas and conservation corridors characterized the model landscape a farm vector layer provided a landscape for growing crops where humans could guard crops obtain food and interact with elephants as well as for elephants to eat crops the rivers layer provided areas for humans and elephants to obtain water and also provided nutrients and moisture content for crops and vegetation growth the protected areas layer provided the landscape for vegetation growth and elephants to obtain ecological resources das at al 2014 conservation corridors were the primary locations that hei might occur and consisted of a human landscape elephant habitat and migratory routes outside the core protected areas parker et al 2007 thouless et al 2016 the agents interacted in a 1000 m x 1000 m spatial grid resource distribution map where each grid cell contained ecological resources wild plants farm crops and water in the scale between 0 no resource and 5 most resources depending on the agent s current location in a cell on the map valcu kempenaers 2010 in each map grid cell rules governed transitions of scales between ecological resources frances et al 2016 the values of the grid cells were spatially autocorrelated meaning that the value of each cell was related to that of neighboring cells valcu kempenaers 2010 secondary data were adopted to determine elephant and human demographics and location in the model according to tawiri and kws 2014 there were 11 herds or families of elephants one herd with 27 individuals and 10 herds with nine individuals each based on these data the model accommodated up to 127 elephants in total which was regarded as the elephant carrying capacity in the bunda district the age composition of elephant populations was categorised into young sub adult or adult elephants young are elephants below 6 years sub adults were between 6 and 24 years while adults were older than 24 years mduma et al 2010 age structure was as per lindeque 1991 where young constituted 25 sub adults represented 24 and adult elephants constituted 51 of the elephant population therefore the model consisted of 52 male and 55 female elephants in 1 1 sex ratio kioko et al 2013 in the case of humans data on individuals were unavailable due to confidentiality and ethical issues a monte carlo sampling approach was adopted to generate a synthetic population with demographic attributes closely related to the real population of the bunda district it created human agents with age gender and socio economic activity such human attributes were used for modelling and simulation to determine what human could and could not do the human population in the 12 villages under study was approximately 30 661 and spread over 3 000 households urt 2013 it was impossible to model all 10 000 people who annually interacted with elephants in the bunda district walpole et al 2004 instead 600 humans were selected as a representative sample therefore the synthetic generator generated uniformly distributed random number of humans between 0 and 601 in microsoft excel rainwater and rivers were the major sources of water for natural vegetation plants crops and elephants in the model millington et al 2010 since the study area experiences rainy and dry seasons inclusion of dry and rainy seasons in the model was desirable therefore wet and dry seasons determined specific sources of water for each timestep rivers were the major sources in dry seasons while both rivers and rainwater were the major sources in rainy seasons the river vector layer consisted of five segments the 3d analyst extension was deployed to determine the maximum and minimum heights of each river segments by using a digital elevation model dem as a base layer which assisted in identification of grid cells with highest and lowest elevation useya 2013 this helped in the identification of rivers flow and rain water in the model hillerislambers et al 2001 the grand canyon model was extended to prototype rainwater and rivers flow it is a built in example in netlogo wilensky 2006 at the initial timestep rains were created randomly in the modelling environment depending on the rain rate parameter which determined the amount of rain in a particular timestep the drops ran to the neighbouring grid cell with the lowest elevation if the rain could not find a neighbouring grid cell with the lower elevation it remained where it was and became water when rain ran to the edge of the map it was removed from the map in this model green grid cells indicated crops yellow squares indicated natural vegetation plants black grid cells indicated bare soil blue grid cells indicated soil water availability and brown indicated dry soil not suitable for vegetation and crops 2 1 3 2 emergence the spatial distribution of humans and elephants emerged from the adaptive behavior and traits they used to make decisions about moving between protected and unprotected landscapes the spatial distribution varied depending on the initial location of humans and elephants as a result the locations where crop damage human and elephant deaths occurred varied depending on the spatial location of the humans and elephants in the model 2 1 3 3 fitness the model agents maintained and monitored their energy levels as fitness levels the maximum energy level was set to 100 points and a minimum of 0 agents gained energy points after eating food and drinking water and lost energy after performing certain activities however there were interspecific and intraspecific variations in energy expenditure and gain among model agents when the energy level reached zero the model agent died 2 1 3 4 learning human and elephant agents behaved as cognitive or conscious agents having mental awareness of their natural environments in which they move live eat and drink in this model agents never learned 2 1 3 5 individual prediction predicting future conditions was also not considered in the model 2 1 3 6 heterogeneity there was heterogeneity of agents due to the presence of more than one type of conscious agent as consequences both human and elephant agents were heterogeneous in their decision making 2 1 3 7 individual sensing african elephants recognised other elephants sex age unique identifications and their energy levels as well as external elements such as protected areas conservation corridor farms rivers and humans african elephants were the permanent residents of protected areas and occasional visitors to human landscapes similarly humans recognised human gender human id protected areas conservation corridor farms rivers and elephants human were the permanent residents of conservation corridors but never resided or visited the protected areas kideghesho mtoni 2008 2 1 3 8 interactions the interactions in the model depended on the location of the agent in relation to other agents elephants interacted with humans farms rivers protected areas conservation corridors crop farms and other elephants while humans interacted with other humans farms rivers crops conservation corridors and elephants but not the protected areas kideghesho mtoni 2008 2 1 3 9 individual decision making the agents were resource consuming entities and started the simulation at their respective map positions elephants in protected areas and humans in households at each time step agents could either remain in their current grid cell or move to one of the eight neighboring cells diagonal moves were allowed frances et al 2016 after moving each agent collected from its current cell an amount of resources water vegetation or crops which were distributed between 0 and 5 after collection of the resources agents consumed them if the total amount of resources accumulated by an agent was zero the agent moved to another cell while if the amount of resource was above one the agent consumed it and increased their energy level by that amount the agents used a tree decision making method similar to those used in lucita where choices are modelled as the outcome of a series of if then conditions arranged in a hierarchy allowing agents to quickly make decisions based on the evaluation of the available options schreinemachers berger 2011 distance coverage resources consumption and other agents activities stemmed from logical or empirical rules in the form of if then structure deangelis diaz 2019 elephants executed decisions on how and where to consume ecological resources and crops while humans executed decisions on where to eat and how to guard crops against elephants elephants attained the objectives of locating resources it could eat with less resistance similarly human attained their objective of locating food water and guarding crops farm with uncertainty social norms and cultural values were excluded in decision making however spatial and temporal aspects influenced the outcome müllera et al 2013 the decision on where to obtain ecological resources was highly influenced by the energy level and geographical distance between an agent s current grid cell and the potential resources in that cell 2 1 3 10 agent objectives the objective of african elephants was to locate an adequate quantity of food and water to maintain or increase their survival rates they behaved in accordance to optimal foraging theory which demonstrates that animals select patches that maximise their energy efficiency in a cost benefit manner dumont david 2004 the objective of humans was to guard and consume crops as well as drinking water to maximise their survival rates 2 1 3 11 stochasticity we ran a non deterministic model due to the uncertainty in its outputs the probability concept was used in modelling an agent s properties methods and environment there were two main sources of stochasticity in the model first the initial settings of the model particularly the initial location for elephants number of elephants vegetation and crop growth rates geographical distance of agents to farms conservation corridors and rivers were assigned randomly second during each run the number of human deaths elephant deaths crop acreage damaged by elephants agent fitness level and number of incidents of hidden impacts were also modelled randomly 2 1 3 12 collectives agents did not belong to or form any collectives 2 1 3 13 observation for each modelling scenario the total number of human deaths elephant deaths total number of hectares damaged by elephants and the total number of people with hidden impacts were recorded each scenario was individually analysed for the extent of hidden impacts human deaths elephant deaths and crop damage protected areas rivers farms and conservation corridors were initialized at the beginning of each model run the gis layers making up rivers protected areas conservation corridors and farms were imported from a file containing the gis vector data elephants and humans were also initialized at the start of each model run all elephants were randomly initialized in the protected areas the elephants were considered not to be in the human areas and be completely healthy with a random elephant energy level between 50 and 100 units similarly all humans were initialized in their respective households as completely healthy agents with a random human energy level between 50 and 100 units it is important to clarify that a household in the model means a group of people living together within the same homestead often owning and managing their farms together nkedianye et al 2020 therefore no physical houses were included in this model but a piece of land managed by people as a household 2 1 4 implementation details the model was implemented in the netlogo integrated development environment ide wilensky rand 2015 each model simulation ran for 365 time steps with each step representing one day of real world time the initial settings were broadly varied to fit the need of different scenarios to explore the impact of combining different model setting parameter and parameter values of 18 specific scenarios were designed to explore the possibility of either reducing or eradication hei incidents online appendix a the choice of the initial values was driven by the design of a specific scenario for proper moderation of landscape stochasticity and also the variability of model outputs parameter combinations and values each scenario was re run 10 times to obtain a mean value for each output after a year 365 iterations the total number of human deaths elephant deaths total number hectares of crop damage and the total number of people with hidden impacts were recorded model did not use input data to represent time varying processes as the model did not contain processes that changed over time 2 1 5 sub models nineteen parameters were used in this model online appendix a which have been discussed in detail in the corresponding sub models elephant movement in this model 1 0 one elephant step represented 1000 m before the elephant moved a certain amount of energy was deducted from its overall energy level in this model elephants moved 30 steps every day covering up to 10 950 grid cells every year since the actual daily energy consumption of elephant movement was unknown and probably variable it was assumed that one unit of energy was consumed by elephant per each step arnold 2010 the direction of elephant movement depended on the availability of resources and proximity of humans in the neighborhood at the beginning of each step elephant examined neighboring squares and detected different entities the distance determined the ability of elephants in detecting humans vegetation water and crops thus elephants travelled across different landscapes when detecting other entities the parameter river distance corridor distance and protectedarea distance were distances elephants used to detect humans and crops in rivers corridors and protected areas the maximum travelling distance covered by elephants was 8 000 m per day tudor locke 2011 thus elephant moved eight steps per day covering up to 2 920 grid cells per year elephant foraging vegetation african elephants usually feed on natural vegetation in the form of bark leaves wood roots twigs fruits seeds and grasses to survive campos arceiz blake 2011 osborn 2004 santra et al 2008 in this model all natural plants were collectively regarded as vegetation elephants usually spend at least 20 hours a day foraging das et al 2014 dswf 2013 therefore it was assumed that elephants were active for 24 hours since elephants are a highly mobile species it was assumed that elephants are always able to find food and therefore no elephant died of starvation after eating vegetation elephant energy increased by 50 points the amount energy accrued from consuming vegetation matched the average digestibility coefficient 50 of the elephant from vegetation clauss et al 2003 elephant drinking water african elephants usually drink more than 200 liters of water every day dswf 2013 in this model elephants obtained water from streams and rivers the model excluded the probabilistic events of obtaining water from other sources such as wells and taps because the spatial data about such sources were unavailable since elephants are highly mobile the model elephants had high probability of obtaining water when the parameter elephant water chance was initially set to 0 92 nearly 25 of elephants died of dehydration in that case the mortality rate seemed to be high it was therefore changed to 0 99 and decreased the mortality rate to less than 1 which seemed to be reasonable for elephant population since vegetation intake adds more fitness points 50 points to elephant energy than water it was assumed that 20 points of energy would be added after drinking water arnold 2010 elephants damaging crops crop farms were opportunistic sources of energy for elephants because of their high nutrients and low chemical and physical defenses osborn 2004 crop damage occurred in the farms near conservation corridors rivers and protected areas prasad et al 2011 smith kasiki 1999 wilson et al 2013 in this model adult sub adult and young elephants were all responsible for crop damage chiyo cochrane 2005 the distance between the current elephant location and crop farms determined crop damage prasad et al 2011 the parameters protectedarea distance corridor distance and river distance determined the distance between farm and the current elephant location when corridor distance was set to 0 meter conservation corridor to 0 meter and protectedarea distance to 0 meter nearly 8 560 acres of crops were damaged by elephants the damaged acreages seemed to be more than those specified in the secondary data obtained from the bunda district council the parameters values were therefore changed to 0 meter for corridor distance 256 meters for river distance and 200 meters for protectedarea distance to 200 meters and decreased crop damage to 560 acres which seemed to be realistic for the bunda district these are the parameter values used in the baseline scenario specifically and were obtained from the field survey it was assumed that crop consumption activated elephant energy by 70 points because crops usually contain more energy than natural vegetation and water das et al 2014 elephant death the model excluded deaths from dehydration starvation road accidents and poaching elephant death occurs when elephants damage crops in the guarded farms okello et al 2014 based on the field survey when an elephant damages a crop in a guarded farm either the human runs away 75 4 an elephant death occurs 1 5 the elephant moves away 17 7 or there is some other result 5 4 human fainted for fear elephant injured human did nothing thus the probability of elephant mortality rate when an elephant damages a crop was fixed to 1 5 mamboleo et al 2019 setting the parameter elephant mortality rate to 0 015 resulted into 4 elephant deaths in 10 years which emulates the secondary data obtained from the bunda district council human movement the more a human move the more human energy they consume each human spends 1 0 energy for each step 1000 m in this model humans moved eight steps every day covering up to 2 920 grid cells every year the direction of human movement depended on the availability of food water and proximity of elephants in the neighborhood before an initiation of each step a human agent assesses the direction of movement with the primary objective of safeguarding crops and locating food to eat and water to drink human eating food crops are the primary source of energy for humans humans energy demands vary according to age gender weight and physical activity when a human consumed a crop their energy level eventually increased up to 68 points das et al 2014 studies estimate that humans obtain 68 of energy from food consumption while the rest is obtained from non food sources such as water mishra et al 2012 therefore 68 of human energy equivalent to 68 points came from the crops human guarding crops humans guard crops to reduce elephant crop damage human agents guarded crops near rivers protected areas and conservation corridors as they are frequently damaged by elephants in these areas desai riddle 2015 when the surrounding grid cells were occupied by elephants human moved either towards or away from them the human energy and the state of the grid cell determined his her movements parker et al 2003 based on the field survey in most cases 60 human will move away from an elephant less often human either kills an elephant or is killed by an elephant desai riddle 2015 lamarque et al 2009 according to our field survey the probability of human to successfully scare away elephants from the crops farm was 0 14 in that case the parameter crops guarding success was set to 0 14 human drinking water humans usually drink 2 to 3 liters of water every day to survive cbd 2010 in our model human obtained water from streams and rivers the probabilistic events for getting water from other sources such as lakes and wells are not part of this model since humans are intelligent and highly mobile creatures it was assumed that humans had a high chance of obtaining enough water when the parameter human get water chance was initially set to 87 nearly 11 of humans died of dehydration this mortality rate seemed to be high it was therefore changed to 99 and decreased the mortality rate to less than 1 2 which seemed to be reasonable for this population to survive cbd 2010 there was no information on how much human energy is activated each time a human drinks water it was assumed 20 points of energy would be added to human energy after drinking water hidden impacts barua et al 2013 found a number of indirect impacts including disruption of family bonds elevated poverty opportunity costs health and nutritional status and interrupted school attendance for children humans residing near conservation corridors protected areas and rivers are susceptible to hidden impacts granados 2011 hoare 1999 khumalo yung 2015 the impacts occur due to repetitive observations of human deaths elephant encounters and elephant crop damage khumalo yung 2015 kuriyan 2002 based on our field survey hidden impacts occur to humans above four years but farmers and school children were mostly affected badola 1998 barua et al 2013 hill 2004 the field survey showed the probability that a human acquires hidden impacts is 0 6 setting the parameter to 0 6 resulted in 342 incidents which seemed to be reasonable for human population and emulated the field survey data obtained from the bunda district human death the model excluded natural death and other forms of human death such as disease robbery dehydration and poaching related deaths death in this model occurs after preventing elephant from damaging crops in this model human deaths were rare walpole et al 2004 elephants mostly killed farmers residing in conservation corridors mduma lobora foley jones 2010 based on the field survey one human death occurs every 10 years to humans aged four years and above but farmers and school children are most affected badola 1998 barua et al 2013 hill 2004 according to our field survey the probability of human mortality rate when human guarding crops was 0 12 setting the parameter value human mortality rate to 0 12 resulted into the desired mortality rate of 1 human death in 10 years which replicates the secondary data from the bunda district vegetation growth at the initial timestep plants were randomly established all over the protected area regardless of water availability at each time step soil water availability was calculated based upon the location rain rate and density of plants new plant established on a bare patch with sufficient soil water a soil water content parameter determined where a new plant would grow in each timestep hillerislambers et al 2001 the plant grew in bare patches with sufficient water availability the parameter possessed 0 no water and 1 water values millington et al 2010 once the plant was eaten by elephants it would only regrow after 120 timesteps equivalent to four months walpole et al 2004 the plants were placed randomly with equal probability on any bare patch with sufficient water availability crop growth at the initial timestep crops were randomly established in farms not in protected areas regardless of water availability at each time step water availability in crop soil was calculated based upon the patch location and rain rate hillerislambers et al 2001 a new crop was raised on a bare patch with sufficient water and during rainy season after 90 timesteps equivalent to three months kideghesho mtoni 2008 the soil water content parameter possessed 0 no water and 1 water values millington et al 2010 once the crop was eaten by either elephants or humans it regrew after 90 timesteps 2 2 data analysis the baseline scenario was run for 365 iterations under business as usual conditions no changing of model parameters this provided the baseline information on current mitigation treatments of hei in the bunda district with which to compare outcomes emerging from other modelling scenarios the analysis evaluated the effects of 18 modelling scenarios which were formed as possible combinations of the model settings and parameter values online appendix a this enabled the examination of relationships between various model parameters and the behaviours for selection of the best scenario each model simulation ran for 365 time steps with each step representing one day of real world time the model outputs were used to compare emerging outcomes from each scenario for proper moderation of landscape stochasticity and also the variability of model outputs parameter combinations and values for each scenario were run 5 times to obtain a mean value for each output after a year 365 iterations the total number of human deaths elephant deaths total number hectares of crop damage and the total number of people with hidden impacts were recorded from each scenario model results with the total number of human deaths the total number of elephant deaths a total number of acreages of crop damage and a total number of people with hidden impacts were exported for statistical and graphical analysis the data analysis was performed using an anova single factor analysis in microsoft excel each scenario was individually analysed for the extent of hidden impacts human deaths elephant deaths and crop damage against main model variables 2 3 model calibration and validation the model parameter values were obtained from a geospatial survey conducted in the bunda district from march to october 2018 the values included 600 humans 126 elephants corridor distance 0 meters protectedarea distance 200 meters and river distance 252 meters were used for model calibration and validation also a graphical user interface gui from netlogo ide was used for visual verification of humans elephants and their patches in the model moreover parameter sensitivity tests were conducted to determine the change in model outputs in response to changing model parameter values the tests revealed strong relationships between several model parameters and outputs parameter variability involved the human population elephant population river distance protectedarea distance and corridor distance as main parameters the main outputs recorded for model validation and verification were human and elephant deaths crop damage and hidden impacts furthermore comparisons between observed data survey data and model outputs were conducted to validate the model according to the data from survey one elephant and four human deaths were recorded in ten years which correlated well with model outputs also a comparison between survey and model outputs on crop damage showed a close resemblance except for an overestimation of 10 52 hectares for four years in the model moreover a comparison between survey data and model outputs on hidden impacts showed a close comparison except for an overestimation of 16 incidents the full descriptions figure tables and statistics entailing model calibration and validation are presented in the online appendix a3 presents the anova single factor statistical results for the significance of each independent variable with respect to the type of modelling scenario at the end of the simulation these are statistically significant outcomes hidden impacts human deaths crop damage and elephant deaths from the simulation of 18 modelling scenarios involving the combinations of five independent variables of elephant population human population distance from rivers distance from conservation corridors and distance from protected areas the majority 63 out of 67 of hei incidents in all modelling scenarios have p values below 0 05 except human deaths in hees protectedarea hees corridor hees river protect corridor and hidden impact in elephant effect scenario tab 1 and thus the majority of independent variables have a significant impact on the hei incidents in three modelling scenarios human deaths have na p values because the respective scenarios eradicated human deaths since statistical results p values provided insufficient information on a trend of each incident when independent variables were changed between the lowest and highest values thus each incident was graphically analysed to identify its trend overall 26 out of 67 hei incidents with p values below 0 05 were successfully reduced 37 out of 67 incidents with p values below 0 05 were unsuccessfully reduced 1 out of 67 incidents with p value above 0 05 was unsuccessfully reduced and 3 out of 67 incidents with p values below 0 05 were successfully eradicated when the independent variables were changed between the lowest and highest values the full set of the results anova single factor statistical results and descriptions entailing what each scenario means are presented in the supplementary material online appendix a2 3 discussion a spatially explicit and non deterministic agent based model was developed to evaluate the relative performance of different modelling scenarios for reducing or eradicating adverse impacts emanating from hei in the bunda district of tanzania the model simulated adverse impacts in particular the magnitude and frequency of crop damage human deaths hidden impacts and elephant deaths human population elephant population river conservation corridor and protected areas were the main model variables hidden impacts seemed to be the most difficult incidents to reduce as only four out of the 18 scenarios managed to significantly reduce them in those four successful scenarios the main variables were either distance from rivers human population or both in that situation human population size was one of the main determinants of hidden impacts caused by elephants as hidden impacts increased linearly with number of humans in the human effects scenario in the other words the more the human population the more the possibility of humans to interact with elephants in the village land however the hidden impacts increased constantly with increased number of elephants in the model that is to say hidden impact is indirectly inflicted to humans by elephants regardless to elephant population size according to the model for successful minimization of hidden impacts human population size should be reduced or humans should relocate their residents and farms further away from rivers fig 4 however it is important to note that rural residents in the bunda district lack reliable water supply and indoor plumbing systems additionally there is inadequate water quality and quantity in the serengeti national park and grumeti game reserve for elephants particularly in the drought seasons gereta wolanski 1998 all these heighten the interactions between human and elephants because both species depend on the same rivers as the main source of water human deaths were the easiest incidents to reduce as 15 out of 18 modelling scenarios significantly reduced the human fatalities reduction in the human population significantly reduced human deaths in the human effect scenario fig 4 in that situation human population is one of the main determinants of human deaths caused by elephants however it was possible to reduce human deaths without changing the human population as evidenced in ens river protect corridor and elephant effects scenarios which significantly reduced human deaths the model suggests that human deaths may be reduced by lowering the elephant population and also by distancing anthropogenic activities to at least 6 000 meters away from rivers conservation corridors and protected areas in other words it is difficult to reduce human deaths without lowering the human population size hes and human elephant environmental effects scenarios showed zero incidences of human deaths after including human elephant and environment as model variables in short the model offers several options to select from for either reducing or eliminating human death than other incidents also the model reveals that elephant death is one of the most difficult incidents to reduce and eradicate as only six out of 18 modelling scenarios significantly reduced the elephant fatalities in those scenarios elephant population was one of the model variables the model recommends reduction of the elephant population size as one of the mitigation options in reducing elephant deaths it was possible to reduce elephant deaths without changing human population size though eradication of elephant deaths required reduction in human population size for instance the ens river protect corridor scenario reduced elephant deaths without lowering the human population size moreover the model offers eight modelling scenarios to reduce elephant crop damage the majority of those scenarios included river distances or elephant population as one of their main variables the model suggests that most of the crop damage incidents occur within 1000 meters from rivers according to the model human population size is not the only determinant of elephant crop damage fig 5 implementation of human environmental effects and human elephant environmental effects scenarios which included human component in simulation reduced the incidents of elephant crop damage fig 5 the elephant effects scenario shows that elephant crop damage may be reduced without affecting the human population size it also suggests that it is likely to decrease elephant crop damage without distancing the farms from rivers likewise it is possible to reduce crop damage without lowering the elephant population size by adopting the environmental and human environmental effects scenarios however it was impossible to eradicate the crop damage incidents in the model through the adopting of any of 18 modelling scenarios according to the model reducing either human or elephant population could only reduce but not eliminate any of hei incidents as a comparison the elephant effects scenario reduced all adverse impacts except hidden impacts whereas the human effects scenario reduced only hidden impacts it was also possible to reduce or eliminate human deaths without affecting elephant population size by adopting the hes river protect corridor scenario fig 5 but it was unlikely to eradicate any of the incidents without reducing human population size fig 5 in reality the model shows that hei emanates from an amalgamation of several factors beyond just humans and elephants according to graham et al 2010 geographical factors are another determinant of hei as an illustration implementation of the hes river protect corridor scenario suggested that distancing human settlements from rivers corridors and protected areas could reduce all incidents except elephant deaths fig 4 in short many conservation related problems are heavily influenced by a human component bandara tisdell 2002 implementation of the hes river protect corridor scenario by distancing anthropogenic activities away from environmental features river protected areas or corridor eradicated human deaths fig 5 the scenario also reduced hidden impacts but failed to reduce elephant deaths a fair amount of elephant deaths but low incidents of elephant crop damage after 3000 meters from environmental variables means humans can hardly tolerate any level of elephant crop damage and also crop damage is not the only cause for elephant deaths from hei but also human deaths and hidden impacts maiden 2004 lamarque et al 2009 mduma et al 2010 also high amount of elephant deaths after 9000 meters entails that elephants utilize human landscape not only as a foraging ground but also as a migratory corridor where they are likely to encounter humans when migrating mduma et al 2010 the elephant effect scenario is capable of reducing all incidents except hidden impacts this scenario demonstrates how the elephant population size may influence hei occurrences to ascertain the impacts of elephants and environment features on hei the elephant environmental effects scenario was implemented and reduced all incidents except elephant deaths fig 6 the elephant environmental effects scenario is suitable for reducing human deaths hidden impacts and crop damage but not elephant deaths the human environmental effects elephant effects human effects and elephant environment effects scenarios were ineffective at either reducing or eradicating all hei occurrences in this model several modelling scenarios are only useful in reducing or eradicating a particular incident not all incidents the collective impacts of human elephant and environment model variables on hei was investigated by implementing the human elephant environmental effects scenario the modelling scenario unveiled that it was unlikely to reduce or eradicate any of the hei incident by just lowering human and elephant populations together with distancing human activities from one of environmental features river protected areas or corridor the lowering of human and elephant populations and distancing of human activities from all environmental features rivers protected areas and corridors reduced hidden impacts and eliminated human and elephant deaths in the model in the hees river protect corridor scenario the total disappearance of most hidden impacts and elephant crop damage occurred after 8000 meters from rivers corridor and protected areas fig 6 a noticeable reduction of incidents in the human elephant environmental effects scenario happened beyond 5000 meters from edges of protected areas fig 7 areas up to 5000 meters from protected areas are usually considered a buffer zone where governmental and customary laws regulate resource utilisation biodiversitya z 2015 strategic resource management of buffer zones usually aims at enhancing positive impacts while minimising negative ones on neighbouring communities and sustainable conservation ebregt greve 2000 environmentally destructive activities such as farming deforestation infrastructure development and livestock keeping are highly discouraged within a buffer zone governments encourage ecologically friendly activities such as reforestation collection of non timber forest products and ecotourism activities and regard them as an integral part of sustainable rural development policy and environmental conservation programs the magnitude of human and wildlife interactions in a buffer zone is high because of their proximity to core wildlife reserves for people to coexist with wildlife in a buffer zone adoption of the highest degree of tolerance for the problem is required as an alternative people should relocate their settlements and socio economic activities away and use a buffer zone as an area for ecological friendly activities such as worshipping activities environmental conservation and tourism selection of the best performing scenario was based on the magnitude of the reduction of adverse impact s stemming from hei however it is important to understand that for each selection of the best scenario s there are costs that a governing body must incur for successful implementation it is beyond the scope of this study to estimate the cost for each scenario however there was no cost free scenario if the aim is to eradicate elephant and human deaths and reduce hidden impacts and crop damage then the human elephant environmental effects scenario hees river protect corridor is the best scenario this scenario recorded the lowest incidence of human death people with hidden impacts elephant death and the number of hectares of crops damaged by elephants the scenario eradicated human deaths and elephant deaths beyond 0 meters from protected areas and rivers moreover it significantly reduced the hidden impacts and elephant crop damage with the total disappearance of incidents occurred beyond 7000 meters from the rivers corridors and protected areas the elephant effects and elephant environmental effects scenarios hees river protect corridor were the next best performing scenarios reducing three out of four factors despite the effectiveness in eradicating and reducing incidents the governing body should also consider in advance fiscal conservation land and socio economic policies before the adoption of the suggested scenarios as they may seriously challenge the implementation of the human elephant environmental effects scenario the problem is that the scenario requires a substantial reduction of the elephant population which may contradict conservation policies laws and international conservation agreements the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites recognises african elephants as an endangered species in tanzania similarly in some parts of the country the commercial ivory poaching has reduced elephant populations close to local extinction in those situations reduction or translocation of elephant populations is ecologically financially and legally impractical as a substitute to the elephant related scenario the human environmental effects scenario is a good choice as it eliminated human deaths and reduced hidden impacts but not elephant deaths and crop damage since the primary focus of many conservation organisations is to maintain a healthy elephant population while protecting the welfare of people this can also be an improper choice as elephant death and crop damage are still present based on priorities and policies if the model user prioritizes the reduction of hei occurrences without affecting the integrity of humans and elephants the environmental effects scenario ens river protect corridor is the best choice it reduces all incidents except elephant deaths implementation of this scenario requires distancing crops farm to beyond 7000 meters from rivers corridors and protected areas for that reason depending on the land ownership of the area compensation for land and property before moving people to other locations may be required it may also depend on people s willingness to move this scenario also will not reduce elephant deaths the model user may choose to reduce elephant and human deaths only without affecting elephant and human population sizes in that case the environmental effects scenario ens protectedarea would be the most effective choice this scenario recommends distancing human settlement to 10000 meters from the edge of protected areas however the scenario does not end the hidden impacts and elephant crop damage alternately the manager may decide to reduce crop damage and human deaths only without affecting elephant and human population sizes in that case the environmental effects scenario ens river is the best choice the scenario recommends distancing of human activities to more than 8000 meters from rivers and streams the adoption of the best scenario should not rely solely on the type of adverse impact tolerance and resilience level of elephants but also the well being of the affected people the capabilities of people elephants and conservationists to accept tolerate and ultimately to recover from a certain level of adverse impacts may determine the selection of the most important scenario making decisions about total eradication or reduction of adverse impacts is situational the scenarios with the lowest incidents are highly recommended as the best scenarios in addition the model recommends that before selecting the best scenario consideration of financial policies conservation policies and social policies and legal framework is undertaken legal and policy dimensions may complicate the implementation of the best scenario when not taken into consideration finally the human elephant environmental effects hees river protect corridor would be recommended as the best scenario for the total eradication of negative impacts and environmental effects ens river protect corridor scenario as the best for substantial reduction of hei occurrences with minimal impacts on the integrity of elephants and humans 3 1 further model developments or directions our model could have been more effective if it had incorporated the detailed dynamics of indirect or hidden impacts hidden impacts were modelled and simulated as a single combined output in reality there are many types of hidden impacts including suffering from disease marriage problems psychological problems debts and restricted movements it was not possible to model each of them as an individual impact due to insufficient coverage of data for development and validation with adequate data on hidden impacts the model would be able to highlight the extent and severity of each category of the hidden impacts in the district we would recommend a comprehensive study to identify and quantify specific hidden impacts in the district french et al 2019 asserted that the way animals utilize the joint space is the function of many factors in that case a time series approach for joint space analysis could have been adopted in this study to incorporate all driving factors behind human elephant interactions in computation modelling it is our recommendation to the future modelers to consider this approach when modelling human wildlife interactions our model could be redeveloped to make it flexible and portable for users from different protected areas with active elephants to apply it without any modification on the configuration of the model this would make its application possible locally and internationally it would also assist both african and asian elephants its application would also be possible to other problem animals in the world including wild pigs eland lions wild dogs and primates additionally our model could be redeveloped to answer this question would changing the number of elephants from 127 individuals to 11 herds lessen the severity of conflict if the herds were acting as one entity against if acting separately the model opens a new chapter for both elephant management and hei mitigation measures it allows conservationists to design test and prescribe tested actions that can reduce hei occurrences application of this approach is possible to all countries with active elephant ranges worldwide once modified implementation of any modelling scenarios necessitates concerted action and coordinated commitments it is therefore essential for conservation agencies to seek the political and public will to make a modelling approach work a successful outcome only happens when the government and public stakeholders speak in the same language stakeholders must be willing to recognise and understand hei occurrences as complex problems more importantly stakeholders must also agree on the positive and negative impacts of the suggested mitigation measure implementation of the mitigation measures can also be very demanding as most of them necessitate both parties to sacrifice property and or other resources locals may have to sacrifice their property and social justice while the government may sacrifice financial resources and elephant lives governments and local communities must be aware of the cost and benefit for each recommended mitigation measures in addition the reformation of the legal and policy framework is inevitable before implementation the reformation will provide a smooth implementation of the agreed mitigation measures between the government and the public model aimed to suggest the best option to either minimise or reduce adverse impacts of hei in the bunda district it evaluated 18 modelling scenarios and recommended the hees river protect corridor based on the magnitude of the reduction of adverse impact s stemming from hei the model advocates that there is no single cause of hei incidents in other words hei is caused by myriads of factor including anthropogenic and non anthropogenic living and non living factors reduction in either human or elephant population size may only reduce to certain extent but not eradicate the adverse impacts of hei also lowering of elephant and human populations may only either reduce or eradicate some but not all annoying incidents of hei the model remains important in the provision of geographical and scientific details about hei occurrences as mitigation measures can be scientifically and socially tested before their adoption since different environmental conservation agencies adopt different criteria policies and priorities to decide on appropriate hei interventions this model provides myriads of options that conservation agencies can choose from to reduce any of the adverse impacts of hei such flexibility makes the modelling approach user friendly and multipurpose in addition the model substantially reduces the costs and time of carrying out similar field experiments it is not practical to implement this model in other areas unless significant adaptations are made to local conditions decisions made by elephants and humans depend on a myriad of factors that are area specific including psychology preferences culture geography and irrational behaviours of individual agents which are too difficult to measure for humans and elephants this model is specifically applicable to bunda district as it replicates the environment and behaviours of agents specific to district this model serves a specific not a general purpose tool implementation of the best recommended scenarios from the model to areas inside or outside tanzania should be exercised with extreme caution as such areas always have local factors that affect hei in very different ways however this model still serves as the learning platform for conservation stakeholders to understand hei occurrences better by interacting with it and modifying the specifications to fit their local areas it can at least form a null hypothesis for expectations around hei the implementation of the model to other areas requires changes in the densities of elephants and humans in the models as well as their attributes and the environmental characteristics of new areas in addition there must be changes in interaction rules to reflect the hei dynamics of the areas of interest specific to local populations the magnitude of hei culture experience conservation policies and laws poverty level and species of elephants determine the interaction rules humans from different areas may have different experiences and responses toward elephants and so different species and subspecies of elephants may react differently to humans moreover before adopting the model to other areas adapting the environmental components and set up to reflect the area of interest is essential environmental components such as farms protected areas households rivers and conservation corridor used in the model differ hugely compared to other areas other areas may have more or less similar environmental components to the bunda district since such components are the backbone of the interaction interface it is important to assure that the environmental setup and ingredients are in the right order furthermore it is also necessary to consider the purpose of the model the model aims at controlling four adverse impacts of hei and any change in this purpose may affect the components and setup and interaction rules it may also affect the number and type of agents involved lastly but also importantly the availability of reliable data for calibration validation and verification of the suggested model is crucial the validation and verification of the model hinged on the specific data from the bunda

24664,modeling somatic growth of animals whose growth rates are seasonally variable is a challenge seasonal variation in growth reduces model fit and precision if not accounted for and ad hoc adjustments to growth models may be biased or biologically unrealistic we developed a growth phenology model gpm that uses a logistic function to model the cumulative proportion of total annual growth we applied this model using two different approaches to datasets from temperate climate populations of two freshwater turtle species that experience extended winter dormancy during which no growth occurs the first dataset consisted of repeated intra annual observations of sub adult snapping turtles chelydra serpentina tracked by radio telemetry which we analyzed in a bayesian context focusing on growth over a single season we then demonstrated a post hoc combination of the fitted gpm with a separate overall growth model for the second application we fully integrated the gpm into a hierarchical von bertalanffy growth model which we applied to a dataset of primarily inter annual observations of juvenile midland painted turtles chrysemys picta marginata specifying informative priors allowed us to fit the model despite the sparseness of intra annual information in the data we also demonstrate using the beta cumulative distribution function as an alternative to the logistic function in the gpm we discuss incorporating prior knowledge about seasonal foraging and activity periods into growth models via a gpm as a transparent alternative to deterministic implicit a priori

by environmental conditions e g kielbassa et al 2010 marchand et al 2018 ramirez et al 2020 and growth interacts dynamically with other evolved aspects of life history such as size and age at maturity survival and fecundity e g armstrong et al 2018 congdon et al 2018 shine and iverson 1995 the link between growth and population vital rates means that somatic growth models are critical for parameterizing many applied population models such as integral projection models rose et al 2019 and allometric models hatch 2019 tests of life history and ecological hypotheses may therefore depend on accurate estimation of growth model parameters e g bulté and blouin demers 2009 hatch et al 2019 or among individual variation in growth rates armstrong et al 2018 bjorndal et al 2019 congdon et al 2018 under standard growth models the predicted growth of an animal over a time interval depends only on the animal s current size and the duration of the interval wang and jackson 2000 however growth will also depend on the environmental conditions over the interval and these are expected to vary seasonally therefore modeling somatic growth in long lived ectotherms is a challenge when growth rates are seasonally variable failure to account for seasonal variation in growth reduces model fit and precision lindeman 1997 spence and turtle 2017 seasonal biases in observation interval duration can result in biased growth estimates schmid 1995 and ad hoc adjustments to growth models may be biologically unrealistic fig 1 some authors resort to discarding a subset of data to avoid discrepancies due to unmodelled seasonal differences among observations bjorndal et al 2013 chessman 2018 krueger et al 2011 samson 2003 seminoff et al 2002 approaches to handling seasonal variation can include i modeling growth as a function of a measured environmental covariate such as temperature which is integrated into the growth function itself e g arnall et al 2019 kielbassa et al 2010 or indirectly by defining growing degree days e g snover et al 2015 or ii seasonality can be handled by using a model of annual growth phenology within the latter general approach specific strategies include fig 1

the growth model by including an oscillating sine function e g koch et al 2007 ogle 2017 pitcher and macdonald 1973 somers 1988 reviewed in akamine 2009 also see technical note garcía berthou et al 2012 most herpetological growth models rely on either completely implicit seasonal models or the ignore as error approach in many temperate climate ectotherm populations feeding occurs during a limited annual window that may not be equivalent to the duration of the general activity season an often unstated assumption is that either the activity season or a narrower annual foraging window is an adequate proxy for the timing and duration of growth the implicit approach makes the additional assumption that the growth rate is uniform during this period implicit models are typically applied by transforming observation dates into a continuous variable defined relative to the start and end of the activity season this transformation may be implemented during initial data processing so that the implied model and its assumptions are not usually considered part of a formal growth model an exception is smith et al 2010 who include the start and end points for the non growing season as explicit parameters which were estimated using the growth data along with the other growth model parameters the use of oscillating functions in growth models is well established in fisheries science and versions of these models are available in several stock assessment software packages such as tropfishr mildenberger et al 2017 and fishmethods nelson 2018 typically oscillating growth functions do not accommodate prolonged periods of zero growth and fitting them to such data can result in apparent negative growth size decreases at certain times of year pauly et al 1992 however models adding a no growth time term to prevent this have been developed ogle 2017 pauly et al 1992 wang and jackson 2000 lindeman 1997 simply rescaled the time term to exclude the winter period before fitting an oscillating model to produce a non linear implicit model of growth in juvenile painted turtles chrysemys picta here we present a simple flexible conceptual framework for combining a model of lifetime somatic growth such as the von bertalanffy vb with a model of the seasonal timing of growth growth phenology model gpm this approach allows more precise modeling of seasonally variable growth by explicitly incorporating the timing of seasonal changes in growth rate including prolonged dormant periods without growth fitted to the observed data we also demonstrate a strategy for specifying biologically meaningful priors on seasonal component parameters we first develop and illustrate a logistic gpm focusing only on growth within a single season in the context of repeated intra annual observations of juvenile snapping turtles chelydra serpentina we then construct a model of growth over multiple years by fitting a combined gpm and vb model to a dataset of primarily inter annual mark

phenology model gpm in temperate climate turtles growth in body length within a single season has rarely been quantified but there is evidence that it may be approximately sigmoidal ernst 1971 keller et al 1997 lindeman 1999 1997 sexton 1965 following lindeman 1997 we used a logistic function appendix a secition1 eq a 1 to model seasonal growth 1 δ l i j a i 1 exp g 1 b s i j ϵ i j where δ l i j is the change in length relative to the first measurement of the season for observation j of individual i and s i j is the fraction of the year elapsed by observation j of individual i b g and a i are parameters of the logistic function to be estimated b is the inflection point the fraction of the year when half the growth has occurred and g is the logistic rate parameter that determines how quickly growth occurs a i is the total increase in length over the growing season relative to the initial size of individual i so that a i is a property of individuals rather than seasonal variation in growth rate ϵ i j n 0 σ e 2 is the normally distributed residual error 2 1 fitting the logistic gpm to seasonal growth of snapping turtles we analyzed within season growth using previously unpublished observations of juvenile and young adult snapping turtles tracked by vhf radio telemetry during 2013 and 2014 snapping turtles were captured in may from canoe by hand or dip net in baited hoop traps or by hand during terrestrial movements as part of sampling for the long term algonquin park snapping and painted turtle life history projects turtles were fitted with model a2480 3 6 g or model r1920 16 g transmitters advanced telemetry systems ats isanti minnesota usa depending on turtle size transmitters were attached using epoxy to the posterior lateral portion of the carapace and the transmitter and glue combined to weigh less than 5 of body mass in all cases five radio tracked adults that did not show appreciable growth were excluded from the analysis one juvenile was excluded because it was removed for successful veterinary treatment of a suspected infection at the transmitter attachment site the remaining 11 snapping turtles carapace length cl range 11 09 29 65 cm were radio located on foot or from canoe once every 14 days mean from may through august and once more in mid september 2013 or early october 2014 turtles were initially captured in or adjacent to seven different water bodies and most movements were within contiguous habitat patches however two individuals were initially captured during overland movements and one moved again to another water body during the active season three individuals transitioned to small adjacent wetlands in late august prior to hibernation when feasible turtles were recaptured from canoe by wading or by snorkeling and straight midline cl was measured using vernier calipers to the nearest 0 1 mm snapping turtles were often unavailable for capture due to their frequent retreat to inaccessible habitat features such as beaver lodges bank burrows or areas under floating bog mats we measured size on 52 of 90 observation occasions including initial capture we only analyzed data from one field season for each individual we parameterized the data as within season growth by subtracting the first measurement of the season for each individual from subsequent measurements first measurements were taken between 6 may and 31 may because we could not assume that no growth occurred before then we modified eq 1 by adding a second term to account for missed growth δ l i j a i 1 exp g 1 b s i j a i 1 exp g 1 b s i 1

logistic gpm with intra annual data we fitted the gpm using the bayesian updating software jags version 4 2 0 plummer 2003 implemented in r version 4 0 2 r development core team 2018 using the r2jags package version 0 6 1 su and yajima 2020 we specified a i as a fixed effect of individual i and b and g as single population level parameters additionally we constructed a model with b i and g i as individually varying random effects appendix b but this more complex model was not an improvement as judged by dic deviance information criterion spiegelhalter et al 2002 a similar model can be fitted using maximum likelihood for example by using the r package nlme however bayesian fitting is advantageous here because it allows for informative priors to be specified based on common sense biological and climatic constraints informative priors can improve precision of the posterior parameter estimates especially when the sample size is small e g link and barker 2010 informative priors often take the form of a pert program evaluation and review technique distribution malcolm et al 1959 which is a beta distribution fitted to data elicited from experts on the most likely value and minimum and maximum constraints vose 2000 snapping turtles in algonquin park are typically active from early may through september with foraging occurring between late may and the end of august obbard and brooks 1981 mean temperatures in the study area peak in mid july environment and climate change canada 2020 we used this information to formulate a prior for parameter b which corresponds to the midpoint and maximum rate of increase of the logistic function by specifying a pert distribution with a minimum of 15 may a most likely value mode of 15 july and maximum of 1 september which is b p e r t 0 37 0 54 0 67 on the year fraction scale to specify a biologically interpretable prior on parameter g we noted that the logistic function is also the cumulative distribution function cdf for the logistic probability distribution which in turn has quantile function q p b g ln p 1 p where p is the probability the quantile function enabled us to conceptualize g in terms of the proportion of growth accumulating within a time frame we proposed that accruing 90 of annual growth in only three weeks 21 days would be a conservative upper limit on growth rate relative to the length of the active season which is ca 5 months obbard and brooks 1981 therefore δ s 21 days 0 0575 yr q p 2 0 95 q p 1 0 05 and solving for g reveals that b cancels out and 3 g δ s ln p 2 1 p 2 ln p 1 1 p 1 21 365 2422 ln 0 95 1 0 95 ln 0 05 1 0 05 0 0098 we used eq 3 to determine that when g 0 085 it would take six months to complete 90 of growth which we took as a conservative constraint on the minimum growth rate we proposed a most likely value of g 0 043 corresponding to the 76 days between 31 may and 15 august resulting in the prior g p e r t 0 0098 0 043 0 085 we treated the individually varying annual increment parameter a i as a fixed effect with prior a i u 0 5 to constrain mean annual growth between 0 and 5 cm 95 of growth trajectories are not expected to exceed ca 3 cm year armstrong and brooks 2013 individual growth was highly variable in part because individuals varied in sex and starting size we could have implemented a more informative prior along with a random effects data structure based on the model of armstrong and brooks 2013 but the present procedure is more generalizable to the typical case where a detailed population specific growth model has not yet been implemented the directed acyclic graph of the model structure is shown in fig 2 a we ran three mcmc markov chain monte carlo chains for 110 000 iterations and discarded the first 10 000 as burn in we assessed convergence using the gelman rubin diagnostic r 1 1 brooks and gelman 1998 and inspection of trace plots of monitored parameters we performed posterior predictive checking by calculating the sum of squares ssq of residuals and comparing these to ssq of datasets simulated based on the model at each mcmc iteration we made these comparisons using a bayesian p value p b and by visually inspecting the scatterplot gelman et al 2004 the logistic gpm parameters all showed good convergence and the posterior predictive check indicated adequate fit p b 0 475 where values far from 0 5 suggest inadequate fit for the chosen discrepancy measure gelman et al 2004 the total annual growth a i varied among individuals range 0 26 1 84 cm fig 2b if a i is factored out the fitted function describes the proportion of the total annual growth predicted to have occurred by time s based on parameters b and g table 1 fig 2c fig 3 demonstrates that time can be rescaled to reflect the proportion of annual growth predicted to have occurred by each point in the year based on the estimated parameter means table 1 95 of annual growth was accrued by 23 july fig 2c which is only 64 of the way through the foraging period fig 1 this differs markedly from the timing of growth predicted if growth is assumed to be linear over the presumed active or foraging periods fig 1 several studies on this and other turtle species have reported reduced foraging activity or reduced growth later in the season despite warm temperatures ernst 1971 keller et al 1997 lindeman 1997 obbard and brooks 1981 sexton 1965 additionally food intake at the beginning and end of the active season may be allocated to recovering from or preparing for periods of negative energy balance aphagic periods before during and after hibernation rather than growth crawford 1994 jackson and ultsch 2010 3 adding the logistic gpm to a von bertalanffy growth function to this point we have not modelled a within year effect of body size on growth rate that is we assumed that over a single season slower growth with increasing size was adequately accommodated by among individual year differences in annual growth increment a i this simplification is reasonable as a starting point for snapping turtles in algonquin park because each growing season comprises only a small fraction of individuals lifetime growth trajectory armstrong and brooks 2013 to explicitly integrate the seasonal model into an overall somatic growth model we conceptualized the logistic gpm as a scaling modification for time this suggests an intuitive way to incorporate the logistic gpm into a somatic growth model like the von bertalanffy vb model by including it within the time term spence and turtle 2017 take a similar approach but without defining a continuous seasonal model and they point out that the somers 1988 version of the seasonal vb model can also be conceived this way a typical formulation of the length at age vb model is that of beverton and holt 1957 4 l i j l 1 exp k t s i j t 0 where l is the asymptotic size parameter k is the rate parameter t s i j is age at observation j of individual i and t 0 is the hypothetical age before birth when length is 0 which we treated as a population level parameter in our notation we used y s for time variables measured in decimal calendar years and t s for age measured in decimal years of age table 2 we symbolized the seasonal logistic gpm as function f s applied to year fraction 0 s 1 and as function f y s applied to y s which includes whole number years table 2 see appendix a sections a 1 and a 2 for derivations to add the seasonal model we focused on the time term of eq 4 δ t t s i j t 0 which we modified to apply the logistic gpm using function f so that the time difference is quantified on the gpm scale therefore an integrated vb and logistic gpm model is 5 l i j l 1 exp k f t s i j s h f t 0 s h where s h is year fraction at hatching we have made the simplifying assumption that all hatching occurs at the same time every year september 15 which is the middle of the hatching period riley et al 2014 in which case s h is a population level parameter because each year of age begins at s h instead of 0 on the calendar scale the function of this parameter is to shift age variables so that a fraction of a year of age aligns with fractions of a calendar year before applying the logistic gpm transformation see appendix a section a 2 for details of our derivation figs 3 c and 3d show a version of the combined vb and logistic gpm model plotted using different scales with years the same in both cases but fractions of years represented as either linear age t s or as growth phenology age expected proportion of annual growth accrued which we denoted as t p eq a 9 table 2 fig 3 illustrates that the form and parameters of the overall growth model can be treated independently from the particulars of the gpm 3 1 incorporating seasonal growth into the interval form of the von bertalanffy model the interval parameterization of the vb model fabens 1965 can be written using notation as in table 2 6 l i j l l l i j 1 exp k y s i j y s i j 1 this form is also called the recapture parameterization and is used to fit the vb model to recapture data without relying on known age as we did for the size at age vb function we modified the time terms to incorporate the logistic gpm l i j l l l i j 1 exp k f y s i j f y s i j 1 which we can express in the y p notation table 2 signifying the logistic gpm scale 7 l i j l l l j 1 exp k y p i j y p i j 1 3 2 enforcing intercepts within our conception of the seasonal model it is desirable that the proportion of annual growth p approaches 0 at the start and 1 at the end of each annual period s 0 and s 1 respectively this is approximately satisfied for the fitted logistic model of seasonal growth in snapping turtles however in some situations such as a frequentist analysis or bayesian analysis with more diffuse priors it is conceivable that the unmodified logistic gpm could produce unanticipated or unrealistic output under certain parameter combinations figure a 1 we have applied two approaches to this problem in appendix c we replace the logistic function with the beta cdf which is constrained to return values from 0 to 1 over the range 0 1 this gave very similar results to the approach presented here which is to rescale the logistic function given a linear proportion of year s the following modification of the logistic gpm f s standardizes the output so that p intersects 0 at the start and 1 at the end of each annual period 8 f s f s f 0 f 1 f 0 p and f y s y f s y p where function f accommodates year fractions s combined with whole years y the standardized and unstandardized versions of the logistic gpm function are compared in figure a 1 4 fitting the combined model to painted turtle recaptures for the snapping turtle dataset above we added the seasonal logistic gpm component to an overall growth model after estimating the gpm parameters g and b separately using an ancillary data set here we demonstrate fitting the combined model to a primarily inter annual recapture dataset for a different species of freshwater turtle painted turtles also living in algonquin park compared to the vb model without an explicit seasonal component this comes at the cost of an increase in model complexity due to having to estimate two additional parameters b and g in the frequentist framework however incorporating prior information can reduce the increase in complexity in bayesian analysis spiegelhalter et al 2002 4 1 painted turtle dataset the recapture dataset was collected in algonquin provincial park as part of a long term life history study to focus on illustrating the seasonal component we only included observations of juveniles l 8 6 cm to avoid complicating the model by incorporating effects of sex and maturity we excluded unknown age individuals with only one juvenile observation because these cases were not informative for the model one pronounced outlier which had a residual that was more than double the next largest value was detected after fitting the model we removed this observation which was inconsistent with other observations of the same individual before refitting the model the remaining data consist of 658 midline plastron length observations of 158 juvenile painted turtles collected between 1991 and 2017 with a median interval of 1 year min 3 days max 3 years aquatic sampling for the painted turtle project is primarily conducted during the pre nesting period and focuses on among year recaptures as a consequence of the 658 juvenile observations we analyzed only 13 were made in the same year as a previous observation of the same individual and only 44 were made after 31 may by fitting a seasonal model to these data we endeavoured to assess whether our approach could be applied in cases without directed within year sampling juvenile painted turtles can be confidently aged using scute rings for a few years after hatching brooks et al 1997 lindeman 1997 we incorporated known age information for 28 individuals whose age could be determined at first capture and for which contemporaneous photographs verifying growth ring counts were available we also applied a separate dataset of hatchling observations to estimate variation in size at hatch described below 4 2 hierarchical von bertalanffy model we adapted the armstrong and brooks 2013 hierarchical formulation of the vb model which differs from the conventional vb model eq 4 and 6 by including among individual variation in parameter estimates armstrong and brooks 2013 also replaced k i with k i l i which decouples individual variation in growth rate and asymptotic size because we did not include adult size observations among individual variation in l i was not well estimated the mcmc chains for hierarchical mean and sd parameters did not converge in preliminary runs so we treated l as a single parameter without individual variation incorporating these features along with the logistic gpm into the vb interval formulation eq 7 results in the model l i j l l l i j 1 exp k i l y p i j y p i j 1 ϵ i j where k i ln n μ k σ k 2 is the individually varying rate parameter ϵ i j is the residual error with distribution n 0 σ e 2 and y p i j f y s i j eq 8 is time of observation j of individual i adjusted using the standardized logistic gpm function with parameters b and g which are estimated from the data along with the vb parameters in the jags code we used the equivalent parameterization 9 l i j n μ l i j σ e 2 μ l i j l l l i j 1 exp k i l y p i j y p i j 1 4 2 1 seasonal model parameters the painted turtle activity season is similar in timing to that experienced by snapping turtles as both populations occur in algonquin park with foraging occurring primarily between late may and the end of august lefevre and brooks 1995 rollinson and brooks 2007 we therefore used the same priors b p e r t 0 37 0 54 0 67 and g p e r t 0 0098 0 043 0 085 for the painted turtle data to assess identifiability and prior sensitivity of the seasonal component parameters we refitted the model using uniform priors constrained over the same ranges b u 0 37 0 67 and g u 0 0098 0 085 we did not model individual variation in these parameters because most individuals were not captured more than once per season 4 2 2 known age individuals and hatching size data for known age individuals we used the same interval formulation that we applied to the recapture data eq 9 with the first observation paired with inferred size and time of hatching to create the first interval in these cases l i j 1 l h i unobserved hatching plastron length for individual i and y p i j 1 f y h s h i time of hatch incorporating the logistic gpm we assumed a standard hatching date of 15 september s h 0 706 which is in the middle of the hatching period although painted turtle hatchlings often delay emergence from the nest chamber until the following spring fall emergence is not uncommon in algonquin park populations riley et al 2014 fall and spring emergence episodes are separated by the cold period when significant somatic growth is not expected regardless of overwintering strategy so we do not anticipate substantial differences in growth rates between strategies l h i was not observed for any of the individuals in our growth dataset so we assumed that for each individual l h i was drawn from a random distribution of hatchling sizes we used size at hatching data from the algonquin park study populations hughes and brooks 2006 riley et al 2014 riley and litzgus 2013 to estimate the parameters of the hatchling size distribution we used a hierarchical model fit to plastron length observations of 632 hatchlings from 140 clutches where the length of hatchling h within in each clutch c is normally distributed around the within clutch mean as h l h n μ h c σ h 2 and clutch means are themselves normally distributed across the population as μ h c n μ c σ c 2 therefore applying the law of total variance we modelled the distribution of l h i as l h i n μ c σ h 2 σ c 2 because we used the interval formulation the vb parameter t 0 is not part of the likelihood and does not need to be estimated during model fitting however some form of t 0 is necessary for plotting the length at age or length vs time vb curve for known age individuals we calculated individual t 0 i t 0 i on the gpm transformed age scale as a derived parameter appendix a section a 3 4 2 3 integrated model we combined the hierarchical vb hatchling size and seasonal components into an integrated model the directed acyclic graph of the model structure is shown in fig 4 we specified uninformative priors for all parameters except b and g in the seasonal component we ran the model in jags to sample 110 000 mcmc draws for each of three chains before discarding 10 000 as burn in and thinning by 10 we assessed convergence using the gelman rubin diagnostic r 1 1 brooks and gelman 1998 and inspection of trace plots of monitored parameters we performed posterior predictive checking by calculating the sum of squares ssq of residuals and comparing these to ssq of datasets simulated based on the model at each mcmc iteration we made these comparisons using a bayesian p value p b and by visually inspecting the scatterplot gelman et al 2004 we assessed identifiability of the gpm parameters by estimating prior posterior overlap τ for b and g gimenez et al 2009 calculated as in keevil 2020 4 3 painted turtles fitted model results convergence was achieved for all monitored parameters table 3 and the posterior predictive check indicated adequate fit based on the ssq discrepancy measure p b 0 497 under the less informative uniform distribution gpm parameter b was identifiable τ b 0 224 while g was weakly identifiable τ g 0 368 based on the τ 0 35 threshold of garrett and zeger 2000 appendix a section a 4 weak identifiability suggests that the posterior estimates may be informed substantially by the priors garrett and zeger 2000 gimenez et al 2009 however the differences in posterior distributions estimated under different prior specifications were negligible figure a 2 the logistic gpm for painted turtles fig 5 was estimated with less precision than the gpm for the intra annual observations of snapping turtles fig 2c this is unsurprising because while the snapping turtle dataset consisted of repeated observations of individuals within a growing season only a small subset of the painted turtle observations was informative for the seasonal component because the sampling was primarily annual nevertheless the gpm parameters were at least weakly identifiable even under a less informative uniform prior appendix a section a 4 figure a 3 our estimate of the length of the 90 growing season which we defined as the annual interval between 5 and 95 growth accumulation was substantially longer for painted turtles compared to snapping turtles table 4 we interpret this comparison with caution because these estimates were made using somewhat different models applied to data collected at different temporal scales however the direction of the difference is consistent with ecological differences between the two species painted turtles bask throughout the open water season to raise their body temperature and metabolic rate edwards and blouin demers 2007 rollinson et al 2008 rowe et al 2017 aerial basking by snapping turtles is comparatively infrequent albeit more common in algonquin park than at warmer sites obbard and brooks 1979 and snapping turtles often choose microhabitats that are cooler than the available maximum environmental temperatures brown et al 1990 rowe et al 2020 in michigan rowe et al 2020 2017 found that snapping turtles were less precise thermoregulators and that painted turtles maintained higher rates of thermal exploitation over a greater proportion of the active season the between species difference in the onset of growth quantified as 5 accumulated growth table 4 was a substantial component of the difference in overall growing season length that we estimated although male snapping turtles in algonquin park are very active in may while seeking mating opportunities females are significantly less active in may than in june july and august brown and brooks 1993 which is consistent with a late onset of feeding and growth that we inferred for snapping turtles in general if these differences in activity and thermal ecology are reflected in the timing of feeding assimilation and growth then they are congruent with the phenological differences implied by our fitted models 4 4 advantages of a bayesian gpm approach the integrated seasonal vb model is plotted for an example individual painted turtle with two observations in 2013 fig 6 on the standard time scale an observation made on 18 august 2013 is plotted near an earlier observation made 02 may in the same year fig 6a but on the gpm corrected scale the august observation is much closer to the third observation made on 12 may of the following spring fig 6b this example illustrates the seasonality correction provided by the logistic gpm component the horizontal error bars on observations in fig 6b indicate the quantification and propagation of uncertainty around the effect of season on growth i e growth phenology providing an advantage over implicit models which may afford some ability to correct for seasonality but cannot account for uncertainty in phenology relative to the common approaches to handle seasonal growth rate variation identified in the introduction ignore as error implicit oscillating sine etc using the logistic gpm to model seasonal variation in somatic growth has benefits that include quantification and propagation of uncertainty in growth phenology to somatic growth models biological realism due to gradual increase and decrease in growth rate at the beginning and end of the growing season accommodation of prolonged winter dormancy without appreciable growth incorporation of commonly available basic ancillary information about timing and duration of the active foraging season in the bayesian context does not require additional environmental covariates can be fitted to data with few intra annual observations given sufficiently informative bayesian priors timing and rate of seasonal growth are fit to data rather than being fixed before analysis although some of these features are present or can be added in some of the alternative approaches the logistic gpm or the beta gpm has the advantage of including them all within a fairly simple two parameter model the informative priors for the gpm parameters relied only on ancillary information about growth season duration because this type of information is frequently available and is already commonly used for implicit seasonal models in growth studies many ecologists avoid incorporating prior information especially when doing so may directly impact conclusions about focal hypotheses preferring instead to use vague priors or purely likelihood based methods banner et al 2020 however for many applications of somatic growth models seasonal variation in growth rate is not a theoretical focus instead the focus may be on estimating life history parameters or assessing effects of site or phenotype on growth over multiple years in this context growth phenology can be thought of as a nuisance component that nevertheless must be modelled to understand the overall growth process furthermore many applications already rely implicitly on prior information by defining growth time based on values chosen for the start and end of the growing season these implicit models further assume that growth is uniform within these rigid bounds we propose that formally including prior information into an explicit seasonal model such as the logistic gpm is a better approach because it is more transparent allows the observed data to influence the seasonal component and quantifies uncertainty and propagates it to the rest of the model 5 conclusions our analysis of within year snapping turtle growth indicated that the phenology of somatic growth in our study population differed substantially from the phenology inferred from the activity season which suggests that activity season delineations may not adequately characterize the somatic growth period this illustrates an advantage of our approach which allows observed data to influence the model of seasonal variation in growth rather than fixing it a priori as in implicit models our application of the logistic gpm to inter annual observations of painted turtle growth demonstrates integration of the seasonal model with an overall somatic growth model and illustrates that such a model can be fitted in the context of sparse seasonal growth data if prior information is included 5 1 potential extensions our application of the logistic gpm is flexible facilitating extensions to other situations one possibility is to apply our logistic gpm component to growth functions other than the vb model we do not anticipate any barrier to applying the gpm to the age or time interval term of somatic growth models such as richards gompertz or schnute a second possible extension is to replace the logistic function with a different cumulative proportion function in the gpm we illustrate this using the beta cdf in appendix c another possibility is the inverse probit function which also has two parameters to estimate and would behave similarly to the logistic function but with a slightly more abrupt increase and decrease because the probit is the corresponding quantile function the probit function can be applied to determine prior constraints based on proportions of the growth period as we did for the logistic and beta distributions distributions with other features such as asymmetry e g gompertz beta kumaraswamy or flexible tails e g the t distribution could also be used although these typically require estimation of more than two parameters or additional assumptions appendix c it is important to note that we applied the gpm in the context of northern hemisphere animals with winter dormancy for which it is reasonable to assume that no growth is occurring at year boundaries 31 december 01 january this assumption may also apply to species that experience winter cessation of growth in the absence of hibernation such as some marine turtles snover and hohn 2004 and species undergoing obligate estivation during the austral summer e g western swamp turtles pseudemydura umbrina arnall et al 2019 other populations for which calendar year boundaries occur during the active season could be accommodated by modifying our approach to

24664,modeling somatic growth of animals whose growth rates are seasonally variable is a challenge seasonal variation in growth reduces model fit and precision if not accounted for and ad hoc adjustments to growth models may be biased or biologically unrealistic we developed a growth phenology model gpm that uses a logistic function to model the cumulative proportion of total annual growth we applied this model using two different approaches to datasets from temperate climate populations of two freshwater turtle species that experience extended winter dormancy during which no growth occurs the first dataset consisted of repeated intra annual observations of sub adult snapping turtles chelydra serpentina tracked by radio telemetry which we analyzed in a bayesian context focusing on growth over a single season we then demonstrated a post hoc combination of the fitted gpm with a separate overall growth model for the second application we fully integrated the gpm into a hierarchical von bertalanffy growth model which we applied to a dataset of primarily inter annual observations of juvenile midland painted turtles chrysemys picta marginata specifying informative priors allowed us to fit the model despite the sparseness of intra annual information in the data we also demonstrate using the beta cumulative distribution function as an alternative to the logistic function in the gpm we discuss incorporating prior knowledge about seasonal foraging and activity periods into growth models via a gpm as a transparent alternative to deterministic implicit a priori

2018 under standard growth models the predicted growth of an animal over a time interval depends only on the animal s current size and the duration of the interval wang and jackson 2000 however growth will also depend on the environmental conditions over the interval and these are expected to vary seasonally therefore modeling somatic growth in long lived ectotherms is a challenge when growth rates are seasonally variable failure to account for seasonal variation in growth reduces model fit and precision lindeman 1997 spence and turtle 2017 seasonal biases in observation interval duration can result in biased growth estimates schmid 1995 and ad hoc adjustments to growth models may be biologically unrealistic fig 1 some authors resort to discarding a subset of data to avoid discrepancies due to unmodelled seasonal differences among observations bjorndal et al 2013 chessman 2018 krueger et al 2011 samson 2003 seminoff et al 2002 approaches to handling seasonal variation can include i modeling growth as a function of a measured environmental covariate such as temperature which is integrated into the growth function itself e g arnall et al 2019 kielbassa et al 2010 or indirectly by defining growing degree days e g snover et al 2015 or ii seasonality can be handled by using a model of annual growth phenology within the latter general approach specific strategies include fig 1

the growth model by including an oscillating sine function e g koch et al 2007 ogle 2017 pitcher and macdonald 1973 somers 1988 reviewed in akamine 2009 also see technical note garcía berthou et al 2012 most herpetological growth models rely on either completely implicit seasonal models or the ignore as error approach in many temperate climate ectotherm populations feeding occurs during a limited annual window that may not be equivalent to the duration of the general activity season an often unstated assumption is that either the activity season or a narrower annual foraging window is an adequate proxy for the timing and duration of growth the implicit approach makes the additional assumption that the growth rate is uniform during this period implicit models are typically applied by transforming observation dates into a continuous variable defined relative to the start and end of the activity season this transformation may be implemented during initial data processing so that the implied model and its assumptions are not usually considered part of a formal growth model an exception is smith et al 2010 who include the start and end points for the non growing season as explicit parameters which were estimated using the growth data along with the other growth model parameters the use of oscillating functions in growth models is well established in fisheries science and versions of these models are available in several stock assessment software packages such as tropfishr mildenberger et al 2017 and fishmethods nelson 2018 typically oscillating growth functions do not accommodate prolonged periods of zero growth and fitting them to such data can result in apparent negative growth size decreases at certain times of year pauly et al 1992 however models adding a no growth time term to prevent this have been developed ogle 2017 pauly et al 1992 wang and jackson 2000 lindeman 1997 simply rescaled the time term to exclude the winter period before fitting an oscillating model to produce a non linear implicit model of growth in juvenile painted turtles chrysemys picta here we present a simple flexible conceptual framework for combining a model of lifetime somatic growth such as the von bertalanffy vb with a model of the seasonal timing of growth growth phenology model gpm this approach allows more precise modeling of seasonally variable growth by explicitly incorporating the timing of seasonal changes in growth rate including prolonged dormant periods without growth fitted to the observed data we also demonstrate a strategy for specifying biologically meaningful priors on seasonal component parameters we first develop and illustrate a logistic gpm focusing only on growth within a single season in the context of repeated intra annual observations of juvenile snapping turtles chelydra serpentina we then construct a model of growth over multiple years by fitting a combined gpm and vb model to a dataset of primarily inter annual mark recapture observations of midland painted turtles c picta marginata 1 1 study site and species both our snapping and painted turtle datasets were collected during long term field studies carried out

activity occurs between early may and mid september lefevre and brooks 1995 obbard and brooks 1981 rollinson and brooks 2007 algonquin park female snapping turtles lay one clutch of eggs per year once they reach 24 cm carapace length at approximately 15 to 20 years of age yoa armstrong and brooks 2013 galbraith et al 1989 keevil et al 2018 median male snapping turtles are 1 2 longer and 1 8 heavier

male painted turtles mature at 7 to 10 yoa at a plastron length typically 8 5 cm samson 2003 females reach maturity at an average plastron length of 13 cm between 12 and 15 yoa after which they nest

phenology model gpm in temperate climate turtles growth in body length within a single season has rarely been quantified but there is evidence that it may be approximately sigmoidal ernst 1971 keller et al 1997 lindeman 1999 1997 sexton 1965 following lindeman 1997 we used a logistic function appendix a secition1 eq a 1 to model seasonal growth 1 δ l i j a i 1 exp g 1 b s i j ϵ i j where δ l i j is the change in length relative to the first measurement of the season for observation j of individual i and s i j is the fraction of the year elapsed by observation j of individual i b g and a i are parameters of the logistic function to be estimated b is the inflection point the fraction of the year when half the growth has occurred and g is the logistic rate parameter that determines how quickly growth occurs a i is the total increase in length over the growing season relative to the initial size of individual i so that a i is a property of individuals rather than seasonal variation in growth rate ϵ i j n 0 σ e 2 is the normally distributed residual error 2 1 fitting the logistic gpm to seasonal growth of snapping turtles we analyzed within season growth using previously unpublished observations of juvenile and young adult snapping turtles tracked by vhf radio telemetry during 2013 and 2014 snapping turtles were captured in may from canoe by hand or dip net in baited hoop traps or by hand during terrestrial movements as part of sampling for the long term algonquin park snapping and painted turtle life history projects turtles were fitted with model a2480 3 6 g or model r1920 16 g transmitters advanced telemetry systems ats isanti minnesota usa depending on turtle size transmitters were attached using epoxy to the posterior lateral portion of the carapace and the transmitter and glue combined to weigh less than 5 of body mass in all cases five radio tracked adults that did not show appreciable growth were excluded from the analysis one juvenile was excluded because it was removed for successful veterinary treatment of a suspected infection at the transmitter attachment site the remaining 11 snapping turtles carapace length cl range 11 09 29 65 cm were radio located on foot or from canoe once every 14 days mean from may through august and once more in mid september 2013 or early october 2014 turtles were initially captured in or adjacent to seven different water bodies and most movements were within contiguous habitat patches however two individuals were initially captured during overland movements and one moved again to another water body during the active season three individuals transitioned to small adjacent wetlands in late august prior to hibernation when feasible turtles were recaptured from canoe by wading or by snorkeling and straight midline cl was measured using vernier calipers to the nearest 0 1 mm snapping turtles were often unavailable for capture due to their frequent retreat to inaccessible habitat features such as beaver lodges bank burrows or areas under floating bog mats we measured size on 52 of 90 observation occasions including initial capture we only analyzed data from one field season for each individual we parameterized the data as within season growth by subtracting the first measurement of the season for each individual from subsequent measurements first measurements were taken between 6 may and 31 may because we could not assume that no growth occurred before then we modified eq 1 by adding a second term to account for missed growth δ l i j a i 1 exp g 1 b s i j a i 1 exp g 1 b s i 1

logistic gpm with intra annual data we fitted the gpm using the bayesian updating software jags version 4 2 0 plummer 2003 implemented in r version 4 0 2 r development core team 2018 using the r2jags package version 0 6 1 su and yajima 2020 we specified a i as a fixed effect of individual i and b and g as single population level parameters additionally we constructed a model with b i and g i as individually varying random effects appendix b but this more complex model was not an improvement as judged by dic deviance information criterion spiegelhalter et al 2002 a similar model can be fitted using maximum likelihood for example by using the r package nlme however bayesian fitting is advantageous here because it allows for informative priors to be specified based on common sense biological and climatic constraints informative priors can improve precision of the posterior parameter estimates especially when the sample size is small e g link and barker 2010 informative priors often take the form of a pert program evaluation and review technique distribution malcolm et al 1959 which is a beta distribution fitted to data elicited from experts on the most likely value and minimum and maximum constraints vose 2000 snapping turtles in algonquin park are typically active from early may through september with foraging occurring between late may and the end of august obbard and brooks 1981 mean temperatures in the study area peak in mid july environment and climate change canada 2020 we used this information to formulate a prior for parameter b which corresponds to the midpoint and maximum rate of increase of the logistic function by specifying a pert distribution with a minimum of 15 may a most likely value mode of 15 july and maximum of 1 september which is b p e r t 0 37 0 54 0 67 on the year fraction scale to specify a biologically interpretable prior on parameter g we noted that the logistic function is also the cumulative distribution function cdf for the logistic probability distribution which in turn has quantile function q p b g ln p 1 p where p is the probability the quantile function enabled us to conceptualize g in terms of the proportion of growth accumulating within a time frame we proposed that accruing 90 of annual growth in only three weeks 21 days would be a conservative upper limit on growth rate relative to the length of the active season which is ca 5 months obbard and brooks 1981 therefore δ s 21 days 0 0575 yr q p 2 0 95 q p 1 0 05 and solving for g reveals that b cancels out and 3 g δ s ln p 2 1 p 2 ln p 1 1 p 1 21 365 2422 ln 0 95 1 0 95 ln 0 05 1 0 05 0 0098 we used eq 3 to determine that when g 0 085 it would take six months to complete 90 of growth which we took as a conservative constraint on the minimum growth rate we proposed a most likely value of g 0 043 corresponding to the 76 days between 31 may and 15 august resulting in the prior g p e r t 0 0098 0 043 0 085 we treated the individually varying annual increment parameter a i as a fixed effect with prior a i u 0 5 to constrain mean annual growth between 0 and 5 cm 95 of growth trajectories are not expected to exceed ca 3 cm year armstrong and brooks 2013 individual growth was highly variable in part because individuals varied in sex and starting size we could have implemented a more informative prior along with a random effects data structure based on the model of armstrong and brooks 2013 but the present procedure is more generalizable to the typical case where a detailed population specific growth model has not yet been implemented the directed acyclic graph of the model structure is shown in fig 2 a we ran three mcmc markov chain monte carlo chains for 110 000 iterations and discarded the first 10 000 as burn in we assessed convergence using the gelman rubin diagnostic r 1 1 brooks and gelman 1998 and inspection of trace plots of monitored parameters we performed posterior predictive checking by calculating the sum of squares ssq of residuals and comparing these to ssq of datasets simulated based on the model at each mcmc iteration we made these comparisons using a bayesian p value p b and by visually inspecting the scatterplot gelman et al 2004 the logistic gpm parameters all showed good convergence and the posterior predictive check indicated adequate fit p b 0 475 where values far from 0 5 suggest inadequate fit for the chosen discrepancy measure gelman et al 2004 the total annual growth a i varied among individuals range 0 26 1 84 cm fig 2b if a i is factored out the fitted function describes the proportion of the total annual growth predicted to have occurred by time s based on parameters b and g table 1 fig 2c fig 3 demonstrates that time can be rescaled to reflect the proportion of annual growth predicted to have occurred by each point in the year based on the estimated parameter means table 1 95 of annual growth was accrued by 23 july fig 2c which is only 64 of the way through the foraging period fig 1 this differs markedly from the timing of growth predicted if growth is assumed to be linear over the presumed active or foraging periods fig 1 several studies on this and other turtle species have reported reduced foraging activity or reduced growth later in the season despite warm temperatures ernst 1971 keller et al 1997 lindeman 1997 obbard and brooks 1981 sexton 1965 additionally food intake at the beginning and end of the active season may be allocated to recovering from or preparing for periods of negative energy balance aphagic periods before during and after hibernation rather than growth crawford 1994 jackson and ultsch 2010 3 adding the logistic gpm to a von bertalanffy growth function to this point we have not modelled a within year effect of body size on growth rate that is we assumed that over a single season slower growth with increasing size was adequately accommodated by among individual year differences in annual growth increment a i this simplification is reasonable as a starting point for snapping turtles in algonquin park because each growing season comprises only a small fraction of individuals lifetime growth trajectory armstrong and brooks 2013 to explicitly integrate the seasonal model into an overall somatic growth model we conceptualized the logistic gpm as a scaling modification for time this suggests an intuitive way to incorporate the logistic gpm into a somatic growth model like the von bertalanffy vb model by including it within the time term spence and turtle 2017 take a similar approach but without defining a continuous seasonal model and they point out that the somers 1988 version of the seasonal vb model can also be conceived this way a typical formulation of the length at age vb model is that of beverton and holt 1957 4 l i j l 1 exp k t s i j t 0 where l is the asymptotic size parameter k is the rate parameter t s i j is age at observation j of individual i and t 0 is the hypothetical age before birth when length is 0 which we treated as a population level parameter in our notation we used y s for time variables measured in decimal calendar years and t s for age measured in decimal years of age table 2 we symbolized the seasonal logistic gpm as function f s applied to year fraction 0 s 1 and as function f y s applied to y s which includes whole number years table 2 see appendix a sections a 1 and a 2 for derivations to add the seasonal model we focused on the time term of eq 4 δ t t s i j t 0 which we modified to apply the logistic gpm using function f so that the time difference is quantified on the gpm scale therefore an integrated vb and logistic gpm model is 5 l i j l 1 exp k f t s i j s h f t 0 s h where s h is year fraction at hatching we have made the simplifying assumption that all hatching occurs at the same time every year september 15 which is the middle of the hatching period riley et al 2014 in which case s h is a population level parameter because each year of age begins at s h instead of 0 on the calendar scale the function of this parameter is to shift age variables so that a fraction of a year of age aligns with fractions of a calendar year before applying the logistic gpm transformation see appendix a section a 2 for details of our derivation figs 3 c and 3d show a version of the combined vb and logistic gpm model plotted using different scales with years the same in both cases but fractions of years represented as either linear age t s or as growth phenology age expected proportion of annual growth accrued which we denoted as t p eq a 9 table 2 fig 3 illustrates that the form and parameters of the overall growth model can be treated independently from the particulars of the gpm 3 1 incorporating seasonal growth into the interval form of the von bertalanffy model the interval parameterization of the vb model fabens 1965 can be written using notation as in table 2 6 l i j l l l i j 1 exp k y s i j y s i j 1 this form is also called the recapture parameterization and is used to fit the vb model to recapture data without relying on known age as we did for the size at age vb function we modified the time terms to incorporate the logistic gpm l i j l l l i j 1 exp k f y s i j f y s i j 1 which we can express in the y p notation table 2 signifying the logistic gpm scale 7 l i j l l l j 1 exp k y p i j y p i j 1 3 2 enforcing intercepts within our conception of the seasonal model it is desirable that the proportion of annual growth p approaches 0 at the start and 1 at the end of each annual period s 0 and s 1 respectively this is approximately satisfied for the fitted logistic model of seasonal growth in snapping turtles however in some situations such as a frequentist analysis or bayesian analysis with more diffuse priors it is conceivable that the unmodified logistic gpm could produce unanticipated or unrealistic output under certain parameter combinations figure a 1 we have applied two approaches to this problem in appendix c we replace the logistic function with the beta cdf which is constrained to return values from 0 to 1 over the range 0 1 this gave very similar results to the approach presented here which is to rescale the logistic function given a linear proportion of year s the following modification of the logistic gpm f s standardizes the output so that p intersects 0 at the start and 1 at the end of each annual period 8 f s f s f 0 f 1 f 0 p and f y s y f s y p where function f accommodates year fractions s combined with whole years y the standardized and unstandardized versions of the logistic gpm function are compared in figure a 1 4 fitting the combined model to painted turtle recaptures for the snapping turtle dataset above we added the seasonal logistic gpm component to an overall growth model after estimating the gpm parameters g and b separately using an ancillary data set here we demonstrate fitting the combined model to a primarily inter annual recapture dataset for a different species of freshwater turtle painted turtles also living in algonquin park compared to the vb model without an explicit seasonal component this comes at the cost of an increase in model complexity due to having to estimate two additional parameters b and g in the frequentist framework however incorporating prior information can reduce the increase in complexity in bayesian analysis spiegelhalter et al 2002 4 1 painted turtle dataset the recapture dataset was collected in algonquin provincial park as part of a long term life history study to focus on illustrating the seasonal component we only included observations of juveniles l 8 6 cm to avoid complicating the model by incorporating effects of sex and maturity we excluded unknown age individuals with only one juvenile observation because these cases were not informative for the model one pronounced outlier which had a residual that was more than double the next largest value was detected after fitting the model we removed this observation which was inconsistent with other observations of the same individual before refitting the model the remaining data consist of 658 midline plastron length observations of 158 juvenile painted turtles collected between 1991 and 2017 with a median interval of 1 year min 3 days max 3 years aquatic sampling for the painted turtle project is primarily conducted during the pre nesting period and focuses on among year recaptures as a consequence of the 658 juvenile observations we analyzed only 13 were made in the same year as a previous observation of the same individual and only 44 were made after 31 may by fitting a seasonal model to these data we endeavoured to assess whether our approach could be applied in cases without directed within year sampling juvenile painted turtles can be confidently aged using scute rings for a few years after hatching brooks et al 1997 lindeman 1997 we incorporated known age information for 28 individuals whose age could be determined at first capture and for which contemporaneous photographs verifying growth ring counts were available we also applied a separate dataset of hatchling observations to estimate variation in size at hatch described below 4 2 hierarchical von bertalanffy model we adapted the armstrong and brooks 2013 hierarchical formulation of the vb model which differs from the conventional vb model eq 4 and 6 by including among individual variation in parameter estimates armstrong and brooks 2013 also replaced k i with k i l i which decouples individual variation in growth rate and asymptotic size because we did not include adult size observations among individual variation in l i was not well estimated the mcmc chains for hierarchical mean and sd parameters did not converge in preliminary runs so we treated l as a single parameter without individual variation incorporating these features along with the logistic gpm into the vb interval formulation eq 7 results in the model l i j l l l i j 1 exp k i l y p i j y p i j 1 ϵ i j where k i ln n μ k σ k 2 is the individually varying rate parameter ϵ i j is the residual error with distribution n 0 σ e 2 and y p i j f y s i j eq 8 is time of observation j of individual i adjusted using the standardized logistic gpm function with parameters b and g which are estimated from the data along with the vb parameters in the jags code we used the equivalent parameterization 9 l i j n μ l i j σ e 2 μ l i j l l l i j 1 exp k i l y p i j y p i j 1 4 2 1 seasonal model parameters the painted turtle activity season is similar in timing to that experienced by snapping turtles as both populations occur in algonquin park with foraging occurring primarily between late may and the end of august lefevre and brooks 1995 rollinson and brooks 2007 we therefore used the same priors b p e r t 0 37 0 54 0 67 and g p e r t 0 0098 0 043 0 085 for the painted turtle data to assess identifiability and prior sensitivity of the seasonal component parameters we refitted the model using uniform priors constrained over the same ranges b u 0 37 0 67 and g u 0 0098 0 085 we did not model individual variation in these parameters because most individuals were not captured more than once per season 4 2 2 known age individuals and hatching size data for known age individuals we used the same interval formulation that we applied to the recapture data eq 9 with the first observation paired with inferred size and time of hatching to create the first interval in these cases l i j 1 l h i unobserved hatching plastron length for individual i and y p i j 1 f y h s h i time of hatch incorporating the logistic gpm we assumed a standard hatching date of 15 september s h 0 706 which is in the middle of the hatching period although painted turtle hatchlings often delay emergence from the nest chamber until the following spring fall emergence is not uncommon in algonquin park populations riley et al 2014 fall and spring emergence episodes are separated by the cold period when significant somatic growth is not expected regardless of overwintering strategy so we do not anticipate substantial differences in growth rates between strategies l h i was not observed for any of the individuals in our growth dataset so we assumed that for each individual l h i was drawn from a random distribution of hatchling sizes we used size at hatching data from the algonquin park study populations hughes and brooks 2006 riley et al 2014 riley and litzgus 2013 to estimate the parameters of the hatchling size distribution we used a hierarchical model fit to plastron length observations of 632 hatchlings from 140 clutches where the length of hatchling h within in each clutch c is normally distributed around the within clutch mean as h l h n μ h c σ h 2 and clutch means are themselves normally distributed across the population as μ h c n μ c σ c 2 therefore applying the law of total variance we modelled the distribution of l h i as l h i n μ c σ h 2 σ c 2 because we used the interval formulation the vb parameter t 0 is not part of the likelihood and does not need to be estimated during model fitting however some form of t 0 is necessary for plotting the length at age or length vs time vb curve for known age individuals we calculated individual t 0 i t 0 i on the gpm transformed age scale as a derived parameter appendix a section a 3 4 2 3 integrated model we combined the hierarchical vb hatchling size and seasonal components into an integrated model the directed acyclic graph of the model structure is shown in fig 4 we specified uninformative priors for all parameters except b and g in the seasonal component we ran the model in jags to sample 110 000 mcmc draws for each of three chains before discarding 10 000 as burn in and thinning by 10 we assessed convergence using the gelman rubin diagnostic r 1 1 brooks and gelman 1998 and inspection of trace plots of monitored parameters we performed posterior predictive checking by calculating the sum of squares ssq of residuals and comparing these to ssq of datasets simulated based on the model at each mcmc iteration we made these comparisons using a bayesian p value p b and by visually inspecting the scatterplot gelman et al 2004 we assessed identifiability of the gpm parameters by estimating prior posterior overlap τ for b and g gimenez et al 2009 calculated as in keevil 2020 4 3 painted turtles fitted model results convergence was achieved for all monitored parameters table 3 and the posterior predictive check indicated adequate fit based on the ssq discrepancy measure p b 0 497 under the less informative uniform distribution gpm parameter b was identifiable τ b 0 224 while g was weakly identifiable τ g 0 368 based on the τ 0 35 threshold of garrett and zeger 2000 appendix a section a 4 weak identifiability suggests that the posterior estimates may be informed substantially by the priors garrett and zeger 2000 gimenez et al 2009 however the differences in posterior distributions estimated under different prior specifications were negligible figure a 2 the logistic gpm for painted turtles fig 5 was estimated with less precision than the gpm for the intra annual observations of snapping turtles fig 2c this is unsurprising because while the snapping turtle dataset consisted of repeated observations of individuals within a growing season only a small subset of the painted turtle observations was informative for the seasonal component because the sampling was primarily annual nevertheless the gpm parameters were at least weakly identifiable even under a less informative uniform prior appendix a section a 4 figure a 3 our estimate of the length of the 90 growing season which we defined as the annual interval between 5 and 95 growth accumulation was substantially longer for painted turtles compared to snapping turtles table 4 we interpret this comparison with caution because these estimates were made using somewhat different models applied to data collected at different temporal scales however the direction of the difference is consistent with ecological differences between the two species painted turtles bask throughout the open water season to raise their body temperature and metabolic rate edwards and blouin demers 2007 rollinson et al 2008 rowe et al 2017 aerial basking by snapping turtles is comparatively infrequent albeit more common in algonquin park than at warmer sites obbard and brooks 1979 and snapping turtles often choose microhabitats that are cooler than the available maximum environmental temperatures brown et al 1990 rowe et al 2020 in michigan rowe et al 2020 2017 found that snapping turtles were less precise thermoregulators and that painted turtles maintained higher rates of thermal exploitation over a greater proportion of the active season the between species difference in the onset of growth quantified as 5 accumulated growth table 4 was a substantial component of the difference in overall growing season length that we estimated although male snapping turtles in algonquin park are very active in may while seeking mating opportunities females are significantly less active in may than in june july and august brown and brooks 1993 which is consistent with a late onset of feeding and growth that we inferred for snapping turtles in general if these differences in activity and thermal ecology are reflected in the timing of feeding assimilation and growth then they are congruent with the phenological differences implied by our fitted models 4 4 advantages of a bayesian gpm approach the integrated seasonal vb model is plotted for an example individual painted turtle with two observations in 2013 fig 6 on the standard time scale an observation made on 18 august 2013 is plotted near an earlier observation made 02 may in the same year fig 6a but on the gpm corrected scale the august observation is much closer to the third observation made on 12 may of the following spring fig 6b this example illustrates the seasonality correction provided by the logistic gpm component the horizontal error bars on observations in fig 6b indicate the quantification and propagation of uncertainty around the effect of season on growth i e growth phenology providing an advantage over implicit models which may afford some ability to correct for seasonality but cannot account for uncertainty in phenology relative to the common approaches to handle seasonal growth rate variation identified in the introduction ignore as error implicit oscillating sine etc using the logistic gpm to model seasonal variation in somatic growth has benefits that include quantification and propagation of uncertainty in growth phenology to somatic growth models biological realism due to gradual increase and decrease in growth rate at the beginning and end of the growing season accommodation of prolonged winter dormancy without appreciable growth incorporation of commonly available basic ancillary information about timing and duration of the active foraging season in the bayesian context does not require additional environmental covariates can be fitted to data with few intra annual observations given sufficiently informative bayesian priors timing and rate of seasonal growth are fit to data rather than being fixed before analysis although some of these features are present or can be added in some of the alternative approaches the logistic gpm or the beta gpm has the advantage of including them all within a fairly simple two parameter model the informative priors for the gpm parameters relied only on ancillary information about growth season duration because this type of information is frequently available and is already commonly used for implicit seasonal models in growth studies many ecologists avoid incorporating prior information especially when doing so may directly impact conclusions about focal hypotheses preferring instead to use vague priors or purely likelihood based methods banner et al 2020 however for many applications of somatic growth models seasonal variation in growth rate is not a theoretical focus instead the focus may be on estimating life history parameters or assessing effects of site or phenotype on growth over multiple years in this context growth phenology can be thought of as a nuisance component that nevertheless must be modelled to understand the overall growth process furthermore many applications already rely implicitly on prior information by defining growth time based on values chosen for the start and end of the growing season these implicit models further assume that growth is uniform within these rigid bounds we propose that formally including prior information into an explicit seasonal model such as the logistic gpm is a better approach because it is more transparent allows the observed data to influence the seasonal component and quantifies uncertainty and propagates it to the rest of the model 5 conclusions our analysis of within year snapping turtle growth indicated that the phenology of somatic growth in our study population differed substantially from the phenology inferred from the activity season which suggests that activity season delineations may not adequately characterize the somatic growth period this illustrates an advantage of our approach which allows observed data to influence the model of seasonal variation in growth rather than fixing it a priori as in implicit models our application of the logistic gpm to inter annual observations of painted turtle growth demonstrates integration of the seasonal model with an overall somatic growth model and illustrates that such a model can be fitted in the context of sparse seasonal growth data if prior information is included 5 1 potential extensions our application of the logistic gpm is flexible facilitating extensions to other situations one possibility is to apply our logistic gpm component to growth functions other than the vb model we do not anticipate any barrier to applying the gpm to the age or time interval term of somatic growth models such as richards gompertz or schnute a second possible extension is to replace the logistic function with a different cumulative proportion function in the gpm we illustrate this using the beta cdf in appendix c another possibility is the inverse probit function which also has two parameters to estimate and would behave similarly to the logistic function but with a slightly more abrupt increase and decrease because the probit is the corresponding quantile function the probit function can be applied to determine prior constraints based on proportions of the growth period as we did for the logistic and beta distributions distributions with other features such as asymmetry e g gompertz beta kumaraswamy or flexible tails e g the t distribution could also be used although these typically require estimation of more than two parameters or additional assumptions appendix c it is important to note that we applied the gpm in the context of northern hemisphere animals with winter dormancy for which it is reasonable to assume that no growth is occurring at year boundaries 31 december 01 january this assumption may also apply to species that experience winter cessation of growth in the absence of hibernation such as some marine turtles snover and hohn 2004 and species undergoing obligate estivation during the austral summer e g western swamp turtles pseudemydura umbrina arnall et al 2019 other populations for which calendar year boundaries occur during the active season could be accommodated by modifying our approach to include a phase shift constant within the time terms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
