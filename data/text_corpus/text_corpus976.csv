4880,we measured the concentrations of the total dissolved ions tdi dissolved silica major cations and the δd and δ18o at sub weekly intervals for one year in the okavango river at the outlet of the okavango delta delta our objectives were to 1 document the temporal variations in the concentrations of solutes in the okavango river 2 determine the processes controlling the transfer of solutes to the river and 3 assess the temporal solute load and outflux from the delta we found that the tdi and major cation concentrations in the river were anomalously high during the rainy season and before the arrival of the annual flood pulse the anomalous increases in the solute concentrations are due to dissolution and mobilization of precipitated salts stored in the floodplains and on hundreds of thousands of islands scattered across the delta wetlands as well as from flushing of remnant evaporated flood water of higher salinity trapped in isolated wetland pools overland flow generated by local rains and flooding connect the river to the solute stores in the watershed the temporally activated hydrologic flow pathways transfer solutes to the river that flushes them out of the delta the solute load in the river was higher during the rainy season and during pulse flooding and mimicked the discharge hydrograph we estimate that 17 838 mg y of dissolved solutes was flushed out of the delta with 67 removed during pulse flooding 6 months and 30 during the rainy season 4 months the transfer of solutes from the watershed to the river during pulse flooding and the rainy season and solute export from the delta is an important mechanism that keeps the delta s surface water resources fresh which is critical for supporting a freshwater wetland ecosystem our results highlight the importance of intermittent activation of hydrologic flow pathways in controlling solute cycling in this and other arid watersheds keywords okavango river solute transport solute load hydrologic connectivity endorheic basin botswana 1 introduction hydrologic connectivity between rivers and solute stores in watersheds is established by hydrologic flow pathways e g overland flow shallow subsurface flow and groundwater through which solutes can be transported to rivers the intermittent hydrologic connectivity between rivers and solute stores in watersheds is a major determinant of the types and amount of solutes delivered to rivers and controls the timing of when solutes from different solute stores are delivered to rivers boyer et al 1997 dalzell et al 2007 gooseff et al 2008 liu et al 2008 covino 2017 geeraert et al 2017 fovet et al 2018 duvert et al 2020 solute transfer to rivers and their transport in rivers in humid regions have been investigated extensively e g fovet et al 2018 herndon et al 2018 rose et al 2018 wymore et al 2020 liu et al 2020 because these rivers contribute to the ocean solute budget and are therefore considered important in the global cycling of solutes hope et al 1994 kanduč et al 2007 for instance a study by liu et al 2020 in the beipan river sw china revealed that during high discharge carbonate weathering becomes one of the dominant processes controlling river dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations and this provided insights into the role of hydrological variability on solute sources and river dic dynamics in a wet monsoonal climate although studies in humid regions have advanced our knowledge and understanding of solute sources solute mobilization and their transfer to rivers as well as solute export from watersheds similar studies in watersheds in arid environments particularly in endorheic basins seely et al 2003 still lag behind endorheic basins constitute 20 23 of the earth s surface nyberg et al 2018 and are characterized by solute cycling occurring entirely within the terrestrial system yapiyev et al 2017 despite the decoupling of solute cycling processes in endorheic basins from global oceanic solute cycle yapiyev et al 2017 the percentage of the land surface occupied by endorheic basins is the basis for the inference that significant amounts of solutes are transferred to and processed at the terminus of endorheic basins li 2014 sheng 2014 the solutes cycled within endorheic basins are a major determinant of the salinity status and ecological sustainability of wetland ecosystems often found at or near the terminus of endorheic basins sheng 2014 yet little is known about the delivery of solutes to rivers transportation of solutes and their storage at or near the basin terminus hence solute cycling in endorheic basins remains enigmatic knowledge on solute cycling in endorheic basins is pivotal for informing water management decision making in these basins where water scarcity is a major challenge understanding the role of rivers in solute cycling requires the assessments of the hydrologic transience controlled by water sources and the hydrologic flow pathways traveled by water to the river water source partitioning techniques using solutes e g total dissolved solids cations silica and stable water isotopes δd and δ18o have proven useful in deciphering the role of different hydrological flow pathways in delivering solutes to rivers koeniger et al 2009 ala aho et al 2018 horgby et al 2019 duvert et al 2020 the use of tracers to determine the origin of solutes and the timing of solute delivery to rivers is critical in refining our understanding of the processes controlling solute transport in rivers e g runkel and bencala 1995 oromeng et al 2020 and provides insights on catchment scale solute cycling e g darracq et al 2010 liu et al 2020 yet the application of solutes and isotopic tracers in understanding water source partitioning to rivers and tracing how solutes are exchanged between rivers and their watersheds in arid settings is not common oromeng et al 2020 we investigated the processes controlling solute transfer and transport of solutes in the okavango delta near the terminus of the endorheic okavango river basin orb the orb spans 530 000 km2 and overlaps climatic gradients from a higher rainfall temperate region in angola to the steppe middle kalahari desert in botswana e g ellery et al 2003 peel et al 2007 near the terminus of the orb in the middle kalahari desert the okavango river divides into several distributaries forming the okavango delta delta the delta is the largest freshwater wetland in southern africa mccarthy and ellery 1998 and is a ramsar world heritage site secretariat of the convention on wetlands 2017 the delta is unique because it is pristine and its hydrology is controlled by annual pulse flooding initiated by rains from the upper watershed in angola and by local rains e g wolski et al 2005 the delta is also characterized by high evapotranspiration rates mccarthy and ellery 1998 bauer 2004 bauer et al 2006 bauer gottwein et al 2007 which induce precipitation of salts on floodplains and on the numerous tree islands in the delta wetlands and concentrates solutes in isolated wetland pools scattered across the delta dincer et al 1979 mccarthy et al 1991 1998 gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 gumbricht et al 2004 yet the okavango river and the surface water in the delta wetlands remain fresh currently there is a lack of understanding of how and when the okavango river is connected to solute stores in the local delta watershed and how the river connectivity to the solute stores affects solute cycling and solute export from the delta as a freshwater riverine wetland ecosystem serving as an important source of potable water to the nearby communities mosepele et al 2006 2009 kgathi et al 2006 documenting the processes that may affect the solute behavior and consequently water quality in the delta is crucial additionally assessing the delta s temporal solute outflux provides insights on the processes that regulate the salinity of the delta surface water resources in this study we made sub weekly measurements of discharge total dissolved ions tdi major cations ca2 mg2 na k dissolved silica and δd and δ18o in the okavango river at the outlet of the okavango delta our objectives were to 1 document the temporal variations in the concentrations of solutes in the okavango river 2 determine the processes controlling the transfer of solutes to the river and 3 assess the temporal solute load and outflux from the delta we conducted our temporal investigation at the outlet of the delta in order to capture the integration of the processes controlling solute dynamics that affect the okavango delta and its wetlands our findings provide a baseline from which to monitor future temporal solute dynamics in the okavango delta and insights on solute cycling near the terminus of endorheic basins 2 the okavango delta 2 1 location the study site is located at the outlet of the okavango delta near the terminus of the orb the okavango delta consists of a panhandle region and a delta region fig 1 the panhandle is a narrow valley with a gradient of 1 5500 through which the okavango river meanders extensively mccarthy et al 1997 when the okavango river crosses the gumare fault at the end of the panhandle the river divides into distributary channels that form the delta region the delta region is a gently sloping 1 3400 alluvial fan with a surface area of more than 22 000 km2 mccarthy et al 1992 formed within the half graben of the okavango rift zone mccarthy et al 1993 1997 modisi et al 2000 kinabo et al 2007 2008 bufford et al 2012 leseane et al 2015 the topography of the okavango delta has been shaped by neotectonics river sedimentation channel formation and avulsion mccarthy and ellery 1994 mccarthy et al 1998 tectonism in the delta region caused overall regional tilting evidenced by varying elevations from 1025 m where okavango river flows into the delta at mohembo to 920 m in the mababe depression gumbricht et al 2001 the delta region is characterized by relatively flat topography mccarthy et al 1998 mccarthy 2006 with gentle undulations where the local relief rarely exceeds 2 m except for areas with termite mounds mccarthy et al 1998 gumbricht et al 2001 mccarthy 2006 2 2 geology the upper orb watershed cuito and cubango basins in angola lies on the precambrian congo craton the metamorphic rocks of the upper watershed formed during the precambrian include gneisses quartzites and migmatite bereslawski 1997 steudel et al 2013 large parts of the cuito basin and southern parts of the cubango basin are covered by sedimentary rocks of the karoo supergroup and overlain by thick layers of unconsolidated sands clays lime rock and lateritic layers of the kalahari superior formation bereslawski 1997 catuneanu et al 2005 jones 2010 the headwater region of the cubango river is characterized by crystalline bedrock comprising granite dolerite and porphyrite bereslawski 1997 in the region surrounding the okavango delta the bedrock geology consists of precambrian crystalline rocks of the damara and ghanzi chobe orogenic belt modie 2000 milzow et al 2009 the superficial geology consists of quaternary kalahari alluvium and recent swamp sediments ringrose et al 2009 overlying 40 m of sands and 105 175 m of lacustrine and fluvio deltaic sediments kalscheuer et al 2015 the lacustrine and deltaic sediments are remnants of the paleo lake makgadikgadi and paleo okavango megafan sedimentary units podgorski et al 2013 2015 kalscheuer et al 2015 2 3 climate and hydrology the orb s climatic regimes transition from a temperate climate in the angolan highlands to the steppe arid middle kalahari desert in botswana peel et al 2007 the climate of the upper watershed in angola and lower watershed in the delta is characterized by wet and dry seasons mccarthy and ellery 1994 milzow et al 2009 steudel et al 2013 the wet season spans from november to march and the dry season lasts from april to october the mean annual rainfall in the upper watershed is 1100 mm pombo et al 2015 the maximum daily temperatures vary between 22 and 24 c during the rainy season and decrease to 15 17 c during the dry season steudel et al 2013 the delta receives an average annual rainfall of 450 mm milzow et al 2009 the highest mean monthly maximum temperatures during the rainy season range between 32 and 35 c and the lowest mean monthly minimum temperatures during the dry season range between 2 and 7 c moses and gondwe 2019 the estimated potential evapotranspiration is 2172 mm y which is 4 times greater than the rainfall received in the delta wilson and dincer 1976 the hydrology of the delta is driven by an annual flood pulse derived from the upper watershed in angola and by local rains the precipitation that falls around october in the angolan highlands flows through the cubango river and cuito rivers and reach the northern part of botswana via the okavango river around february may mccarthy and ellery 1998 mccarthy et al 2003 wolski et al 2008 mackay et al 2011 after reaching the delta the flood pulse takes approximately 4 6 months to travel a river distance of 400 km from the proximal portion in mohembo to the distal portion at maun mccarthy and ellery 1998 as the flood advances across the delta the area inundated gradually increases from an annual low of 4500 6000 km2 to an annual high of 9000 12 000 km2 depending on the flood magnitude ramberg and wolski 2008 due to the relatively high hydraulic conductivity 10 30 m day and porosity 30 of the sandy soils in the delta obakeng and gieske 1997 as well as the slow propagation of the flood wave across the delta the flood inundation is accompanied by recharge of the shallow unconfined aquifer mccarthy 2006 thus the okavango river is influent as evidenced by the deepening of the groundwater table away from the delta wetlands mccarthy et al 1997 ellery et al 2003 mccarthy 2006 milzow et al 2009 akondi et al 2019 there are 150 000 islands complexes scattered across the delta these islands vary in shape and size from a few square meters to 700 000 m2 and cover 5 of the area of the permanent swamp 25 of the seasonal swamp and 50 of the occasionally flooded swamps mccarthy and metcalfe 1990 gumbricht et al 2004 humphries et al 2014 the trees and halophytic grasses which dominate the islands facilitate evapotranspiration driven flow of water from okavango river towards the islands gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 ramberg and wolski 2008 this evaporation as well as transpiration by vegetation on island fringes enhances the accumulation of salts in island fringes and centers gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 ramberg and wolski 2008 the island complexes are inundated by the annual flood pulse and periodically trap water which is then subjected to et and precipitate salts in the island centers during the rainy season when there is no flooding the seasonally and occasionally inundated wetland ecotones of the okavango delta are dominated by isolated surface water pools mccarthy et al 1998 caused by the accumulation of summer rains and previous year s floods these isolated wetland pools show enriched δ18o 0 1 7 5 induced by evaporation dincer et al 1979 mccarthy et al 1991 1998 3 methodology 3 1 sample collection and analyses this study was conducted between november 2017 and december 2018 during which we sampled the okavango river 23 28 48 99 e 19 57 16 77 s and rain 23 27 7 07 e 19 57 19 49 s in maun we collected 98 river samples and 51 rain samples the river samples were collected by the grab technique into 20 ml glass scintillation vials at sub weekly intervals rain samples were collected in a static collector and aliquots were transferred into 20 ml glass scintillation vials as soon as the rain event was over all the samples were protected from sunlight and kept in a cool storage the samples were transported to the university of delaware usa where they were filtered through 0 45 μm nylon syringe filters and refrigerated until analyses aliquots of the river samples were acidified with trace metal grade nitric acid and analyzed for cations by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer agilent tech icp ms 7500cx series total dissolved ions tdi was measured using an orion star a212 benchtop conductivity tds meter calibrated according to the manufacturer s instructions silica concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry on a chemetrics v 3000 series photometer the δ18o and δd of river and rain samples were measured using a los gatos research lgr liquid water isotope analyzer lwia the lgr lwia performed 6 injections per sample and the last 4 injections were averaged for the sample isotope value each batch run was calibrated with standard light antarctic precipitation slap2 and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standards and machine drift was verified by running a test sample and a select standard every 5th sample the isotope ratios are reported in delta notation δ in per mil δ r sample r standard r standard 1000 where r is the ratio of d h or 18o 16o in the sample and standard the δd and δ18o are reported relative to vsmow the precision 1σ standard deviation of the lgr lwia isotopic measurement is better than 0 3 for δd and 0 07 for δ18o 3 2 river discharge and solute load estimates river discharge q and water level measured at the maun thamalakane station 23 25 35 09 e 20 0 17 04 s were obtained from the botswana department of water and sanitation we developed a discharge rating curve from log water level m vs log discharge m3 s and obtained the least squares regression equation r2 0 74 n 17 1 log q m 3 s 3 9 l o g w a t e r l e v e l m 0 11 where q and the water level are the instantaneous

dissolved solids tds in mg l used in determining the solute load was obtained by adding the total dissolved ions tdi mg l and dissolved silica mg l e g gondwe et al 2017 we determined the instantaneous solute load isl i by multiplying the instantaneous tds concentration c i in mg l with the corresponding instantaneous discharge q i in l s e g aulenbach et al 2016 and assumed that the tds concentrations represent all the dissolved solutes in the river e g hem 1985 2 i s l i c i q i we estimated the daily solute loads dsl by summing the instantaneous solute load for each day the

maun is presented in table 4 4 1 temporal variations in solute concentrations tdi cations and silica on a temporal basis the concentrations of tdi fig 2 a showed similar temporal behavior to that of na fig 2b mg2 ca2 k and silica fig 2c the solute concentrations tdi na and silica increased from november 2017 to february 2018 fig 2a c in february 2018 the solute concentrations decreased precipitously and stayed low until the end of the rainy season in mid april 2018 near the start of the dry season in mid april there was a rapid increase in the solute concentrations which remained high until june 2018 after which the solute concentrations decreased to low values and fluctuated within a narrow range past the end of the dry season and into the rainy season in december 2018 the order of cation abundance measured in the okavango river in maun is na k mg2 ca2 the temporal behavior of the ratio of na ca2 show higher ratios between late february 2018 and late april 2018 increasing from 7 to 19 fig 2d during other times the na ca2 ratio remained low fluctuating between 5 and 10 4 2 temporal variations in river discharge and rainfall the hydrograph constructed from the least squares regression equation developed from discharge and water level data table 4 is shown in fig 2e on an annual basis the hydrograph shows two main peaks the hydrograph is asymmetric with steep rising limbs and more gentle falling limbs during the beginning of the rainy season the hydrograph was receding as river discharge decreased from 13 m3 s to 0 8 m3 s between november 2017 and early february 2018 a smaller discharge rise in february 2018 peaked at 3 5 m3 s in early march 2018 before slowly receding to 0 2 m3 s in june 2018 the discharge began to rise in june 2018 and peaked at 12 6 m3 s in august 2018 fig 2e the peak discharge was followed by a gradual recession from late august through december 2018 temporal rainfall distribution in the distal portion of the okavango delta in maun shows that between the 2017 and 2018 rainy season more rain fell during the second half of the rainy season between late january to april 2018 with about 80 of the season s rain falling during january to march fig 2f 4 3 temporal variations in air temperature during the rainy season between november 2017 and march 2018 the mean monthly air temperature fluctuated around 29 3 c fig 2g during the dry season in 2018 the mean monthly air temperature decreased from 24 c in april to the lowest temperature of 18 c in july after july 2018 the average monthly air temperature increased from near the end of the dry season continuously to a high of 34 c in december 2018 during the rainy season 4 4 temporal variations in the stable isotopic composition of river water and rain the δd and δ18o of river water co vary and we show the temporal δd variations in river water in fig 2h the δd was enriched during the first half of the rainy season from november 2017 to february 2018 with the highest value of 23 observed in december 2017 the δd decreased precipitously in mid february to about 43 and stayed low at 18 5 to the end of the rainy season in april 2018 the start of the dry season was marked by a sudden increase in the δd to a high of 4 which lasted from april to late may 2018 from june through december 2018 the δd increased continuously to a high of 26 the temporal variations of δd of rain shown in fig 2i indicates enrichment during the beginning of the rainy season in december 2017 with the highest δd value of 37 between january and march 2018 the δd varied around 60 30 the wide ranges in the isotopic composition of rain measured in this study have been reported in previous studies e g akondi et al 2019 verhagen 1992 mazor et al 1977 foster et al 1982 5 discussion 5 1 temporal shifts in solute concentrations in the okavango river our temporal assessment of the solute chemistry of the okavango river at the outlet of the okavango delta documents seasonal and sub seasonal variations in the concentrations of tdi cations and silica fig 2a c generally the concentrations of the different solutes increased continuously from the early rainy season in november 2017 to peak concentrations in the mid rainy season in february 2018 before decreasing markedly and staying nearly constant through the end of the rainy season in march 2018 the solute concentrations increased sharply in april 2018 and stayed nearly constant at higher concentrations until june 2018 after which the concentrations decreased sharply and then remained nearly constant through december 2018 the temporal variations in solute concentrations in the okavango river can be driven by 1 water column processes that enrich solutes e g et and weathering or reactions which remove solutes precipitation 2 addition of water with higher enrichment or lower dilution solute concentrations during river recharge and or 3 episodic transfer of solutes from solute stores in the watershed to the river 5 2 water column addition or removal of solutes in the okavango river 5 2 1 evapotranspiration et previous studies of the solute chemistry in the okavango river in the delta have suggested that et is the major process controlling the spatio temporal evolution of solutes e g sawula and martins 1991 mccarthy et al 1993 cronberg et al 1996 mladenov et al 2005 mackay et al 2011 akoko et al 2013 atekwana et al 2016 gondwe and masamba 2016 potential et in the delta exceeds precipitation by a factor of 4 wilson and dincer 1976 dincer et al 1979 and et is responsible for downriver enrichment in solutes from the proximal portion of the delta in mohembo to the distal portion in maun e g akoko et al 2013 gondwe et al 2017 increases in the tdi or ionic concentrations induced by et at a fixed river station should correspond to seasons such that high rates of et and higher solute concentrations are observed during the rainy season when temperatures are high and lower rates of et and lower solute concentrations are observed during the dry season when temperatures are cooler the anomalously higher tdi cations and silica concentrations during the mid rainy season fig 2a c occur when the air temperatures are high fig 2g however the high tdi cations and silica concentration anomalies at the beginning of the dry season in may 2018 fig 2a c occur when the air temperatures are lower fig 2g and are therefore inconsistent with evapoconcentration of solutes to determine the effect of evaporation in increasing the solute concentrations in the okavango river we first demonstrate evidence of its occurrence in river water during the evaporation of surface water isotopic fractionation causes enrichment in the δd and δ18o craig 1961 ehhalt et al 1963 dansgaard 1964 clark and fritz 1997 govender et al 2013 good et al 2014 the δd and δ18o composition of okavango river samples co vary fig 3 also shown in fig 3 is the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl the lmwl is constructed from the data published by akondi et al 2019 and data collected for rain in this study the δd and δ18o of samples from the okavango river lie below the gmwl and lmwl and along the okavango delta evaporation line odel consistent with previous studies which suggest that the okavango river undergoes evaporation during transit through the delta dincer et al 1979 atekwana et al 2016 akondi et al 2019 evidence for evapoconcentration in increasing solute concentrations in the river water was assessed from the relationship between tdi concentrations and d excess we use the d excess to characterize the effects of evaporation on river solute concentrations because lower d excess values indicate greater extent of evaporation e g dansgaard 1964 fröhlich et al 2002 huang and pang 2012 krishan et al 2020 we divided the discharge hydrograph fig 2e into major changing discharge regimes fig 4 a flood pulse recession november 2017 february 2018 and september 2018 december 2018 fig 4b rainy season dry season recession march 2018 june 2018 fig 4c flood pulse rise june 2018 august 2018 fig 4d and rainy season rise february 2018 march 2018 fig 4e in fig 4b e we show the log tdi concentrations vs d excess the model line black solid line d excess 93 2 log tdi 158 1 r2 0 99 and the upper and lower limits of the 95 confidence interval along the model line pink shaded region bounded by dashed lines were derived from okavango river water collected in maun and evaporated over time atekwana et al 2016 in principle there should be a negative relationship between log tdi concentrations vs d excess during evaporation e g huang and pang 2012 as shown by the model line with the data falling within 95 confidence interval pink shaded region data plotting outside to the right or the left of the 95 confidence interval indicate river water with tdi concentrations affected by other factors in addition to evapoconcentration the log tdi concentrations d excess modelling allows us to determine when additional factors affect the solute concentrations as the okavango river changes from one flow regime to another fig 4 during discharge recession november 2017 february 2018 september 2018 december 2018 fig 4b and march june 2018 fig 4c there are three solute regimes 1 a baseline solute regime dominated by evapoconcentration and characterized by data which lie along the model line within the 95 confidence interval region 2 a solute regime of highly evaporated water with low tdi concentrations characterized by data plotting to the left beyond the 95 confidence interval and 3 a solute regime with higher d excess where the data plot to the right and parallel to the 95 confidence interval for the rising discharge regime during annual flooding june august 2018 fig 4d 90 of the data lie within the 95 confidence interval indicating river baseline condition dominated by evaporative enrichment in contrast during the rising discharge in the rainy season february march 2018 fig 4e all the data plot in a cluster to the right of the 95 confidence interval signifying a different river solute regime from the model analysis we deduce that in addition to the baseline evapoconcentration of river water there are two other major processes that affect the solute regime of the okavango river one characterized by highly evaporated water with low tdi concentrations and another characterized by less evaporated water with low to high tdi concentrations since d excess indicates the extent of evaporation we posit that the same extent of evaporation should not result in wide ranges in tdi concentrations unless other river solute enrichment processes are at play transpiration which can change the tdi concentrations of river water will not affect the δd and δ18o composition because unlike evaporation transpiration does not cause isotopic fractionation e g walker and richardson 1991 thus although transpiration affects the solute concentrations which we are unable to quantify from our data we assumed that its effect on the river solutes is constant over space and time in the okavango delta and does not adversely affect river water differentially or episodically although studies of the solute chemistry in the okavango river in the delta have suggested that et is the major process controlling the spatio temporal evolution of solutes e g sawula and martins 1991 mccarthy et al 1993 masamba and muzila 2005 mladenov et al 2005 akoko et al 2013 mosimane et al 2017 mogobe et al 2018 the results of this study indicate that et is not solely responsible for the temporal solute perturbations observed in the okavango river at the exit of the delta we use the results of this study to suggest that the lower and nearly uniform solute concentrations observed between february 2018 and april 2018 and between june 2018 and november 2018 fig 2a c represent the baseline solute concentrations of the river at maun we make this suggestion because the concentration changes from this baseline occur slowly while perturbations from this baseline occur by sharp concentration increases for example tdi has a baseline concentration of 70 5 mg l and is nearly constant between january and mid april and decreases slowly from june through december fig 2a additionally if we assume that the transit time for river water to travel the 400 km from the entrance of the delta in mohembo to the exit at maun is constant et acting alone on the river water will result in similar temporary baseline concentration that will change in a relatively slow manner 5 2 2 weathering and precipitation reactions the addition or removal of solutes in the water column through dissolution or precipitation reactions can alter tdi cation and silica concentrations and depend on the saturation state with respect to mineral phases drever 1971 miller and drever 1977 hodson et al 2010 thermodynamic equilibrium models indicate that the okavango river is undersaturated with respect to solid mineral phases such as calcite aragonite and dolomite sawula and martins 1991 the undersaturated state of the okavango river favors mineral dissolution over precipitation and therefore we infer that the chemical removal of solutes from the water column through precipitation is unlikely to be one of the factors affecting the observed temporal solute behavior although the okavango river is undersaturated with respect to calcite aragonite and dolomite weathering of these mineral phases is not important because of their low abundance in sediments of the delta mccarthy and metcalfe 1990 huntsman mapila et al 2005 while there is certainly potential for mineral weathering in the water column because the delta receives 170 000 mg y of bed load and 39 000 mg y of suspended load mccarthy and ellery 1998 episodic weathering occuring only during the beginning of the rainy season and before the initiation of pulse flooding when solute concentrations are high fig 2a c is not a viable explanation for the periodic solute enrichment for instance silica is generated from quartz dissolution which is a thermodynamically slow process the quartz solubility at the temperatures and ph of okavango river water 25 c 6 3 is about 100 µm frings et al 2014 which is lower than dissolved silica concentrations measured during this study thus quartz dissolution is unlikely to occur episodically within the water column therefore we discount chemical weathering or precipitation in the okavango river water column to the observed seasonal and sub seasonal variations in river solute behavior 5 3 hydrologically driven episodic transport of solutes to the okavango river since the solute concentrations in the okavango river increase markedly during hydrologic perturbations we assess the role of hydrologic connectivity between the river and the watershed solute stores in the mobilization and transfer of solutes to the river we developed a conceptual model to illustrate how solutes at the surface can be transferred from the adjacent watershed consisting of floodplains wetlands and islands to the river and from groundwater fig 5 this conceptual model considers the role of the river in the accumulation of solutes in solute stores beyond the river channel and in groundwater and in the transfer of solutes from the solute stores to the river the solute stores fig 5a beyond the okavango river channel consist of 1 salt precipitates on floodplains and on island fringes and island centers that result from et gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 gumbricht et al 2004 ramberg and wolski 2008 2 post flood recession isolated wetland pools and wetland water subjected to et dincer et al 1979 mccarthy et al 1991 1998 and 3 saline groundwater ramberg and wolski 2008 mccarthy et al 2012 river access to the solute stores and the transfer of solutes to the river is established by temporal activation of hydrologic flow pathways connecting the river to the solute stores hydrologic connectivity between the river and the solute stores is via overland flow initiated during the rainy season fig 5b by flooding and return flow of flood waters following the annual pulse flooding and from groundwater influx fig 5c groundwater discharge to rivers in humid watersheds is an important source of solutes to rivers godsey et al 2009 liu et al 2020 rose et al 2018 in arid watersheds groundwater is an important source of solutes if groundwater supports rivers baskaran et al 2009 batlle aguilar et al 2014 imes and wood 2007 surface water groundwater interaction in the okavango delta has not been investigated extensively however on a regional basis the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater table steepens away from the river and floodplains mccarthy et al 1993 1998 ellery et al 2003 milzow et al 2009 making the okavango river and wetlands a potential source of groundwater recharge fig 6 a studies conducted in the okavango delta wetlands indicate river recharge of local groundwater during periods of flooding dincer et al 1979 gieske 1996 mccarthy 2006 groundwater recharge by the river appears to be prominent from an evaluation of the hydro stratigraphy from the lower okavango delta where our sampling station is located fig 6b groundwater levels near the sampling station are 5 m or more below the ground surface and groundwater flows towards the northeast and away from the middle of the delta fig 6b indicating river recharge of groundwater thangarajan et al 1999 mangisi 2004 furthermore the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of groundwater shows enrichment and lie on the trend of the okavango delta evaporation line akondi et al 2019 which is consistent with evaporated river recharge of groundwater although this notion of the absence of groundwater influence on the river chemistry is consistent with previous studies mccarthy et al 1993 ellery et al 2003 milzow et al 2009 akondi et al 2019 it is also possible to have input of groundwater with similar chemistry and isotopic composition to the river water spatially across the delta which complicates surface water groundwater interaction dynamics thus the groundwater behavior in the delta during hydrologic events and the dry season still need to be explored and constrained our study is unable to constrain the temporal groundwater response during different hydrologic regimes we tested our conceptual model using the relationship between total dissolved solids tdi silica in river water and river discharge c q relationship which provides insights into the mobilization and transfer of solutes from watersheds to rivers godsey et al 2009 chorover et al 2017 rose et al 2018 wymore et al 2020 in our evaluation we use the discharge regimes described in section 5 2 1 fig 7 a to model flow regime based c q relationships fig 7b e the c q relationship for the okavango river during the flood pulse recession for november 2017 february 2018 show solute enrichment with decreasing river discharge followed by dilution while river samples for the september 2018 december 2018 mostly cluster at lower solute concentrations fig 7b for the november 2017 february 2018 recession the continuous solute enrichment with decrease in the river discharge evident on the temporal plots of tdi cations and silica concentrations fig 2a c corresponds to highly enriched δd in river water fig 2h we interpret the concomitant shift to higher solute concentrations with decreasing discharge to mass transfer of solute enriched evaporated water from the wetlands into the river e g diamond and cohen 2018 herndon et al 2018 following the pulse flooding and dilution fig 7d this mixture of pulse floodwater and wetland water during return flow is characterized by a negative relationship between log tdi concentrations and d excess fig 4b previous studies have noted the existence of isolated saline wetland pools which are isotopically enriched within the seasonally and occasionally flooded wetland ecotones of the okavango delta dincer et al 1979 mccarthy et al 1991 1998 which serve as locations for solutes transported via return flow we note that during the september 2018 december 2018 the peak discharge from the flood pulse was 62 lower than in 2017 and the solute concentrations fig 2a c show only small variations while the δd slowly increased fig 2h the c q relationship shows scatter and low log c with decreasing log q fig 7b indicating that the flood pulse was of such a low magnitude that it was likely confined within the river channels the floodwater was subjected only to evaporation and was unmixed with higher solute concentration water from the wetlands as the flood receded consistent with the low d excess and tdi concentrations fig 4b the c q relationship of the okavango river during hydrograph recession in the late rainy season and early dry season march june 2018 fig 7a is characterized by a marked increase in solute concentrations in the middle of the recession followed by nearly constant solute concentrations and subsequent dilution fig 7c during the first half of the recession when the solute concentrations are low the na ca2 ratios indicate a shift in the type of solutes in the river because river water was getting progressively enriched in na relative to ca2 fig 2d we suggest that there is a hydrologic connection between the solute sources in floodplains and islands and the okavango river which provides solutes enriched in na mccarthy and metcalfe 1990 mccarthy et al 1991 and gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 indicate that chemical sedimentation caused by et of river and wetland water on the thousands of islands in the okavango delta include sodium carbonate salts trona thermonatrite thus although the overall river solute concentrations decrease from the dilution effect of rain fig 2a c fig 7c rain induced overland flow dissolves sodium salts from the floodplains and island which is then transferred to the river fig 2d fig 5b the c q relationship of the okavango river during increasing discharge from the pulse flooding in june august 2018 fig 7a is characterized by solute enrichment with increasing river discharge followed by solute dilution near peak flooding fig 7d during the period of slow solute concentration increases the log tdi concentrations vs d excess show data that cluster around the model line fig 4d additionally during the discharge increases na ca2 was flat and consistent with the baseline concentrations indicating the addition of evaporated river water with a similar proportion of ions to river water although the solute concentrations were slightly higher such enriched evaporated river water can come from the adjacent isolated wetland pools hosting isotopically enriched water dincer et al 1979 mccarthy et al 1991 1998 the water from the evaporated wetland pools is delivered to the river by the arriving flood pulse via the hydrologic piston model glover and johnson 1974 where old highly evaporated water enriched in solutes is pushed by the flood front during the arrival of new flood pulse fig 5c near the peak discharge fresh floodwaters arrive in maun causing a slight decrease in solute concentrations fig 7d we suggest hydrologic connection between the river and adjacent evaporated water in the wetlands since the flood magnitude was low in 2018 floodwaters were not sufficient to overtop the wetlands to flood the salt islands during the rainy season when river discharge increased in february 2018 march 2018 the c q relationship of the okavango river is characterized by a slight increase in solute concentrations followed by slight dilution near peak discharge fig 7e during this period of slow solute concentrations increases the data for the log tdi concentrations vs d excess are off to the right of the model line and clustered at low tdi concentrations and higher d excess fig 4e the low tdi concentrations are consistent with rain dilution and the higher d excess indicates lower evaporation effects nevertheless the na ca2 increased above baseline fig 2d indicating the mobilization of solutes rich in na from solute stores to the river by overland flow initiated by rain fig 5b 5 4 temporal solute load and solute flux from the okavango delta the instantaneous dissolved solute load estimated from tds concentrations tdi silica and discharge shows a bi annual distribution fig 8 a higher dissolved solute loads in the river are observed between july and november and between february and may although the solute load magnitudes are different the temporal variations in the instantaneous dissolved solute loads behave similar to river discharge fig 2e and are higher during high river discharge and lower during low river discharge this temporal behavior in solute load can be used to infer that increased discharge is associated with increase in solute concentrations yet increased discharge is from the annual pulse flooding and seasonal rains which are more dilute compared to the baseline chemistry of river water at maun this behavior in the temporal dissolved solute load is consistent with solute transfer from the floodplains island and evaporated isolated wetland pools discussed in section 5 3 during this study an annual dissolved solute flux of 17 838 mg was removed from the delta table 1 when examined on a monthly basis the solute flux mirrors the daily solute load fig 8b higher amounts of solutes leave the delta during the annual pulse flooding between july and november and during the rainy season in february through may for dissolved solute outflux from the okavango delta 67 leaves during pulse flooding 6 months 30 during the rainy season 4 months and 3 during the rest of the time 2 months the results of this study show that river discharge perturbations associated with the annual pulse flooding and rain are responsible for transferring 97 of the annual solute load removed from the delta via the okavango river 5 5 solute transport and cycling in the okavango delta the okavango delta is a solute store and sink and there is ample evidence of salt accumulation on the island edges and centers gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 zimmermann et al 2006 ramberg and wolski 2008 and in isolated evaporated saline wetland pools dincer et al 1979 mccarthy et al 1991 1998 yet the surface waters of the delta remain relatively fresh the pristine conditions of the delta have been attributed to the island salt sinking model which is a salt removal process controlled by density driven sinking of saline waters mccarthy and ellery 1994 bauer 2004 bauer gottwein et al 2007 ramberg and wolski 2008 in the island salt sinking model et concentrates salts in thousands of islands in the delta and then the saline water beneath islands sinks to greater depths due to density driven flow the island sinking salt model does not address the salt precipitates left as crust on the surface of the islands and floodplains we propose a hydrological flushing model as an additional mechanism that contributes to maintaining the pristine water quality condition of the okavango delta in the hydrologic flushing model the annual pulse flooding and seasonal rains dissolve salt precipitates on the floodplains and islands and transfer the solutes along with evaporated wetland water to the okavango river which is then transported out of the delta oromeng et al 2020 the solutes exported from the delta accumulate at the orb s terminus in the makgadikgadi pans a source for the salt mining sector in botswana molwalefhe 2003 6 conclusions and implications total dissolved ions major cations ca2 mg2 na k dissolved silica concentrations and the δd and δ18o of river water were used to investigate the processes controlling temporal solute behavior in the okavango river at the distal portion of the delta in the semi arid botswana our investigation showed that the temporal variability of solute concentrations in the delta is primarily controlled by the temporally changing hydrology pulse flood and rains and that these hydrological perturbations complement evapotranspiration during solute cycling solutes in the delta are cycled between the riverine solute pool and the islands floodplains and wetland pools enhanced solute transfer to the river occurs during hydrologic perturbations when hydrologic connectivity is established between the river and solute stores in floodplains islands and wetlands the results of this study also showed that 97 of the dissolved solutes export from the delta occur during the rainy season and during the annual pulse flooding the enhanced solute outflux from the delta during hydrologic perturbations indicate the significance of hydrologic events in flushing out solutes from the delta as a mechanism for maintaining the delta s pristine condition the periodic interception of river solutes by stores beyond the river act as transient solute storage and gives us insights into the existence of hydro geochemical hotspots and hot moments mcclain et al 2003 in the okavango delta floodplains salt islands and isolated wetland pools that accumulated solutes are hotspots compared to their surroundings the periods when solutes are transferred from the solutes stores to the river characterized by anomalously high solute concentrations in the river indicate hot moments of dissolved solute flux and export the hotspots and hot moments in the okavango delta have implications for the delta s ecological and water quality status due to the highly dynamic annual flooding regime in the okavango delta wolski et al 2008 wolski and murray hudson 2008 murray hudson et al 2014 the inter annual variability in solute concentrations and solute load in the okavango delta needs to be constrained we recognize that the river s chemical response will vary depending on flow magnitude and that our study may not capture the typical annual hydrochemical response or cover the range in the inter annual changes in river solute chemistry future work designed and conducted to investigate long term annual cycles will capture the extent to which the inter annual variability persists over the longer term additionally water samples collected at a frequency higher than in this study may provide greater constraints on the delta s hydrochemical processes oromeng et al 2020 credit authorship contribution statement goabaone j ramatlapeng methodology validation formal analysis investigation writing

4880,we measured the concentrations of the total dissolved ions tdi dissolved silica major cations and the δd and δ18o at sub weekly intervals for one year in the okavango river at the outlet of the okavango delta delta our objectives were to 1 document the temporal variations in the concentrations of solutes in the okavango river 2 determine the processes controlling the transfer of solutes to the river and 3 assess the temporal solute load and outflux from the delta we found that the tdi and major cation concentrations in the river were anomalously high during the rainy season and before the arrival of the annual flood pulse the anomalous increases in the solute concentrations are due to dissolution and mobilization of precipitated salts stored in the floodplains and on hundreds of thousands of islands scattered across the delta wetlands as well as from flushing of remnant evaporated flood water of higher salinity trapped in isolated wetland pools overland flow generated by local rains and flooding connect the river to the solute stores in the watershed the temporally activated hydrologic flow pathways transfer solutes to the river that flushes them out of the delta the solute load in the river was higher during the rainy season and during pulse flooding and mimicked the discharge hydrograph we estimate that 17 838 mg y of dissolved solutes was flushed out of the delta with 67 removed during pulse flooding 6 months and 30 during the rainy season 4 months the transfer of solutes from the watershed to the river during pulse flooding and the rainy season and solute export from the delta is an important mechanism that keeps the delta s surface water resources fresh which is critical for supporting a freshwater wetland ecosystem our results highlight the

al 2018 herndon et al 2018 rose et al 2018 wymore et al 2020 liu et al 2020 because these rivers contribute to the ocean solute budget and are therefore considered important in the global cycling of solutes hope et al 1994 kanduč et al 2007 for instance a study by liu et al 2020 in the beipan river sw china revealed that during high discharge carbonate weathering becomes one of the dominant processes controlling river dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations and this provided insights into the role of hydrological variability on solute sources and river dic dynamics in a wet monsoonal climate although studies in humid regions have advanced our knowledge and understanding of solute sources solute mobilization and their transfer to rivers as well as solute export from watersheds similar studies in watersheds in arid environments particularly in endorheic basins seely et al 2003 still lag behind endorheic basins constitute 20 23 of the earth s surface nyberg et al 2018 and are characterized by solute cycling occurring entirely within the terrestrial system yapiyev et al 2017 despite the decoupling of solute cycling processes in endorheic basins from global oceanic solute cycle yapiyev et al 2017 the percentage of the land surface occupied by endorheic basins is the basis for the inference that significant amounts of solutes are transferred to and processed at the terminus of endorheic basins li 2014 sheng 2014 the solutes cycled within endorheic basins are a major determinant of the salinity status and ecological sustainability of wetland ecosystems often found at or near the terminus of endorheic basins sheng 2014 yet little is known about the delivery of solutes to rivers transportation of solutes and their storage at or near the basin terminus hence solute cycling in endorheic basins remains enigmatic knowledge on solute cycling in endorheic basins is pivotal for informing water management decision making in these basins

transport of solutes in the okavango delta near the terminus of the endorheic okavango river basin orb the orb spans 530 000 km2 and overlaps climatic gradients from a higher rainfall temperate region in angola to the steppe middle kalahari desert in botswana e g ellery et al 2003 peel et al 2007 near the terminus of the orb in the middle kalahari desert the okavango river divides into several distributaries forming the okavango delta delta the delta is the largest freshwater wetland in southern africa mccarthy and ellery 1998 and is a ramsar world heritage site secretariat of the convention on wetlands 2017 the delta is unique because it is pristine and its hydrology is controlled by annual pulse flooding initiated by rains from the upper watershed in angola and by local rains e g wolski et al 2005 the delta is also characterized by high evapotranspiration rates mccarthy and ellery 1998 bauer 2004 bauer et al 2006 bauer gottwein et al 2007 which induce precipitation of salts on floodplains and on the numerous tree islands in the delta wetlands and concentrates solutes in isolated wetland pools scattered across the delta dincer et al 1979 mccarthy et al 1991 1998 gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 gumbricht et al 2004 yet the okavango river and the surface water in the delta wetlands remain fresh currently there is a lack of understanding of how and when the okavango river is connected to solute stores in the local delta watershed and how the river connectivity to the solute stores affects solute cycling and solute export from the delta as a freshwater riverine wetland ecosystem serving as an important source of potable water to the nearby communities mosepele et al 2006 2009 kgathi et al 2006 documenting the processes that may affect the solute behavior and consequently water quality in the delta is crucial additionally assessing the delta s temporal solute outflux provides insights on the processes that regulate the salinity of the delta surface water

okavango delta our objectives were to 1 document the temporal variations in the concentrations of solutes in the okavango river 2 determine the processes controlling the transfer of solutes to the river and 3 assess the temporal solute load and outflux from the delta we conducted our temporal investigation at the outlet of the delta in order to capture the integration of the processes controlling solute dynamics that affect the okavango delta and its wetlands our findings provide a baseline from which to monitor future temporal solute dynamics in the okavango delta and insights on solute cycling near the terminus of endorheic basins 2 the okavango delta 2 1 location the study site is located at the outlet of the okavango delta near the terminus of the orb the okavango delta consists of a panhandle region and a delta region fig 1 the panhandle is a narrow valley with a gradient of 1 5500 through which the okavango river meanders extensively mccarthy et al 1997 when the okavango river crosses the gumare fault at the end of the panhandle the river divides into distributary channels that form the delta region the delta region is a gently sloping 1 3400 alluvial fan with a surface area of more than 22 000 km2 mccarthy et al 1992 formed within the half graben of the okavango rift zone mccarthy et al 1993 1997 modisi et al 2000 kinabo et al 2007 2008 bufford et al 2012 leseane et al 2015 the topography of the okavango delta has been shaped by neotectonics river sedimentation channel formation and avulsion mccarthy and ellery 1994 mccarthy et al 1998 tectonism in the delta region caused overall regional tilting evidenced by varying elevations from 1025 m where okavango river flows into the delta at mohembo to 920 m in the mababe depression gumbricht et al 2001 the delta region is characterized by relatively flat topography mccarthy et al 1998 mccarthy 2006 with gentle undulations where the local relief rarely exceeds 2 m except for areas with termite mounds mccarthy et al 1998 gumbricht et al 2001 mccarthy 2006 2 2 geology the upper orb watershed cuito and cubango basins in angola lies on the precambrian congo craton the metamorphic rocks of the upper watershed formed during the precambrian include gneisses quartzites and migmatite bereslawski 1997 steudel et al 2013 large parts of the cuito basin and southern parts of the cubango basin are covered by sedimentary rocks of the karoo supergroup and overlain by thick layers of unconsolidated sands clays lime rock and lateritic layers of the kalahari superior formation bereslawski 1997 catuneanu et al 2005 jones 2010 the headwater region of the cubango river is characterized by crystalline bedrock comprising granite dolerite and porphyrite bereslawski 1997 in the region surrounding the okavango delta the bedrock geology consists of precambrian crystalline rocks of the damara and ghanzi chobe orogenic belt modie 2000 milzow et al 2009 the superficial geology consists of quaternary kalahari alluvium and recent swamp sediments ringrose et al 2009 overlying 40 m of sands and 105 175 m of lacustrine and fluvio deltaic sediments kalscheuer et al 2015 the lacustrine and deltaic sediments are remnants of the paleo lake makgadikgadi and paleo okavango megafan sedimentary units podgorski et al 2013 2015 kalscheuer et al 2015 2 3 climate and hydrology the orb s climatic regimes transition from a temperate climate in the angolan highlands to the steppe arid middle kalahari desert in botswana peel et al 2007 the climate of the upper watershed in angola and lower watershed in the delta is characterized by wet and dry seasons mccarthy and ellery 1994 milzow et al 2009 steudel et al 2013 the wet season spans from november to march and the dry season lasts from april to october the mean annual rainfall in the upper watershed is 1100 mm pombo et al 2015 the maximum daily temperatures vary between 22 and 24 c during the rainy season and decrease to 15 17 c during the dry season steudel et al 2013 the delta receives an average annual rainfall of 450 mm milzow et al 2009 the highest mean monthly maximum temperatures during the rainy season range between 32 and 35 c and the lowest mean monthly minimum temperatures during the dry season range between 2 and 7 c moses and gondwe 2019 the estimated potential evapotranspiration is 2172 mm y which is 4 times greater than the rainfall received in the delta wilson and dincer 1976 the hydrology of the delta is driven by an annual flood pulse derived from the upper watershed in angola and by local rains the precipitation that falls around october in the angolan highlands flows through the cubango river and cuito rivers and reach the northern part of botswana via the okavango river around february may mccarthy and ellery 1998 mccarthy et al 2003 wolski et al 2008 mackay et al 2011 after reaching the delta the flood pulse takes approximately 4 6 months to travel a river distance of 400 km from the proximal portion in mohembo to the distal portion at maun mccarthy and ellery 1998 as the flood advances across the delta the area inundated gradually increases from an annual low of 4500 6000 km2 to an annual high of 9000 12 000 km2 depending on the flood magnitude ramberg and wolski 2008 due to the relatively high hydraulic conductivity 10 30 m day and porosity 30 of the sandy soils in the delta obakeng and gieske 1997 as well as the slow propagation of the flood wave across the delta the flood inundation is accompanied by recharge of the shallow unconfined aquifer mccarthy 2006 thus the okavango river is influent as evidenced by the deepening of the groundwater table away from the delta wetlands mccarthy et al 1997 ellery et al 2003 mccarthy 2006 milzow et al 2009 akondi et al 2019 there are 150 000 islands complexes scattered across the delta these islands vary in shape and size from a few square meters to 700 000 m2 and cover 5 of the area of the permanent swamp 25 of the seasonal swamp and 50 of the occasionally flooded swamps mccarthy and metcalfe 1990 gumbricht et al 2004 humphries et al 2014 the trees and halophytic grasses which dominate the islands facilitate evapotranspiration driven flow of water from okavango river towards the islands gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 ramberg and wolski 2008 this evaporation as well as transpiration by vegetation on island fringes enhances the accumulation of salts in island fringes and centers gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 ramberg and wolski 2008 the island complexes are inundated by the annual flood pulse and periodically trap water which is then subjected to et and precipitate salts in the island centers during the rainy season when there is no flooding the seasonally and occasionally inundated wetland ecotones of the okavango delta are dominated by isolated surface water pools mccarthy et al 1998 caused by the accumulation of summer rains and previous year s floods these isolated wetland pools show enriched δ18o 0 1 7 5 induced by evaporation dincer et al 1979 mccarthy et al 1991 1998 3 methodology 3 1 sample collection and analyses this study was conducted between november 2017 and december 2018 during which we sampled the okavango river 23 28 48 99 e 19 57 16 77 s and rain 23 27 7 07 e 19 57 19 49 s in maun we collected 98 river samples and 51 rain samples the river samples were collected by the grab technique into 20 ml glass scintillation vials at sub weekly intervals rain samples were collected in a static collector and aliquots were transferred into 20 ml glass scintillation vials as soon as the rain event was over all the samples were protected from sunlight and kept in a cool storage the samples were transported to the university of delaware usa where they were filtered through 0 45 μm nylon syringe filters and refrigerated until analyses aliquots of the river samples were acidified with trace metal grade nitric acid and analyzed for cations by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer agilent tech icp ms 7500cx series total dissolved ions tdi was measured using an orion star a212 benchtop conductivity tds meter calibrated according to the manufacturer s instructions silica concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry on a chemetrics v 3000 series photometer the δ18o and δd of river and rain samples were measured using a los gatos research lgr liquid water isotope analyzer lwia the lgr lwia performed 6 injections per sample and the last 4 injections were averaged for the sample isotope value each batch run was calibrated

na fig 2b mg2 ca2 k and silica fig 2c the solute concentrations tdi na and silica increased from november 2017 to february 2018 fig 2a c in february 2018 the solute concentrations decreased precipitously and stayed low until the end of the rainy season in mid april 2018 near the start of the dry season in mid april there was a rapid increase in the solute concentrations which remained high until june 2018 after which the solute concentrations decreased to low values and fluctuated within a narrow range past the end of the dry season and into the rainy season in december 2018 the order of cation abundance measured in the okavango river in maun is na k mg2 ca2 the temporal behavior of the ratio of na ca2 show higher ratios between late february 2018 and late april 2018 increasing from 7 to 19 fig 2d during other times the na ca2 ratio remained low fluctuating between 5 and 10 4 2 temporal variations in river discharge and rainfall the hydrograph constructed from the least squares regression equation developed from discharge and water level data table 4 is shown in fig 2e on an annual basis the hydrograph shows two main peaks the hydrograph is asymmetric with steep rising limbs and more gentle falling limbs during the beginning of the rainy season the hydrograph was receding as river discharge decreased from 13 m3 s to 0 8 m3 s between november 2017 and early february 2018 a smaller discharge rise in february 2018 peaked at 3 5 m3 s in early march 2018 before slowly receding to 0 2 m3 s in june 2018 the discharge began to rise in june 2018 and peaked at 12 6 m3 s in august 2018 fig 2e the peak discharge was followed by a gradual recession from late august through december 2018 temporal rainfall distribution in the distal portion of the okavango delta in maun shows that between the 2017 and 2018 rainy season more rain fell during the second half of the rainy season between late january to april 2018 with about 80 of the season s rain falling during january to march fig 2f 4 3 temporal variations in air temperature during the rainy season between november 2017 and march 2018 the mean monthly air temperature fluctuated around 29 3 c fig 2g during the dry season in 2018 the mean monthly air temperature decreased from 24 c in april to the lowest temperature of 18 c in july after july 2018 the average monthly air temperature increased from near the end of the dry season continuously to a high of 34 c in december 2018 during the rainy season 4 4 temporal variations in the stable isotopic composition of river water and rain the δd and δ18o of river water co vary and we show the temporal δd variations in river water in fig 2h the δd was enriched during the first half of the rainy season from november 2017 to february 2018 with the highest value of 23 observed in december 2017 the δd decreased precipitously in mid february to about 43 and stayed low at 18 5 to the end of the rainy season in april 2018 the start of the dry season was marked by a sudden increase in the δd to a high of 4 which lasted from april to late may 2018 from june through december 2018 the δd increased continuously to a high of 26 the temporal variations of δd of rain shown in fig 2i indicates enrichment during the beginning of the rainy season in december 2017 with the highest δd value of 37 between january and march 2018 the δd varied around 60 30 the wide ranges in the isotopic composition of rain measured in this study have been reported in previous studies e g akondi et al 2019 verhagen 1992 mazor et al 1977 foster et al 1982 5 discussion 5 1 temporal shifts in solute concentrations in the okavango river our temporal assessment of the solute chemistry of the okavango river at the outlet of the okavango delta documents seasonal and sub seasonal variations in the concentrations of tdi cations and silica fig 2a c generally the concentrations of the different solutes increased continuously from the early rainy season in november 2017 to peak concentrations in the mid rainy season in february 2018 before decreasing markedly and staying nearly constant through the end of the rainy season in march 2018 the solute concentrations increased sharply in april 2018 and stayed nearly constant at higher concentrations until june 2018 after which the concentrations decreased sharply and then remained nearly constant through december 2018 the temporal variations in solute concentrations in the okavango river can be driven by 1 water column processes that enrich solutes e g et and weathering or reactions which remove solutes precipitation 2 addition of water with higher enrichment or lower dilution solute concentrations during river recharge and or 3 episodic transfer of solutes from solute stores in the watershed to the river 5 2 water column addition or removal of solutes in the okavango river 5 2 1 evapotranspiration et previous studies of the solute chemistry in the okavango river in the delta have suggested that et is the major process controlling the spatio temporal evolution of solutes e g sawula and martins 1991 mccarthy et al 1993 cronberg et al 1996 mladenov et al 2005 mackay et al 2011 akoko et al 2013 atekwana et al 2016 gondwe and masamba 2016 potential et in the delta exceeds precipitation by a factor of 4 wilson and dincer 1976 dincer et al 1979 and et is responsible for downriver enrichment in solutes from the proximal portion of the delta in mohembo to the distal portion in maun e g akoko et al 2013 gondwe et al 2017 increases in the tdi or ionic concentrations induced by et at a fixed river station should correspond to seasons such that high rates of et and higher solute concentrations are observed during the rainy season when temperatures are high and lower rates of et and lower solute concentrations are observed during the dry season when temperatures are cooler the anomalously higher tdi cations and silica concentrations during the mid rainy season fig 2a c occur when the air temperatures are high fig 2g however the high tdi cations and silica concentration anomalies at the beginning of the dry season in may 2018 fig 2a c occur when the air temperatures are lower fig 2g and are therefore inconsistent with evapoconcentration of solutes to determine the effect of evaporation in increasing the solute concentrations in the okavango river we first demonstrate evidence of its occurrence in river water during the evaporation of surface water isotopic fractionation causes enrichment in the δd and δ18o craig 1961 ehhalt et al 1963 dansgaard 1964 clark and fritz 1997 govender et al 2013 good et al 2014 the δd and δ18o composition of okavango river samples co vary fig 3 also shown in fig 3 is the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl the lmwl is constructed from the data published by akondi et al 2019 and data collected for rain in this study the δd and δ18o of samples from the okavango river lie below the gmwl and lmwl and along the okavango delta evaporation line odel consistent with previous studies which suggest that the okavango river undergoes evaporation during transit through the delta dincer et al 1979 atekwana et al 2016 akondi et al 2019 evidence for evapoconcentration in increasing solute concentrations in the river water was assessed from the relationship between tdi concentrations and d excess we use the d excess to characterize the effects of evaporation on river solute concentrations because lower d excess values indicate greater extent of evaporation e g dansgaard 1964 fröhlich et al 2002 huang and pang 2012 krishan et al 2020 we divided the discharge hydrograph fig 2e into major changing discharge regimes fig 4 a flood pulse recession november 2017 february 2018 and september 2018 december 2018 fig 4b rainy season dry season recession march 2018 june 2018 fig 4c flood pulse rise june 2018 august 2018 fig 4d and rainy season rise february 2018 march 2018 fig 4e in fig 4b e we show the log tdi concentrations vs d excess the model line black solid line d excess 93 2 log tdi 158 1 r2 0 99 and the upper and lower limits of the 95 confidence interval along the model line pink shaded region bounded by dashed lines were derived from okavango river water collected in maun and evaporated over time atekwana et al 2016 in principle there should be a negative relationship between log tdi concentrations vs d excess during evaporation e g huang and pang 2012 as shown by the model line with the data falling within 95 confidence interval pink shaded region data plotting outside to the right or the left of the 95 confidence interval indicate river water with tdi concentrations affected by other factors in addition to evapoconcentration the log tdi concentrations d excess modelling allows us to determine when additional factors affect the solute concentrations as the okavango river changes from one flow regime to another fig 4 during discharge recession november 2017 february 2018 september 2018 december 2018 fig 4b and march june 2018 fig 4c there are three solute regimes 1 a baseline solute regime dominated by evapoconcentration and characterized by data which lie along the model line within the 95 confidence interval region 2 a solute regime of highly evaporated water with low tdi concentrations characterized by data plotting to the left beyond the 95 confidence interval and 3 a solute regime with higher d excess where the data plot to the right and parallel to the 95 confidence interval for the rising discharge regime during annual flooding june august 2018 fig 4d 90 of the data lie within the 95 confidence interval indicating river baseline condition dominated by evaporative enrichment in contrast during the rising discharge in the rainy season february march 2018 fig 4e all the data plot in a cluster to the right of the 95 confidence interval signifying a different river solute regime from the model analysis we deduce that in addition to the baseline evapoconcentration of river water there are two other major processes that affect the solute regime of the okavango river one characterized by highly evaporated water with low tdi concentrations and another characterized by less evaporated water with low to high tdi concentrations since d excess indicates the extent of evaporation we posit that the same extent of evaporation should not result in wide ranges in tdi concentrations unless other river solute enrichment processes are at play transpiration which can change the tdi concentrations of river water will not affect the δd and δ18o composition because unlike evaporation transpiration does not cause isotopic fractionation e g walker and richardson 1991 thus although transpiration affects the solute concentrations which we are unable to quantify from our data we assumed that its effect on the river solutes is constant over space and time in the okavango delta and does not adversely affect river water differentially or episodically although studies of the solute chemistry in the okavango river in the delta have suggested that et is the major process controlling the spatio temporal evolution of solutes e g sawula and martins 1991 mccarthy et al 1993 masamba and muzila 2005 mladenov et al 2005 akoko et al 2013 mosimane et al 2017 mogobe et al 2018 the results of this study indicate that et is not solely responsible for the temporal solute perturbations observed in the okavango river at the exit of the delta we use the results of this study to suggest that the lower and nearly uniform solute concentrations observed between february 2018 and april 2018 and between june 2018 and november 2018 fig 2a c represent the baseline solute concentrations of the river at maun we make this suggestion because the concentration changes from this baseline occur slowly while perturbations from this baseline occur by sharp concentration increases for example tdi has a baseline concentration of 70 5 mg l and is nearly constant between january and mid april and decreases slowly from june through december fig 2a additionally if we assume that the transit time for river water to travel the 400 km from the entrance of the delta in mohembo to the exit at maun is constant et acting alone on the river water will result in similar temporary baseline concentration that will change in a relatively slow manner 5 2 2 weathering and precipitation reactions the addition or removal of solutes in the water column through dissolution or precipitation reactions can alter tdi cation and silica concentrations and depend on the saturation state with respect to mineral phases drever 1971 miller and drever 1977 hodson et al 2010 thermodynamic equilibrium models indicate that the okavango river is undersaturated with respect to solid mineral phases such as calcite aragonite and dolomite sawula and martins 1991 the undersaturated state of the okavango river favors mineral dissolution over precipitation and therefore we infer that the chemical removal of solutes from the water column through precipitation is unlikely to be one of the factors affecting the observed temporal solute behavior although the okavango river is undersaturated with respect to calcite aragonite and dolomite weathering of these mineral phases is not important because of their low abundance in sediments of the delta mccarthy and metcalfe 1990 huntsman mapila et al 2005 while there is certainly potential for mineral weathering in the water column because the delta receives 170 000 mg y of bed load and 39 000 mg y of suspended load mccarthy and ellery 1998 episodic weathering occuring only during the beginning of the rainy season and before the initiation of pulse flooding when solute concentrations are high fig 2a c is not a viable explanation for the periodic solute enrichment for instance silica is generated from quartz dissolution which is a thermodynamically slow process the quartz solubility at the temperatures and ph of okavango river water 25 c 6 3 is about 100 µm frings et al 2014 which is lower than dissolved silica concentrations measured during this study thus quartz dissolution is unlikely to occur episodically within the water column therefore we discount chemical weathering or precipitation in the okavango river water column to the observed seasonal and sub seasonal variations in river solute behavior 5 3 hydrologically driven episodic transport of solutes to the okavango river since the solute concentrations in the okavango river increase markedly during hydrologic perturbations we assess the role of hydrologic connectivity between the river and the watershed solute stores in the mobilization and transfer of solutes to the river we developed a conceptual model to illustrate how solutes at the surface can be transferred from the adjacent watershed consisting of floodplains wetlands and islands to the river and from groundwater fig 5 this conceptual model considers the role of the river in the accumulation of solutes in solute stores beyond the river channel and in groundwater and in the transfer of solutes from the solute stores to the river the solute stores fig 5a beyond the okavango river channel consist of 1 salt precipitates on floodplains and on island fringes and island centers that result from et gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 gumbricht et al 2004 ramberg and wolski 2008 2 post flood recession isolated wetland pools and wetland water subjected to et dincer et al 1979 mccarthy et al 1991 1998 and 3 saline groundwater ramberg and wolski 2008 mccarthy et al 2012 river access to the solute stores and the transfer of solutes to the river is established by temporal activation of hydrologic flow pathways connecting the river to the solute stores hydrologic connectivity between the river and the solute stores is via overland flow initiated during the rainy season fig 5b by flooding and return flow of flood waters following the annual pulse flooding and from groundwater influx fig 5c groundwater discharge to rivers in humid watersheds is an important source of solutes to rivers godsey et al 2009 liu et al 2020 rose et al 2018 in arid watersheds groundwater is an important source of solutes if groundwater supports rivers baskaran et al 2009 batlle aguilar et al 2014 imes and wood 2007 surface water groundwater interaction in the okavango delta has not been investigated extensively however on a regional basis the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater table steepens away from the river and floodplains mccarthy et al 1993 1998 ellery et al 2003 milzow et al 2009 making the okavango river and wetlands a potential source of groundwater recharge fig 6 a studies conducted in the okavango delta wetlands indicate river recharge of local groundwater during periods of flooding dincer et al 1979 gieske 1996 mccarthy 2006 groundwater recharge by the river appears to be prominent from an evaluation of the hydro stratigraphy from the lower okavango delta where our sampling station is located fig 6b groundwater levels near the sampling station are 5 m or more below the ground surface and groundwater flows towards the northeast and away from the middle of the delta fig 6b indicating river recharge of groundwater thangarajan et al 1999 mangisi 2004 furthermore the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of groundwater shows enrichment and lie on the trend of the okavango delta evaporation line akondi et al 2019 which is consistent with evaporated river recharge of groundwater although this notion of the absence of groundwater influence on the river chemistry is consistent with previous studies mccarthy et al 1993 ellery et al 2003 milzow et al 2009 akondi et al 2019 it is also possible to have input of groundwater with similar chemistry and isotopic composition to the river water spatially across the delta which complicates surface water groundwater interaction dynamics thus the groundwater behavior in the delta during hydrologic events and the dry season still need to be explored and constrained our study is unable to constrain the temporal groundwater response during different hydrologic regimes we tested our conceptual model using the relationship between total dissolved solids tdi silica in river water and river discharge c q relationship which provides insights into the mobilization and transfer of solutes from watersheds to rivers godsey et al 2009 chorover et al 2017 rose et al 2018 wymore et al 2020 in our evaluation we use the discharge regimes described in section 5 2 1 fig 7 a to model flow regime based c q relationships fig 7b e the c q relationship for the okavango river during the flood pulse recession for november 2017 february 2018 show solute enrichment with decreasing river discharge followed by dilution while river samples for the september 2018 december 2018 mostly cluster at lower solute concentrations fig 7b for the november 2017 february 2018 recession the continuous solute enrichment with decrease in the river discharge evident on the temporal plots of tdi cations and silica concentrations fig 2a c corresponds to highly enriched δd in river water fig 2h we interpret the concomitant shift to higher solute concentrations with decreasing discharge to mass transfer of solute enriched evaporated water from the wetlands into the river e g diamond and cohen 2018 herndon et al 2018 following the pulse flooding and dilution fig 7d this mixture of pulse floodwater and wetland water during return flow is characterized by a negative relationship between log tdi concentrations and d excess fig 4b previous studies have noted the existence of isolated saline wetland pools which are isotopically enriched within the seasonally and occasionally flooded wetland ecotones of the okavango delta dincer et al 1979 mccarthy et al 1991 1998 which serve as locations for solutes transported via return flow we note that during the september 2018 december 2018 the peak discharge from the flood pulse was 62 lower than in 2017 and the solute concentrations fig 2a c show only small variations while the δd slowly increased fig 2h the c q relationship shows scatter and low log c with decreasing log q fig 7b indicating that the flood pulse was of such a low magnitude that it was likely confined within the river channels the floodwater was subjected only to evaporation and was unmixed with higher solute concentration water from the wetlands as the flood receded consistent with the low d excess and tdi concentrations fig 4b the c q relationship of the okavango river during hydrograph recession in the late rainy season and early dry season march june 2018 fig 7a is characterized by a marked increase in solute concentrations in the middle of the recession followed by nearly constant solute concentrations and subsequent dilution fig 7c during the first half of the recession when the solute concentrations are low the na ca2 ratios indicate a shift in the type of solutes in the river because river water was getting progressively enriched in na relative to ca2 fig 2d we suggest that there is a hydrologic connection between the solute sources in floodplains and islands and the okavango river which provides solutes enriched in na mccarthy and metcalfe 1990 mccarthy et al 1991 and gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 indicate that chemical sedimentation caused by et of river and wetland water on the thousands of islands in the okavango delta include sodium carbonate salts trona thermonatrite thus although the overall river solute concentrations decrease from the dilution effect of rain fig 2a c fig 7c rain induced overland flow dissolves sodium salts from the floodplains and island which is then transferred to the river fig 2d fig 5b the c q relationship of the okavango river during increasing discharge from the pulse flooding in june august 2018 fig 7a is characterized by solute enrichment with increasing river discharge followed by solute dilution near peak flooding fig 7d during the period of slow solute concentration increases the log tdi concentrations vs d excess show data that cluster around the model line fig 4d additionally during the discharge increases na ca2 was flat and consistent with the baseline concentrations indicating the addition of evaporated river water with a similar proportion of ions to river water although the solute concentrations were slightly higher such enriched evaporated river water can come from the adjacent isolated wetland pools hosting isotopically enriched water dincer et al 1979 mccarthy et al 1991 1998 the water from the evaporated wetland pools is delivered to the river by the arriving flood pulse via the hydrologic piston model glover and johnson 1974 where old highly evaporated water enriched in solutes is pushed by the flood front during the arrival of new flood pulse fig 5c near the peak discharge fresh floodwaters arrive in maun causing a slight decrease in solute concentrations fig 7d we suggest hydrologic connection between the river and adjacent evaporated water in the wetlands since the flood magnitude was low in 2018 floodwaters were not sufficient to overtop the wetlands to flood the salt islands during the rainy season when river discharge increased in february 2018 march 2018 the c q relationship of the okavango river is characterized by a slight increase in solute concentrations followed by slight dilution near peak discharge fig 7e during this period of slow solute concentrations increases the data for the log tdi concentrations vs d excess are off to the right of the model line and clustered at low tdi concentrations and higher d excess fig 4e the low tdi concentrations are consistent with rain dilution and the higher d excess indicates lower evaporation effects nevertheless the na ca2 increased above baseline fig 2d indicating the mobilization of solutes rich in na from solute stores to the river by overland flow initiated by rain fig 5b 5 4 temporal solute load and solute flux from the okavango delta the instantaneous dissolved solute load estimated from tds concentrations tdi silica and discharge shows a bi annual distribution fig 8 a higher dissolved solute loads in the river are observed between july and november and between february and may although the solute load magnitudes are different the temporal variations in the instantaneous dissolved solute loads behave similar to river discharge fig 2e and are higher during high river discharge and lower during low river discharge this temporal behavior in solute load can be used to infer that increased discharge is associated with increase in solute concentrations yet increased discharge is from the annual pulse flooding and seasonal rains which are more dilute compared to the baseline chemistry of river water at maun this behavior in the temporal dissolved solute load is consistent with solute transfer from the floodplains island and evaporated isolated wetland pools discussed in section 5 3 during this study an annual dissolved solute flux of 17 838 mg was removed from the delta table 1 when examined on a monthly basis the solute flux mirrors the daily solute load fig 8b higher amounts of solutes leave the delta during the annual pulse flooding between july and november and during the rainy season in february through may for dissolved solute outflux from the okavango delta 67 leaves during pulse flooding 6 months 30 during the rainy season 4 months and 3 during the rest of the time 2 months the results of this study show that river discharge perturbations associated with the annual pulse flooding and rain are responsible for transferring 97 of the annual solute load removed from the delta via the okavango river 5 5 solute transport and cycling in the okavango delta the okavango delta is a solute store and sink and there is ample evidence of salt accumulation on the island edges and centers gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 zimmermann et al 2006 ramberg and wolski 2008 and in isolated evaporated saline wetland pools dincer et al 1979 mccarthy et al 1991 1998 yet the surface waters of the delta remain relatively fresh the pristine conditions of the delta have been attributed to the island salt sinking model which is a salt removal process controlled by density driven sinking of saline waters mccarthy and ellery 1994 bauer 2004 bauer gottwein et al 2007 ramberg and wolski 2008 in the island salt sinking model et concentrates salts in thousands of islands in the delta and then the saline water beneath islands sinks to greater depths due to density driven flow the island sinking salt model does not address the salt precipitates left as crust on the surface of the islands and floodplains we propose a hydrological flushing model as an additional mechanism that contributes to maintaining the pristine water quality condition of the okavango delta in the hydrologic flushing model the annual pulse flooding and seasonal rains dissolve salt precipitates on the floodplains and islands and transfer the solutes along with evaporated wetland water to the okavango river which is then transported out of the delta oromeng et al 2020 the solutes exported from the delta accumulate at the orb s terminus in the makgadikgadi pans a source for the salt mining sector in botswana molwalefhe 2003 6 conclusions and implications total dissolved ions major cations ca2 mg2 na k dissolved silica concentrations and the δd and δ18o of river water were used to investigate the processes controlling temporal solute behavior in the okavango river at the distal portion of the delta in the semi arid botswana our investigation showed that the temporal variability of solute concentrations in the delta is primarily controlled by the temporally changing hydrology pulse flood and rains and that these hydrological perturbations complement evapotranspiration during solute cycling solutes in the delta are cycled between the riverine solute pool and the islands floodplains and wetland pools enhanced solute transfer to the river occurs during hydrologic perturbations when hydrologic connectivity is established between the river and solute stores in floodplains islands and wetlands the results of this study also showed that 97 of the dissolved solutes export from the delta occur during the rainy season and during the annual pulse flooding the enhanced solute outflux from the delta during hydrologic perturbations indicate the significance of hydrologic events in flushing out solutes from the delta as a mechanism for maintaining the delta s pristine condition the periodic interception of river solutes by stores beyond the river act as transient solute storage and gives us insights into the existence of hydro geochemical hotspots and hot moments mcclain et al 2003 in the okavango delta floodplains salt islands and isolated wetland pools that accumulated solutes are hotspots compared to their surroundings the periods when solutes are transferred from the solutes stores to the river characterized by anomalously high solute concentrations in the river indicate hot moments of dissolved solute flux and export the hotspots and hot moments in the okavango delta have implications for the delta s ecological and water quality status due to the highly dynamic annual flooding regime in the okavango delta wolski et al 2008 wolski and murray hudson 2008 murray hudson et al 2014 the inter annual variability in solute concentrations and solute load in the okavango delta needs to be constrained we recognize that the river s chemical response will vary depending on flow magnitude and that our study may not capture the typical annual hydrochemical response or cover the range in the inter annual changes in river solute chemistry future work designed and conducted to investigate long term annual cycles will capture the extent to which the inter annual variability persists over the longer term additionally water samples collected at a frequency higher than in this study may provide greater constraints on the delta s hydrochemical processes oromeng et al 2020 credit authorship contribution statement goabaone j ramatlapeng methodology validation formal analysis investigation writing

4881,irrigated agriculture greatly affects the hydrological systems and thereby eco environment and food security in arid and semi arid regions however a comprehensive assessment of the hydrological system dynamics in response to irrigated agriculture is still scarce especially in oasis desert systems of arid inland regions thus we investigated the impact of irrigated agriculture on hydrological regimes in an oasis desert system of northwest china temporal variations in water balance and lateral groundwater flow in oasis and desert experimental fields i e oasis plot and desert plot were quantified using the water balance analysis method soil water variations groundwater dynamics and surface water and groundwater interactions in the oasis desert system were determined by combining line transect survey methods and stable isotope 18o 2h techniques using the usgs modflow software the results showed that water exchange fluxes and groundwater dynamics were altered by the application of water saving irrigation techniques and the increase in total precipitation in particular the downward total exchanging flux above groundwater table and the outward total lateral groundwater flow reduced significantly in the oasis plot spatial heterogeneity and profile variability of soil moisture along the soil water content swc transect significantly reduced simultaneously the depth dependence of swc in oasis cropland and the deep soil moisture at the edge of desert were improved under water saving irrigation scenario temporal variations in groundwater table depths gtds exhibited three different patterns i e stable metastable and fluctuating and maintained a continuously downward trend except for the oasis desert ecotone along the gtd transect and an abrupt change was found to have occurred during 2006 2012 prompting changes in the seasonality of groundwater resource availability groundwater recharge and discharge processes changed dramatically due to large scale land reclamation and groundwater pumping groundwater depletion is approaching hydrological limits although the process is largely compensated by precipitation and streamflow variability water saving irrigation in conjunction with restriction of land reclamation and adaptation of water management practices is at least for the present the most effective way to maintain the coexistence of oasis and desert ecosystems in arid inland regions keywords oasis desert system hydrological regimes irrigated agriculture sustainable water management 1 introduction hydrological system dynamics are governed by the interactions between climate inputs and human development hirsch et al 1990 sivakumar 2017 recent global studies highlight the extent of human intervention in hydrological systems and demonstrate a rapidly increasing water demand for the expansion of irrigated agriculture wada et al 2011 siebert et al 2014 veldkamp et al 2017 de graaf et al 2019 undoubtedly the development of irrigated agriculture is necessary to fulfil the increasing food requirements of the burgeoning global population singh 2016 however over exploitation of water and land resources for irrigated agriculture has markedly altered hydrological systems across the globe especially in arid and semi arid regions trenberth and asrar 2014 zeng et al 2016 voisin et al 2017 condon and maxwell 2019

surface water interactions is essential for sustainable management of water resources in water limited oasis desert systems han et al 2011 gabiri et al 2018 the oasis desert system consists of two subsystems of oasis and desert that are independent but interact in arid and semi arid regions li et al 2016 hydrological regimes play an important role in the development of oasis desert ecosystems

tang et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 singh 2016 hu et al 2017 gabiri et al 2018 accordingly the agricultural potential of oasis areas and the vegetation survival in the desert areas as well as the coexistence of oasis desert systems in inland river watersheds are either threatened or have been deteriorated zeng et al 2016 de graaf et al 2019 wu et al 2019b several studies have been conducted to

al 2011 zhang et al 2014 zeng et al 2016 hu et al 2017 han and zhou 2018 however alteration of the overall water balance by irrigated agriculture and in the long term its effects on the evolution of groundwater regimes in the oasis desert system are not yet understood well furthermore few studies have been conducted on the impact of regional hydrological regime changes on the coexistence of oasis and desert ecosystems particularly under different irrigation development scenarios hydrological regimes under irrigated agriculture conditions are relatively complex and variable frequently showing non linear and multi temporal scale characteristics zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless these can be investigated through comprehensive measurements such as long term positioning experiments intensive observations transect survey hydrological modelling and stable isotope techniques zhang et al 2014 singh 2016 zheng et al 2019 simultaneously the combination of physical techniques and water balance analysis has been proven to be effective in understanding the mechanism of soil water movement in the unsaturated zone in field experiment settings tennakoon and milroy 2003 zhang et al 2014 han and zhou 2018 stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen have been widely used as natural tracers for investigating the processes of evaporation characterising the behaviour of water movement and identifying the water sources for subsurface flow in arid regions han and zhou 2018 wu et al 2019a the usgs modflow software harbaugh et al 2000 has been commonly used to assess the effects of pumping on streamflow and aquifer levels and estimate regional hydrological budgets previous studies have shown that the groundwater flow model modflow is a well documented and extensively tested model and has high reliability for well posed hydrological problems wang et al 2002 hu et al 2010 xu et al 2011 the sangong river watershed srw is an arid inland river watershed characterised by typical oasis desert landscapes and long term irrigated agriculture practices in china s xinjiang province zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 since the 1950 s the hydrological system has been seriously disturbed by the development of irrigated agriculture within the watershed water saving irrigation especially during the past 15 years has potentially altered the hydrological cycles of oasis desert systems zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2019b therefore it is essential to appropriately investigate the impacts of irrigation including the transformation of irrigation schemes from traditional irrigation to water saving irrigation on the long term hydrological regimes in the oasis desert system moreover the study area represents the typical evolution of human water system development i e the natural stage exploitation stage and balanced development stage in the oasis desert systems in inland regions with a good data foundation zhang et al 2017 hence the srw can provide an excellent case study to generate insights into how human activities in particular irrigated agriculture development affect the coexistence of oasis and desert ecosystems for other similar arid areas in this study the water balance analysis zhang et al 2014 physical techniques han and zhou 2018 stable isotope tracers δ 18o and δ 2h zheng et al 2019 and usgs modflow software harbaugh et al 2000 were used to comprehensively assess the impact of irrigated agriculture on hydrological regimes in the oasis desert system in the srw where water saving irrigation has been widely applied the main objectives of this study were to a quantify and compare the characteristics of the water balance including lateral groundwater flow in oasis and desert fields under different irrigation regimes b investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of soil water variations and groundwater dynamics in the oasis desert system across different hydrological positions c identify changes in surface water and groundwater interactions within the srw and the effects of irrigated agriculture on the coexistence of oasis and desert ecosystems the study aims to provide suggestions for optimising agricultural water management and maintaining the sustainability of the oasis desert system in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of study area the srw 87 49 88 16 e 43 50 44 22 n is located in the northern tianshan mountains and southern guerbantonggute desert in northwest china with a total drainage area of approximately 1820 km2 fig 1 a the central oasis and northern desert in the watershed forms a typical oasis desert system which can be subdivided into four regions with different hydrological characteristics luo et al 2008 that is the alluvial diluvial fan oasis adfo alluvial plain oasis in the upper part apou alluvial plain oasis in the lower part apol and northern desert desert fig 1a the study area has a typical continental arid climate mean annual precipitation is approximately 171 mm fig s1 mean annual temperature is approximately 7 30 and mean annual pan evaporation is 1533 2240 mm wang et al 2018 according to long term hydrological data 1961 2016 mountain annual runoff mro is approximately 1 01 108 m3 with an insignificant increasing trend observed during the last 30 years r 2 0 42 p 0 05 fig s2 predominant soils are grey desert soil in the middle oasis and stable or semi stable aeolian sand soil in the northern desert the annals of fukang county 1999 the regional quaternary aquifers vary from a zone of single unconfined gravel and pebbles in the upper alluvial fan to a multi layered zone comprising sand and clay in the lower watershed fig 1d vegetation in the region includes various xeromorphic species for example haloxylon ammodendron h persicum populus bryonia dioica and crops such as wheat corn cotton grapes and hops cotton is one of the most important commercial crops regionally the srw has a long history of irrigated agricultural development along with the increase in population reclamation of saline alkali land improvements in irrigation technology and implementation of government policies irrigated agriculture has been greatly developed in the watershed zhang et al 2017 the irrigated area nearly doubled between 1978 and 2014 in particular the cultivated land area steadily increased since the 1970 s and sharply increased at the end of the 2002 fig 2 it has become the dominant land use type in the region wang et al 2018 the regional crop planting structure has shifted from grain based to food and cash crops lei et al 2006 this has resulted in an increase in the total water demand for irrigation and agricultural water use accounting for 90 of the total water consumption consequently there has been a switch from surface water irrigation to the use of more reliable groundwater resource for irrigation fig 2 irrigation schemes in the region include traditional irrigation e g furrow flood irrigation and water saving irrigation e g sprinkler mulched drip irrigation although the latter irrigation was only introduced in 2006 fig 2 by 2012 water saving irrigation area accounted for 85 of the total irrigation area with mulched drip irrigation being the most extensive the statistical yearbook of fukang 2013 with the development of modern irrigated agriculture both irrigation water use efficiency and water supply services have been increasing continuously however the watershed is facing water resource shortage similar to the other arid inland areas luo et al 2008 this has resulted in increasing groundwater consumption declining groundwater levels and triggering of a series of eco environmental problems in the oasis desert system zhang et al 2017 2 2 site description and transect design field experiments were

statistic department of fukang city and statistical communique on national economic and social development of xinjiang 2 4 water balance and lateral groundwater flow in this study two cylindrical soil control columns of unit surface area i e farmland control volume and sandland control volume were taken as the research object fig 3 the depth of each soil column was extended to the 150 cm soil depth because the deepest neutron probe was installed at a depth of 150 cm the actual evapotranspiration eta was estimated using the following equation allen et al 1998 1 e t a k c e t 0 where kc is the crop coefficient and et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm which was calculated by the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the kc values for initial development mid season and

2006 the runoff and lateral flow for in the control volume can be ignored zhang et al 2014 therefore assuming negligible the interception process the water balance of each soil control volume can be expressed as zhang et al 2014 2 ef e t a δ s p i where p is the precipitation mm i is the irrigation mm ef is the exchange flux at 150 cm soil depth of the control volume i e lower boundary mm and δs is the change of soil water storage sws within 150 cm soil depth mm groundwater is replenished by both regional flows and local recharge in the arid inland area fig 3 therefore groundwater dynamics at

δsd respectively other parameters correspond to their respective means it is worth noting that the error analysis represents the variation relative to the mean and is not an indication of measurement accuracy zhang et al 2014 to investigate surface water and groundwater interactions groundwater recharge and discharge was simulated using the usgs modflow software modflow is an industry standard model that simulates two dimensional three dimensional 2d 3d cell to cell groundwater flows in heterogeneous and anisotropic porous media using the finite difference method hu et al 2010 the 3d movement of groundwater of constant density in a homogeneous and anisotropic medium is expressed as harbaugh et al 2000 6 x kxx h x y kyy h y z kzz h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are the hydraulic conductivity values along the x y and z coordinate axes l t 1 h is the piezometric head l w is the volumetric flux per unit volume t 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous media l 1 and

hydrogeological conditions in the srw the simulation domain a b and b c are the supply boundaries c d d e e f and f a are the excretion boundaries was generalised as shown in fig 1 this simulation domain was divided into two layers the upper layer is a phreatic aquifer and the lower layer is a weakly confined aquifer with a total depth of 120 m meanwhile using the equidistant finite difference discretisation method the domain was further divided into 64 rows and 70 columns of regular rectangular grids 500 m 500 m with each layer consisting of 8960 grid cells of which 5398 were effective cells and the effective simulation area was 674 75 km2 moreover water fluxes on each boundary of the domain were processed by the recharge rch well wel drainage drn evapotranspiration evt and general head boundary ghb modules furthermore the gtds in january 1995 were taken as the initial water table and gtds measured during january 1995 to december 2004 and january 2005 to december 2016 were used for parameter estimation and model calibration respectively the specific process of model building and numerical calculation of the water budget components can be found in wang et al 2002 2 5 data

area fig 2 two irrigation scenarios traditional flood irrigation and water saving irrigation were set up note that these two scenarios reflect measures rather than simulations the traditional flood irrigation scenario and the water saving irrigation scenario represent the irrigation practices during 1950 2006 and after 2012 respectively moreover considering farmland irrigation plant growth climate variability and oasis desert interactions the entire growing season was divided under both irrigation scenarios for the oasis and desert plots into four analysis periods period 1 was the cotton seedling stage period 2 was the cotton squaring stage period 3 was the cotton flowering and boll setting stage and period 4 was the cotton boll opening stage this was done to analyse the spatio temporal water balance and groundwater dynamics 3 results 3 1 water balance and lateral groundwater flow at the two experimental sites 3 1 1 distribution of precipitation irrigation and

fig 5a c in the desert plot the daily sws within the 0 150 cm depth were not different between both scenarios which showed slight seasonal fluctuations due to rain pulses evapotranspiration and groundwater dynamics fig 4i during the 2005 2006 and 2012 2016 growing seasons the δs decreased with the value of 19 6 and 20 2 2 9 mm respectively however δsd increased with the value of 0 044 and 0

experienced upward water fluxes due to extremely low precipitation and very high eta demand while there were some exceptions to rainy days because of weak infiltration and ef became larger at first and then gradually became smaller as the growing season progressed fig 4j during the 2005 2006 and 2012 2016 growing seasons ef was 172 4 and 134 3 20 5 mm respectively and efd was 199 0 and 191 5 21

2 1 spatial dynamics of soil water content in various soil layers under the ecgs swc had clear spatial differences among the soil depths along the swc transect fig 6 a1 swcs in the o5 o8 zone were notably higher than those in the o1 o4 zone particularly in the 100 cm soil layers mean swc in the adfo apou apol and desert were 13 16 0 53 15 29 0 63 14 99 0 53 and 1 39 0 18 respectively fig 6b under the lcgs the overall spatial similarity of swc among the layers along the transect was observed fig 6a2 swcs were similar and almost constant in the 0 80 cm layer 0 92 0 05 and lower than those in the 80 220 cm layer 1 43 0 11 from d1 to d4 mean swc in the adfo apou apol and desert were 19 94 0 91 15 01 0 55 14 30 0 52 and 1 72 0 15 respectively fig 6b by contrast the coefficient of

distribution function pdf in 0 220 cm soil profiles in both the transect double peaked shape and the four hydrological regions single peaked shape showed no significant difference between the two stages fig 6c compared with the findings of zhao 2002 these results indicate that water saving irrigation practices can significantly reduce the spatial heterogeneity and profile variability of soil moisture at a regional scale furthermore significant correlation in the spatial pattern of swc between layers especially between two adjacent layers was found under both stages in the oasis and desert regions fig 7 in addition correlations between gtds and swcs among different layers were also observed along the transect 3 2 2 temporal variations of groundwater table in different landscapes clear differences in gtd and its dynamics were observed along the gtd transect fig 8 the mann kendall test results showed that the wells w1 w7 displayed decreasing trends and wells w8 w10 showed increasing trends the largest cv of gtd was observed in well w4 whereas the smallest was observed in wells w1 w2 and w8 w10 the gtd probability density function pdf patterns of wells w2 and w4 w7 were relatively scattered wells w1 and w8 w10 were relatively concentrated and well w3 had a less pronounced peak fig 8 in addition variations of gtd in the 10 wells can be classified into three major patterns pattern ⅰ stable wells w8 w10 with var and std of 0 01 0 04 and 0 06 0 19 respectively pattern ⅱ metastable wells w5 w7 represents periodic annual repetitive behaviours with var and std of 2 20 4 60 and 1 48 2 17 respectively pattern iii fluctuating wells w1 w4 describes the most erratic variation behaviours with var and std of 17 80 135 33 and 2 79 11 63 respectively the non parametric pettitt test and bayesian change point analysis provided similar results for detecting the sudden change points of gtd in wells w1 w10 from 1995 to 2016 fig s3 surprisingly the change points of gtd for all wells except well w1 were found to have occurred during 2006 2012 which represents the transition period of agricultural irrigation schemes from traditional flood irrigation to water saving irrigation by contrast both the seasonal gtd and the average annual gtd for wells w1 w7 under the traditional flood irrigation scenario 1995 2006 were shallower than under the water saving irrigation scenario 2012 2016 whereas the opposite patterns though weaker were observed for wells w8 w10 fig 9 moreover seasonal gtd fluctuation patterns in all wells exhibited significant differences between the both scenarios this indicates that the shift in regional irrigation scheme potentially causes the seasonality of groundwater resource availability changes in the oasis desert system 3 2 3 dynamic changes in surface water and groundwater interactions local precipitation and river water snowmelt water are two potential sources of groundwater recharge in the study area fig 10 a river water samples showed less variation in δ 18o and δ 2h values average 10 49 0 75 and 71 30 2 40 and most values were below the evaporation line el δ 2h 6 78δ 18o 0 80 r 2 0 86 which suggests that river water evaporates for a short time before infiltration to groundwater stable isotope values for most groundwater samples were plotted at the lower right of the local meteoric water line lmwl and the average value of δ 18o δ 2h in shallow and deep groundwater was 11 06 0 82 78 93 6 68 and 11 40 0 72 82 82 4 87 respectively fig 10a this indicates that there is a close hydraulic relationship between shallow and deep groundwater moreover the isotopic compositions of soil recharge water at eight sample sites so1 so4 sd1 sd4 in the oasis desert system were mostly located below the lmwl and were depleted in δ 2h than that in groundwater fig 10b this suggests that the soil water in the unsaturated zone mainly originates from atmospheric precipitation in the srw the comparisons between the measured and simulated values of the groundwater level for the 10 long term monitoring wells during the calibration and validation stages in the study area are shown in table s3 and fig s4 the simulation results of the groundwater level were generally satisfactory suggested that the modflow model with the calibrated parameters can be used for the simulation analysis of the hydrological cycle in the srw as shown in table 3 the annual groundwater budget was remarkably increased from 2844 104 m3 a 1 during 2002 2006 to 5227 104 m3 a 1 during 2012 2016 total recharge tr slightly decreased by 1 69 from traditional flood irrigation period 6052 m3 a 1 to water saving irrigation period 5950 m3 a 1 with the recharge of streamflow and reservoir increasing by 3 62 and 41 28 respectively total discharge td increased by 25 64 from traditional flood irrigation period 8896 m3 a 1 to water saving irrigation period 11177 m3 a 1 with the lateral discharge and groundwater pumping increasing by 4 84 and 53 47 respectively and the phreatic evaporation was reduced by 44 74 although both natural conditions and human activities were responsible for the annual groundwater budget change the effect of human activities e g gwe cla awu cps ucl was more profound in the last 23 years fig 11 the results indicate that human activities related to irrigated agriculture are triggering changes in groundwater budgets in the srw overall the development of irrigated agriculture is causing hydrological regimes in the oasis desert system to change dramatically and groundwater depletion is approaching hydrological limits leading to a disconnection of the groundwater and surface water systems as shown in fig 12 during the near natural period before 1950 fig 12a irrigated agriculture had limited impacts on hydrological processes surface water and groundwater interactions were weak and natural factors dominated the hydrological regime the groundwater table in the irrigated areas did not change much and the water table was relatively deep zhang et al 2014 during traditional flood irrigation period 1950 2006 fig 12b water balance and groundwater dynamics were notably altered by the rapid development of irrigated agriculture the frequent water exchange was maintained between oasis and desert areas groundwater in the alluvial diluvial fans was mainly recharged by lateral flow and accompanied by continuous groundwater extraction and the water table dropped sharply whereas groundwater in the alluvial diluvial plains was largely supplied by vertical recharge from the irrigation fields and the water table increased evidently during water saving irrigation period after 2012 fig 12c excessive groundwater pumping resulted in the continuous decline in groundwater table and the significant reduction in vertical infiltration recharge almost throughout the study area this is causing a shift in the surface water and groundwater exchanges reducing water discharge from oasis to desert and reshaping hydrologic landscape functions under a hypothetical future scenario i e water saving irrigation with over development fig 12d groundwater exploitation will increase dramatically and the water table will decline continuously groundwater and surface water systems will disconnect gradually and finally the hydrological regimes of the system will change completely 4 discussion 4 1 error analysis for water balance components estimations water balance analysis is a widely used method for quantifying the components of the water balance equations that cannot otherwise be directly measured tennakoon and milroy 2003 tang et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 gee and hillel 1988 pointed out that neutron probes measurements coupled with micrometeorological techniques provide a more reliable measurement of water balance components in this study the variabilities of ef estimate σef ef and lf estimate σlf lf were obtained using eqs 4 and 5 in the oasis plot σef ef and σlf lf for the four analysis periods and the entire growth season were 0 12 1 13 and 0 25 and 0 48 2 03 and 0 49 respectively under traditional flood irrigation and correspondingly were 0 07 0 16 and 0 03 and 0 57 0 79 and 0 36 respectively under water saving irrigation in the desert plot σef ef and σlf lf for the four analysis periods and the entire growth season were 0 02 0 07 and 0 01 and 0 03 0 34 and 0 08 respectively under traditional flood irrigation and correspondingly were 0 01 0 29 and 0 02 and 0 04 0 33 and 0 03 respectively under water saving irrigation the results suggest that the variabilities of both σef ef and σlf lf in the oasis plot under traditional flood irrigation were larger than those under water saving irrigation due to the differences in soil moisture variability and surface fluxes zhang et al 2014 and variabilities of both σef ef and σlf lf in the oasis plot were larger than those in the desert plot moreover we further analysed the impact of eta estimate σeta eta on σef ef and θ estimate σθ θ θ and δsd estimate σδ sd δsd on σlf lf using eqs 4 and 5 based on the field estimates under two scenarios at both plots the results suggest that the uncertainty in the eta term is the greatest potential source of error in determining ef and lf as reported in other studies scanlon et al 2002 allen et al 2011 han et al 2017 however owing to the recent rapid progress in measurement and bias correction of eta ef can be directly quantified by water balance analysis at field scale which can then be used to estimate groundwater dynamics zhang et al 2014 crosbie et al 2014 4 2 evaluation of hydrological regimes in oasis desert systems water balance is an important parameter for determining water dynamics in agricultural and natural ecosystems and its components are affected by both climatic conditions and human activities allen and ingram 2002 zhang et al 2014 in the studied area the increasing trend of precipitation in both plots is consistent with previous studies shi et al 2002 wu et al 2016 the characteristics of the variation of total evapotranspiration during the cotton growth period under different irrigation schemes support the results of zhang et al 2014 who found that compared with traditional flood irrigation water saving irrigation significantly reduced eta in the farmland the sws in the 0 150 cm soil layer of cotton field under traditional flood irrigation was much higher than that under water saving irrigation fig 4c furthermore vico and porporato 2010 reported that traditional irrigation tends to maintain higher mean soil moisture than microirrigation over the root zone however mulched drip irrigation can significantly increase the sws within the 150 cm depth with increasing precipitation and declining groundwater table in our study fig 5c this may be attributed to the fact that the thickening of the unsaturated zone can reduce groundwater recharge by increasing both the fraction of unsaturated zone water storage and the time lag between deep drainage and recharge cao and zheng 2016 han et al 2017 in addition the weak increments in sws in the desert plot in the soil surface were attributed to rainfall events whereas the dynamics of sws in the deep soil layer were caused by groundwater table fluctuations and soil temperature gradients yi et al 2015 du et al 2017 irrigation return flow is an important component of farmland hydrological processes and a vital source of water for downstream areas in arid regions dewandel et al 2008 simons et al 2015 hu et al 2017 compared with traditional flood irrigation the downward total ef in the oasis plot under mulched drip irrigation was remarkably increased due to increased precipitation events and continuous irrigation whereas the downward total efd was significantly reduced owing to the sharp decline of gtd and limited irrigation amount each time accordingly the outward total lf was clearly decreased fig 5c which is also confirmed by the findings of hu et al 2017 han and zhou 2018 and zheng et al 2019 however total ef and total efd were upward and total lf was inward with a slight increasing trend in the desert plot under both irrigation scenarios fig 5f the results indicate that groundwater is continuously transported to the surface to supply evapotranspiration through root absorption by deep rooted plants wu et al 2019b and water vapour diffusion in dry soils wang et al 2014b moreover the development of irrigated agriculture on the edge of the desert caused an increase in local desert lf the lf may also be caused by lateral groundwater inflows driven by flood irrigation from adjacent woodlands rather than the vertical infiltration of irrigation drainage han and zhou 2018 moreover seasonal variation of groundwater use coefficient in the desert plot is closely related to plant growth groundwater table dynamics and climate variability wu et al 2019b furthermore there are significant positive and negative correlations between groundwater pumping and the gwd change in the oasis r 2 0 90 p 0 01 and desert r 2 0 55 p 0 05 plots respectively soil water groundwater surface water interactions cover a broad range of hydrological processes at various spatio temporal scales which play an important role in the dynamics of natural hydrological systems reichard 1995 unland et al 2013 condon and maxwell 2019 in our study the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture along the swc transect under the water saving irrigation scenario was evidently lower than that under the traditional flood irrigation scenario zhao 2002 moreover swc had a clear depth dependence within the profile and correlation coefficients decreased with distance between layers under both ecgs and lcgs fig 7 these results are in agreement with those of other studies biswas and si 2011 li et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 zhang and shao 2013 furthermore the implementation of water saving irrigation agriculture on the desert edge increased the below 60 cm depth soil moisture at the desert edge due to oasis desert interactions li et al 2016 these soil water may potentially serve as a source of water for desert vegetation temporal variation of gtds exhibited three different patterns along the gtd transect fig 8 such patterns were also reported by wang et al 2014a in northwest china meanwhile gtds are exhibiting a continuous downward trend in both adfo and apou due to excessive groundwater pumping zhao 2002 and a slight upward trend in the oasis desert ecotone due to the additional groundwater recharge from large scale wasteland reclamation tang et al 2007 moreover the seasonality of groundwater availability is changing with the development of water saving irrigation agriculture in addition the infiltration pattern of soil water has changed under the water saving irrigation method and the rate of water use generally exceeds replenishment rate in the oasis area fig 10 and table 3 therefore groundwater storage depletion gradually becomes the dominant hydrological process in the watershed although the progression is largely masked by precipitation and streamflow variability han and zhou 2018 zheng et al 2019 it is important to note that the gradual deterioration of the regional hydrological regimes is the result of the excessive reclamation and over exploitation related to irrigated agriculture rather than irrigation itself 4 3 implications for sustainable water management anthropogenic activities especially the over exploitation associated with irrigation agricultural development can significantly affect the water balance hydrological cycle and groundwater dynamics and strengthen spatio temporal redistribution of regional water resources in arid regions han et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 han and zhou 2018 to avoid further deterioration of hydrological regimes and maintain the coexistence of oasis desert ecosystems in inland basins adaptation of water management which takes into account ecosystem environment and socioeconomics in a changing climate should be implemented throughout the region based on our analysis in the field trials and modelling previous research findings in related fields e g ma et al 2005 hu et al 2010 2017 zhang et al 2014 han and zhou 2018 and lessons drawn from global dryland development and management we provide the following recommendations for srw and other similar arid regions a to achieve highly efficient and sustainable development of irrigation in water limited oasis desert systems traditional irrigation should be gradually replaced by water saving irrigation optimum water saving irrigation and planting schedules should be constantly explored and the mulching drip irrigation technique should be prioritised zhang et al 2014 moreover the effects of different irrigation schemes for oasis desert interactions should be characterised b to ensure the seasonal availability of groundwater resources for oasis irrigation and desert vegetation the discharge of salts in downstream along with irrigation return flow foster et al 2018 and the dependence of desert vegetation on oasis drainage should be taken into account moreover the regional critical groundwater level interval and groundwater pumping threshold should be determined and rational allocation and scientific management of surface water resources should be implemented c to curb the impacts of human over development on regional sustainable water management e g the paradox of irrigation efficiency grafton et al 2018 and eco environmental health e g the soil salinization and vegetation degradation zhang et al 2014 the total water saving irrigated area should be limited most of the water savings gained through advanced water saving irrigation should be utilised for ecological purposes and physical water accounts need to be developed from the farm scale to basin scale to enact more efficient human water systems water governance liu et al 2015 d to address the challenges posed by climate change to agricultural activities such as agricultural risks from changing snowmelt qin et al 2020 and climate shift from warm dry to warm humid shi et al 2002 the potential impact of climate variability on regional hydrological regimes should be investigated by combining field experiments and integrated models and related dominant factors should be identified 5 conclusions in this study the effects of irrigated agricultural on hydrological regimes in an oasis desert system of northwestern china were determined by the water balance analysis method line transect survey method i e swc transect and gtd transect stable isotope 18o 2h techniques and the usgs modflow software the downward total exchange flux above the groundwater table and the outward total lateral groundwater flow reduced significantly in the oasis the spatial heterogeneity and profile variability of soil moisture along the swc transect reduced significantly and the depth dependence of swc in oasis cropland and the deep soil moisture at the edge of desert improved under the water saving irrigation scheme the temporal variations of gtds exhibited three different patterns along the gtd transect and almost all maintained a continuously decreasing trend and the shift in regional irrigation scheme caused the seasonality of groundwater resource availability changes the groundwater recharge and discharge processes changed dramatically groundwater depletion is now approaching hydrological limits although the process is largely masked by precipitation and streamflow variability our results suggested that water saving irrigation with restriction of reclamation and adaptation of water management is critical in maintaining the coexistence of oasis desert

4881,irrigated agriculture greatly affects the hydrological systems and thereby eco environment and food security in arid and semi arid regions however a comprehensive assessment of the hydrological system dynamics in response to irrigated agriculture is still scarce especially in oasis desert systems of arid inland regions thus we investigated the impact of irrigated agriculture on hydrological regimes in an oasis desert system of northwest china temporal variations in water balance and lateral groundwater flow in oasis and desert experimental fields i e oasis plot and desert plot were quantified using the water balance analysis method soil water variations groundwater dynamics and surface water and groundwater interactions in the oasis desert system were determined by combining line transect survey methods and stable isotope 18o 2h techniques using the usgs modflow software the results showed that water exchange fluxes and groundwater dynamics were altered by the application of water saving irrigation techniques and the increase in total precipitation in particular the downward total exchanging flux above groundwater table and the outward total lateral groundwater flow reduced significantly in the oasis plot spatial heterogeneity and profile variability of soil moisture along the soil water content swc transect significantly reduced simultaneously the depth dependence of swc in oasis cropland and the deep soil moisture at the edge of desert were improved under water saving irrigation scenario temporal variations in groundwater table depths gtds exhibited three different patterns i e stable metastable and fluctuating and maintained a continuously downward trend except for the oasis desert ecotone along the gtd transect and an abrupt change was found to have occurred during 2006 2012 prompting changes in the seasonality of groundwater resource availability groundwater recharge and discharge processes changed dramatically due to large scale land reclamation and groundwater pumping groundwater depletion is approaching hydrological limits although the process is largely compensated by precipitation and streamflow variability water saving irrigation in conjunction with restriction of land reclamation and adaptation of water management practices is at least for the present the most effective way to maintain the coexistence of oasis and desert ecosystems in arid inland regions keywords oasis desert system hydrological regimes irrigated agriculture sustainable water management 1 introduction hydrological system dynamics are governed by the interactions between climate inputs and human development hirsch et al 1990 sivakumar 2017 recent global studies highlight the extent of human intervention in hydrological systems and demonstrate a rapidly increasing water demand for the expansion of irrigated agriculture wada et al 2011 siebert et al 2014 veldkamp et al 2017 de graaf et al 2019 undoubtedly the development of irrigated agriculture is necessary to fulfil the increasing food requirements of the burgeoning global population singh 2016 however over exploitation of water and land resources for irrigated agriculture has markedly altered hydrological systems across the globe especially in arid and semi arid regions trenberth and asrar 2014 zeng et al 2016 voisin et al 2017 condon and maxwell 2019 therefore a better understanding regarding the impacts of irrigated agriculture on hydrological regimes such as water balance changes groundwater dynamics soil hydrological regimes and groundwater and surface water interactions is essential for sustainable management of water resources in water limited oasis desert systems han et al 2011 gabiri et al 2018 the oasis desert system consists of two subsystems of oasis and desert that are independent but interact in arid and semi arid regions li et al 2016 hydrological regimes play an important role in the development of oasis desert ecosystems

tang et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 singh 2016 hu et al 2017 gabiri et al 2018 accordingly the agricultural potential of oasis areas and the vegetation survival in the desert areas as well as the coexistence of oasis desert systems in inland river watersheds are either threatened or have been deteriorated zeng et al 2016 de graaf et al 2019 wu et al 2019b several studies have been conducted to quantify the impact of irrigated agriculture on hydrological regimes e g evapotranspiration exchange flux irrigation return flow and groundwater level dynamics in inland regions ma et al 2005 han et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 zeng et al 2016 hu et al 2017 han and zhou 2018 however alteration of the overall water balance by irrigated agriculture and in the long term its effects on the evolution of groundwater regimes in the oasis desert system are not yet understood well furthermore few studies have been conducted on the impact of regional hydrological regime changes on the coexistence of oasis and desert ecosystems particularly under different irrigation development scenarios hydrological regimes under irrigated agriculture conditions are relatively complex and variable frequently showing non linear and multi temporal scale characteristics zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless these can be investigated through comprehensive measurements such as long term positioning experiments intensive observations transect survey hydrological modelling and stable isotope techniques zhang et al 2014 singh 2016 zheng et al 2019 simultaneously the combination of physical techniques and water balance analysis has been proven to be effective in understanding the mechanism of soil water movement in the unsaturated zone in field experiment settings tennakoon and milroy 2003 zhang et al 2014 han and zhou 2018 stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen have been widely used as natural tracers for investigating the processes of evaporation characterising the behaviour of water movement and identifying the water sources for subsurface flow in arid regions han and zhou 2018 wu et al 2019a the usgs modflow software harbaugh et al 2000 has been commonly used to assess the effects of pumping on streamflow and aquifer levels and estimate regional hydrological budgets previous studies have shown that the groundwater flow model modflow is a well documented and extensively tested model and has high reliability for well posed hydrological problems wang et al 2002 hu et al 2010 xu et al 2011 the sangong river watershed srw is an arid inland river watershed characterised by typical oasis desert landscapes and long term irrigated agriculture practices in china s xinjiang province zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 since the 1950 s the hydrological system has been seriously disturbed by the development of irrigated agriculture within the watershed water saving irrigation especially during the past 15 years has potentially altered the hydrological cycles of oasis desert systems zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2019b therefore it is essential to appropriately investigate the impacts of irrigation including the transformation of irrigation schemes from traditional irrigation to water saving irrigation on the long term hydrological regimes in the oasis desert system moreover the study area represents the typical evolution of human water system development i e the natural stage exploitation stage and balanced development stage in the oasis desert systems in inland regions with a good data foundation zhang et al 2017 hence the srw can provide an excellent case study to generate insights into how human activities in particular irrigated agriculture development affect the coexistence of oasis and desert ecosystems for other similar arid areas in this study the water balance analysis zhang et al 2014 physical techniques han and zhou 2018 stable isotope tracers δ 18o and δ 2h zheng et al 2019 and usgs modflow software harbaugh et al 2000 were used to comprehensively assess the impact of irrigated agriculture on hydrological regimes in the oasis desert system in the srw where water saving irrigation has been widely applied the main objectives of this study were to a quantify and compare the characteristics of the water balance including lateral groundwater flow in oasis and desert fields under different irrigation regimes b investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of soil water variations and groundwater dynamics in the oasis desert system across different hydrological positions c identify changes in surface water and groundwater interactions within the srw and the effects of irrigated agriculture on the coexistence of oasis and desert ecosystems the study aims to provide suggestions for optimising agricultural water management and maintaining the sustainability of the oasis desert system in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of study area the srw 87 49 88 16 e 43 50 44 22 n is located in the northern tianshan mountains and southern guerbantonggute desert in northwest china with a total drainage area of approximately 1820 km2 fig 1 a the central oasis and northern desert in the watershed forms a typical oasis desert system which can be subdivided into four regions with different hydrological characteristics luo et al 2008 that is the alluvial diluvial fan oasis adfo alluvial plain oasis in the upper part apou alluvial plain oasis in the lower part apol and northern desert desert fig 1a the study area has a typical continental arid climate mean annual precipitation is approximately 171 mm fig s1 mean annual temperature is approximately 7 30 and mean annual pan evaporation is 1533 2240 mm wang et al 2018 according to long term hydrological data 1961 2016 mountain annual runoff mro is approximately 1 01 108 m3 with an insignificant increasing trend observed during the last 30 years r 2 0 42 p 0 05 fig s2 predominant soils are grey desert soil in the middle oasis and stable or semi stable aeolian sand soil in the northern desert the annals of fukang county 1999 the regional quaternary aquifers vary from a zone of single unconfined gravel and pebbles in the upper alluvial fan to a multi layered zone comprising sand and clay in the lower watershed fig 1d vegetation in the region includes various xeromorphic species for example haloxylon ammodendron h persicum populus bryonia dioica and crops such as wheat corn cotton grapes and hops cotton is one of the most important commercial crops regionally the srw has a long history of irrigated agricultural development along with the increase in population reclamation of saline alkali land improvements in irrigation technology and implementation of government policies irrigated agriculture has been greatly developed in the watershed zhang et al 2017 the irrigated area nearly doubled between 1978 and 2014 in particular the cultivated land area steadily increased since the 1970 s and sharply increased at the end of the 2002 fig 2 it has become the dominant land use type in the region wang et al 2018 the regional crop planting structure has shifted from grain based to food and cash crops lei et al 2006 this has resulted in an increase in the total water demand for irrigation and agricultural water use accounting for 90 of the total water consumption consequently there has been a switch from surface water irrigation to the use of more reliable groundwater resource for irrigation fig 2 irrigation schemes in the region include traditional irrigation e g furrow flood irrigation and water saving irrigation e g sprinkler mulched drip irrigation although the latter irrigation was only introduced in 2006 fig 2 by 2012 water saving irrigation area accounted for 85 of the total irrigation area with mulched drip irrigation being the most extensive the statistical yearbook of fukang 2013 with the development of modern irrigated agriculture both irrigation water use efficiency and water supply services have been increasing continuously however the watershed is facing water resource shortage similar to the other arid inland areas luo et al 2008 this has resulted in increasing groundwater consumption declining groundwater levels and triggering of a series of eco environmental problems in the oasis desert system zhang et al 2017 2 2 site description and transect design field experiments were conducted at the oasis site oasis plot 87 55 e 44 17 n 470 m a s l and the desert site desert plot 87 55 e 44 22 n 430 m a s l of the fukang station of desert ecology chinese academy of sciences cas

reach the groundwater xu and li 2006 table s1 lists the key characteristics for each experiment site to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of swc within profiles along the defined hydrological regions under water saving irrigation condition in the oasis desert system during the crop growing season a representative sampling transect swc transect approximately 3 83 km long in the north south direction was established in april 2018 fig 1a the transect consists of 12 transverse sections oasis 8 desert 4 with 3 sampling points for oasis and 2 sampling points for desert on each section a total of 32 sampling points the sections are numbered consecutively from south to north by o1 o8 and d1 d4 respectively among them sections o1 o2 are located in adfo sections o3 o5 are located in apou sections o6 o8 are located in apol and sections d1 d4 are located in desert the distance between transverse section is 1700 5600 m along the transect and the distance between sampling points is 950 3400 m on each section in addition each sampling point in the oasis area is located in the farmland and in the desert area in the inter dune to determine the temporal and spatial patterns of the gtd variations and delineate the dominant factors that control groundwater dynamics for the various landscapes 10 long term w1 w10 and 4 temporary w11 w14 groundwater monitoring wells gtd transect which were constructed specifically for the monitoring programme by the local government and the cas were chosen along the defined hydrological positions in the oasis desert system in the

point three replicate measurements were performed for each sample on 5 june 2018 i e the early crop growing stage ecgs and 11 september 2018 i e the late crop growing stage lcgs soil samples were stored immediately in airtight aluminium boxes after they were extracted then the gravimetric swc was measured using the oven dry method 24 h at 105 c in the laboratory in total there were 18 27 27 and 24 soil samples in the various layers in the adfo apou apol and desert respectively note that no precipitation events occurred during the sampling periods along the gtd transect the gtd in each long term and temporary monitoring well was measured every 10 days and at the beginning of each month respectively using a portable groundwater level gauge model 101 solinst canada ltd ontario canada to ensure data integrity and reliability the missing gtd data were interpolated using data from adjacent wells the latitude longitude and elevation of each sampling point and monitoring well were determined using a handheld gps receiver water samples for stable isotope analysis were collected from 1 september to 31 october 2015 a total of 212 water samples were collected including 19 river

interval of 20 cm along the groundwater depth of 6 40 5 70 5 60 5 80 and 8 80 m for sample points so1 so2 so3 so4 and sd1 respectively fig 1a all water samples were collected in clean 100 ml polyethylene bottles tightly capped and stored at 4 c until isotope analysis the samples were filtered through 0 2 μm filters before isotope analysis and analysed at the center laboratory of xi an geological survey center china geological survey the stable isotopes of water samples δ 2h δ 18o were analysed using laser absorption water vapour isotope analyser picarro i2120 ca usa isotopic compositions were reported in the conventional delta δ notation relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the reported analytical errors for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes ratio are 0 1 for

statistic department of fukang city and statistical communique on national economic and social development of xinjiang 2 4 water balance and lateral groundwater flow in this study two cylindrical soil control columns of unit surface area i e farmland control volume and sandland control volume were taken as the research object fig 3 the depth of each soil column was extended to the 150 cm soil depth because the deepest neutron probe was installed at a depth of 150 cm the actual evapotranspiration eta was estimated using the following equation allen et al 1998 1 e t a k c e t 0 where kc is the crop coefficient and et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm which was calculated by the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the kc values for initial development mid season and end season stages of cotton under traditional flood irrigation scenario were 0 47 0 05 0 81 0 07 1 23 0 11 and 0 63 0 05 respectively allen et al 1998 hu et al 2017 and correspondingly under mulched drip irrigation scenario were 0 33 0 05 0 62 0 06 1 03 0 07 and 0 55 0 06 respectively allen et al 1998 yang et al 2016 and the kc values for the desert under plant growing period of april to october were 0 12 0 01 0 24 0 01 0 33 0 02 0 40 0 01 0 35 0 01 0 25 0 01 and 0 13 0 01 respectively zhao and zhao 2014 during water saving irrigation period 2012 2016 and traditional irrigation period 2002 2006 the runoff and lateral flow for in the control volume can be ignored zhang et al 2014 therefore assuming negligible the interception process the water balance of each soil control volume can be expressed as zhang et al 2014 2 ef e t a δ s p i where p is the precipitation mm i is the irrigation mm ef is the exchange flux at 150 cm soil depth of the control volume i e lower boundary mm and δs is the change of soil water storage sws within 150 cm soil depth mm groundwater is replenished by both regional flows and local recharge in the arid inland area fig 3 therefore groundwater dynamics at each plot can be expressed as zhang et al 2014 3 lf e f θ sat θ δ z wt δ s d where lf is the net lateral flow i e regional flow mm θsat is the saturated water content θ is the swc within the range of groundwater table changes δz wt is the change in gtd mm θ sat θ δzwt is the sws change related to a falling or rising groundwater table and δsd is the sws change in the zone between the bottom of control volume and the upper boundary of water table variation mm the swc within the layer between the 150 cm depth and gtd was assumed to have a linear variation zhang et al 2014 du et al 2017 to assess the uncertainties associated with exchange flux and lateral water flow error analysis based on the barry theory 1978 was implemented by converting eqs 2 and 3 using the standard error se zhang et al 2014 the variabilities of ef and lf can be obtained by the following equations 4 σ ef ef e t a ef 2 σ e t a e t a 2 δ s ef 2 σ δ s δ s 2 p ef 2 σ p p 2 i ef 2 σ i i 2 1 2 5 σ lf lf ef lf 2 σ ef

δsd respectively other parameters correspond to their respective means it is worth noting that the error analysis represents the variation relative to the mean and is not an indication of measurement accuracy zhang et al 2014 to investigate surface water and groundwater interactions groundwater recharge and discharge was simulated using the usgs modflow software modflow is an industry standard model that simulates two dimensional three dimensional 2d 3d cell to cell groundwater flows in heterogeneous and anisotropic porous media using the finite difference method hu et al 2010 the 3d movement of groundwater of constant density in a homogeneous and anisotropic medium is expressed as harbaugh et al 2000 6 x kxx h x y kyy h y z kzz h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are the hydraulic conductivity values along the x y and z coordinate axes l t 1 h is the piezometric head l w is the volumetric flux per unit volume t 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous media l 1 and

hydrogeological conditions in the srw the simulation domain a b and b c are the supply boundaries c d d e e f and f a are the excretion boundaries was generalised as shown in fig 1 this simulation domain was divided into two layers the upper layer is a phreatic aquifer and the lower layer is a weakly confined aquifer with a total depth of 120 m meanwhile using the equidistant finite difference discretisation method the domain was further divided into 64 rows and 70 columns of regular rectangular grids 500 m 500 m with each layer consisting of 8960 grid cells of which 5398 were effective cells and the effective simulation area was 674 75 km2 moreover water fluxes on each boundary of the domain were processed by the recharge rch well wel drainage drn evapotranspiration evt and general head boundary ghb modules furthermore the gtds in january 1995 were taken as the initial water table and gtds measured during january 1995 to december 2004 and january 2005 to december 2016 were used for parameter estimation and model calibration respectively the specific process of model building and numerical calculation of the water budget components can be found in wang et al 2002 2 5 data analysis and scenario settings the gtds for the 10 selected long term monitoring wells table 1 were tested using the non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 non parametric pettitt test pettitt 1979 and bayesian change point analysis perreault et al 2000 to detect the spatio temporal variations and change points spearman correlation analysis vachaud et al 1985 was used to identify correlations between swc and gtd among the layers along the swc transect grey relational analysis xie 2008 was used to identify the main factors affecting the annual groundwater budgets in the srw statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss 21 0 spss inc armonk ny usa charting was processed using matlab r2014a the mathworks inc natick ma us according to irrigation history in this study area fig 2 two irrigation scenarios traditional flood irrigation and water saving irrigation were set up note that these two scenarios reflect measures rather than simulations the traditional flood irrigation scenario and the water saving irrigation scenario represent the irrigation practices during 1950 2006 and after 2012 respectively moreover considering farmland irrigation plant growth climate variability and oasis desert interactions the entire growing season was divided under both irrigation scenarios for the oasis and desert plots into four analysis periods period 1 was the cotton seedling stage period 2 was the cotton squaring stage period 3 was the cotton flowering and boll setting stage and period 4 was the cotton boll opening stage this was done to analyse the spatio temporal water balance and groundwater dynamics 3 results 3 1 water balance and lateral groundwater flow at the two experimental sites 3 1 1 distribution of precipitation irrigation and evapotranspiration as illustrated in figs 3a b g h and 4 in the oasis plot the total precipitation mean time interval between precipitation events irrigation frequency irrigation quota for the entire growth period and for the single irrigation were 119 9 12 2 mm 6 1 0 8 days 29 7 2 4 days 664 8 26 7 mm and 118 8 1 4 mm respectively during the 2002 2006 growing period and correspondingly were 156 0 18 4 mm 4 9 0 2 days 16 2 1 1 days 659 4 61 6 mm and 64 5 2 7 mm respectively during the 2012 2016 growing period fig 4a precipitation plus irrigation p i during the 2012 2016 growing period 815 4 59 5 mm was greater than that during the 2002 2006 growing period 784 7 36 0 mm p 0 05 and the p i in period 3 was higher than that in other periods under both scenarios fig 5 a c the source of irrigation water was predominantly groundwater during each study period fig 4b the maximum eta values were observed around july each year for the study period and total eta during the 2002 2006 growing period 754 1 17 5 mm was notably greater than that during the 2012 2016 growing period 634 3 11 3 mm fig 5c in the desert plot the total p was 93 9 and 108 2 19 9 mm during the 2005 2006 and 2012 2016 growing periods respectively fig 4g the time of occurrence of maximum eta values and eta distribution patterns were similar to the oasis plot fig 4h there was no clear difference in total eta between both scenarios fig 5d f 3 1 2 variations of soil water storage and exchange flux as shown in figs 4c i and 5 in the oasis plot the dynamics of the daily sws varied in both irrigation scenarios sws in the 0 150 cm layer under traditional flood irrigation scenario 507 7 23 1 mm was significantly higher than that under water saving irrigation scenario 439 2 11 7 mm p 0 05 fig 4c during the 2002 2006 and 2012 2016 growing seasons the sws change within the 0 150 cm depth δs decreased with the value of 37 1 36 9 and 19 8 13 1 mm respectively p 0 05 the change of sws per cm depth within the 150 cm depth δsd decreased 1 19 0 06 mm increased 0 62 0 03 mm respectively p 0 05 moreover both δs and δsd in period 1 were significantly larger than in other periods under both scenarios fig 5a c in the desert plot the daily sws within the 0 150 cm depth were not different between both scenarios which showed slight seasonal fluctuations due to rain pulses evapotranspiration and groundwater dynamics fig 4i during the 2005 2006 and 2012 2016 growing seasons the δs decreased with the value of 19 6 and 20 2 2 9 mm respectively however δsd increased with the value of 0 044 and 0 034 0 005 mm respectively fig 5d f as shown in figs 4d j and 5 in the oasis plot the daily water exchange flux dynamics in response to irrigation events under traditional flood irrigation scenario were more sensitive than that observed under water saving irrigation scenario fig 4d during the 2002 2006 and 2012 2016 growing seasons the total water exchange flux at 150 cm depth ef was 67 7 9 6 and 311 9 43 1 mm respectively p 0 01 the total water exchange flux above groundwater table efd was 167 5 23 0 and 86 8 11 7 mm respectively p 0 05 fig 5c accordingly the irrigation return flow coefficient i e the ratio of efd to total applied water reduced sharply from 0 21 0 09 during the 2002 2006 growing season to 0 09 0 01 during the 2012 2016 growing season in the desert plot most days experienced upward water fluxes due to extremely low precipitation and very high eta demand while there were some exceptions to rainy days because of weak infiltration and ef became larger at first and then gradually became smaller as the growing season progressed fig 4j during the 2005 2006 and 2012 2016 growing seasons ef was 172 4 and 134 3 20 5 mm respectively and efd was 199 0 and 191 5 21 4 mm respectively fig 5f the groundwater use coefficient i e the contribution of groundwater to eta was 0 96 during the 2005 2006 growing season periods 1 4 were 0 83 0 55 0 67 and 0 97 respectively and 0 81 0 03 during the 2012 2016 growing season periods 1 4 were 0 78 0 02 0 72 0 01 0 76 0 03 and 0 98 0 01 respectively 3 1 3 dynamics of groundwater table and lateral water flow as shown in figs 4e k and 5 in the oasis plot gtd showed a fluctuating downward trend with the extension of cotton growth period under both scenarios specifically the average gtd agtd was 2342 283 and 5099 279 mm during the 2002 2006 and 2012 2016 growing seasons respectively p 0 05 figs 4e and 5c in the desert plot gtd fluctuation during water saving irrigation period was notably larger than that during traditional flood irrigation period fig 4k whereas agtd during the 2012 2016 growing period 7558 13 mm was slightly shallower than that during the 2005 2006 growing period 7631 mm moreover the change in gtd δgtd in period 3 was remarkably larger than in other periods under both irrigation scenarios fig 5d f as shown in figs 4f l and 5 in the oasis plot the daily lf was closely related to the land surface recharge and groundwater dynamics within the analysis zone total lf outward during the 2002 2006 growing season 231 5 33 6 mm was significantly larger than that during the 2012 2016 growing season 131 9 23 6 mm p 0 05 moreover lf during each period was outward except for period 3 under both scenarios figs 4f and 5a c in the desert plot a positive linear correlation was detected between the daily lf and daily eta r 2 0 403 p 0 05 the flow direction of lf was inward on most days while there were some exceptions to the heavy rainy days total lf was inward during both the 2005 2006 159 4 m and 2012 2016 178 0 16 3 m growing seasons and total lf in period 3 was the largest under both scenarios figs 4l and 5d f 3 2 water dynamics and groundwater variations in the oasis desert system 3 2 1 spatial dynamics of soil water content in various soil layers under the ecgs swc had clear spatial differences among the soil depths along the swc transect fig 6 a1 swcs in the o5 o8 zone were notably higher than those in the o1 o4 zone particularly in the 100 cm soil layers mean swc in the adfo apou apol and desert were 13 16 0 53 15 29 0 63 14 99 0 53 and 1 39 0 18 respectively fig 6b under the lcgs the overall spatial similarity of swc among the layers along the transect was observed fig 6a2 swcs were similar and almost constant in the 0 80 cm layer 0 92 0 05 and lower than those in the 80 220 cm layer 1 43 0 11 from d1 to d4 mean swc in the adfo apou apol and desert were 19 94 0 91 15 01 0 55 14 30 0 52 and 1 72 0 15 respectively fig 6b by contrast the coefficient of variation cv standard deviation std and variance var of mean swc in each soil layer were lower under the lcgs than those under the ecgs table s2 moreover the curved shape of soil moisture probability distribution function pdf in 0 220 cm soil profiles in both the transect double peaked shape and the four hydrological regions single peaked shape showed no significant difference between the two stages fig 6c compared with the findings of zhao 2002 these results indicate that water saving irrigation practices can significantly reduce the spatial heterogeneity and profile variability of soil moisture at a regional scale furthermore significant correlation in the spatial pattern of swc between layers especially between two adjacent layers was found under both stages in the oasis and desert regions fig 7 in addition correlations between gtds and swcs among different layers were also observed along the transect 3 2 2 temporal variations of groundwater table in different landscapes clear differences in gtd and its dynamics were observed along the gtd transect fig 8 the mann kendall test results showed that the wells w1 w7 displayed decreasing trends and wells w8 w10 showed increasing trends the largest cv of gtd was observed in well w4 whereas the smallest was observed in wells w1 w2 and w8 w10 the gtd probability density function pdf patterns of wells w2 and w4 w7 were relatively scattered wells w1 and w8 w10 were relatively concentrated and well w3 had a less pronounced peak fig 8 in addition variations of gtd in the 10 wells can be classified into three major patterns pattern ⅰ stable wells w8 w10 with var and std of 0 01 0 04 and 0 06 0 19 respectively pattern ⅱ metastable wells w5 w7 represents periodic annual repetitive behaviours with var and std of 2 20 4 60 and 1 48 2 17 respectively pattern iii fluctuating wells w1 w4 describes the most erratic variation behaviours with var and std of 17 80 135 33 and 2 79 11 63 respectively the non parametric pettitt test and bayesian change point analysis provided similar results for detecting the sudden change points of gtd in wells w1 w10 from 1995 to 2016 fig s3 surprisingly the change points of gtd for all wells except well w1 were found to have occurred during 2006 2012 which represents the transition period of agricultural irrigation schemes from traditional flood irrigation to water saving irrigation by contrast both the seasonal gtd and the average annual gtd for wells w1 w7 under the traditional flood irrigation scenario 1995 2006 were shallower than under the water saving irrigation scenario 2012 2016 whereas the opposite patterns though weaker were observed for wells w8 w10 fig 9 moreover seasonal gtd fluctuation patterns in all wells exhibited significant differences between the both scenarios this indicates that the shift in regional irrigation scheme potentially causes the seasonality of groundwater resource availability changes in the oasis desert system 3 2 3 dynamic changes in surface water and groundwater interactions local precipitation and river water snowmelt water are two potential sources of groundwater recharge in the study area fig 10 a river water samples showed less variation in δ 18o and δ 2h values average 10 49 0 75 and 71 30 2 40 and most values were below the evaporation line el δ 2h 6 78δ 18o 0 80 r 2 0 86 which suggests that river water evaporates for a short time before infiltration to groundwater stable isotope values for most groundwater samples were plotted at the lower right of the local meteoric water line lmwl and the average value of δ 18o δ 2h in shallow and deep groundwater was 11 06 0 82 78 93 6 68 and 11 40 0 72 82 82 4 87 respectively fig 10a this indicates that there is a close hydraulic relationship between shallow and deep groundwater moreover the isotopic compositions of soil recharge water at eight sample sites so1 so4 sd1 sd4 in the oasis desert system were mostly located below the lmwl and were depleted in δ 2h than that in groundwater fig 10b this suggests that the soil water in the unsaturated zone mainly originates from atmospheric precipitation in the srw the comparisons between the measured and simulated values of the groundwater level for the 10 long term monitoring wells during the calibration and validation stages in the study area are shown in table s3 and fig s4 the simulation results of the groundwater level were generally satisfactory suggested that the modflow model with the calibrated parameters can be used for the simulation analysis of the hydrological cycle in the srw as shown in table 3 the annual groundwater budget was remarkably increased from 2844 104 m3 a 1 during 2002 2006 to 5227 104 m3 a 1 during 2012 2016 total recharge tr slightly decreased by 1 69 from traditional flood irrigation period 6052 m3 a 1 to water saving irrigation period 5950 m3 a 1 with the recharge of streamflow and reservoir increasing by 3 62 and 41 28 respectively total discharge td increased by 25 64 from traditional flood irrigation period 8896 m3 a 1 to water saving irrigation period 11177 m3 a 1 with the lateral discharge and groundwater pumping increasing by 4 84 and 53 47 respectively and the phreatic evaporation was reduced by 44 74 although both natural conditions and human activities were responsible for the annual groundwater budget change the effect of human activities e g gwe cla awu cps ucl was more profound in the last 23 years fig 11 the results indicate that human activities related to irrigated agriculture are triggering changes in groundwater budgets in the srw overall the development of irrigated agriculture is causing hydrological regimes in the oasis desert system to change dramatically and groundwater depletion is approaching hydrological limits leading to a disconnection of the groundwater and surface water systems as shown in fig 12 during the near natural period before 1950 fig 12a irrigated agriculture had limited impacts on hydrological processes surface water and groundwater interactions were weak and natural factors dominated the hydrological regime the groundwater table in the irrigated areas did not change much and the water table was relatively deep zhang et al 2014 during traditional flood irrigation period 1950 2006 fig 12b water balance and groundwater dynamics were notably altered by the rapid development of irrigated agriculture the frequent water exchange was maintained between oasis and desert areas groundwater in the alluvial diluvial fans was mainly recharged by lateral flow and accompanied by continuous groundwater extraction and the water table dropped sharply whereas groundwater in the alluvial diluvial plains was largely supplied by vertical recharge from the irrigation fields and the water table increased evidently during water saving irrigation period after 2012 fig 12c excessive groundwater pumping resulted in the continuous decline in groundwater table and the significant reduction in vertical infiltration recharge almost throughout the study area this is causing a shift in the surface water and groundwater exchanges reducing water discharge from oasis to desert and reshaping hydrologic landscape functions under a hypothetical future scenario i e water saving irrigation with over development fig 12d groundwater exploitation will increase dramatically and the water table will decline continuously groundwater and surface water systems will disconnect gradually and finally the hydrological regimes of the system will change completely 4 discussion 4 1 error analysis for water balance components estimations water balance analysis is a widely used method for quantifying the components of the water balance equations that cannot otherwise be directly measured tennakoon and milroy 2003 tang et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 gee and hillel 1988 pointed out that neutron probes measurements coupled with micrometeorological techniques provide a more reliable measurement of water balance components in this study the variabilities of ef estimate σef ef and lf estimate σlf lf were obtained using eqs 4 and 5 in the oasis plot σef ef and σlf lf for the four analysis periods and the entire growth season were 0 12 1 13 and 0 25 and 0 48 2 03 and 0 49 respectively under traditional flood irrigation and correspondingly were 0 07 0 16 and 0 03 and 0 57 0 79 and 0 36 respectively under water saving irrigation in the desert plot σef ef and σlf lf for the four analysis periods and the entire growth season were 0 02 0 07 and 0 01 and 0 03 0 34 and 0 08 respectively under traditional flood irrigation and correspondingly were 0 01 0 29 and 0 02 and 0 04 0 33 and 0 03 respectively under water saving irrigation the results suggest that the variabilities of both σef ef and σlf lf in the oasis plot under traditional flood irrigation were larger than those under water saving irrigation due to the differences in soil moisture variability and surface fluxes zhang et al 2014 and variabilities of both σef ef and σlf lf in the oasis plot were larger than those in the desert plot moreover we further analysed the impact of eta estimate σeta eta on σef ef and θ estimate σθ θ θ and δsd estimate σδ sd δsd on σlf lf using eqs 4 and 5 based on the field estimates under two scenarios at both plots the results suggest that the uncertainty in the eta term is the greatest potential source of error in determining ef and lf as reported in other studies scanlon et al 2002 allen et al 2011 han et al 2017 however owing to the recent rapid progress in measurement and bias correction of eta ef can be directly quantified by water balance analysis at field scale which can then be used to estimate groundwater dynamics zhang et al 2014 crosbie et al 2014 4 2 evaluation of hydrological regimes in oasis desert systems water balance is an important parameter for determining water dynamics in agricultural and natural ecosystems and its components are affected by both climatic conditions and human activities allen and ingram 2002 zhang et al 2014 in the studied area the increasing trend of precipitation in both plots is consistent with previous studies shi et al 2002 wu et al 2016 the characteristics of the variation of total evapotranspiration during the cotton growth period under different irrigation schemes support the results of zhang et al 2014 who found that compared with traditional flood irrigation water saving irrigation significantly reduced eta in the farmland the sws in the 0 150 cm soil layer of cotton field under traditional flood irrigation was much higher than that under water saving irrigation fig 4c furthermore vico and porporato 2010 reported that traditional irrigation tends to maintain higher mean soil moisture than microirrigation over the root zone however mulched drip irrigation can significantly increase the sws within the 150 cm depth with increasing precipitation and declining groundwater table in our study fig 5c this may be attributed to the fact that the thickening of the unsaturated zone can reduce groundwater recharge by increasing both the fraction of unsaturated zone water storage and the time lag between deep drainage and recharge cao and zheng 2016 han et al 2017 in addition the weak increments in sws in the desert plot in the soil surface were attributed to rainfall events whereas the dynamics of sws in the deep soil layer were caused by groundwater table fluctuations and soil temperature gradients yi et al 2015 du et al 2017 irrigation return flow is an important component of farmland hydrological processes and a vital source of water for downstream areas in arid regions dewandel et al 2008 simons et al 2015 hu et al 2017 compared with traditional flood irrigation the downward total ef in the oasis plot under mulched drip irrigation was remarkably increased due to increased precipitation events and continuous irrigation whereas the downward total efd was significantly reduced owing to the sharp decline of gtd and limited irrigation amount each time accordingly the outward total lf was clearly decreased fig 5c which is also confirmed by the findings of hu et al 2017 han and zhou 2018 and zheng et al 2019 however total ef and total efd were upward and total lf was inward with a slight increasing trend in the desert plot under both irrigation scenarios fig 5f the results indicate that groundwater is continuously transported to the surface to supply evapotranspiration through root absorption by deep rooted plants wu et al 2019b and water vapour diffusion in dry soils wang et al 2014b moreover the development of irrigated agriculture on the edge of the desert caused an increase in local desert lf the lf may also be caused by lateral groundwater inflows driven by flood irrigation from adjacent woodlands rather than the vertical infiltration of irrigation drainage han and zhou 2018 moreover seasonal variation of groundwater use coefficient in the desert plot is closely related to plant growth groundwater table dynamics and climate variability wu et al 2019b furthermore there are significant positive and negative correlations between groundwater pumping and the gwd change in the oasis r 2 0 90 p 0 01 and desert r 2 0 55 p 0 05 plots respectively soil water groundwater surface water interactions cover a broad range of hydrological processes at various spatio temporal scales which play an important role in the dynamics of natural hydrological systems reichard 1995 unland et al 2013 condon and maxwell 2019 in our study the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture along the swc transect under the water saving irrigation scenario was evidently lower than that under the traditional flood irrigation scenario zhao 2002 moreover swc had a clear depth dependence within the profile and correlation coefficients decreased with distance between layers under both ecgs and lcgs fig 7 these results are in agreement with those of other studies biswas and si 2011 li et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 zhang and shao 2013 furthermore the implementation of water saving irrigation agriculture on the desert edge increased the below 60 cm depth soil moisture at the desert edge due to oasis desert interactions li et al 2016 these soil water may potentially serve as a source of water for desert vegetation temporal variation of gtds exhibited three different patterns along the gtd transect fig 8 such patterns were also reported by wang et al 2014a in northwest china meanwhile gtds are exhibiting a continuous downward trend in both adfo and apou due to excessive groundwater pumping zhao 2002 and a slight upward trend in the oasis desert ecotone due to the additional groundwater recharge from large scale wasteland reclamation tang et al 2007 moreover the seasonality of groundwater availability is changing with the development of water saving irrigation agriculture in addition the infiltration pattern of soil water has changed under the water saving irrigation method and the rate of water use generally exceeds replenishment rate in the oasis area fig 10 and table 3 therefore groundwater storage depletion gradually becomes the dominant hydrological process in the watershed although the progression is largely masked by precipitation and streamflow variability han and zhou 2018 zheng et al 2019 it is important to note that the gradual deterioration of the regional hydrological regimes is the result of the excessive reclamation and over exploitation related to irrigated agriculture rather than irrigation itself 4 3 implications for sustainable water management anthropogenic activities especially the over exploitation associated with irrigation agricultural development can significantly affect the water balance hydrological cycle and groundwater dynamics and strengthen spatio temporal redistribution of regional water resources in arid regions han et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 han and zhou 2018 to avoid further deterioration of hydrological regimes and maintain the coexistence of oasis desert ecosystems in inland basins adaptation of water management which takes into account ecosystem environment and socioeconomics in a changing climate should be implemented throughout the region based on our analysis in the field trials and modelling previous research findings in related fields e g ma et al 2005 hu et al 2010 2017 zhang et al 2014 han and zhou 2018 and lessons drawn from global dryland development and management we provide the following recommendations for srw and other similar arid regions a to achieve highly efficient and sustainable development of irrigation in water limited oasis desert systems traditional irrigation should be gradually replaced by water saving irrigation optimum water saving irrigation and planting schedules should be constantly explored and the mulching drip irrigation technique should be prioritised zhang et al 2014 moreover the effects of different irrigation schemes for oasis desert interactions should be characterised b to ensure the seasonal availability of groundwater resources for oasis irrigation and desert vegetation the discharge of salts in downstream along with irrigation return flow foster et al 2018 and the dependence of desert vegetation on oasis drainage should be taken into account moreover the regional critical groundwater level interval and groundwater pumping threshold should be determined and rational allocation and scientific management of surface water resources should be implemented c to curb the impacts of human over development on regional sustainable water management e g the paradox of irrigation efficiency grafton et al 2018 and eco environmental health e g the soil salinization and vegetation degradation zhang et al 2014 the total water saving irrigated area should be limited most of the water savings gained through advanced water saving irrigation should be utilised for ecological purposes and physical water accounts need to be developed from the farm scale to basin scale to enact more efficient human water systems water governance liu et al 2015 d to address the challenges posed by climate change to agricultural activities such as agricultural risks from changing snowmelt qin et al 2020 and climate shift from warm dry to warm humid shi et al 2002 the potential impact of climate variability on regional hydrological regimes should be investigated by combining field experiments and integrated models and related dominant factors should be identified 5 conclusions in this study the effects of irrigated agricultural on hydrological regimes in an oasis desert system of northwestern china were determined by the water balance analysis method line transect survey method i e swc transect and gtd transect stable isotope 18o 2h techniques and the usgs modflow software the downward total exchange flux above the groundwater table and the outward total lateral groundwater flow reduced significantly in the oasis the spatial heterogeneity and profile variability of soil moisture along the swc transect reduced significantly and the depth dependence of swc in oasis cropland and the deep soil moisture at the edge of desert improved under the water saving irrigation scheme the temporal variations of gtds exhibited three different patterns along the gtd transect and almost all maintained a continuously decreasing trend and the shift in regional irrigation scheme caused the seasonality of groundwater resource availability changes the groundwater recharge and discharge processes changed dramatically groundwater depletion is now approaching hydrological limits although the process is largely masked by precipitation and streamflow variability our results suggested that water saving irrigation with restriction of reclamation and adaptation of water management is critical in maintaining the coexistence of oasis desert

4882,groundwater is an important water source for economic activities and human consumption currently this resource is being affected by intensive abstraction pollution and climatic change this study assessed the vulnerability and recharge of groundwater by weighted indices of an aquifer used for agricultural water supply in chihuahua mexico for current and future conditions the efficacy of the drastic model and modified versions were compared and were used to assess the vulnerability of a semi arid aquifer furthermore scenarios of vulnerability and recharge indices were projected to the nearest future 2015 2040 and distant future 2045 2069 through climate change and land use projections using rcp 4 5 and 8 5 three vulnerability zones were observed for every index with a common high vulnerability in the regions of agricultural land use vulnerability maps were also compared with groundwater quality k na and no3 indicating the southern regions of the aquifer are the most sensitive to pollution of groundwater indices with the highest accuracy of vulnerable zones were identified with the new drasticl and drstil methods the results obtained by the application of climate change scenarios show that the area of highest recharge decreases while aquifer vulnerability increases thus the deficit problem of replenishment from recharge to the aquifer remains from present conditions and has the potential to increase in the future in turn these consequences will also cause vulnerability of economic activities from the region and finally of social and economic security of the local populations that depend on the resource for agricultural water supply as well as for water land and food security keywords arid region contamination risk aquifer climatic variables water recharge cultivated zones 1 introduction regional depletion of groundwater is a worldwide problem where many groundwater systems are not depleted at rates way beyond replenishment and will jeopardize continued use by society and ecosystems since the 1950s groundwater irrigation has increased by a factor of ten in the whole world because of its easy access using well technology and a secure source of water in arid areas shah et al 2007 human activities on the land s surface have increased the intensive use of this resource contributing to degradation of groundwater quantity and quality antonakos and lambrakis 2007 in hydrogeology groundwater vulnerability is defined as the susceptibility of the aquifer to be polluted thapa et al 2018 beyond simple application of pollutants on the land surface the potential for aquifer water quality degradation can also include 1 the mobilization of natural contaminants such as trace metals hanson 2015 everett et al 2013 2 accumulation of organic attributes such as total dissolved carbon and nitrates from riparian habitats edmonds and gellenbeck 2002 long et al 1997 and 3 inter aquifer flow through short circuiting of contaminants to deeper aquifers through wellbore flow in wells screened over multiple aquifers konikow and hornberger 2006 hanson 2015 moreover climate change can further exacerbate these concerns with temperature increases that will increase evapotranspiration combined with reduced precipitation causing a reduction in ground water recharge as well as increased consumption of water and reduced sustainability harding et al 2014 combined with increased human demands for urban supply and agriculture climate change and increased human use are the two major threats to sustainability of water resources vörösmarty et al 2000 cooney 2012 there are few studies about the future vulnerability and availability of groundwater combined with the effects of climate change scenarios with almost all studies focused on historical and current conditions lu et al 2017 vulnerability index maps have been a tool for decision making concerning the protection and management of groundwater resources relative to pollution both statistical and numerical models are techniques for developing mapping schemes of aquifers vulnerability index focazio et al 2002 the most known and widely used methods are god foster and hirata 1988 avi van stempvoort et al 1993 drastic aller 1985 sintacs civita and de maio 1997 the drastic method uses statistical inference to focus on the potential vulnerability of aquifers to anthropogenic sources applied at the land surface that might infiltrate vertically to an unconfined shallow aquifer this method does not account for the geohydrologic framework and related layering of aquifer systems that could also control or prevent vertical migration of any potential contaminants vengosh et al 2002 russo 2012 however they help to identify areas that are susceptible to pollution as well as informative and educative plans about the need to protect the aquifers al abadi et al 2017 the objective of this study is an initial assessment of the vulnerability and recharge of jimenez camargo aquifer using the drastic method along with development and evaluation of improvements to this method the assessment of these improved methods included climate change scenarios projected to the future using rcp 4 5 and 8 5 for the assessment of potential vulnerability within this aquifer system these results have practical relevance for water resource planning as well as decision making about the agronomic urban and industrial uses for upcoming and future decades in the southeast part of the state of chihuahua thus the drastic method and improved versions used in this study provide indicators of vulnerability to some of these surface sources and helps to further evaluate how additional factors can further refine the assessment of vulnerability from anthropogenic sources applied at the land surface to address process ultimately the water quality data and drastic factors can also be evaluated within an integrated hydrologic model combined with transport or particle tracking plummer et al 2004 hanson et al 2013 2 materials and methods to develop vulnerability indices of the aquifer and improved vulnerability tools the following components were evaluated a computation of five vulnerability indices drastic model and improved versions b efficacy of drastic modified versions and c projection of precipitation temperature and land use through selected climate change scenarios for the analysis of potential future effects on recharge and vulnerability groundwater 2 1 study area the area used to evaluate these improved drastic methods is located in the subbasin of the florido river that includes the municipalities of camargo jiménez allende lópez coronado and matamoros fig 1 it comprises an area of approximately 9947 km2 fig 1a that is still predominantly native vegetation 86 3 with some intensive agricultural land use 13 4 and other minor uses 0 3 the major economic activities include ranching and agriculture land ownership of the 761 676 ha is mostly private the 55 4 of land use corresponds to continuous mechanized agriculture and 11 2 for traditional agriculture that uses industrial agricultural methods such as cultivation with plows inegi 2005 the land surface is covered by soil of alluvial origin that are derived from surrounding bedrock other rock types that form parts of the regional aquifer system include limestones igneous and sedimentary rocks with igneous rocks composing the largest portion of the aquifer system conagua 2018 fig 1b the water from the main rivers that cross the valley the florido and the parral rivers also is used in combination with groundwater for irrigation through diversion channels and direct diversions along the river channels fig 1c two storage reservoirs parral and pico de aguila dams capture store and supply surface water for irrigation 2 2 development of the new drastic indices the drastic model was originally developed by the environmental protection agency of the u s a epa aller 1985 this model is based on geological and hydrological parameters that could affect vertical groundwater movement from the land surface it assumes that pollution produced on the land surface can potentially vertically transport to the saturated zone of the underlying aquifers aller 1985 drastic provides a numerical index obtained from ratings and weights assigned to the modeled parameters each parameter class is given by a range from low 1 to high 10 vulnerability and are based on their relative effect on the vulnerability of the aquifer these model parameters are also weighted to reflect their relative importance from 1 less important to 5 most important in addition the model presents a classification system according to the impact on the soil general texture distribution and to the impact of conditions from agriculture and others anthropogenic activities ex pesticides and herbicides this addition to the original drastic uses the same parameters as drastic but with different weights the values scale was grouped into three categories low 50 100 medium 100 130 and high 130 in this study the models that were used were drastic for general conditions and the new versions of drastic called drastic pesticide p for intense agriculture conditions drasticl with the addition of the land use drasticl pesticide p as a version for intense agriculture conditions and drstil version with the parameters representing the layers of the aquifer and hydraulic conductivity removed from the model the vulnerability index by drastic uses eq 1 1 drastic d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where d is the depth to the unconfined groundwater r is the annual natural recharge a is the aquifer material lithology of the aquifer s is soil media the texture of soil t is the topography slope i is the impact of the vadose zone and c is the rock type vertical hydraulic conductivity the sub indices r and w represent the rating of the parameter and an assigned weight for the parameters respectively additional pesticide conditions are summarized in supplementary material for the new drasticl model the additional layer of the land use was added l and related term in the analysis the application results are advantageous because it reflects the impact of diverse activities developed over the land surface sahoo et al 2016 drasticl uses eq 2 2 drasticl d r d w r r rw a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w l r l w finally the simplified version of drastic drstil has the factors of the aquifer media a and hydraulic conductivity c omitted this approach omits the flow length and dispersion of the pollutants considered throughout the aquifer system li and merchant 2013 herrera et al 2018 however this method was modified to include the additional attribute of land use l to estimate the impact of agriculture as a potential source of artificial recharge and related pollutants this version of the drastic model uses eq 3 3 drstil d r d w r r r w s r s w t r t w i r i w l r l w 2 2 1 description and estimation of drastic layers the description and estimation of every layer used in this work are summarized in table 1 the complete information of drastic layers is described in the supplementary material for the d and r layers an interpolation was made with ordinary kriging from the geostatistical analyst extension of arc gis esri 2014 while for the t layer a slope was estimated with the slope method of the surface extension of arc gis esri 2014 2 2 2 sensitive analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of drastic methods two analyses were applied single parameter sensitivity and map removal sensitivity measure al abadi et al 2017 pacheco et al 2015 tomer et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 the map removal sensitivity method identifies the sensitivity of the vulnerability map towards removing one or more layers from vulnerability analysis the sensitivity is estimated with eq 4 4 s i v n v n where si is the sensitivity v and v are the unperturbed and the perturbed vulnerability indices respectively n and n are the number of data layers used to compute v and v the calculated vulnerability index obtained by using all factors is considered as an unperturbed parameter while the vulnerability computed using a lower number of data layers was considered as a perturbed parameter the single parameter sensitivity measure evaluates the impact of each of the drastic factors on the vulnerability index this analysis compares the effective weight of each input factor for a polygon with the theoretical weight assigned by the analytic drastic model the effective weight of each polygon is obtained with eq 5 5 w pi p r p w v 100 where w refers to effective weight for each factor pr and pw are the rating and weighting values of each factor and v was defined previously 2 2 3 comparison of the vulnerability index by water quality values an evaluation and comparison of the vulnerability indices were estimated with pearson and spearman correlations these correlations were performed between vulnerability areas with chemical species such as total dissolved solids tds sulfates so4 2 calcium ca magnesium mg chloride cl potassium k and sodium na as well as nitrates an agricultural byproduct from chemical fertilization chemical species concentrations from selected wells from conagua surveys between 2002 and 2019 conagua 2002 conagua 2019 a pearson correlation matrix de sas 2006 allowed comparison across all attributes of indices and groundwater sample chemical attributes a spearman correlation rho also was used to remove the restriction caused by the general distribution form of two variables and the sample size lake et al 2003 zhao et al 2018 with eq 6 6 ρ 1 6 i 1 n d i 2 n n 2 1 where n is sample size and d is the rank difference between groundwater vulnerability and nitrate concentration level 2 2 4 model discrimination analysis anova was used to analyze for potential of a statistical differences between models drastic and new versions to 95 reliability all of the drastic versions were normalized using the box cox method sas 2006 and a tukey test to compare multiple means of factors analyzed sas 2006 2 3 vulnerability indices on climate change scenarios to obtain the vulnerability indices on projected scenarios of climate change the recharge of the aquifer was computed according to projected future temperature variation and precipitation as well as the projection to potential changes in land use the scenarios were projected into two future periods representing the nearest future 2015 2040 and the distant future 2045 2069 2 3 1 climate change scenarios climate scenarios used the atlas climático digital de méxico acdm fernández eguiarte et al 2012 centro de ciencias de la atmosfera 2012 and the model of the national centre of meteorological research cnrm cm5 national centre for meteorological research 2014 each climatic scenario was structured for two radiative forcings of greenhouse gas emissions rcp representative concentration paths by the year 2069 4 5 and 8 5 these prescribed pathways for co2 concentrations joined to land use change are widely used to model the climatic future scenarios san josé et al 2016 these climatic scenarios represent an increase of 29 and 125 by the end of the 21st century respectively over current co2 emission 416 2 ppm 2 3 2 projected recharge of the aquifer the annual potential recharge under these scenarios was obtained by the difference between annual projected precipitation and evapotranspiration et li and merchant 2013 the projected et was computed from the empirical turc equation herrera et al 2018 rodríguez huerta et al 2020 this was obtained from eqs 7 and 8 7 e t p 0 9 p 2 l 2 8 l 300 25 t 0 005 t 3 where p is precipitation mm yr and t is temperature degrees celsius 2 3 3 statistical analysis a paired two tailed t test was applied to analyze the significance of the statistical differences between climatic parameters such as precipitation actual evapotranspiration and recharge projected to rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios in the nearest and the distant future periods 2 3 4 projection of land use for a greater consistency with the climate change model the land use layer was also modified to reflect the potential conditions for the nearest future 2015 2039 and distant future 2045 2069 two satellite images were used for years 1997 landsat 5 thematic mapper tm and for 2017 landsat 8 operational land imager oli from the u s geological survey usgs glovis 2016 the land use classification was developed with cluster analysis from the idrisi selva program eastman 2012 prediction of land use change was estimated with the ca markov model hamad et al 2018 the projected land use maps were validated by validate module of idrisi selva where the estimated statistic kappa k with values greater or equal to 0 6 are considered acceptable escandón calderón et al 2018 3 results 3 1 classification of layers the reclassified layers obtained by drastic are shown in fig 2 depth to groundwater varies widely from 9 m to 30 m fig 2a likewise the aquifer is widely composed of alluvial material 54 that fills the lower parts of valley fig 2b and c slopes for the study area range from 6 to 12 whereas in the upper parts of the valley and mountains with igneous and sedimentary rocks show steeper slopes 18 fig 2d these bedrocks formations delineate the surface boundaries of the aquifer with sedimentary rocks composing the northeast limit of the aquifer these higher elevations also are composed of calcareous and conglomeritic rocks which is formed by las pampas las margaritas el mimbre and los acebuches mountain ranges inegi 2005 the southeastern bedrock area also includes an open area filled by alluvial material fig 2e the 14 of aquifer area showed low permeability due to extrusive igneous rocks outcrop 10 6 cm s located to the northern and the southwester see fig 2d and e the surface soils and sedimentary alluvium are composed of medium and fine grained texture alluvium fig 2f 78 and 19 respectively thus medium grained texture soils supporting most of native vegetation while fine grained texture areas are coincident with riparian and agricultural areas fig 2g the recharge layer showed three ranges of values for recharge with the highest values ranging from 102 to 178 mm y this high recharge zone occurs at the southeast part of the aquifer fig 2h according with the highest precipitation and lowest evapotranspiration conditions see results in supplementary material fig sd1a b doe 2019 as well as medium grained soil texture and native vegetation to the southeast of the aquifer the san gabriel and pico de aguila reservoirs conagua 2020 as well as la estacada lagoon and the florido river are within these recharge zones secretaría general de gobierno 2019 3 2 sensitivity analysis the aquifer media mean 7 and soil texture mean 5 layer are the main contributors to pollution risk in the aquifer based on the drastic vulnerability indices depth to the water table recharge topography and vertical hydraulic conductivity also showed moderate risk contribution to the aquifer however contributions of every layer to the different versions of the drastic models used sensitivity was estimated from single parameters and map removal analysis the layer contribution to the drastic vulnerability index as well as sensitivity analysis results are summarized in supplementary material the single parameter sensitivity analysis revealed that impact of the vadose zone aquifer media and soil texture layers tend to be the most sensitive parameters in the vulnerability assessment to drastic and drasticl this is due to their mean effective weights are higher than their respective theoretical weights in drstil index impact of the vadose zone and soil texture layers were the most sensitive the map removal sensitivity analysis also showed that the impact of the vadose zone was the layer with highest mean rating for drastic 4 2 drasticl 3 4 and drstil 4 7 thus the impact of vadose zone mean 6 8 is the major contributor to the high contamination risk in jimenez camargo aquifer impact of the vadose zone aquifer media and soil texture are intimately related due to water rock soil interactions several contaminants can be leached hence their transport to deeper groundwater depends on parameters such as porosity including capillary fringe and rock fractures and permeability on the other hand the topography recharge and land use layers are highly variable in the analysis of vulnerability index by drastic with variation coefficients of 94 75 5 and 74 2 respectively the variability of these layers also will be the main parameters to predict the behavior of vulnerability index in future scenarios 3 3 vulnerability indices the spatial distribution of vulnerability indices of low moderate and high categories according to weighted value assigned and obtained from the analysis of drastic and modified drastic methods fig 3 the drastic index was found in a range from 67 to 141 and it showed moderate vulnerability 57 and 23 of high vulnerability vulnerability was highest mainly in the southern part of the aquifer fig 3a where the high recharge alluvial material and sedimentary rock outcrops and some surface water bodies are located precipitation and applied water also can be leaching some chemical species from these rocks and transporting them down to the groundwater the water table depth is also relatively less in this bedrock area than the alluvial areas fig 2a even though the range for the drastic p index values ranged from 58 to 161 similar to drastic the high and moderate vulnerabilities zones reduced their area in 6 and 23 respectively fig 3a1 where the low vulnerability zone increased to cover half the area of aquifer the vulnerability index is predominantly low is in zones where the fine grained soils are present fig 2f this is due to in this version drastic p the soil texture layer has a higher weight these particles on the surface produce low permeability reducing water infiltration much of the soil has developed a desert crust that is smooth and hardened surface from continuous processes of wetting and drying climatic condition and related accumulation of fine grained particles in addition moderate vulnerability zone spreads where the alluvial material moderate recharge and native vegetation are present fig e g and h the aquifer area is mainly covered by scrub and grassland 88 of the total aquifer area as with drastic the highest vulnerability was found to the south the higher vulnerability areas are in zones where the sedimentary rocks and alluvial material are located fig 2e with vertical hydraulic conductivity of 10 4 cm s the drasticl index range of values 82 to 181 were higher than those results from drastic version this vulnerability index includes the land use layer fig 2 obtaining low vulnerability for more than a half of the aquifer area the main contributor parameters to uncertainty were the land use l and topography t with variances of 10 and 8 respectively nevertheless high vulnerability is well delineated in areas with agricultural and urban land use fig 2g thus additional and relatively higher vulnerability can be attributed to the anthropogenic activities associated with agricultural and urban land use both activities can modify the soil structure and composition producing a higher exposure to potential pollutants similarly in drasticl p the vulnerability ranged from 73 to 201 where moderate vulnerability increased to cover 39 of the aquifer area the vulnerability areas delineated with drasticl p are located in similar zones than those obtained by drasticl however it is now also taking into account the soil texture finally when lithology layer of the aquifer was removed to the drastic using drstil the vulnerability ranged from 59 to 148 with the high vulnerability area of 31 this increase is mainly attributed to land use topography recharge and unconfined water table depth the anova analysis showed significant differences between drastic and their versions 0 0001 these differences are mainly due to land use layer thus two groups were identified the first group is integrated by drasticl and dristil while the second group includes drastic and drastic p this highlights the importance of tracking land use as well as the application of pesticides and herbicides for example in california usa there is a requirement to report all applications and amounts along with crop type application date and location this information is integrated into a publicly available database called california pesticide inventory program calpip california department of pesticide regulation 2019 3 4 comparison of the vulnerability indices the maps of vulnerability were compared using correlations with parameters of groundwater quality conagua 2002 significant correlations of na k and no3 were found for drasticl and drstil p 0 05 the mean concentrations of na k and no3 from aquifer well samples were 164 mg l 1 26 mg l 1 and 4 12 mg l 1 respectively the pearson correlation drasticl showed correlations of 0 6 and 0 5 with na and k respectively while drstil just had a significant correlation with k 0 5 and none of the parameters showed correlation with no3 moreover the spearman correlation for the three chemical species na k and no3 showed significant correlation with drstil of 0 5 these results suggest that the original form of drastic did not reflect actual groundwater vulnerability huan et al 2012 conversely drasticl and drstil vulnerability maps are reasonable for this study area these results suggest that the addition or subtraction of layers and the weight changes improved the correlation value similar improved relations were obtained from published studies sahoo et al 2016 3 5 assessment of the vulnerability indices for climate change scenarios the evapotranspiration precipitation and recharge parameters were analyzed using rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios for both the nearest future 2015 2040 and distant future 2045 2069 periods figs 4 and 5 the vulnerability index assessment included statistical analysis of the parameters precipitation evapotranspiration recharge tmax and tmin table 2 the evapotranspiration precipitation and recharge have similar spatial distribution but different magnitudes for rcpˈs 4 5 fig 4 and 8 5 fig 5 in both future periods the highest evapotranspiration and precipitation values tend to be present in the southern parts of the aquifer for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and future periods these two parameters showed similar values in the nearest future for the rcpˈs 4 5 and 8 5 but increased in the distant future for rcp4 5 while decreasing for rcp8 5 higher evapotranspiration 64 82 and precipitation 27 115 increase relative to historical values for both future periods and both rcp scenarios the highest values of evapotranspiration and precipitation are expected in the southern part of the aquifer figs 4a b 5a b for an r 0 9 p 0 05 for both scenarios and future periods sedimentary rocks compose the southeastern part of aquifer combined with shallow unconfined water table depths fig 3a where the groundwater will be more exposed to high temperature with surface water the main source of irrigation for cultivated areas in that region the increased evaporation and evapotranspiration also will increase the irrigation demand from both groundwater and surface water similarly under scenarios of increased co2 emissions the agriculture irrigation demand in the central valley california drove additional undesirable effects such as land subsidence and reduced streamflow hanson et al 2012 2010 zhu et al 2020 the projections from analysis with idrisi selva on the land use layer showed an increase in the estimated size of future agricultural land use the reliability of this projection was acceptable with a kappa index value of 0 68 this analysis showed an increase from the current agricultural land use of 13 4 to 24 8 for the period 2015 2040 this potential land use expansion is located in areas with favorable alluvial soils and smooth topographic slopes conversely the future urban land use is projected to decrease by 3 from 2015 to 2040 to 2045 2069 the highest potential recharge is expected in the southern regions of the aquifer for both rcp scenarios and future periods however recharge is projected to be slightly larger in the nearest future 2015 2040 than in the subsequent future period 2045 2069 figs 4 and 5 with precipitation and et projected to increase table 2 demand and consumption at the land surface will be greater that will result in a net reduction of water availability for recharge 100 mm y much of this larger recharge zone in both future periods can be attributed to vertical infiltrations from surface reservoirs such as pico de aguila dam and other reservoir dams and lakes located in the southern aquifer region fig 4e and f a decrease in the high recharge area was estimated for both rcp scenarios and future period in rcp 4 5 the high recharge area in the nearest future is 157 km2 but dramatically decreases to 0 7 km2 in the distant future the high recharge area decreases even more in the rcp 8 5 than in future periods of the rcp4 5 table 2 fig 5e and f for rcp8 5 the high recharge area decreases to 0 3 km2 in 2015 2040 and is projected to potentially disappear completely in 2045 2069 the recharge parameter showed correlations with precipitation r 0 55 p 0 05 and tmin r 0 53 p 0 05 even though precipitation values are not less in futures periods relative to the current period and recharge is also affected by tmin r 0 75 p 0 05 temperature is one of the most important parameters when climatic change is assessed the projected range of temperatures is similar for both rcp scenarios within both future periods table 2 however the range of temperature between 2015 and 2040 and 2045 2069 is significantly different for rcp4 5 both with a temperature increase of 0 8 c similarly tmax and tmin averages increase more by approximately 1 5 c from 2015 to 2040 to 2045 2069 in rcp8 5 this suggests that aquifer recharge will be affected by t especially with the tmin which is correlated with precipitation in agricultural areas where the evapotranspiration is projected to increase dramatically this will require larger amounts of irrigation even though this could drive increased artificial recharge from inefficient irrigation there is also increased pumpage that can results in a larger and more rapid declines of groundwater levels and a potential initiation of land subsidence hanson et al 2010 zhu et al 2020 based on the future values of recharge and the land use as well as the statistical analysis the vulnerability maps were developed with the drstil and drasticl indices using rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for both future periods fig 6 drasticl shows greater areas with high vulnerability ranging from 35 rcp 4 5 distant future to 37 rcp 8 5 nearest future of the total aquifer area these areas are located in the south area of greatest recharge and are coincident with the alluvial parts of the aquifer coincident with agricultural land use overall the drstil showed a lower range of vulnerability than drasticl and was similar for each rcp scenario and future period the higher vulnerability zones from drstil range from 17 rcp4 5 distant future to 25 rcp4 5 nearest future of the total aquifer area for rcp8 5 the percentage of the vulnerability areas is very similar between nearest and distant future the areas of highest vulnerability are coincident with the agricultural land use areas medium recharge areas figs 4 and 5 e f g and mainly accentuated to the east and north fig 6e h finally drasticl showed increased high vulnerability areas of the aquifer from current to futures scenarios from 22 to 34 fig 6 this can be attributed to the potential increase of areas agricultural areas for future periods conversely drstil results showed a potential decrease in high vulnerability areas in futures periods relative to current conditions this may be related to the projected reduction of high recharge zones however the leaching and transport of pollutants from aquifer media is not part of this method s evaluation and its effect remains uncertain within the drastic evaluations 4 discussion the methods developed here provide a broader approach to drastic analysis and indicates that land use layer gave the high vulnerability for the aquifer in this study high and moderate vulnerability found in this work is consistent with places of arid climate and agricultural land use li and merchant 2013 neshat et al 2014 zair et al 2017 bhaskar et al 2018 rodríguez huerta et al 2020 kløve et al 2014 groundwater with high concentrations of na k and no3 may be related to leaching from aquifer geology as well as from soils in cultivated lands hernández 2012 the presence of these chemical species in groundwater samples confirmed the vulnerability areas found by drastic similar correlation using nitrates r 0 5 p 0 05 from agricultural practices have also been documented as vulnerabilities in aquifers from greece india pakistan and poland khan et al 2019 kozłowski and sojka 2019 sahoo et al 2016 panagopoulos et al 2006 in addition these pollutants have not been directly related to hydraulic conductivity and soil in the aquifer vulnerability assessments panagopoulos et al 2006 the high vulnerability zones are coincident with agricultural land use as well as areas with the higher elevations and related greater precipitation and in southern parts of the aquifer where there are also reservoirs which also can contribute to the leaching and transport to the shallow groundwater tables the relief and related slope of the land surface favors a greater runoff through some rivers which transport water to low zones in the valley thus greater slope areas disfavors the aquifer recharge and favor greater runoff that yield low or moderate groundwater recharge cazanezcu and cazanezcu 2010 the new modified versions of drastic also are more efficient by including the land use layer which in turn helps to identify the importance of sub regional forcing related to land use for example the impact of agricultural land use on aquifer recharge results in the larger volumes of water used for irrigation that cause larger artificial recharge to the aquifer due to inefficient irrigation saida et al 2017 bhaskar et al 2018 gonzález hosseini moghari et al 2019 the study region used for comparison of the drastic methods and estimation of climate change has dry conditions and is an important agricultural area which is the main economic source to local inhabitants over the last 40 years there has been an accelerated increase of groundwater use for irrigation along with increased groundwater pumpage lópez et al 2011 the predominant agriculture in the region are pecans orchards 65 7 with a total surface of 247 969 ha and have increased owing to high export demand up to 89 since 1980 conagua 2018 conagua 2002 along with increases in other sesonal crops with high water demand such as alfalfa 32 8 grain corn 0 6 oat 0 4 and sorghum 0 4 sagarpa 2011 thus jimenez camargo aquifer is under increased water demand and hardened demand from long term orchards that require water over decades and not just seasonal or interannual demands for irrigation the jimenez camargo aquifer is in overexploited status with a groundwater deficit of 135 3 hm3 y conagua 2018 hernández 2012 yet the mexican authorities have granted 284 hm3 y of groundwater to agriculture with about 20 artificial recharge from inefficient irrigation 56 9 hm3 y here the estimation of natural vertical recharge is 116 4 hm3 y producing a total recharge of 173 3 hm3 y however the water abstraction measured is 303 1 hm3 y with 5 5 hm3 y of natural discharge by springs showing a depletion in the groundwater storage streamflow capture and reduced discharge inflow budgets which is not sustainable even with an increase in precipitation 100 mm projections of climate change scenarios for both rcp scenarios this analysis shows a reduction of area in the highest potential recharge areas figs 4 and 5 in the future scenarios the aquifer area shows an overall decrease in recharge relative to historical conditions this suggests that reduced recharge is due to the sum of two main causes a precipitation increase in the same area where evapotranspiration is also larger and b minimum temperature is increasing into future which also drives larger evapotranspiration and potential increased demand for irrigation with overall hotter temperatures and longer growing seasons in the historical scenario the recharge average is about 33 from precipitation table 2 but in the projected scenarios the average water recharged from precipitations will be about 13 5 higher temperatures produce an increase in evaporation from surface water bodies present in that area which reduces the contact area for infiltration and the amount of surface water available for irrigation in addition the change in temperature patterns force the biota to modify its biochemical activity resulting in an increase of water demand bhaskar et al 2018 kløve et al 2014 these projections under climate change show a decrease in the area of agricultural land use into the future this difference can be attributed to aquifer storage depletion related to increased irrigation demands of perennial and seasonal crops in the study area in addition the overexploitation of aquifers from agricultural demands will also result in a loss of water quality causing even higher vulnerability under this condition the irrigated soils can present high amounts of salts which result in additional pumpage and irrigation to leach salts from the root zone hanson et al 1994 cahn and bali 2015 boyce et al 2019 rodríguez huerta et al 2020 fries et al 2020 mendieta mendoza et al 2020 consequently farmlands will need major quantities of irrigation under climate change scenarios that will also include salinity issues the vulnerability maps show an approximation of how future changes to vulnerability will affect the potential distribution of usable groundwater li and merchant 2013 albornoz euán et al 2017 lu et al 2017 in this study the drastic approach has helped to understand the potential vulnerability of aquifer under the effects of recharge and the land use that when combined with climate variations can drive increasing vulnerability for both indices as well as increased water infiltration that can transport pollutants to shallow unconfined groundwater with further water quality degradation therefore it is necessary to consider the impacts of these pollutants on its destination and paths of infiltration because they are highly variable and can be very hard to predict as they can by trapped in soil strata that make up the layers of the aquifer within these water cycles of supply and demand the groundwater levels continue to decrease with the decreased recharge increased vegetation covering and increased rate of groundwater pumpage fries et al 2020 chen et al 2018 in a similar study of an aquifer in yucatan mexico where precipitation values are 1050 mm and temperature was estimated to increase by 0 62 c and 0 72 c were coincident with estimates of reduced groundwater recharge of 23 and 20 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively rodríguez huerta et al 2020 in this study area with dry conditions the jimenez chihuahua aquifer there is an estimated groundwater recharge reduction of about 47 for both rcpˈs this is a lower estimate than the current estimate of groundwater use and must be taken into account for the sustainability of the resource it is important to point out the semi arid regions includes developed agricultural areas while seasonal rains can contribute to natural groundwater recharge it is also necessary to assess the artificial recharge from inefficient irrigation artificial recharge depends on when and where the precipitation evapotranspiration and increment of cultivated zones are occurring and this was not part of any of these drastic methods used in this study for instance in the central valley of california the evapotranspiration is higher annually than precipitation but precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in winter season and artificial recharge from inefficient irrigation exceeds spring summer evapotranspiration on a monthly basis faunt et al 2009 the related climate change analysis performed with an integrated hydrologic model hanson et al 2012 showed the importance of evaluating local climatic variability and climate change as this will help to improve water budgets and supply and demand dynamics within climatic change and its impacts on surface water and groundwater use and movement moreover these kind of studies must also include the simulation of flow and related analysis of fate and transport of contaminants which represents many decades of model simulation though to get long enough travel paths to assess any potential change in water quality relative to nearby well and surface water return flow samples central valley salinity coalition 2012 the comparison of the drastic methods and the efficacy of this analysis with related vulnerability maps provides a baseline for developing policies and decisions concerning the protection and management of water resources some strategies that could contribute to more sustainable groundwater budgets may include a efficient measuring and monitoring of groundwater pumpage b irrigation management irrigation scheduling methods c parcel planning as well as to limit the opening of new agricultural lands c mapping land use on an annual or seasonal basis d implementation of crops with less water requirements and use of more efficient irrigation methods and e raising promoting the governance of conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water by the social sectors government population private industry through environmental education and modernized governance 5 conclusions in this study the potential effects on vulnerability and availability of groundwater from the jimenez camargo aquifer was obtained by the development of modified drastic methods this study shows that drasticl and drstil have better skill than other forms of drastic to detect the vulnerability areas where the impact of the vadose zone and land use attributes are the main contributors to the aquifer vulnerability this study also showed that the current higher vulnerability is located in the southern part of this aquifer and the groundwater pollution may also be related to nitrates sodium and potassium from agricultural activities furthermore drastic versions were applied for climate change assessments on the study area these methodologies also showed that topography recharge and land use variables are useful to predict changes in projected future climate change scenarios and related future changes in vulnerability and availability for groundwater the climate change scenarios projected a negative effect in the areal extent of recharge zones as well as an increase of high vulnerability for the aquifer in future scenarios evaluated high vulnerability showed a spatial increment towards to the east and north of the aquifer area according to the projected expansion of agricultural land use zones therefore with higher co2 emissions there could be more significant reductions for the recharge replenishment to the underlying aquifers combined with an expected increase of land use for nearest future these agricultural land use areas will show a decrease in land use for distant future period this is related to the reduction of water for irrigation driving a potential reduction in agricultural land use this will in turn generate higher vulnerability within the agricultural land use which may further exacerbate the problem of groundwater depletion and overexploitation of the aquifers while this initial assessment outlines the potential vulnerability and relations of vulnerability a more comprehensive evaluation also is needed that includes a holistic assessment of the environmental social and economic components of supply and demand for conjunctive use of all water to achieve a more complete water management system it will require a complete frameworks of monitoring systems integrated hydrologic modeling of alternate climate change scenarios and modeling the initial components from a broader conjunctive use and sustainability framework boyce et al 2020 this will help to develop relevant strategies aimed at sustainability through potential reductions and increased efficiencies in use of water and land resources additionally it will demand outreach to the general population water purveyors agricultural producers as well as state and federal agencies that oversee water management are stewarding the resources and are better informed about these conditions trends and vulnerabilities without an integral approach to management and growth such as additional agricultural land use could result in potential threats to water and food security and higher risk of pollution combined with reduced sustainability of water resources thus monitoring modeling and informed management will help to further identify and mitigate the vulnerabilities identified in this initial study and guide the governance development and mitigation of water uses that includes the sustainable use of surface water combined with groundwater and land use subject to climate change and climate variability credit authorship contribution statement mendieta mendoza aurora

4882,groundwater is an important water source for economic activities and human consumption currently this resource is being affected by intensive abstraction pollution and climatic change this study assessed the vulnerability and recharge of groundwater by weighted indices of an aquifer used for agricultural water supply in chihuahua mexico for current and future conditions the efficacy of the drastic model and modified versions were compared and were used to assess the vulnerability of a semi arid aquifer furthermore scenarios of vulnerability and recharge indices were projected to the nearest future 2015 2040 and distant future 2045 2069 through climate change and land use projections using rcp 4 5 and 8 5 three vulnerability zones were observed for every index with a common high vulnerability in the regions of agricultural land use vulnerability maps were also compared with groundwater quality k na and no3 indicating the southern regions of the aquifer are the most sensitive to pollution of groundwater indices with the highest accuracy of vulnerable zones were identified with the new drasticl and drstil methods the results obtained by the application of climate change scenarios show that the area of highest recharge decreases while aquifer vulnerability increases thus the deficit problem of replenishment from recharge to the aquifer remains from present conditions and has the potential to increase in the future in turn these consequences will also cause vulnerability of economic activities from the region and finally of social and economic security of the local populations that depend on the resource for agricultural water supply as well as for water land and food security keywords arid region contamination risk aquifer climatic variables water recharge cultivated zones 1 introduction regional depletion of groundwater is a worldwide problem where many groundwater systems are not depleted at rates way beyond replenishment and will jeopardize continued use by society and ecosystems since the 1950s groundwater irrigation has increased by a factor of ten in the whole world because of its easy access using well technology and a secure source of water in arid areas shah et al 2007 human activities on the land s surface have increased the intensive use of this resource contributing to degradation of groundwater quantity and quality antonakos and lambrakis 2007 in hydrogeology groundwater vulnerability is defined as the susceptibility of the aquifer to be polluted thapa et al 2018 beyond simple application of pollutants on the land surface the potential for aquifer water quality degradation can also include 1 the mobilization of natural contaminants such as trace metals hanson 2015 everett et al 2013 2 accumulation of organic attributes such as total dissolved carbon and nitrates from riparian habitats edmonds and gellenbeck 2002 long et al 1997 and 3 inter aquifer flow through short circuiting of contaminants to deeper aquifers through wellbore flow in wells screened over multiple aquifers konikow and hornberger 2006 hanson 2015 moreover climate change can further exacerbate these concerns with temperature increases that will increase evapotranspiration combined with reduced precipitation causing a reduction in ground water recharge as well as increased consumption of water and reduced sustainability harding et al 2014 combined with increased human demands for urban supply and agriculture climate change and increased human use are the two major threats to sustainability of water resources vörösmarty et al 2000 cooney 2012 there are few studies about the future vulnerability and availability of groundwater combined with the effects of climate change scenarios with almost all studies focused on historical and current conditions lu et al 2017 vulnerability index maps have been a tool for decision making concerning the protection and management of groundwater resources relative to pollution both statistical and numerical models are techniques for developing mapping schemes of aquifers vulnerability index focazio et al 2002 the most known and widely used methods are god foster and hirata 1988 avi van stempvoort et al 1993 drastic aller 1985 sintacs civita and de maio 1997 the drastic method uses statistical inference to focus on the potential vulnerability of aquifers to anthropogenic sources applied at the land surface that might infiltrate vertically to an unconfined shallow aquifer this method does not account for the geohydrologic framework and related layering of aquifer systems that could also control or prevent vertical migration of any potential contaminants vengosh et al 2002 russo 2012 however they help to identify areas that are susceptible to pollution as well as informative and educative plans about the need to protect the aquifers al abadi et al 2017 the objective of this study is an initial assessment of the vulnerability and recharge of jimenez camargo aquifer using the drastic method along with development and evaluation of improvements to this method the assessment of these improved methods included climate change scenarios projected to the future using rcp 4 5 and 8 5 for the assessment of potential vulnerability within this aquifer system these results have practical relevance for water resource planning as well as decision making about the agronomic urban and industrial uses for upcoming and future decades in the southeast part of the state of chihuahua thus the drastic method and improved versions used in this study provide indicators of vulnerability to some of these surface sources and helps to further evaluate how additional factors can further refine the assessment of vulnerability from anthropogenic sources applied at the land surface to address process ultimately the water quality data and drastic factors can also be evaluated within an integrated hydrologic model combined with transport or particle tracking plummer et al 2004 hanson et al 2013 2 materials and methods to develop vulnerability indices of the aquifer and improved vulnerability tools the following components were evaluated a computation of five vulnerability indices drastic model and improved versions b efficacy of drastic modified versions and c projection of precipitation temperature and land use through selected climate change scenarios for the analysis of potential future effects on recharge and vulnerability groundwater 2 1 study area the area used to evaluate these improved drastic methods is located in the subbasin of the florido river that includes the municipalities of camargo jiménez allende lópez coronado and matamoros fig 1 it comprises an area of approximately 9947 km2 fig 1a that is still predominantly native vegetation 86 3 with some intensive agricultural land use 13 4 and other minor uses 0 3 the major economic activities include ranching and agriculture land ownership of the 761 676 ha is mostly private the 55 4 of land use corresponds to continuous mechanized agriculture and 11 2 for traditional agriculture that uses industrial agricultural methods such as cultivation with plows inegi 2005 the land surface is covered by soil of alluvial origin that are derived from surrounding bedrock other rock types that form parts of the regional aquifer system include limestones igneous and sedimentary rocks with igneous rocks composing the largest portion of the aquifer system conagua 2018 fig 1b the water from the main rivers that cross the valley the florido and the parral rivers also is used in combination with groundwater for irrigation through diversion channels and direct diversions along the river channels fig 1c two storage reservoirs parral and pico de aguila dams capture store and supply surface water for irrigation 2 2 development of the new drastic indices the drastic model was originally developed by the environmental protection agency of the u s a epa aller 1985 this model is based on geological and hydrological parameters that could affect vertical groundwater movement from the land surface it assumes that pollution produced on the land surface can potentially vertically transport to the saturated zone of the underlying aquifers aller 1985 drastic provides a numerical index obtained from ratings and weights assigned to the modeled parameters each parameter class is given by a range from low 1 to high 10 vulnerability and are based on their relative effect on the vulnerability of the aquifer these model parameters are also weighted to reflect their relative importance from 1 less important to 5 most important in addition the model presents a classification system according to the impact on the soil general texture distribution and to the impact of conditions from agriculture and others anthropogenic activities ex pesticides and herbicides this addition to the original drastic uses the same parameters as drastic but with different weights the values scale was grouped into three categories low 50 100 medium 100 130 and high 130 in this study the models that were used were drastic for general conditions and the new versions of drastic called drastic pesticide p for intense agriculture conditions drasticl with the addition of the land use drasticl pesticide p as a version for intense agriculture conditions and drstil version with the parameters representing the layers of the aquifer and hydraulic conductivity removed from the model the vulnerability index by drastic uses eq 1 1 drastic d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w where d is the depth to the unconfined groundwater r is the annual natural recharge a is the aquifer material lithology of the aquifer s is soil media the texture of soil t is the topography slope i is the impact of the vadose zone and c is the rock type vertical hydraulic conductivity the sub indices r and w represent the rating of the parameter and an assigned weight for the parameters respectively additional pesticide conditions are summarized in supplementary material for the new drasticl model the additional layer of the land use was added l and related term in the analysis the application results are advantageous because it reflects the impact of diverse activities developed over the land surface sahoo et al 2016 drasticl uses eq 2 2 drasticl d r d w r r rw a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w l r l w finally the simplified version of drastic drstil has the factors of the aquifer media a and hydraulic conductivity c omitted this approach omits the flow length and dispersion of the pollutants considered throughout the aquifer system li and merchant 2013 herrera et al 2018 however this method was modified to include the additional attribute of land use l to estimate the impact of agriculture as a potential source of artificial recharge and related pollutants this version of the drastic model uses eq 3 3 drstil d r d w r r r w s r s w t r t w i r i w l r l w 2 2 1 description and estimation of drastic layers the description and estimation of every layer used in this work are summarized in table 1 the complete information of drastic layers is described in the supplementary material for the d and r layers an interpolation was made with ordinary kriging from the geostatistical analyst extension of arc gis esri 2014 while for the t layer a slope was estimated with the slope method of the surface extension of arc gis esri 2014 2 2 2 sensitive analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of drastic methods two analyses were applied single parameter sensitivity and map removal sensitivity measure al abadi et al 2017 pacheco et al 2015 tomer et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 the map removal sensitivity method identifies the sensitivity of the vulnerability map towards removing one or more layers from vulnerability analysis the sensitivity is estimated with eq 4 4 s i v n v n where si is the sensitivity v and v are the unperturbed and the perturbed vulnerability indices respectively n and n are the number of data layers used to compute v and v the calculated vulnerability index obtained by using all factors is considered as an unperturbed parameter while the vulnerability computed using a lower number of data layers was considered as a perturbed parameter the single parameter sensitivity measure evaluates the impact of each of the drastic factors on the vulnerability index this analysis compares the effective weight of each input factor for a polygon with the theoretical weight assigned by the analytic drastic model the effective weight of each polygon is obtained with eq 5 5 w pi p r p w v 100 where w refers to effective weight for each factor pr and pw are the rating and weighting values of each factor and v was defined previously 2 2 3 comparison of the vulnerability index by water quality values an evaluation and comparison of the vulnerability indices were estimated with pearson and spearman correlations these correlations were performed between vulnerability areas with chemical species such as total dissolved solids tds sulfates so4 2 calcium ca magnesium mg chloride cl potassium k and sodium na as well as nitrates an agricultural byproduct from chemical fertilization chemical species concentrations from selected wells from conagua surveys between 2002 and 2019 conagua 2002 conagua 2019 a pearson correlation matrix de sas 2006 allowed comparison across all attributes of indices and groundwater sample chemical attributes a spearman correlation rho also was used to remove the restriction caused by the general distribution form of two variables and the sample size lake et al 2003 zhao et al 2018 with eq 6 6 ρ 1 6 i 1 n d i 2 n n 2 1 where n is sample size and d is the rank difference between groundwater vulnerability and nitrate concentration level 2 2 4 model discrimination analysis anova was used to analyze for potential of a statistical differences between models drastic and new versions to 95 reliability all of the drastic versions were normalized using the box cox method sas 2006 and a tukey test to compare multiple means of factors analyzed sas 2006 2 3 vulnerability indices on climate change scenarios to obtain the vulnerability indices on projected scenarios of climate change the recharge of the aquifer was computed according to projected future temperature variation and precipitation as well as the projection to potential changes in land use the scenarios were projected into two future periods representing the nearest future 2015 2040 and the distant future 2045 2069 2 3 1 climate change scenarios climate scenarios used the atlas climático digital de méxico acdm fernández eguiarte et al 2012 centro de ciencias de la atmosfera 2012 and the model of the national centre of meteorological research cnrm cm5 national centre for meteorological research 2014 each climatic scenario was structured for two radiative forcings of greenhouse gas emissions rcp representative concentration paths by the year 2069 4 5 and 8 5 these prescribed pathways for co2 concentrations joined to land use change are widely used to model the climatic future scenarios san josé et al 2016 these climatic scenarios represent an increase of 29 and 125 by the end of the 21st century respectively over current co2 emission 416 2 ppm 2 3 2 projected recharge of the aquifer the annual potential recharge under these scenarios was obtained by the difference between annual projected precipitation and evapotranspiration et li and merchant 2013 the projected et was computed from the empirical turc equation herrera et al 2018 rodríguez huerta et al 2020 this was obtained from eqs 7 and 8 7 e t p 0 9 p 2 l 2 8 l 300 25 t 0 005 t 3 where p is precipitation mm yr and t is temperature degrees celsius 2 3 3 statistical analysis a paired two tailed t test was applied to analyze the significance of the statistical differences between climatic parameters such as precipitation actual evapotranspiration and recharge projected to rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios in the nearest and the distant future periods 2 3 4 projection of land use for a greater consistency with the climate change model the land use layer was also modified to reflect the potential conditions for the nearest future 2015 2039 and distant future 2045 2069 two satellite images were used for years 1997 landsat 5 thematic mapper tm and for 2017 landsat 8 operational land imager oli from the u s geological survey usgs glovis 2016 the land use classification was developed with cluster analysis from the idrisi selva program eastman 2012 prediction of land use change was estimated with the ca markov model hamad et al 2018 the projected land use maps were validated by validate module of idrisi selva where the estimated statistic kappa k with values greater or equal to 0 6 are considered acceptable escandón calderón et al 2018 3 results 3 1 classification of layers the reclassified layers obtained by drastic are shown in fig 2 depth to groundwater varies widely from 9 m to 30 m fig 2a likewise the aquifer is widely composed of alluvial material 54 that fills the lower parts of valley fig 2b and c slopes for the study area range from 6 to 12 whereas in the upper parts of the valley and mountains with igneous and sedimentary rocks show steeper slopes 18 fig 2d these bedrocks formations delineate the surface boundaries of the aquifer with sedimentary rocks composing the northeast limit of the aquifer these higher elevations also are composed of calcareous and conglomeritic rocks which is formed by las pampas las margaritas el mimbre and los acebuches mountain ranges inegi 2005 the southeastern bedrock area also includes an open area filled by alluvial material fig 2e the 14 of aquifer area showed low permeability due to extrusive igneous rocks outcrop 10 6 cm s located to the northern and the southwester see fig 2d and e the surface soils and sedimentary alluvium are composed of medium and fine grained texture alluvium fig 2f 78 and 19 respectively thus medium grained texture soils supporting most of native vegetation while fine grained texture areas are coincident with riparian and agricultural areas fig 2g the recharge layer showed three ranges of values for recharge with the highest values ranging from 102 to 178 mm y this high recharge zone occurs at the southeast part of the aquifer fig 2h according with the highest precipitation and lowest evapotranspiration conditions see results in supplementary material fig sd1a b doe 2019 as well as medium grained soil texture and native vegetation to the southeast of the aquifer the san gabriel and pico de aguila reservoirs conagua 2020 as well as la estacada lagoon and the florido river are within these recharge zones secretaría general de gobierno 2019 3 2 sensitivity analysis the aquifer media mean 7 and soil texture mean 5 layer are the main contributors to pollution risk in the aquifer based on the drastic vulnerability indices depth to the water table recharge topography and vertical hydraulic conductivity also showed moderate risk contribution to the aquifer however contributions of every layer to the different versions of the drastic models used sensitivity was estimated from single parameters and map removal analysis the layer contribution to the drastic vulnerability index as well as sensitivity analysis results are summarized in supplementary material the single parameter sensitivity analysis revealed that impact of the vadose zone aquifer media and soil texture layers tend to be the most sensitive parameters in the vulnerability assessment to drastic and drasticl this is due to their mean effective weights are higher than their respective theoretical weights in drstil index impact of the vadose zone and soil texture layers were the most sensitive the map removal sensitivity analysis also showed that the impact of the vadose zone was the layer with highest mean rating for drastic 4 2 drasticl 3 4 and drstil 4 7 thus the impact of vadose zone mean 6 8 is the major contributor to the high contamination risk in jimenez camargo aquifer impact of the vadose zone aquifer media and soil texture are intimately related due to water rock soil interactions several contaminants can be leached hence their transport to deeper groundwater depends on parameters such as porosity including capillary fringe and rock fractures and permeability on the other hand the topography recharge and land use layers are highly variable in the analysis of vulnerability index by drastic with variation coefficients of 94 75 5 and 74 2 respectively the variability of these layers also will be the main parameters to predict the behavior of vulnerability index in future scenarios 3 3 vulnerability indices the spatial distribution of vulnerability indices of low moderate and high categories according to weighted value assigned and obtained from the analysis of drastic and modified drastic methods fig 3 the drastic index was found in a range from 67 to 141 and it showed moderate vulnerability 57 and 23 of high vulnerability vulnerability was highest mainly in the southern part of the aquifer fig 3a where the high recharge alluvial material and sedimentary rock outcrops and some surface water bodies are located precipitation and applied water also can be leaching some chemical species from these rocks and transporting them down to the groundwater the water table depth is also relatively less in this bedrock area than the alluvial areas fig 2a even though the range for the drastic p index values ranged from 58 to 161 similar to drastic the high and moderate vulnerabilities zones reduced their area in 6 and 23 respectively fig 3a1 where the low vulnerability zone increased to cover half the area of aquifer the vulnerability index is predominantly low is in zones where the fine grained soils are present fig 2f this is due to in this version drastic p the soil texture layer has a higher weight these particles on the surface produce low permeability reducing water infiltration much of the soil has developed a desert crust that is smooth and hardened surface from continuous processes of wetting and drying climatic condition and related accumulation of fine grained particles in addition moderate vulnerability zone spreads where the alluvial material moderate recharge and native vegetation are present fig e g and h the aquifer area is mainly covered by scrub and grassland 88 of the total aquifer area as with drastic the highest vulnerability was found to the south the higher vulnerability areas are in zones where the sedimentary rocks and alluvial material are located fig 2e with vertical hydraulic conductivity of 10 4 cm s the drasticl index range of values 82 to 181 were higher than those results from drastic version this vulnerability index includes the land use layer fig 2 obtaining low vulnerability for more than a half of the aquifer area the main contributor parameters to uncertainty were the land use l and topography t with variances of 10 and 8 respectively nevertheless high vulnerability is well delineated in areas with agricultural and urban land use fig 2g thus additional and relatively higher vulnerability can be attributed to the anthropogenic activities associated with agricultural and urban land use both activities can modify the soil structure and composition producing a higher exposure to potential pollutants similarly in drasticl p the vulnerability ranged from 73 to 201 where moderate vulnerability increased to cover 39 of the aquifer area the vulnerability areas delineated with drasticl p are located in similar zones than those obtained by drasticl however it is now also taking into account the soil texture finally when lithology layer of the aquifer was removed to the drastic using drstil the vulnerability ranged from 59 to 148 with the high vulnerability area of 31 this increase is mainly attributed to land use topography recharge and unconfined water table depth the anova analysis showed significant differences between drastic and their versions 0 0001 these differences are mainly due to land use layer thus two groups were identified the first group is integrated by drasticl and dristil while the second group includes drastic and drastic p this highlights the importance of tracking land use as well as the application of pesticides and herbicides for example in california usa there is a requirement to report all applications and amounts along with crop type application date and location this information is integrated into a publicly available database called california pesticide inventory program calpip california department of pesticide regulation 2019 3 4 comparison of the vulnerability indices the maps of vulnerability were compared using correlations with parameters of groundwater quality conagua 2002 significant correlations of na k and no3 were found for drasticl and drstil p 0 05 the mean concentrations of na k and no3 from aquifer well samples were 164 mg l 1 26 mg l 1 and 4 12 mg l 1 respectively the pearson correlation drasticl showed correlations of 0 6 and 0 5 with na and k respectively while drstil just had a significant correlation with k 0 5 and none of the parameters showed correlation with no3 moreover the spearman correlation for the three chemical species na k and no3 showed significant correlation with drstil of 0 5 these results suggest that the original form of drastic did not reflect actual groundwater vulnerability huan et al 2012 conversely drasticl and drstil vulnerability maps are reasonable for this study area these results suggest that the addition or subtraction of layers and the weight changes improved the correlation value similar improved relations were obtained from published studies sahoo et al 2016 3 5 assessment of the vulnerability indices for climate change scenarios the evapotranspiration precipitation and recharge parameters were analyzed using rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios for both the nearest future 2015 2040 and distant future 2045 2069 periods figs 4 and 5 the vulnerability index assessment included statistical analysis of the parameters precipitation evapotranspiration recharge tmax and tmin table 2 the evapotranspiration precipitation and recharge have similar spatial distribution but different magnitudes for rcpˈs 4 5 fig 4 and 8 5 fig 5 in both future periods the highest evapotranspiration and precipitation values tend to be present in the southern parts of the aquifer for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and future periods these two parameters showed similar values in the nearest future for the rcpˈs 4 5 and 8 5 but increased in the distant future for rcp4 5 while decreasing for rcp8 5 higher evapotranspiration 64 82 and precipitation 27 115 increase relative to historical values for both future periods and both rcp scenarios the highest values of evapotranspiration and precipitation are expected in the southern part of the aquifer figs 4a b 5a b for an r 0 9 p 0 05 for both scenarios and future periods sedimentary rocks compose the southeastern part of aquifer combined with shallow unconfined water table depths fig 3a where the groundwater will be more exposed to high temperature with surface water the main source of irrigation for cultivated areas in that region the increased evaporation and evapotranspiration also will increase the irrigation demand from both groundwater and surface water similarly under scenarios of increased co2 emissions the agriculture irrigation demand in the central valley california drove additional undesirable effects such as land subsidence and reduced streamflow hanson et al 2012 2010 zhu et al 2020 the projections from analysis with idrisi selva on the land use layer showed an increase in the estimated size of future agricultural land use the reliability of this projection was acceptable with a kappa index value of 0 68 this analysis showed an increase from the current agricultural land use of 13 4 to 24 8 for the period 2015 2040 this potential land use expansion is located in areas with favorable alluvial soils and smooth topographic slopes conversely the future urban land use is projected to decrease by 3 from 2015 to 2040 to 2045 2069 the highest potential recharge is expected in the southern regions of the aquifer for both rcp scenarios and future periods however recharge is projected to be slightly larger in the nearest future 2015 2040 than in the subsequent future period 2045 2069 figs 4 and 5 with precipitation and et projected to increase table 2 demand and consumption at the land surface will be greater that will result in a net reduction of water availability for recharge 100 mm y much of this larger recharge zone in both future periods can be attributed to vertical infiltrations from surface reservoirs such as pico de aguila dam and other reservoir dams and lakes located in the southern aquifer region fig 4e and f a decrease in the high recharge area was estimated for both rcp scenarios and future period in rcp 4 5 the high recharge area in the nearest future is 157 km2 but dramatically decreases to 0 7 km2 in the distant future the high recharge area decreases even more in the rcp 8 5 than in future periods of the rcp4 5 table 2 fig 5e and f for rcp8 5 the high recharge area decreases to 0 3 km2 in 2015 2040 and is projected to potentially disappear completely in 2045 2069 the recharge parameter showed correlations with precipitation r 0 55 p 0 05 and tmin r 0 53 p 0 05 even though precipitation values are not less in futures periods relative to the current period and recharge is also affected by tmin r 0 75 p 0 05 temperature is one of the most important parameters when climatic change is assessed the projected range of temperatures is similar for both rcp scenarios within both future periods table 2 however the range of temperature between 2015 and 2040 and 2045 2069 is significantly different for rcp4 5 both with a temperature increase of 0 8 c similarly tmax and tmin averages increase more by approximately 1 5 c from 2015 to 2040 to 2045 2069 in rcp8 5 this suggests that aquifer recharge will be affected by t especially with the tmin which is correlated with precipitation in agricultural areas where the evapotranspiration is projected to increase dramatically this will require larger amounts of irrigation even though this could drive increased artificial recharge from inefficient irrigation there is also increased pumpage that can results in a larger and more rapid declines of groundwater levels and a potential initiation of land subsidence hanson et al 2010 zhu et al 2020 based on the future values of recharge and the land use as well as the statistical analysis the vulnerability maps were developed with the drstil and drasticl indices using rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for both future periods fig 6 drasticl shows greater areas with high vulnerability ranging from 35 rcp 4 5 distant future to 37 rcp 8 5 nearest future of the total aquifer area these areas are located in the south area of greatest recharge and are coincident with the alluvial parts of the aquifer coincident with agricultural land use overall the drstil showed a lower range of vulnerability than drasticl and was similar for each rcp scenario and future period the higher vulnerability zones from drstil range from 17 rcp4 5 distant future to 25 rcp4 5 nearest future of the total aquifer area for rcp8 5 the percentage of the vulnerability areas is very similar between nearest and distant future the areas of highest vulnerability are coincident with the agricultural land use areas medium recharge areas figs 4 and 5 e f g and mainly accentuated to the east and north fig 6e h finally drasticl showed increased high vulnerability areas of the aquifer from current to futures scenarios from 22 to 34 fig 6 this can be attributed to the potential increase of areas agricultural areas for future periods conversely drstil results showed a potential decrease in high vulnerability areas in futures periods relative to current conditions this may be related to the projected reduction of high recharge zones however the leaching and transport of pollutants from aquifer media is not part of this method s evaluation and its effect remains uncertain within the drastic evaluations 4 discussion the methods developed here provide a broader approach to drastic analysis and indicates that land use layer gave the high vulnerability for the aquifer in this study high and moderate vulnerability found in this work is consistent with places of arid climate and agricultural land use li and merchant 2013 neshat et al 2014 zair et al 2017 bhaskar et al 2018 rodríguez huerta et al 2020 kløve et al 2014 groundwater with high concentrations of na k and no3 may be related to leaching from aquifer geology as well as from soils in cultivated lands hernández 2012 the presence of these chemical species in groundwater samples confirmed the vulnerability areas found by drastic similar correlation using nitrates r 0 5 p 0 05 from agricultural practices have also been documented as vulnerabilities in aquifers from greece india pakistan and poland khan et al 2019 kozłowski and sojka 2019 sahoo et al 2016 panagopoulos et al 2006 in addition these pollutants have not been directly related to hydraulic conductivity and soil in the aquifer vulnerability assessments panagopoulos et al 2006 the high vulnerability zones are coincident with agricultural land use as well as areas with the higher elevations and related greater precipitation and in southern parts of the aquifer where there are also reservoirs which also can contribute to the leaching and transport to the shallow groundwater tables the relief and related slope of the land surface favors a greater runoff through some rivers which transport water to low zones in the valley thus greater slope areas disfavors the aquifer recharge and favor greater runoff that yield low or moderate groundwater recharge cazanezcu and cazanezcu 2010 the new modified versions of drastic also are more efficient by including the land use layer which in turn helps to identify the importance of sub regional forcing related to land use for example the impact of agricultural land use on aquifer recharge results in the larger volumes of water used for irrigation that cause larger artificial recharge to the aquifer due to inefficient irrigation saida et al 2017 bhaskar et al 2018 gonzález hosseini moghari et al 2019 the study region used for comparison of the drastic methods and estimation of climate change has dry conditions and is an important agricultural area which is the main economic source to local inhabitants over the last 40 years there has been an accelerated increase of groundwater use for irrigation along with increased groundwater pumpage lópez et al 2011 the predominant agriculture in the region are pecans orchards 65 7 with a total surface of 247 969 ha and have increased owing to high export demand up to 89 since 1980 conagua 2018 conagua 2002 along with increases in other sesonal crops with high water demand such as alfalfa 32 8 grain corn 0 6 oat 0 4 and sorghum 0 4 sagarpa 2011 thus jimenez camargo aquifer is under increased water demand and hardened demand from long term orchards that require water over decades and not just seasonal or interannual demands for irrigation the jimenez camargo aquifer is in overexploited status with a groundwater deficit of 135 3 hm3 y conagua 2018 hernández 2012 yet the mexican authorities have granted 284 hm3 y of groundwater to agriculture with about 20 artificial recharge from inefficient irrigation 56 9 hm3 y here the estimation of natural vertical recharge is 116 4 hm3 y producing a total recharge of 173 3 hm3 y however the water abstraction measured is 303 1 hm3 y with 5 5 hm3 y of natural discharge by springs showing a depletion in the groundwater storage streamflow capture and reduced discharge inflow budgets which is not sustainable even with an increase in precipitation 100 mm projections of climate change scenarios for both rcp scenarios this analysis shows a reduction of area in the highest potential recharge areas figs 4 and 5 in the future scenarios the aquifer area shows an overall decrease in recharge relative to historical conditions this suggests that reduced recharge is due to the sum of two main causes a precipitation increase in the same area where evapotranspiration is also larger and b minimum temperature is increasing into future which also drives larger evapotranspiration and potential increased demand for irrigation with overall hotter temperatures and longer growing seasons in the historical scenario the recharge average is about 33 from precipitation table 2 but in the projected scenarios the average water recharged from precipitations will be about 13 5 higher temperatures produce an increase in evaporation from surface water bodies present in that area which reduces the contact area for infiltration and the amount of surface water available for irrigation in addition the change in temperature patterns force the biota to modify its biochemical activity resulting in an increase of water demand bhaskar et al 2018 kløve et al 2014 these projections under climate change show a decrease in the area of agricultural land use into the future this difference can be attributed to aquifer storage depletion related to increased irrigation demands of perennial and seasonal crops in the study area in addition the overexploitation of aquifers from agricultural demands will also result in a loss of water quality causing even higher vulnerability under this condition the irrigated soils can present high amounts of salts which result in additional pumpage and irrigation to leach salts from the root zone hanson et al 1994 cahn and bali 2015 boyce et al 2019 rodríguez huerta et al 2020 fries et al 2020 mendieta mendoza et al 2020 consequently farmlands will need major quantities of irrigation under climate change scenarios that will also include salinity issues the vulnerability maps show an approximation of how future changes to vulnerability will affect the potential distribution of usable groundwater li and merchant 2013 albornoz euán et al 2017 lu et al 2017 in this study the drastic approach has helped to understand the potential vulnerability of aquifer under the effects of recharge and the land use that when combined with climate variations can drive increasing vulnerability for both indices as well as increased water infiltration that can transport pollutants to shallow unconfined groundwater with further water quality degradation therefore it is necessary to consider the impacts of these pollutants on its destination and paths of infiltration because they are highly variable and can be very hard to predict as they can by trapped in soil strata that make up the layers of the aquifer within these water cycles of supply and demand the groundwater levels continue to decrease with the decreased recharge increased vegetation covering and increased rate of groundwater pumpage fries et al 2020 chen et al 2018 in a similar study of an aquifer in yucatan mexico where precipitation values are 1050 mm and temperature was estimated to increase by 0 62 c and 0 72 c were coincident with estimates of reduced groundwater recharge of 23 and 20 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively rodríguez huerta et al 2020 in this study area with dry conditions the jimenez chihuahua aquifer there is an estimated groundwater recharge reduction of about 47 for both rcpˈs this is a lower estimate than the current estimate of groundwater use and must be taken into account for the sustainability of the resource it is important to point out the semi arid regions includes developed agricultural areas while seasonal rains can contribute to natural groundwater recharge it is also necessary to assess the artificial recharge from inefficient irrigation artificial recharge depends on when and where the precipitation evapotranspiration and increment of cultivated zones are occurring and this was not part of any of these drastic methods used in this study for instance in the central valley of california the evapotranspiration is higher annually than precipitation but precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in winter season and artificial recharge from inefficient irrigation exceeds spring summer evapotranspiration on a monthly basis faunt et al 2009 the related climate change analysis performed with an integrated hydrologic model hanson et al 2012 showed the importance of evaluating local climatic variability and climate change as this will help to improve water budgets and supply and demand dynamics within climatic change and its impacts on surface water and groundwater use and movement moreover these kind of studies must also include the simulation of flow and related analysis of fate and transport of contaminants which represents many decades of model simulation though to get long enough travel paths to assess any potential change in water quality relative to nearby well and surface water return flow samples central valley salinity coalition 2012 the comparison of the drastic methods and the efficacy of this analysis with related vulnerability maps provides a baseline for developing policies and decisions concerning the protection and management of water resources some strategies that could contribute to more sustainable groundwater budgets may include a efficient measuring and monitoring of groundwater pumpage b irrigation management irrigation scheduling methods c parcel planning as well as to limit the opening of new agricultural lands c mapping land use on an annual or seasonal basis d implementation of crops with less water requirements and use of more efficient irrigation methods and e raising promoting the governance of conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water by the social sectors government population private industry through environmental education and modernized governance 5 conclusions in this study the potential effects on vulnerability and availability of groundwater from the jimenez camargo aquifer was obtained by the development of modified drastic methods this study shows that drasticl and drstil have better skill than other forms of drastic to detect the vulnerability areas where the impact of the vadose zone and land use attributes are the main contributors to the aquifer vulnerability this study also showed that the current higher vulnerability is located in the southern part of this aquifer and the groundwater pollution may also be related to nitrates sodium and potassium from agricultural activities furthermore drastic versions were applied for climate change assessments on the study area these methodologies also showed that topography recharge and land use variables are useful to predict changes in projected future climate change scenarios and related future changes in vulnerability and availability for groundwater the climate change scenarios projected a negative effect in the areal extent of recharge zones as well as an increase of high vulnerability for the aquifer in future scenarios evaluated high vulnerability showed a spatial increment towards to the east and north of the aquifer area according to the projected expansion of agricultural land use zones therefore with higher co2 emissions there could be more significant reductions for the recharge replenishment to the underlying aquifers combined with an expected increase of land use for nearest future these agricultural land use areas will show a decrease in land use for distant future period this is related to the reduction of water for irrigation driving a potential reduction in agricultural land use this will in turn generate higher vulnerability within the agricultural land use which may further exacerbate the problem of groundwater depletion and overexploitation of the aquifers while this initial assessment outlines the potential vulnerability and relations of vulnerability a more comprehensive evaluation also is needed that includes a holistic assessment of the environmental social and economic components of supply and demand for conjunctive use of all water to achieve a more complete water management system it will require a complete frameworks of monitoring systems integrated hydrologic modeling of alternate climate change scenarios and modeling the initial components from a broader conjunctive use and sustainability framework boyce et al 2020 this will help to develop relevant strategies aimed at sustainability through potential reductions and increased efficiencies in use of water and land resources additionally it will demand outreach to the general population water purveyors agricultural producers as well as state and federal agencies that oversee water management are stewarding the resources and are better informed about these conditions trends and vulnerabilities without an integral approach to management and growth such as additional agricultural land use could result in potential threats to water and food security and higher risk of pollution combined with reduced sustainability of water resources thus monitoring modeling and informed management will help to further identify and mitigate the vulnerabilities identified in this initial study and guide the governance development and mitigation of water uses that includes the sustainable use of surface water combined with groundwater and land use subject to climate change and climate variability credit authorship contribution statement mendieta mendoza aurora

4883,agriculture s need to feed the growing population is challenged by the decline in available water resources especially in the context of global climate change improving crop water use efficiency wue will help to safeguard the environmental sustainability of food production in dryland areas however the impact of drought on crop wue varies a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of relevant factors is needed to support evidence based management decisions here we used a meta analysis of global drylands 81 studies with 836 paired observations to evaluate the response of various crop wues to drought based on various natural and human induced factors our results showed that responses of crop types wue varied under drought intensity which probably a reference for crop selection in drylands cotton could be one of crop selection reference in hyper arid or arid regions and legume is not recommended for drylands without irrigation cereal crop are suitable for growing in semi arid or dry sub humid areas moreover soil improvement and fertilizer management are the effective methods to alleviate drought stress in addition to irrigation soil with medium texture 1 3 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density and 15 20 g kg 1 organic matter is beneficial for improving wue under drought fertilizer should be carefully considered and not exceed 200 kg ha 1 for wheat in drylands water deficit can improve crop wue but should not exceed 40 of the full irrigation amount field management practices such as mulching and weed control can help alleviate drought by regulating wue to some extent this study evaluated the responses of various crop wues to drought and highlighted the factors contributing to and or decreasing crop wue from natural factor and management practices which provides a basis for agricultural drought mitigation strategies under future climate change in dryland areas keywords crop selection yield dryland agriculture water productivity irrigation 1 introduction drylands cover 40 of the global land surface and this area is expected to increase by 4 8 by 2100 dai 2013 huang et al 2016 various crop models have also simulated an increase in drought driven crop yield losses by 2100 leng and hall 2019 moreover multi model predictions indicate that climate change is likely to exacerbate regional and global water scarcity and confront approximately 15 more of the global population with a severe decline in water resources under representative concentration pathways 8 5 schewe et al 2014 agriculture water use is necessary to feed the world s population and is the largest single user of freshwater accounting for 70 of total freshwater use worldwide wallace 2000 therefore it is important to improve crop water use efficiency to guarantee food security under predicted drought stress associated with climate change zhang and zhang 2007 flexas et al 2016 crop water use efficiency wue crop productivity per unit of water used is a key factor for determining the efficiency of water use by crops and for targeting crops for selection and breeding condon et al 2004 flexas et al 2016 there are different ways of quantifying wue based on observations depending on the research scales leaf whole plant filed and ecosystem this study focuses on crop wue at the field level based on yield production the plant wue is a complex trait controlled by many genes related to drought resistance karaba et al 2007 hughes et al 2017 therefore ensuring that crops demonstrate high wue under drought conditions is important in water limited agricultural regions kang et al 2017 and has evoked calls for a blue revolution to produce more crop per drop of water boland et al 1993 zhang and zhang 2007 therefore understanding the response of crop wue to drought is crucial for ensuring food and water resource security under climate change over the past decades numerous studies have reported the effects of drought on wue in various crops worldwide xue et al 2014 hao et al 2015 hao et al 2019 which have improved our understanding of the mechanisms underlying drought effects briggs and shantz 1913 first reported differences in the wue of six crops in response to water stress in pot experiments at the beginning of the 20th century subsequently many researchers endeavored to examine and improve the wue of various crops under drought stress however the current understanding of crop wue in response to drought remains highly uncertain due to contradictory results and the lack of large and complete datasets for example drought can decrease liu et al 2016 or increase kang et al 2002 crop wue which may result from different treatments environments climate and soil or management practices however the effect of natural factors and management practices on wue under drought cannot be evaluated quantitatively and are typically ignored in case studies in addition reviews tend to only report the effects of drought on wue for individual crops worldwide kang et al 2002 or various crop wues in a particular region katerji et al 2008 therefore integrating the available data from different sources will help to quantitatively evaluate the wue of various crops and identify possible factors affecting wue under drought compared with traditional methods a meta analysis is a quantitative and scientific synthesis tool that can be used to provide reliable conclusions and identify heterogeneous sources from different individual studies gurevitch et al 2018 here a comprehensive meta analysis was performed based on 836 observations from 81 papers published between 1970 and 2018 to a evaluate the wue response of various crops to drought intensity and b quantify the effects of natural factors and management practices on wue variation under drought 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources peer reviewed research papers published between 1970 and 2018 were collected from the web of science and google scholar data were also collected from the china national knowledge internet https www cnki net for the literature search the targeted search terms were water use efficiency or efficiency of water use or wue or water productivity and drought or water stress or water deficit several criteria were set to identify studies and avoid biases in the selection a agronomic wue was calculated as yield evapotranspiration where yield is the economic output of crops and evapotranspiration during crop growth b experiments yielded paired data of crop wue under well watered control and drought treatments a mandatory requirement for the meta analysis c experiments conducted on the same spatiotemporal scales with identical environmental and soil parameters and species composition in both the control and drought treatments and d means standard deviations or standard errors and replicates of crop wue could be directly extracted or calculated from the collected data measurements across different drought intensities temporal scales and crop species cultivars were considered independent observations if more than one drought intensity temporal scale or crop species cultivars was available from the same study in total 81 research studies with 836 observations satisfied our selection criteria and the dataset mainly involved 35 crop species and 105 crop cultivars from 17 countries the collected data and detailed information are summarized in table 1 appendix b a world map showing the sampling points of global dryland areas in the meta analysis is shown in fig 1 2 2 data extraction and classification several explanatory variables including natural environment and management practice factors that could affect crop wue variance under drought stress were extracted and classified in appendix b soil drought intensity decrease in water input from 0 to 100 was expressed as the percentage change in precipitation or irrigation between control and drought treatments we divided soil drought intensity into three levels mild 30 moderate 30 60 and severe 60 in addition when control and drought treatments were manipulated to maintain a certain soil water content drought intensity was calculated from the percentage change in soil water content between control and drought treatments zhou et al 2018 natural environmental variables included country development climate water resources and local soil conditions the level of country development was separated into developed and developing countries climate zones were determined by the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration p pet and were separated into dry sub humid 0 50 0 65 semiarid 0 20 0 50 arid 0 05 0 2 and hyper arid regions 0 05 according to iucn 2008 water resources reflected the availability of local irrigation conditions and were classified as irrigated and rain fed regions three soil property variables were selected for the meta analysis soil texture bulk density and organic matter content soil texture fine medium and coarse soil was categorized according to the cornell comprehensive assessment of soil health framework soil bulk density sbd was divided into four categories 1 3 1 3 1 4 1 4 1 5 and 1 5 g cm 3 soil organic matter som was divided into four categories 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 g kg 1 management practices included irrigation level rates of applied n weed control and plastic mulch irrigation level was divided into four categories according to the percentages of full irrigation water amount 80 100 60 80 40 60 and 40 the rate of applied n for wheat was separated into three levels 100 100 200 and 200 300 kg ha 1 weed control and plastic mulch management were categorized as implemented or not implemented in each study when data from the selected studies were only presented graphically the figures were digitized to extract numerical values using getdata graph digitizer v 2 22 russian federation http www getdata graph digitizer com 2 3 effect size and model selection a meta analysis was used to combine the available data of all crop species from different sources to obtain a unified view of the response of wue to drought the response ratio was used as a metric of effect size in the meta analysis hedges et al 1999 to reflect the effect of drought on crop wue 1 rr l n x e x c where rr is a unit free index with positive and negative values indicating either increasing or decreasing wue in response to changes in drought stress and xe and xc are mean values of crop wue under drought and control treatments respectively for each study the within column variance v associated with each rr value was calculated from the standard deviation associated with each wue 2 v s e 2 n e x e 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 where se and sc are the standard deviations of wue in the drought and control groups respectively and ne and nc are sample sizes of the wue in the drought and control groups respectively a weighted random effects model was selected because the main assumptions are more likely to be satisfied when dealing with ecological data synthesis hedges et al 1999 the weighted mean response ratio was calculated as follows 3 rr i 1 k w i rr i i k w i where i is the number of the case study in the meta analysis k is the cumulative number of case studies and w is the weight of each response ratio individual rr values were weighted by the reciprocal of their variance 1 v rr τ 2 to account for differences in precision among studies the between group variance τ 2 was calculated using the restricted maximum likelihood method hedges et al 1999 4 τ 2 q t k 1 i 1 k w i i 1 k w i 2 i 1 k w i where qt is a statistic based on a chi squared test used to examine the heterogeneity across case studies a significant qt indicates that effect sizes are not equal across studies which implies that other explanatory variables may influence the results further qt was partitioned into between group qm and within group qe heterogeneity the significance level of qm indicates that the independent variable explains a significant amount of the variance in effect size predicted by this model in such cases meta regression analyses were conducted to examine the p values associated with qm qm describes the heterogeneity of effect sizes related to the wue differences between crop categories and was used to make categorical comparisons if p 0 05 qm was considered an important factor affecting wue under drought stress weighted response ratios of categorical variables were considered significantly different if their 95 confidence intervals 95 cis did not overlap 0 2 4 data analysis the effect sizes rr and 95 cis were generated by building a weighted random effects model with restricted maximum likelihood estimation the influence of categorical variables on wue effect sizes was tested by using meta regression to examine between group heterogeneity q m rosenthal s fail safe number n representing the number of studies required to refute significant meta analytic means was used to test the effect of publication bias oswald 2009 all statistical analyses about meta analysis calculations were conducted using openmee brown university providence usa an open source software for ecological and evolutionary meta analysis gurevitch et al 2018 wallace et al 2017 the percentage change in wue caused by drought stress was calculated from the weighted response ratios using the equation exp rr 1 100 aggregated boosted tree analysis de ath 2007 was carried out using the gbmplus package in r with 500 trees used for boosting a 0 02 fold shrinkage rate and three way interactions to quantitatively and visually evaluate the relative influences of explanatory variables climate country development irrigation level plastic mulch n fertilizer weed control soil texture som and sbd on crop wue under drought stress 3 results 3 1 wue response of various crops to drought intensity the meta analysis showed that the weighted response ratios of crop wue under drought stress were normally distributed fig a1 appendix a the overall rr of crop wue in response to drought was 0 007 and the 95 ci was 0 002 to 0 008 indicating that the drought effect on overall effect size of wue is not significant among 836 observations but there was significant residual heterogeneity in the random effects meta analysis for the dataset qt 10761 1 p 0 001 this indicates that the factors that affect wue under drought stress are required for in depth explanations of heterogeneity crop type significantly explained the heterogeneity associated with cereal legume oil fiber tuber vegetable and fruit crops q m 91 1 p 0 001 fig 2 across all observations mild drought increased crop wue by 2 4 but moderate and severe drought decreased crop wue by 2 8 and 1 3 respectively for cereal and oil crops wues increased by 2 2 and 4 0 under mild drought but decreased by 0 6 and 8 9 under severe drought in contrast the wue of tuber crops increased by 25 4 under severe drought moreover the wue of legumes decreased significantly under mild moderate and severe drought by 13 4 15 0 and 48 0 respectively however the wue of fiber crops increased significantly under mild moderate and severe drought by 5 8 11 7 and 23 9 respectively among cereal crops the wue of wheat only increased under mild 6 5 and moderate 5 5 drought while maize only increased under severe drought 6 1 fig 3 3 2 effect of natural factors on wue under drought comparing crop wue responses across the world on average drought had a negative effect in developed countries 5 1 and a positive effect in developing countries 3 3 fig 4 a crop wues in response to drought were also influenced by the local climate with negative response ratios in hyper arid 0 4 and semiarid 4 0 regions and positive response ratios in arid 10 0 and dry sub humid 2 3 regions fig 4b it is worth mentioning that arid regions had much smaller sample sizes n 33 than other drylands and most of the arid regions n 29 were in developing countries moreover most of the studies in this meta analysis were undertaken in irrigated regions n 636 with 10 from rain fed regions n 65 there were no significant differences in wue response ratios occurred between irrigated and rain fed regions fig 4c crop wue responses to drought varied significantly in soils with different textures bulk densities and organic matter contents fig 4d f medium textured soil performed better than fine and coarse textured soil with an increase of 5 8 fig 4d crop wue ratios were positive for soil bulk densities of 1 3 1 4 g cm 3 3 6 and 1 4 1 5 g cm 3 3 0 but negative for soil bulk densities of 1 3 2 0 and 1 5 g cm 3 8 1 fig 4e crop wue decreased at som levels 10 g kg 1 6 9 but increased at som levels of 10 15 3 7 15 20 9 5 and 20 g kg 1 1 2 fig 4f 3 3 effect of management practices on wue under drought irrigation water is a key factor in crop wue under drought and the results revealed that crop wue improved under drought when irrigation water was 60 or 40 of full irrigation water amount fig 5 a crops have different needs for basic n fertilizer we used wheat as an example to analyze the effect of n fertilizer on the response of wue to drought due to sufficient sample sizes for wheat n 247 our results revealed that wue decreased 5 5 under drought at an n application rate between 200 and 300 kg ha 1 but increased by 3 8 and 33 9 at n application rates of 100 200 and 100 kg ha 1 respectively fig 5b the analysis also revealed that of plastic mulch application mitigates the negative effects of drought and improves crop wue by 7 3 under drought stress fig 5c weed control decreased wue 3 6 under drought fig 5d 3 4 key factors affecting wue under drought to compare the relative importance of the natural environment and management practices on crop wue under drought we conducted an aggregated boosted tree abt analysis fig 6 overall effects of management practices on the response of crop wue to drought were prior to those of natural factors irrigation was the most effective method for mitigate drought by regulating wue accounting for 29 3 of the relative influence in addition soil properties including texture 20 3 som 9 8 and sbd 8 9 explain 30 of relative influence for management practices n fertilizer 12 7 plastic mulch 5 7 and weed control 3 1 account for 21 5 of the relative influence moreover climate and country development only account for 8 8 and 1 4 of relative influence respectively 4 discussion 4 1 wue response of various crops to drought intensity the response of different crop types wue varied among drought intensities fig 2 which probably provides a reference for crop selection according to local drought intensity for example fiber crop mainly cotton had better drought resistance than other crop types because the positive wue ratio occurred under mild moderate and severe drought han et al 2016 reported similar findings in cotton and cited the importance of mesophyll conductance in changing anatomical structure and aquaporin expression for improving wue under drought therefore we suggest cotton could be one of crop selection reference in hyper arid or arid regions in contrast the decline in legume wues under various drought intensities suggests that legumes are more sensitive to drought stress than other crop types we suggest that legumes are not recommended to be grown in dryland where irrigation water is scare the different response of legume and cotton to drought may be distinct strategies to perform photosynthesis under drought cotton appears to rely on enhanced electron transport flux for light energy utilization under drought in contrast legume preferentially uses light regulated non photochemical energy dissipation which may have been enhanced by the higher cyclic electron flow in drought stressed leaves zhang et al 2011 daryanto et al 2017 reported similar results in a quantitative analysis of legume cereal and tuber crops yields under drought the fact that legume wues improved under various drought intensities is important given the prominence of this crop globally polania et al 2016 legumes have a major impact on agriculture the environment and health they are often used to improve soil organic fertility and nitrogen economy due to their ability to fix nitrogen symbiotically therefore breeding programs involving drought adaptation in legumes should include biotechnological approaches to improve drought resistance using stress related genes moreover cereal and oil crop have a positive wue ratio under mild drought stress and negative wue ratio under severe drought stress indicating that they are suitable for growing in semi arid and dry sub humid regions in addition we analyzed the responses of wheat and maize to different drought intensities in widely cultivated cereal crops importantly as high frequency and extensive drought events have occurred in countries focused on crop yield and water resources our results show that wheat is the preferred crop for mild and moderate drought and maize is more suitable for severe drought one possible explanation is the differences in their photosynthetic pathways hsiao et al 2007 with wheat being a c3 crop and maize being a c4 crop their wue ratios were 0 014 and 0 55 respectively fig a2 appendix a despite maize having a higher wue than wheat due to its lower leaf resistance and co2 compensation points it is more sensitive to drought daryanto et al 2016 as also reported in some experimental case studies pearcy et al 1981 baldocchi 1994 and meta analyses daryanto et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 because c4 crops decrease their photosynthetic rates much more than their transpiration rates under drought conditions therefore selecting suitable crops according to local conditions is one of the ways to improve crop wue under drylands 4 2 natural factors on average crop wue in developing countries performed better under drought than developed countries fig 4a which may be because crops in developed countries tend to be grown under optimal conditions including sufficient irrigation and advanced irrigation equipment under drought stress crop adaptation or acclimation to drought in suboptimal environments is expressed by improving the wue bhargava and sawant 2013 moreover crop wue ratios varied between the four dryland areas examined in the meta analysis the significant positive effects in arid regions may be because most of the data 29 of 33 observations came from developing countries the overall effect in hyper arid and dry sub humid regions were not significant one of the reasons may be due to the insufficient sample sizes of each dryland types another reason may be optimizing cultivars and irrigation and good management practices weaken the influence of climate to some extent parry et al 2005 davies et al 2011 we conclude that the wue ratio varies between climate zones but the quantitative effects are unknown daryanto et al 2017 reported no yield differences between crops grown in dryland versus non dryland conditions across cereal legume and tuber crops this discrepancy may be attributed to the rough delineation of drylands in the study a recent meta analysis also identified crop wue variations in different climatic regions mbava et al 2020 moreover the results showed that there was no difference between irrigated and rain fed regions however jin et al 2018 indicated that the effects of water stress on wue differed between the irrigated and rain fed regions this may be because the minority of studies in our meta analysis came from rain fed regions 65 of 701 observations with atypical wue data therefore more studies that satisfy our criteria in rain fed regions are needed the response of crop wue varied with different soil properties fig 4d f some studies have found that the effect of drought on crop yield is influenced by soil properties anthony et al 2012 liebig et al 2018 crop wue and yield responses to drought had a significant positive correlation yu et al 2020a indicating that crop wue under drought may be also influenced by soil properties however the effect of soil properties on wue is often neglected even in some reviews on wue katerji et al 2008 because such effects are not demonstrated sufficiently our results indicated that the wue of crops grown in medium textured soil with 1 3 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density and 15 20 g kg 1 organic matter improved under drought fig 4d f medium textured soils performed best for wue possibly due to an appropriate clay content which would have reduced soil water content variations more than in fine textured soil katerji and mastrorilli 2009 also found that wue in four crops decreased significantly when grown in clay soil in a multi year experiment due to a water uptake deficit during the active growing phase another reason might be that the soil pores of medium textured soil allow the roots to be more prolific and reach deeper soil zones in response to drought ramamoorthy et al 2017 crops grew best at an intermediate soil bulk density which presumably represents a compromise between soil that is soft enough to allow good root development stirzaker et al 1996 soil organic matter plays a major role in soil fertility due to its influence on the physical chemical and biological properties of soil quiroga et al 2006 our results indicate that crop wue decreased at 10 g kg 1 organic matter moreover crop wue did not always increase with increasing som and the increasing trend was not significant when som was 20 g kg 1 in a global meta analysis oldfield et al 2019 reported that increasing som content increased yields until the concentrations reached approximately 20 g kg 1 a good soil environment will guarantee food and water security which can be improved with soil amendments and appropriate management practices luo et al 2018 wang et al 2018 4 3 management practices crop wue can be controlled to some degree by management practices such as irrigation fertilization and mulching qiu et al 2008 bodner et al 2015 therefore wue under drought should improve under appropriate management practices farooq et al 2019 the results perhaps unsurprisingly revealed that appropriate irrigation improves crop wue fig 6 strategies that involve reducing irrigation water such as deficit and partial root zone irrigation maintain or increase crop wue to some extent du et al 2010 yu et al 2020b but the threshold for the reduction in irrigation water varied with different irrigation levels in the case studies our results synthesized a global meta analysis further revealing that the increasing trend in crop wue ceased to exist when the relative irrigation water amount was no 60 of full irrigation water amount despite wue increases when irrigation levels are 40 of full irrigation water amount it is always at the expense of yield yu et al 2020b appropriate and intermittent water deficits resulted in root adaptations that enabled plants to maximize their water use in these critical stages vadez 2014 bodner et al 2015 for example du et al 2010 and kang et al 2000 found that drought during early growth was beneficial for improving wue and yield in cereal crops our results indicated that the crop wue of wheat increased when the anthropogenic application of n was 200 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilizers stimulate crop growth yet excessive n input from anthropogenic sources cause soil degradation reducing soil fertility and productivity conley et al 2009 divito et al 2011 and ultimately decreasing crop wue especially under water deficit this is because fertilizers can only be absorbed by plants through water transport with the remainder persisting in the soil which changes the soil properties under water deficit wheat yields did not respond to n application rates above 135 kg ha 1 but declined by up to 50 at 270 kg ha 1 qin et al 2018 therefore the optimal level of fertilizer application under water deficit should be considered carefully our results indicated that crops used water more efficiently without weed control under drought conditions fig 6d which may be due to the reduction in crop transpiration weeds compete for soil water reduce water availability and further contribute to crop water stress abouziena et al 2008 in the presence of weeds crops reduce their stomatal conductance to avoid excessive water loss but stomatal closure leads to a decline in crop yield gonzález et al 1999 abouziena et al 2016 indicated that weeds could reduce crop yields by 50 due to moisture competition alone therefore water saving management practices that come at a cost to crop yields should be avoided in practice in contrast our results showed that the use of plastic mulch significantly improved crop wue under drought as reported in other global mulching meta analyses zhang et al 2017 li et al 2018 plastic mulching is an effective method for altering the soil microenvironment by increasing soil temperature reducing soil water evaporation wang et al 2018 and nitrogen leaching and suppressing weed growth abouziena et al 2008 4 4 relative factor importance for wue variation under drought identifying the relevant factors and quantifying their effects on wue variation in the soil plant atmosphere continuum is key to improving crop water stress management unsurprisingly irrigation water is the most important factor affecting crop wue under drought but it is uncontrollable and limited in rain fed dryland regions without irrigation water resources therefore it is important to understand which properties and factors in the crop system can be manipulated for better crop performance within the given environmental constraints fig 6 our results revealed that soil texture is the second most important factor affecting crop wue after irrigation level the textural characteristics of soils affect the soil water holding capacity rooting and soil water extraction which limit a crop s ability to tolerate water stress tolk et al 1999 soil texture is also associated with other soil properties and fertility for example hudson 1994 reported that som has an important role in water storage but the effect of som on water availability is soil texture dependent rawls et al 2003 therefore we suggest that soil amendment especially soil texture may be an effective way to improve crop drought resistance in areas lacking irrigation for example we can add sand to the clay soil to increase soil permeability and increase clay and organic fertilizer content for sandy soil optimizing the growing environment for such crop soil interactions could ensure a high volume of stored soil water available for plant uptake luo et al 2018 in addition the application of n is one of the most important decisions in practical farming because n influences the grain yield of arable crops wang et al 2018 the transportation of n fertilizer relies strictly on soil water so the optimal level of fertilizer application under water deficit conditions should be considered carefully to avoid degradation of soil quality due to excessive fertilization furthermore various management practices could be incorporated to regulate the soil environment indirectly such as tillage methods density adjustments amendment inputs organic manure straw return mulching cover crops weed control and so on in this meta analysis we only examined the impact of weed control and mulch on wue under drought due to the lack of information in the case studies therefore other management practices should be included and examined for their impact on crop wue under drought in future studies in our study climate type and country development only explained 8 8 and 1 4 of the variation in crop wue respectively indicating that agriculture investment in dryland areas did not differ between countries and proper farmland management weakens the effect of climate differences on wue to some extent 4 5 implications limitations and future perspectives our meta analysis provided a global dataset of wue quantitatively evaluated the wue of various crop types and identified the natural environment and management practices factors mitigating drought by regulating wue this study probably provides a basis for improving crop wue by selecting potential crop types according to local natural environment and taking effective field management practices in dryland agriculture however this study had some limitations firstly despite its current utility and future potential meta analysis has some uncertainties due to data collection limitations for example the fiber crop contains only cotton in the crop classification the dataset also had a geographical bias for example the arid and rain fed regions had fewer data and the wue data for some crop species came from only one study these biases may induce uncertainty in the outcomes therefore more relevant studies should be included in similar meta analyses in the future secondly many other factors should be considered such as the key soil hydraulic parameters and additional biological factors tong et al 2009 lin et al 2018 however most of the studies included in our meta analysis did not report these parameters in the future field studies should describe growing environments and specific management practices in more detail additionally future work should concentrate on more interactive analyses of the various factors that influence wue variation under drought 5 conclusions this global meta analysis quantitatively evaluated the wue response of various crop to drought and the effect of natural factors and management practices on wue variation under drought this analysis has broad implications for improving crop wue in regions with limited water resources adjusting the crop planting structure in dryland areas according to their drought resistance is a key step to improving crop yields and saving water resources for example cotton could be one of crop selection reference for hyper arid or arid regions and legumes are not recommended to grow in drylands without irrigation cereal and oil crop are suitable for growing in semi arid or dry sub humid areas and wheat is more resistant to drought than maize on top of this selecting a suitable natural growing environment and optimized management practices can mitigate the negative effects of drought on crops to some extent our results indicate irrigation is the most effective approach for mitigating drought and appropriate water deficit relative irrigation water amount 60 can improve crop wue moreover soil improvement and fertilizer management are the effective methods to alleviate drought stress in addition to irrigation for dryland areas without irrigation water resources an optimal soil environment and appropriate farming practices can alleviate the negative effects of drought to some extent our results showed that soil with a medium texture 1 3 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density and 15 20 g kg 1 organic matter is beneficial for improving crop wue under drought nitrogen application can improve crop wue but the optimal n application rate for water deficit conditions should be considered carefully and not exceed 200 kg ha 1 for wheat in drylands moreover field management practices such as mulching and weed control also can help alleviate drought by regulating wue this meta analysis quantified the variations in crop wue under drought based on the available scientific evidence providing a basis for management decisions for improving crop wue under drought across global drylands

4883,agriculture s need to feed the growing population is challenged by the decline in available water resources especially in the context of global climate change improving crop water use efficiency wue will help to safeguard the environmental sustainability of food production in dryland areas however the impact of drought on crop wue varies a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of relevant factors is needed to support evidence based management decisions here we used a meta analysis of global drylands 81 studies with 836 paired observations to evaluate the response of various crop wues to drought based on various natural and human induced factors our results showed that responses of crop types wue varied under drought intensity which probably a reference for crop selection in drylands cotton could be one of crop selection reference in hyper arid or arid regions and legume is not recommended for drylands without irrigation cereal crop are suitable for growing in semi arid or dry sub humid areas moreover soil improvement and fertilizer management are the effective methods to alleviate drought stress in addition to irrigation soil with medium texture 1 3 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density and 15 20 g kg 1 organic matter is beneficial for improving wue under drought fertilizer should be carefully considered and not exceed 200 kg ha 1 for wheat in drylands water deficit can improve crop wue but should not exceed 40 of the full irrigation amount field management practices such as mulching and weed control can help alleviate drought by regulating wue to some extent this study evaluated the responses of various crop wues to drought and highlighted the factors contributing to and or decreasing crop wue from natural factor and management practices which provides a basis for agricultural drought mitigation strategies under future climate change in dryland areas keywords crop selection yield dryland agriculture water productivity irrigation 1 introduction drylands cover 40 of the global land surface and this area is expected to increase by 4 8 by 2100 dai 2013 huang et al 2016 various crop models have also simulated an increase in drought driven crop yield losses by 2100 leng and hall 2019 moreover multi model predictions indicate that climate change is likely to exacerbate regional and global water scarcity and confront approximately 15 more of the global population with a severe decline in water resources under representative concentration pathways 8 5 schewe et al 2014 agriculture water use is necessary to feed the world s population and is the largest single user of freshwater accounting for 70 of total freshwater use worldwide wallace 2000 therefore it is important to improve crop water use efficiency to guarantee food security under predicted drought stress associated with climate change zhang and zhang 2007 flexas et al 2016 crop water use efficiency wue crop productivity per unit of water used is a key factor for determining the efficiency of water use by crops and for targeting crops for selection and breeding condon et al 2004 flexas et al 2016 there are different ways of quantifying wue based on observations depending on the research scales leaf whole plant filed and ecosystem this study focuses on crop wue at the field level based on yield production the plant wue is a complex trait controlled by many genes related to drought resistance karaba et al 2007 hughes et al 2017 therefore ensuring that crops demonstrate high wue under drought conditions is important in water limited agricultural regions kang et al 2017 and has evoked calls for a blue revolution to produce more crop per drop of water boland et al 1993 zhang and zhang 2007 therefore understanding the response of crop wue to drought is crucial for ensuring food and water resource security under climate change over the past decades numerous studies have reported the effects of drought on wue in various crops worldwide xue et al 2014 hao et al 2015 hao et al 2019 which have improved our understanding of the mechanisms underlying drought effects briggs and shantz 1913 first reported differences in the wue of six crops in response to water stress in pot experiments at the beginning of the 20th century subsequently many researchers endeavored to examine and improve the wue of various crops under drought stress however the current understanding of crop wue in response to drought remains highly uncertain due to contradictory results and the lack of large and complete datasets for example drought can decrease liu et al 2016 or increase kang et al 2002 crop wue which may result from different treatments environments climate and soil or management practices however the effect of natural factors and management practices on wue under drought cannot be evaluated quantitatively and are typically ignored in case studies in addition reviews tend to only report the effects of drought on wue for individual crops worldwide kang et al 2002 or various crop wues in a particular region katerji et al 2008 therefore integrating the available data from different sources will help to quantitatively evaluate the wue of various crops and identify possible factors affecting wue under drought compared with traditional methods a meta analysis is a quantitative and scientific synthesis tool that can be used to provide reliable conclusions and identify heterogeneous sources from different individual studies gurevitch et al 2018 here a comprehensive meta analysis was performed based on 836 observations from 81 papers published between 1970 and 2018 to a evaluate the wue response of various crops to drought intensity and b quantify the effects of natural factors and management practices on wue variation under drought 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources peer reviewed research papers published between 1970 and 2018 were collected from the web of science and google scholar data were also collected from the china national knowledge internet https www cnki net for the literature search the targeted search terms were water use efficiency or efficiency of water use or wue or water productivity and drought or water stress or water deficit several criteria were set to identify studies and avoid biases in the selection a agronomic wue was calculated as yield evapotranspiration where yield is the economic output of crops and evapotranspiration during crop growth b experiments yielded paired data of crop wue under well watered control and drought treatments a mandatory requirement for the meta analysis c experiments conducted on the same spatiotemporal scales with identical environmental and soil parameters and species composition in both the control and drought treatments and d means standard deviations or standard errors and replicates of crop wue could be directly extracted or calculated from the collected data measurements across different drought intensities temporal scales and crop species cultivars were considered independent observations if more than one drought intensity temporal scale or crop species cultivars was available from the same study in total 81 research studies with 836 observations satisfied our selection criteria and the dataset mainly involved 35 crop species and 105 crop cultivars from 17 countries the collected data and detailed information are summarized in table 1 appendix b a world map showing the sampling points of global dryland areas in the meta analysis is shown in fig 1 2 2 data extraction and classification several explanatory variables including natural environment and management practice factors that could affect crop wue variance under drought stress were extracted and classified in appendix b soil drought intensity decrease in water input from 0 to 100 was expressed as the percentage change in precipitation or irrigation between control and drought treatments we divided soil drought intensity into three levels mild 30 moderate 30 60 and severe 60 in addition when control and drought treatments were manipulated to maintain a certain soil water content drought intensity was calculated from the percentage change in soil water content between control and drought treatments zhou et al 2018 natural environmental variables included country development climate water resources and local soil conditions the level of country development was separated into developed and developing countries climate zones were determined by the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration p pet and were separated into dry sub humid 0 50 0 65 semiarid 0 20 0 50 arid 0 05 0 2 and hyper arid regions 0 05 according to iucn 2008 water resources reflected the availability of local irrigation conditions and were classified as irrigated and rain fed regions three soil property variables were selected for the meta analysis soil texture bulk density and organic matter content soil texture fine medium and coarse soil was categorized according to the cornell comprehensive assessment of soil health framework soil bulk density sbd was divided into four categories 1 3 1 3 1 4 1 4 1 5 and 1 5 g cm 3 soil organic matter som was divided into four categories 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 g kg 1 management practices included irrigation level rates of applied n weed control and plastic mulch irrigation level was divided into four categories according to the percentages of full irrigation water amount 80 100 60 80 40 60 and 40 the rate of applied n for wheat was separated into three levels 100 100 200 and 200 300 kg ha 1 weed control and plastic mulch management were categorized as implemented or not implemented in each study when data from the selected studies were only presented graphically the figures were digitized to extract numerical values using getdata graph digitizer v 2 22 russian federation http www getdata graph digitizer com 2 3 effect size and model selection a meta analysis was used to combine the available data of all crop species from different sources to obtain a unified view of the response of wue to drought the response ratio was used as a metric of effect size in the meta analysis hedges et al 1999 to reflect the effect of drought on crop wue 1 rr l n x e x c where rr is a unit free index with positive and negative values indicating either increasing or decreasing wue in response to changes in drought stress and xe and xc are mean values of crop wue under drought and control treatments respectively for each study the within column variance v associated with each rr value was calculated from the standard deviation associated with each wue 2 v s e 2 n e x e 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 where se and sc are the standard deviations of wue in the drought and control groups respectively and ne and nc are sample sizes of the wue in the drought and control groups respectively a weighted random effects model was selected because the main assumptions are more likely to be satisfied when dealing with ecological data synthesis hedges et al 1999 the weighted mean response ratio was calculated as follows 3 rr i 1 k w i rr i i k w i where i is the number of the case study in the meta analysis k is the cumulative number of case studies and w is the weight of each response ratio individual rr values were weighted by the reciprocal of their variance 1 v rr τ 2 to account for differences in precision among studies the between group variance τ 2 was calculated using the restricted maximum likelihood method hedges et al 1999 4 τ 2 q t k 1 i 1 k w i i 1 k w i 2 i 1 k w i where qt is a statistic based on a chi squared test used to examine the heterogeneity across case studies a significant qt indicates that effect sizes are not equal across studies which implies that other explanatory variables may influence the results further qt was partitioned into between group qm and within group qe heterogeneity the significance level of qm indicates that the independent variable explains a significant amount of the variance in effect size predicted by this model in such cases meta regression analyses were conducted to examine the p values associated with qm qm describes the heterogeneity of effect sizes related to the wue differences between crop categories and was used to make categorical comparisons if p 0 05 qm was considered an important factor affecting wue under drought stress weighted response ratios of categorical variables were considered significantly different if their 95 confidence intervals 95 cis did not overlap 0 2 4 data analysis the effect sizes rr and 95 cis were generated by building a weighted random effects model with restricted maximum likelihood estimation the influence of categorical variables on wue effect sizes was tested by using meta regression to examine between group heterogeneity q m rosenthal s fail safe number n representing the number of studies required to refute significant meta analytic means was used to test the effect of publication bias oswald 2009 all statistical analyses about meta analysis calculations were conducted using openmee brown university providence usa an open source software for ecological and evolutionary meta analysis gurevitch et al 2018 wallace et al 2017 the percentage change in wue caused by drought stress was calculated from the weighted response ratios using the equation exp rr 1 100 aggregated boosted tree analysis de ath 2007 was carried out using the gbmplus package in r with 500 trees used for boosting a 0 02 fold shrinkage rate and three way interactions to quantitatively and visually evaluate the relative influences of explanatory variables climate country development irrigation level plastic mulch n fertilizer weed control soil texture som and sbd on crop wue under drought stress 3 results 3 1 wue response of various crops to drought intensity the meta analysis showed that the weighted response ratios of crop wue under drought stress were normally distributed fig a1 appendix a the overall rr of crop wue in response to drought was 0 007 and the 95 ci was 0 002 to 0 008 indicating that the drought effect on overall effect size of wue is not significant among 836 observations but there was significant residual heterogeneity in the random effects meta analysis for the dataset qt 10761 1 p 0 001 this indicates that the factors that affect wue under drought stress are required for in depth explanations of heterogeneity crop type significantly explained the heterogeneity associated with cereal legume oil fiber tuber vegetable and fruit crops q m 91 1 p 0 001 fig 2 across all observations mild drought increased crop wue by 2 4 but moderate and severe drought decreased crop wue by 2 8 and 1 3 respectively for cereal and oil crops wues increased by 2 2 and 4 0 under mild drought but decreased by 0 6 and 8 9 under severe drought in contrast the wue of tuber crops increased by 25 4 under severe drought moreover the wue of legumes decreased significantly under mild moderate and severe drought by 13 4 15 0 and 48 0 respectively however the wue of fiber crops increased significantly under mild moderate and severe drought by 5 8 11 7 and 23 9 respectively among cereal crops the wue of wheat only increased under mild 6 5 and moderate 5 5 drought while maize only increased under severe drought 6 1 fig 3 3 2 effect of natural factors on wue under drought comparing crop wue responses across the world on average drought had a negative effect in developed countries 5 1 and a positive effect in developing countries 3 3 fig 4 a crop wues in response to drought were also influenced by the local climate with negative response ratios in hyper arid 0 4 and semiarid 4 0 regions and positive response ratios in arid 10 0 and dry sub humid 2 3 regions fig 4b it is worth mentioning that arid regions had much smaller sample sizes n 33 than other drylands and most of the arid regions n 29 were in developing countries moreover most of the studies in this meta analysis were undertaken in irrigated regions n 636 with 10 from rain fed regions n 65 there were no significant differences in wue response ratios occurred between irrigated and rain fed regions fig 4c crop wue responses to drought varied significantly in soils with different textures bulk densities and organic matter contents fig 4d f medium textured soil performed better than fine and coarse textured soil with an increase of 5 8 fig 4d crop wue ratios were positive for soil bulk densities of 1 3 1 4 g cm 3 3 6 and 1 4 1 5 g cm 3 3 0 but negative for soil bulk densities of 1 3 2 0 and 1 5 g cm 3 8 1 fig 4e crop wue decreased at som levels 10 g kg 1 6 9 but increased at som levels of 10 15 3 7 15 20 9 5 and 20 g kg 1 1 2 fig 4f 3 3 effect of management practices on wue under drought irrigation water is a key factor in crop wue under drought and the results revealed that crop wue improved under drought when irrigation water was 60 or 40 of full irrigation water amount fig 5 a crops have different needs for basic n fertilizer we used wheat as an example to analyze the effect of n fertilizer on the response of wue to drought due to sufficient sample sizes for wheat n 247 our results revealed that wue decreased 5 5 under drought at an n application rate between 200 and 300 kg ha 1 but increased by 3 8 and 33 9 at n application rates of 100 200 and 100 kg ha 1 respectively fig 5b the analysis also revealed that of plastic mulch application mitigates the negative effects of drought and improves crop wue by 7 3 under drought stress fig 5c weed control decreased wue 3 6 under drought fig 5d 3 4 key factors affecting wue under drought to compare the relative importance of the natural environment and management practices on crop wue under drought we conducted an aggregated boosted tree abt analysis fig 6 overall effects of management practices on the response of crop wue to drought were prior to those of natural factors irrigation was the most effective method for mitigate drought by regulating wue accounting for 29 3 of the relative influence in addition soil properties including texture 20 3 som 9 8 and sbd 8 9 explain 30 of relative influence for management practices n fertilizer 12 7 plastic mulch 5 7 and weed control 3 1 account for 21 5 of the relative influence moreover climate and country development only account for 8 8 and 1 4 of relative influence respectively 4 discussion 4 1 wue response of various crops to drought intensity the response of different crop types wue varied among drought intensities fig 2 which probably provides a reference for crop selection according to local drought intensity for example fiber crop mainly cotton had better drought resistance than other crop types because the positive wue ratio occurred under mild moderate and severe drought han et al 2016 reported similar findings in cotton and cited the importance of mesophyll conductance in changing anatomical structure and aquaporin expression for improving wue under drought therefore we suggest cotton could be one of crop selection reference in hyper arid or arid regions in contrast the decline in legume wues under various drought intensities suggests that legumes are more sensitive to drought stress than other crop types we suggest that legumes are not recommended to be grown in dryland where irrigation water is scare the different response of legume and cotton to drought may be distinct strategies to perform photosynthesis under drought cotton appears to rely on enhanced electron transport flux for light energy utilization under drought in contrast legume preferentially uses light regulated non photochemical energy dissipation which may have been enhanced by the higher cyclic electron flow in drought stressed leaves zhang et al 2011 daryanto et al 2017 reported similar results in a quantitative analysis of legume cereal and tuber crops yields under drought the fact that legume wues improved under various drought intensities is important given the prominence of this crop globally polania et al 2016 legumes have a major impact on agriculture the environment and health they are often used to improve soil organic fertility and nitrogen economy due to their ability to fix nitrogen symbiotically therefore breeding programs involving drought adaptation in legumes should include biotechnological approaches to improve drought resistance using stress related genes moreover cereal and oil crop have a positive wue ratio under mild drought stress and negative wue ratio under severe drought stress indicating that they are suitable for growing in semi arid and dry sub humid regions in addition we analyzed the responses of wheat and maize to different drought intensities in widely cultivated cereal crops importantly as high frequency and extensive drought events have occurred in countries focused on crop yield and water resources our results show that wheat is the preferred crop for mild and moderate drought and maize is more suitable for severe drought one possible explanation is the differences in their photosynthetic pathways hsiao et al 2007 with wheat being a c3 crop and maize being a c4 crop their wue ratios were 0 014 and 0 55 respectively fig a2 appendix a despite maize having a higher wue than wheat due to its lower leaf resistance and co2 compensation points it is more sensitive to drought daryanto et al 2016 as also reported in some experimental case studies pearcy et al 1981 baldocchi 1994 and meta analyses daryanto et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 because c4 crops decrease their photosynthetic rates much more than their transpiration rates under drought conditions therefore selecting suitable crops according to local conditions is one of the ways to improve crop wue under drylands 4 2 natural factors on average crop wue in developing countries performed better under drought than developed countries fig 4a which may be because crops in developed countries tend to be grown under optimal conditions including sufficient irrigation and advanced irrigation equipment under drought stress crop adaptation or acclimation to drought in suboptimal environments is expressed by improving the wue bhargava and sawant 2013 moreover crop wue ratios varied between the four dryland areas examined in the meta analysis the significant positive effects in arid regions may be because most of the data 29 of 33 observations came from developing countries the overall effect in hyper arid and dry sub humid regions were not significant one of the reasons may be due to the insufficient sample sizes of each dryland types another reason may be optimizing cultivars and irrigation and good management practices weaken the influence of climate to some extent parry et al 2005 davies et al 2011 we conclude that the wue ratio varies between climate zones but the quantitative effects are unknown daryanto et al 2017 reported no yield differences between crops grown in dryland versus non dryland conditions across cereal legume and tuber crops this discrepancy may be attributed to the rough delineation of drylands in the study a recent meta analysis also identified crop wue variations in different climatic regions mbava et al 2020 moreover the results showed that there was no difference between irrigated and rain fed regions however jin et al 2018 indicated that the effects of water stress on wue differed between the irrigated and rain fed regions this may be because the minority of studies in our meta analysis came from rain fed regions 65 of 701 observations with atypical wue data therefore more studies that satisfy our criteria in rain fed regions are needed the response of crop wue varied with different soil properties fig 4d f some studies have found that the effect of drought on crop yield is influenced by soil properties anthony et al 2012 liebig et al 2018 crop wue and yield responses to drought had a significant positive correlation yu et al 2020a indicating that crop wue under drought may be also influenced by soil properties however the effect of soil properties on wue is often neglected even in some reviews on wue katerji et al 2008 because such effects are not demonstrated sufficiently our results indicated that the wue of crops grown in medium textured soil with 1 3 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density and 15 20 g kg 1 organic matter improved under drought fig 4d f medium textured soils performed best for wue possibly due to an appropriate clay content which would have reduced soil water content variations more than in fine textured soil katerji and mastrorilli 2009 also found that wue in four crops decreased significantly when grown in clay soil in a multi year experiment due to a water uptake deficit during the active growing phase another reason might be that the soil pores of medium textured soil allow the roots to be more prolific and reach deeper soil zones in response to drought ramamoorthy et al 2017 crops grew best at an intermediate soil bulk density which presumably represents a compromise between soil that is soft enough to allow good root development stirzaker et al 1996 soil organic matter plays a major role in soil fertility due to its influence on the physical chemical and biological properties of soil quiroga et al 2006 our results indicate that crop wue decreased at 10 g kg 1 organic matter moreover crop wue did not always increase with increasing som and the increasing trend was not significant when som was 20 g kg 1 in a global meta analysis oldfield et al 2019 reported that increasing som content increased yields until the concentrations reached approximately 20 g kg 1 a good soil environment will guarantee food and water security which can be improved with soil amendments and appropriate management practices luo et al 2018 wang et al 2018 4 3 management practices crop wue can be controlled to some degree by management practices such as irrigation fertilization and mulching qiu et al 2008 bodner et al 2015 therefore wue under drought should improve under appropriate management practices farooq et al 2019 the results perhaps unsurprisingly revealed that appropriate irrigation improves crop wue fig 6 strategies that involve reducing irrigation water such as deficit and partial root zone irrigation maintain or increase crop wue to some extent du et al 2010 yu et al 2020b but the threshold for the reduction in irrigation water varied with different irrigation levels in the case studies our results synthesized a global meta analysis further revealing that the increasing trend in crop wue ceased to exist when the relative irrigation water amount was no 60 of full irrigation water amount despite wue increases when irrigation levels are 40 of full irrigation water amount it is always at the expense of yield yu et al 2020b appropriate and intermittent water deficits resulted in root adaptations that enabled plants to maximize their water use in these critical stages vadez 2014 bodner et al 2015 for example du et al 2010 and kang et al 2000 found that drought during early growth was beneficial for improving wue and yield in cereal crops our results indicated that the crop wue of wheat increased when the anthropogenic application of n was 200 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilizers stimulate crop growth yet excessive n input from anthropogenic sources cause soil degradation reducing soil fertility and productivity conley et al 2009 divito et al 2011 and ultimately decreasing crop wue especially under water deficit this is because fertilizers can only be absorbed by plants through water transport with the remainder persisting in the soil which changes the soil properties under water deficit wheat yields did not respond to n application rates above 135 kg ha 1 but declined by up to 50 at 270 kg ha 1 qin et al 2018 therefore the optimal level of fertilizer application under water deficit should be considered carefully our results indicated that crops used water more efficiently without weed control under drought conditions fig 6d which may be due to the reduction in crop transpiration weeds compete for soil water reduce water availability and further contribute to crop water stress abouziena et al 2008 in the presence of weeds crops reduce their stomatal conductance to avoid excessive water loss but stomatal closure leads to a decline in crop yield gonzález et al 1999 abouziena et al 2016 indicated that weeds could reduce crop yields by 50 due to moisture competition alone therefore water saving management practices that come at a cost to crop yields should be avoided in practice in contrast our results showed that the use of plastic mulch significantly improved crop wue under drought as reported in other global mulching meta analyses zhang et al 2017 li et al 2018 plastic mulching is an effective method for altering the soil microenvironment by increasing soil temperature reducing soil water evaporation wang et al 2018 and nitrogen leaching and suppressing weed growth abouziena et al 2008 4 4 relative factor importance for wue variation under drought identifying the relevant factors and quantifying their effects on wue variation in the soil plant atmosphere continuum is key to improving crop water stress management unsurprisingly irrigation water is the most important factor affecting crop wue under drought but it is uncontrollable and limited in rain fed dryland regions without irrigation water resources therefore it is important to understand which properties and factors in the crop system can be manipulated for better crop performance within the given environmental constraints fig 6 our results revealed that soil texture is the second most important factor affecting crop wue after irrigation level the textural characteristics of soils affect the soil water holding capacity rooting and soil water extraction which limit a crop s ability to tolerate water stress tolk et al 1999 soil texture is also associated with other soil properties and fertility for example hudson 1994 reported that som has an important role in water storage but the effect of som on water availability is soil texture dependent rawls et al 2003 therefore we suggest that soil amendment especially soil texture may be an effective way to improve crop drought resistance in areas lacking irrigation for example we can add sand to the clay soil to increase soil permeability and increase clay and organic fertilizer content for sandy soil optimizing the growing environment for such crop soil interactions could ensure a high volume of stored soil water available for plant uptake luo et al 2018 in addition the application of n is one of the most important decisions in practical farming because n influences the grain yield of arable crops wang et al 2018 the transportation of n fertilizer relies strictly on soil water so the optimal level of fertilizer application under water deficit conditions should be considered carefully to avoid degradation of soil quality due to excessive fertilization furthermore various management practices could be incorporated to regulate the soil environment indirectly such as tillage methods density adjustments amendment inputs organic manure straw return mulching cover crops weed control and so on in this meta analysis we only examined the impact of weed control and mulch on wue under drought due to the lack of information in the case studies therefore other management practices should be included and examined for their impact on crop wue under drought in future studies in our study climate type and country development only explained 8 8 and 1 4 of the variation in crop wue respectively indicating that agriculture investment in dryland areas did not differ between countries and proper farmland management weakens the effect of climate differences on wue to some extent 4 5 implications limitations and future perspectives our meta analysis provided a global dataset of wue quantitatively evaluated the wue of various crop types and identified the natural environment and management practices factors mitigating drought by regulating wue this study probably provides a basis for improving crop wue by selecting potential crop types according to local natural environment and taking effective field management practices in dryland agriculture however this study had some limitations firstly despite its current utility and future potential meta analysis has some uncertainties due to data collection limitations for example the fiber crop contains only cotton in the crop classification the dataset also had a geographical bias for example the arid and rain fed regions had fewer data and the wue data for some crop species came from only one study these biases may induce uncertainty in the outcomes therefore more relevant studies should be included in similar meta analyses in the future secondly many other factors should be considered such as the key soil hydraulic parameters and additional biological factors tong et al 2009 lin et al 2018 however most of the studies included in our meta analysis did not report these parameters in the future field studies should describe growing environments and specific management practices in more detail additionally future work should concentrate on more interactive analyses of the various factors that influence wue variation under drought 5 conclusions this global meta analysis quantitatively evaluated the wue response of various crop to drought and the effect of natural factors and management practices on wue variation under drought this analysis has broad implications for improving crop wue in regions with limited water resources adjusting the crop planting structure in dryland areas according to their drought resistance is a key step to improving crop yields and saving water resources for example cotton could be one of crop selection reference for hyper arid or arid regions and legumes are not recommended to grow in drylands without irrigation cereal and oil crop are suitable for growing in semi arid or dry sub humid areas and wheat is more resistant to drought than maize on top of this selecting a suitable natural growing environment and optimized management practices can mitigate the negative effects of drought on crops to some extent our results indicate irrigation is the most effective approach for mitigating drought and appropriate water deficit relative irrigation water amount 60 can improve crop wue moreover soil improvement and fertilizer management are the effective methods to alleviate drought stress in addition to irrigation for dryland areas without irrigation water resources an optimal soil environment and appropriate farming practices can alleviate the negative effects of drought to some extent our results showed that soil with a medium texture 1 3 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density and 15 20 g kg 1 organic matter is beneficial for improving crop wue under drought nitrogen application can improve crop wue but the optimal n application rate for water deficit conditions should be considered carefully and not exceed 200 kg ha 1 for wheat in drylands moreover field management practices such as mulching and weed control also can help alleviate drought by regulating wue this meta analysis quantified the variations in crop wue under drought based on the available scientific evidence providing a basis for management decisions for improving crop wue under drought across global drylands

4884,the gap between the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on mission grace fo is a crucial problem leading to discontinuous global mass change information from time variable gravity field solutions we aim to use the improved multichannel singular spectrum analysis mssa to fill the gap and reconstruct the continual global mass change signals in this study the one year gravity field gap is filled with improved mssa based on the release 06 rl06 monthly gravity field models provided by center for space research csr truncated to d o 60 and further compared with swarm monthly solutions d o 40 the results show that the infilled gravity field models agree with the swarm solutions indicating that improved mssa can reliably bridge the gap between grace and grace fo missions moreover relative to the global land data assimilation system gldas noah model the infilled gravity field models have higher correlation coefficients and smaller root mean squared errors than swarm solutions for the mass change signals over congo lena and fraser river basins according to the simulation results using the same gap as grace and grace fo improved mssa can fill the gap very efficiently and reliably in 25 major river basins over the world keywords grace grace fo swarm multichannel singular spectrum analysis data gap gldas 1 introduction the monthly gravity field models derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission tapley et al 2004 spanning march 2002 to october 2017 were commonly applied in many areas such as hydrology climatology marine science and geophysics for its high resolution and accuracy for example grace has provided new insights into the total water storage change twsc syed et al 2008 landerer and swenson 2012 guo et al 2018 hydrological mass variations abd elbaky and jin 2019 chen 2019 chandan and nagesh 2018 drought or flood detection yirdaw et al 2008 thomas et al 2014 forootan et al 2019 and global ocean mass change chen et al 2018a tamisiea 2011 cazenave 2018 the antarctic ice sheet mass changes chen et al 2009 gao et al 2015 tapley et al 2019 the glacial isostatic adjustment gia steffen et al 2008 etc however the grace mission operated from march 2002 to october 2017 and then the grace fo mission was launched in may 2018 therefore there exists about one year of missing data between the two grace missions li et al 2020 which leads to the inability to supply continuous geophysical information how to bridge the gap effectively is valuable to acquire continual grace geophysical signals many efforts were carried out to explore the potential of bridging the gap between the two grace missions with some alternative observations or approaches in general the gap filling methods can be classified into three aspects firstly satellite laser ranging slr or gps global positioning system observations to low earth orbiting satellites such as swarm can provide the temporal gravity solutions with a lower spatial resolution bezděk et al 2016 jäggi et al 2016 lück et al 2018 teixeira et al 2019 which provides an opportunity to bridge the gap forootan et al 2020 the potential to bridge the gap of the two grace missions with swarm was investigated by lück et al 2018 and forootan et al 2020 and successfully implemented by meyer et al 2019 secondly one can reconstruct the grace twsc by determining the relationships between twsc and corresponding climatic and hydrological variables specifically including rainfall temperature etc which is normally called data driven approaches humphry and gudmundsson 2019 hasan et al 2019 hasan and tarhule 2020 for example the artificial neural network ann was adopted to learn the relationship between twsc and related variables ahmed et al 2019 forootan et al 2014 first applied the independent component analysis ica forootan and kusche 2012 to separate the grace signals into their original sources then produced the reconstruction and derived the relations based on the autoregressive exogenous arx ljung 1987 li et al 2020 applied data driven methods for reconstructing and predicting grace like gridded twsc using climate inputs besides other approaches including the multiple linear regression mlr approach myers 1986 convolutional neural network cnn sun et al 2019 and principal component analysis pca wold 1987 were also used to extrapolate the grace time series of gridded twsc outside the grace period by constructing relationship models with indicators such as precipitation land surface temperature etc li et al 2020 besides the above approaches many interpolation methods such as linear interpolation zotov and shum 2010 zotov 2012 cubic spline interpolation guo et al 2018 and least squares fitting rangelova et al 2010 were used to interpolate missing data with neighboring data however the performance of filling gap with these interpolation approaches is basically dependent on the lengths of time series and gaps availability of neighboring data and so on semiromi and koch 2019 in contrast to the above methods a data adaptive method ssa mssa can better decompose the time series into a trend periodic components and noise and distinguish spatiotemporal patterns zotov and shum 2010 zotov 2012 three classified ssa based approaches have been proposed for filling the data gap the first approach is an iterative interpolation that first needs to fill the missing data with arbitrary numbers golyandina 2010 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 prevost et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the second one is an ssa based forecasting approach used for bridging the twsa gap of two grace missions li et al 2019 the third approach named improved ssa issa was first proposed in shen et al 2015 for stationary time series and performed the algorithm only with available observations it should be noted that all three ssa based approaches assumed that the reconstructed or forecasted component can be approximately represented by a time series with finite rank golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 the improved mssa wang et al 2020 which is the extension of issa shen et al 2015 has been successfully used to process the incomplete grace monthly solutions the improved mssa can fill the missing data especially for consecutive data gaps more exact than the other interpolation and iteration mssa approaches wang et al 2020 this will provide a new method to fill the large gap between the two grace missions accurately the missing months between grace and grace fo account for 14 35 of the total data from april 2002 to march 2020 to test whether improved mssa can effectively fill the large gap we will deeply investigate it in this study as we know that the grace gravity field solutions can be validated by comparing with some independent geophysical data for example the in situ data such as ocean bottom pressure and global navigation satellite systems gnss derived vertical loads chambers and willis 2010 chen et al 2018b and the hydrological models such as gldas noah and wghm data li et al 2020 etc however according to forootan et al 2020 the in situ data is more suited to evaluate the low degree spectral variations therefore we use the gldas noah models to demonstrate the performance of improved mssa and swarm solutions the rest of this paper is organized as follows the datasets used in this study are briefly described in section 2 we briefly introduced the improved mssa in section 3 the results of the filled gap using improved mssa are presented and compared with the swarm data in section 4 the simulation experiment is performed in section 5 for further evaluating the improved mssa and finally the conclusions are shown in section 6 2 datasets 2 1 grace and grace fo data many institutions provided different time variable monthly gravity field solutions due to adopting different processing strategies known as grace level 2 l2 products in this paper we mainly focus on bridging the gap between two grace missions using improved mssa and select the csr rl06 monthly gravity field models being truncated to d o 60 from april 2002 to march 2020 which can be directly downloaded by the website of the international centre for global earth models icgem http icgem gfz potsdam de home from april 2002 to march 2020 there exist 33 missing months data that are specifically presented in table 1 the swarm l2 monthly gravity field models for comparing the results of improved mssa are also presented in table 1 2 2 swarm l2 gravity field models the swarm monthly gravity field solutions were derived from the gps tracking data of three swarm satellites with a lower spatial resolution li et al 2020 encarnacao et al 2019 the specific details can be hand on the website of https earth esa int swarm here we adopt the combined monthly swarm l2 gravity field solutions being synthesized with four different swarm solutions by the astronomical institute czech academy of sciences asu more details about the combined swarm models can be hand in encarnacao et al 2019 data can be downloaded from the website of icgem http icgem gfz potsdam de home note that the swarm sh coefficients are up to d o 40 with the time span from december 2013 to march 2020 encarnacao et al 2019 2 3 gldas data hydrological models have been commonly used to validate the gravity field variation caused by the variations of soil moisture near surface air temperature accumulated snow and other hydrological components over the land regions following chen et al 2016 we adopt the gldas noah models with monthly time resolution and 1 1 spatial resolution which can be downloaded from https daac gsfc nasa gov datasets keywords noah the gldas noah model from april 2002 to march 2020 is adopted in this study and the corresponding used parameters can be hand in the website https daac gsfc nasa gov 3 methodology improved mssa can be directly used to process the incomplete grace monthly gravity field solutions without either data interpolation or iteration wang et al 2020 it has great potential for bridging the large consecutive gap of the two grace missions relative to other interpolation or iteration mssa approaches 3 1 improved mssa approach the improved mssa approach is briefly introduced in this section the details can be hand in wang et al 2020 the main differences of improved mssa with respect to traditional mssa mainly consist of two aspects constructing the lag covariance matrix c and calculating the principal component pc assume that there is a dataset with n time epochs and l data points spatial channels x l t t 1 2 n l 1 2 l the main procedure of improved mssa are described below 1 form a data trajectory matrix x the trajectory matrix of the channel l with m time lags vautard et al 1992 1 x l x l 1 x l 2 x l k x l 2 x l 3 x l k 1 x l m x l m 1 x l n where k n m 1 then a k l m trajectory matrix can be formed rangelova et al 2012 2 x x 1 x 2 x l t 2 construct the lag covariance matrix c for the complete time series one can perform either the singular value decomposition svd to the trajectory matrix x or eigendecomposition to the lag covariance matrix c xx t if the missing data exist in an incomplete time series one cannot directly perform the svd to x but can form the lag covariance matrix c only with the available data of the time series in improved mssa each element c i j of the lag covariance matrix c for the multivariate incomplete time series is computed by shen et al 2015 schoellhamer 2001 3 c i j 1 n ij l 1 l m 1 m x l i m 1 x l j m 1 where i j 1 2 k n ij is the number of available products of x l i m 1 and x l j m 1 within the sample set then the matrix c can be decomposed as c v λ v 1 λ is a diagonal matrix with k diagonal elements and v is the orthogonal matrix with the eigenvectors v k 3 calculate the principal component pc the second key difference for improved mssa is the way of calculating the pcs for incomplete time series xl t which can be written as wang et al 2019 2020 4 a l k i i j 1 s i x l i j 1 v j k i j 1 s i x l i j 1 v j k where 1 i m s i represents the available data index set and s i represents the data gap index set within the corresponding integer interval wang et al 2020 the gap can be bridged once the pcs are available the missing data in eq 4 is replaced with pcs below wang et al 2020 5 x l i j 1 n 1 k a l n i v j n then we can yield a rank deficient linear system of k equations to calculate the pcs by substituting eq 5 into 4 to solve the rank deficient equations the criterion is introduced by minimizing the weighted norm of the pcs with the weight matrix λ sorting in the same order as pcs for the details one can be referred to wang et al 2020 4 reconstruct the time series for all channels once the pcs a l k i k 1 2 k were determined the original time series x l t can be reconstructed with the calculated pcs and eigenvectors wang et al 2020 considering that the bigger singular values represent the components corresponding to signal and the smaller ones to noise guo et al 2018 we can reconstruct the original time series and bridge the gap with first d rcs for all channels 3 2 grace inversion approach the global equivalent water height ewh of mass changes are computed as wahr et al 1998 6 δ h φ λ a ρ ave 3 ρ w l 0 m 0 l p lm sin φ 2 l 1 1 k l δ c lm cos m λ δ s lm sin m λ where φ λ l and m are the latitude longitude degree and order respectively besides a and ρ ave correspond to the mean radius and density of the earth ρ w the density of water p lm sin φ the fully normalized associated legendre function kl the load love number δ c lm and δ s lm are the reconstructed spherical harmonic sh coefficients by improved mssa prevost et al 2019 wang et al 2020 4 bridging the gap between grace and grace fo missions using improved mssa to explore the potential of improved mssa for filling the gap between two grace missions the csr rl06 monthly gravity field models are analyzed from april 2002 to march 2020 with 33 months missing data the grace grace fo and swarm monthly sh coefficients are truncated to d o 60 and 40 respectively and are subtracted with the corresponding mean field bettadpur 2012 the background of the swarm solution is unified to grace and grace fo all the c20 coefficients of grace grace fo and swarm solutions are substituted with the slr estimates cheng et al 2013 in addition the c30 coefficients for grace fo are also substituted with slr estimates cheng et al 2013 and all degree one c10 c11 as well as s11 are added back from swenson et al 2008 4 1 determine gaussian smoothing radius of monthly gravity field solutions to the best of our knowledge the grace grace fo and swarm high degree sh coefficients were seriously polluted by noise requiring gaussian smoothing filtering with a certain radius to suppress the noise the gaussian smoothing radius is a key parameter for filtering monthly gravity field solutions here the smoothing radius is determined based on the criteria of the maximum ratios of the latitude weighted root mean square rms over the land and ocean signals we only adopt the ocean points farther than 500 km from the coast for the reduction of the land signal leakage chen et al 2006 7 r m s r a t i o rms m a s s land e r r rms m a s s ocean e r r where massland and massocean respectively denote the signals over the lands and oceans err is the noise it should be noted that for the improved mssa gaussian smoothing approach the window size and reconstructed order need to be determined before calculating the rms ratios the window size normally being selected as an integer multiple of the period no more than one half the total length golyandina 2010 considering the time consuming and separability of different window sizes we finally select 60 months as the window size that has the strong separability of signal and noise then we analyze the grace grace fo monthly solutions using improved mssa without a gaussian smoothing filter same as wang et al 2019 we determine the reconstructed order by using the w correlation matrix the w correlations of the first 30 pcs are presented in fig 1 it is clear to see that the w correlation values are all relatively high for the pcs i j 1 2 which means these pcs cannot be well separated the corresponding periods of the first 12 pcs are shown in fig 2 it is obvious to find that pcs 1 4 5 mainly represent the long trend signal the pcs 2 3 and pcs 11 12 mainly denote the annual and semi annual components besides these three main component signals the rest of the first 12 pcs mainly stand for other long periodic signals schmidt et al 2008 therefore the reconstructed order is chosen as 12 different from wang et al 2020 mainly due to the longer time series to the best of our knowledge the leading modes pcs of geophysical signals are nearly the same for all grace available solutions even though adopting different gaussian smoothing radius therefore we will use the first 12 pcs to reconstruct geophysical signals to determine the optimal gaussian smoothing radius for improved mssa three case studies are carried out with gaussian smoothing whose radius range from zero km to 1500 km with a step of 100 km especially including 1 grace grace fo degree 60 improved mssa gaussian smoothed 2 grace grace fo degree 60 gaussian smoothed 3 swarm degree 40 gaussian smoothed the mean rms ratios of gaussian smoothing for three case studies are presented in fig 3 where all rms ratios of improved mssa gaussian smoothing approach are larger than those of gaussian smoothing for grace solutions the rms ratios of swarm solutions are the smallest among them the optimal smoothing radius with maximum rms ratios 6 50 4 61 and 1 87 are 400 km 500 km and 1000 km for three case studies respectively which resulted in a higher correlation between grace and swarm estimates which is confirmed with the results of da encarnação et al 2016 therefore we will bridge the gap between grace and grace fo missions using improved mssa 400 km gaussian smoothing with respect to swarm solutions 1000 km gaussian smoothing 4 2 fill the gap between grace and grace fo using improved mssa approach after the optimal gaussian smoothing radius is determined the gap between two grace missions will be bridged by improved mssa 400 km gaussian smoothing and compared with those from swarm solutions 1000 km gaussian smoothing the filled grace sh coefficients c30 and s31 by improved mssa and swarm solutions are presented in fig 4 from the figure we can find that the filled gaps using improved mssa agree with swarm solutions the correlation coefficients of the infilled gravity field models and those from swarm solutions are 0 62 and 0 67 for c30 and s31 respectively note that all evaluation indexes are calculated only with the infilled gravity field models of the gap and corresponding available swarm solutions to demonstrate the performance of improved mssa in bridging the gap between the two grace missions to better compare the filled sh coefficients using improved mssa with those from swarm solutions we further present all the correlation coefficients up to d o 40 same as the maximum degree of swarm solutions in fig 5 the filled grace sh coefficients using improved mssa is strongly correlated to the swarm solutions with the degree and order below 15 weak for the high degrees mainly due to the magnitude noise of swarm da encarnação et al 2016 suggested one can adopt up to d o 20 to suppress excessive noise and lück et al 2018 suggested truncated up to d o 10 or 15 here we simply truncated the filtered sh coefficients of grace grace fo and swarm solutions up to d o 20 and 40 respectively for better comparing the performance of improved mssa in bridging the gap between two grace missions at different degrees and orders 4 3 global mass change comparisons as mentioned in section 4 2 after the gravity field models between grace and grace fo are filled by improved mssa and filtered with 400 km gaussian smoothing the filtered sh coefficients of infilled models and swarm solutions are truncated to d o 20 40 and 60 respectively and transformed into 1 1 gridded maps of ewh the global ewhs may 2018 of infilled gravity field models and swarm solutions are shown in fig 6 for the sh coefficients truncated to d o 20 40 and 60 according to forootan et al 2020 swarm solutions can detect larger scale mass changes over some strong signal regions such as greenland amazon north america etc in fig 6 the global ewhs of the infilled gravity field models agree with those of swarm solutions when the sh coefficients are truncated to d o 40 and 20 however the global mass changes in the regions such as the congo river basin cannot match well with each other the mass change signals of swarm solution are not obvious over the congo river basin in fig 6 when the sh coefficients of the infilled gravity field models 11 months and swarm solutions are truncated to d o 20 and 40 the correspondent mean rms ratios are 3 83 1 55 and 4 37 1 55 respectively if the sh coefficients up to d o 60 are used for the infilled models the mean rms ratio is 4 30 with a slightly smaller rms ratio but higher spatial resolution compared to that truncated to d o 40 in general improved mssa can reliably fill the gap between the two grace missions 4 4 mass variation tests over sahara desert to the best of our knowledge the mass variations over desert areas are anticipated to be very small and mainly caused by more significant noise of the gravity models hence the smaller the mass change signals over desert areas are the better the gravity monthly solutions will be chen et al 2019 thus we test the filled gravity field models by improved mssa relative to swarm solutions over the sahara desert 15 n 35 n 0 e 35 e we compute the time series of latitude weighted mean ewhs over the sahara desert and present them in fig 7 when the sh coefficients are truncated to d o 20 and 40 for grace grace fo and swarm solutions as well as the infilled gravity field models the results in fig 7 show that grace grace fo solutions and the infilled models have less mass variation than swarm solutions whether the sh coefficients are truncated or not besides we further compute the rms of mass variation over the sahara desert with the infilled gravity field models and present them in table 2 where all the rmss of the infilled gravity field models are smaller than those of swarm solutions indicating that the infilled gravity field models by improved mssa are reliable 4 5 mass change signal comparison with the gldas noah model over three river basins besides validating the infilled gravity field models over desert areas hydrological models have been commonly used to evaluate the infilled models over the land areas famiglietti et al 2011 piretzidis et al 2015 li et al 2019 many studies were carried out to compare grace solutions with hydrological models such as the gldas model and wghm data and concluded that there exists a good agreement between them chen et al 2016 2019 therefore we use the gldas model to verify the filled gravity field models with improved mssa following chen et al 2016 the gldas noah model is adopted to compare and evaluate the infilled models over three river basins including lena high latitude fraser mid latitude and congo basin low latitude since the differences shown in section 4 4 are not obvious for the sh coefficients truncated to different degrees and orders we only compare grace grace fo degree 60 improved mssa 400 km gaussian smoothing and swarm degree 40 1000 km gaussian smoothing with the gldas noah model to avoid signal leakage the forward modeling approach is applied to the gravity field solutions chen et al 2015 the correlation coefficients and root mean squared error rmse of mass change differences are computed to evaluate the infilled models and swarm solutions relative to the gldas noah models over the three river basins since the gldas noah model does not include groundwater variations different from grace grace fo and swarm solutions and groundwater variations are generally small over the river basins we simply eliminate their effect by subtracting the corresponding mean value before acquiring the corresponding differences another problem is that there exist obvious time lags between the gravity field models and gldas models and different gravity field models of grace grace fo swarm may own different time lags resulting in failing to evaluate them accurately to rigorously evaluate the infilled gravity field models we correct the time lag problem by acquiring the maximum correlation coefficients of the gravity field models and gldas models knapp et al 1976 and then compute the corresponding rmse using the mass change difference between the infilled gravity field models and swarm solutions relative to gldas noah model the correlation coefficients and rmses of the filled models of all grid data by improved mssa and swarm relative to gldas noah models over three river basins are respectively presented in fig 8 and fig 9 where the correlation coefficients between the infilled gravity models and the gldas noah models are higher than those of the swarm solutions over three river basins the rmse of improved mssa over lena is obviously smaller than that over the other two basins because the quality of grace grace fo solutions at higher latitude region is higher than at lower latitude region therefore the fraser basin mid latitude area ranks second and the congo basin low latitude area ranks third in fig 9 besides the time series of latitude weighted regional mean mass changes are computed based on the region 1 o 1 o gridded ewhs and presented in fig 10 for the infilled gravity field models grace grace fo and swarm solutions over three river basins to show the results clearly we only present the corresponding series from december 2013 to march 2020 whose data are all available for grace grace fo including the infilled gap and swarm solution for the three river basins seasonal changes can be picked up from the filled gravity filed models using improved mssa and swarm solutions but with slight differences relative to the gldas noah model which may be due to the lack of groundwater variations in the gldas noah model though we have subtracted the corresponding mean value to reduce their effects we further compute the correlation coefficients and rmses by using differences of the time series of the infilled gravity field models and swarm solutions relative to the gldas noah model the corresponding statistics results for three river basins are presented in table 3 the correlation coefficients r are 0 84 0 98 and 0 96 for improved mssa over congo lena and fraser river basins respectively 0 78 0 72 and 0 86 for swarm solutions the results of lena river basin in table 3 are more significant to show the advantage of improved mssa in filling the gap being confirmed in fig 9 therefore we can conclude that both improved mssa and swarm solutions can bridge the gap between two grace missions efficiently and the filled gravity field models by improved mssa seems closer to those of gldas noah model over the three river basins 5 simulation experiment analysis the improved mssa has been compared with interpolation mssa and iteration mssa in filling the missing data via randomly deleting some months of data by wang et al 2020 and the results showed that improved mssa outperforms interpolation mssa and iteration mssa in filling the missing data to demonstrate the performance of improved mssa in filling the gaps as large as that between grace and grace fo we generate the gap by deleting 11 consecutive months 2006 08 2007 06 from csr rl06 monthly solutions 2002 04 2016 08 because we focus on validating the performance of improved mssa for filling the large gaps in this section degree one is not added back gia and signal leakage are not corrected the processing methods are the same as those in the real data analysis and the reconstructed order d is determined as 11 the signals derived from the csr solutions of the whole 156 months are as reference signals for evaluating improved mssa compared to iteration mssa interpolation mssa is not used for comparison because it works even worse than iteration mssa wang et al 2020 we present the reference signals of global mass changes in august 2006 and the differences relative to the reconstructed signals by improved mssa and iteration mssa in fig 11 which indicates that the differences of improved mssa are smaller than those of iteration mssa hence improved mssa can fill the gap more exact than iteration mssa to evaluate the quality of the infilled signals we calculate the latitude weighted root mean squared errors rmse by using the global mass change differences δvi of the reference signals minus the infilled signals derived by improved mssa and iteration mssa as follows wang et al 2020 8 rmse ω i ω δ v i 2 cos φ i i ω cos φ i where φi is the corresponding latitude ω represents a specific spatial range and can be global or regional e g oceans and all grids within ω are summed based on the latitude weights cos φi the latitude weighted rmses of improved mssa and iteration mssa for global and ocean regions are shown in fig 12 for 11 months of the generated gap all rmses derived by improved mssa are obviously smaller than those by iteration mssa the mean latitude weighted rmses of improved mssa are 2 28 and 1 12 cm for global and ocean regions respectively smaller than 2 56 and 1 18 cm of iteration mssa therefore we can conclude that improved mssa performs better than iteration mssa in filling the gap the time series of latitude weighted mean regional mass changes are computed based on 1 1 gridded ewhs the results are presented in fig 13 for the 4 regions of global oceans greenland amazon and india we further compute the rmses and relative errors by using of time series differences of the infilled gravity field models relative to the reference signals the rmses and relative errors of the 4 regions are shown in table 4 where the relative errors are 6 93 5 20 6 49 and 10 15 for the global oceans greenland amazon and india respectively indicating that the infilled signals by improved mssa are quite reliable in the 4 regions all statistics results show that improved mssa can bridge the large gap of 11 months better than iteration mssa note that the relative error δ is computed by the ratio of rms of difference and rms of the corresponding reference signals we further select 25 major river basins shown in fig 14 over the world and calculate the rmses and relative errors with the differences from august 2006 to june 2007 and summarize the statistics result in table 5 the relative errors of yukon mackenzie mississippi and colorado river basins are all smaller than 15 in table 5 for the regions with a strong signal such as amazon and tocantins south america euphrates asia zambezi africa etc the correspondent relative errors are less than 15 indicating that the filled gravity field models with improved mssa are quite reliable in the strong signal regions among all 25 river basins the relative errors of 5 basins are less than 10 16 basins less than 20 and 20 basins less than 30 the relative errors of 5 river basins exceed 30 which are parana south america congo africa brahmaputra ob and kolyma asia parana basin has the largest relative error 47 59 which is probably caused by signal leakage from amazon therefore improved mssa can be used to fill the gap between grace and grace fo efficiently and reliably overall 6 conclusions in this study the gap between two grace missions is bridged by improved mssa to acquire continual global mass change signals and results are compared with swarm monthly solutions the time series of 18 year 2002 04 2020 03 csr rl06 monthly gravity field solutions d o 60 and the combined monthly swarm solutions d o 40 are analyzed the infilled gravity field model in may 2018 agrees with swarm solution in the distribution of spatial signals indicating the reliability of the infilled gravity field models to some extent then we validate the infilled gravity field models and swarm solutions over the sahara desert and the results show that the infilled gravity field models have smaller mass change signals since mass variation over deserts is very small and mainly caused by the noise of the infilled models besides the correlation coefficients and rmses over lena fraser and congo river basins are computed by using the mass change differences of the infilled gravity field models and swarm solutions relative to gldas noah models to further assess their qualities the results show that the infilled gravity field models have higher correlation coefficients and smaller rmses than the swarm solutions over all the 3 river basins indicating that improved mssa can reliably fill the gap between the two grace missions the simulation experiment using the same gap as grace and grace fo shows that improved mssa can bridge the gap very efficiently and reliably in 25 major river basins over the world credit authorship contribution statement fengwei wang methodology investigation validation

4884,the gap between the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on mission grace fo is a crucial problem leading to discontinuous global mass change information from time variable gravity field solutions we aim to use the improved multichannel singular spectrum analysis mssa to fill the gap and reconstruct the continual global mass change signals in this study the one year gravity field gap is filled with improved mssa based on the release 06 rl06 monthly gravity field models provided by center for space research csr truncated to d o 60 and further compared with swarm monthly solutions d o 40 the results show that the infilled gravity field models agree with the swarm solutions indicating that improved mssa can reliably bridge the gap between grace and grace fo missions moreover relative to the global land data assimilation system gldas noah model the infilled gravity field models have higher correlation coefficients and smaller root mean squared errors than swarm solutions for the mass change signals over congo lena and fraser river basins according to the simulation results using the same gap as grace and grace fo improved mssa can fill the gap very efficiently and reliably in 25 major river basins over the world keywords grace grace fo swarm multichannel singular spectrum analysis data gap gldas 1 introduction the monthly gravity field models derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission tapley et al 2004 spanning march 2002 to october 2017 were commonly applied in many areas such as hydrology climatology marine science and geophysics for its high resolution and accuracy for example grace has provided new insights into the total water storage change twsc syed et al 2008 landerer and swenson 2012 guo et al 2018 hydrological mass variations abd elbaky and jin 2019 chen 2019 chandan and nagesh 2018 drought or flood detection yirdaw et al 2008 thomas et al 2014 forootan et al 2019 and global ocean mass change chen et al 2018a tamisiea 2011 cazenave 2018 the antarctic ice sheet mass changes chen et al 2009 gao et al 2015 tapley et al 2019 the glacial isostatic adjustment gia steffen et al 2008 etc however the grace mission operated from march 2002 to october 2017 and then the grace fo mission was launched in may 2018 therefore there exists about one year of missing data between the two grace missions li et al 2020 which leads to the inability to supply continuous geophysical information how to bridge the gap effectively is valuable to acquire continual grace geophysical signals many efforts were carried out to explore the potential of bridging the gap between the two grace missions with some alternative observations or approaches in general the gap filling methods can be classified into three aspects firstly satellite laser ranging slr or gps global positioning system observations to low earth orbiting satellites such as swarm can provide the temporal gravity solutions with a lower spatial resolution bezděk et al 2016 jäggi et al 2016 lück et al 2018 teixeira et al 2019 which provides an opportunity to bridge the gap forootan et al 2020 the potential to bridge the gap of the two grace missions with swarm was investigated by lück et al 2018 and forootan et al 2020 and successfully implemented by meyer et al 2019 secondly one can reconstruct the grace twsc by determining the relationships between twsc and corresponding climatic and hydrological variables specifically including rainfall temperature etc which is normally called data driven approaches humphry and gudmundsson 2019 hasan et al 2019 hasan and tarhule 2020 for example the artificial neural network ann was adopted to learn the relationship between twsc and related variables ahmed et al 2019 forootan et al 2014 first applied the independent component analysis ica forootan and kusche 2012 to separate the grace signals into their original sources then produced the reconstruction and derived the relations based on the autoregressive exogenous arx ljung 1987 li et al 2020 applied data driven methods for reconstructing and predicting grace like gridded twsc using climate inputs besides other approaches including the multiple linear regression mlr approach myers 1986 convolutional neural network cnn sun et al 2019 and principal component analysis pca wold 1987 were also used to extrapolate the grace time series of gridded twsc outside the grace period by constructing relationship models with indicators such as precipitation land surface temperature etc li et al 2020 besides the above approaches many interpolation methods such as linear interpolation zotov and shum 2010 zotov 2012 cubic spline interpolation guo et al 2018 and least squares fitting rangelova et al 2010 were used to interpolate missing data with neighboring data however the performance of filling gap with these interpolation approaches is basically dependent on the lengths of time series and gaps availability of neighboring data and so on semiromi and koch 2019 in contrast to the above methods a data adaptive method ssa mssa can better decompose the time series into a trend periodic components and noise and distinguish spatiotemporal patterns zotov and shum 2010 zotov 2012 three classified ssa based approaches have been proposed for filling the data gap the first approach is an iterative interpolation that first needs to fill the missing data with arbitrary numbers golyandina 2010 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 prevost et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the second one is an ssa based forecasting approach used for bridging the twsa gap of two grace missions li et al 2019 the third approach named improved ssa issa was first proposed in shen et al 2015 for stationary time series and performed the algorithm only with available observations it should be noted that all three ssa based approaches assumed that the reconstructed or forecasted component can be approximately represented by a time series with finite rank golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 the improved mssa wang et al 2020 which is the extension of issa shen et al 2015 has been successfully used to process the incomplete grace monthly solutions the improved mssa can fill the missing data especially for consecutive data gaps more exact than the other interpolation and iteration mssa approaches wang et al 2020 this will provide a new method to fill the large gap between the two grace missions accurately the missing months between grace and grace fo account for 14 35 of the total data from april 2002 to march 2020 to test whether improved mssa can effectively fill the large gap we will deeply investigate it in this study as we know that the grace gravity field solutions can be validated by comparing with some independent geophysical data for example the in situ data such as ocean bottom pressure and global navigation satellite systems gnss derived vertical loads chambers and willis 2010 chen et al 2018b and the hydrological models such as gldas noah and wghm data li et al 2020 etc however according to forootan et al 2020 the in situ data is more suited to evaluate the low degree spectral variations therefore we use the gldas noah models to demonstrate the performance of improved mssa and swarm solutions the rest of this paper is organized as follows the datasets used in this study are briefly described in section 2 we briefly introduced the improved mssa in section 3 the results of the filled gap using improved mssa are presented and compared with the swarm data in section 4 the simulation experiment is performed in section 5 for further evaluating the improved mssa and finally the conclusions are shown in section 6 2 datasets 2 1 grace and grace fo data many institutions provided different time variable monthly gravity field solutions due to adopting different processing strategies known as grace level 2 l2 products in this paper we mainly focus on bridging the gap between two grace missions using improved mssa and select the csr rl06 monthly gravity field models being truncated to d o 60 from april 2002 to march 2020 which can be directly downloaded by the website of the international centre for global earth models icgem http icgem gfz potsdam de home from april 2002 to march 2020 there exist 33 missing months data that are specifically presented in table 1 the swarm l2 monthly gravity field models for comparing the results of improved mssa are also presented in table 1 2 2 swarm l2 gravity field models the swarm monthly gravity field solutions were derived from the gps tracking data of three swarm satellites with a lower spatial resolution li et al 2020 encarnacao et al 2019 the specific details can be hand on the website of https earth esa int swarm here we adopt the combined monthly swarm l2 gravity field solutions being synthesized with four different swarm solutions by the astronomical institute czech academy of sciences asu more details about the combined swarm models can be hand in encarnacao et al 2019 data can be downloaded from the website of icgem http icgem gfz potsdam de home note that the swarm sh coefficients are up to d o 40 with the time span from december 2013 to march 2020 encarnacao et al 2019 2 3 gldas data hydrological models have been commonly used to validate the gravity field variation caused by the variations of soil moisture near surface air temperature accumulated snow and other hydrological components over the land regions following chen et al 2016 we adopt the gldas noah models with monthly time resolution and 1 1 spatial resolution which can be downloaded from https daac gsfc nasa gov datasets keywords noah the gldas noah model from april 2002 to march 2020 is adopted in this study and the corresponding used parameters can be hand in the website https daac gsfc nasa gov 3 methodology improved mssa can be directly used to process the incomplete grace monthly gravity field solutions without either data interpolation or iteration wang et al 2020 it has great potential for bridging the large consecutive gap of the two grace missions relative to other interpolation or iteration mssa approaches 3 1 improved mssa approach the improved mssa approach is briefly introduced in this section the details can be hand in wang et al 2020 the main differences of improved mssa with respect to traditional mssa mainly consist of two aspects constructing the lag covariance matrix c and calculating the principal component pc assume that there is a dataset with n time epochs and l data points spatial channels x l t t 1 2 n l 1 2 l the main procedure of improved mssa are described below 1 form a data trajectory matrix x the trajectory matrix of the channel l with m time lags vautard et al 1992 1 x l x l 1 x l 2 x l k x l 2 x l 3 x l k 1 x l m x l m 1 x l n where k n m 1 then a k l m trajectory matrix can be formed rangelova et al 2012 2 x x 1 x 2 x l t 2 construct the lag covariance matrix c for the complete time series one can perform either the singular value decomposition svd to the trajectory matrix x or eigendecomposition to the lag covariance matrix c xx t if the missing data exist in an incomplete time series one cannot directly perform the svd to x but can form the lag covariance matrix c only with the available data of the time series in improved mssa each element c i j of the lag covariance matrix c for the multivariate incomplete time series is computed by shen et al 2015 schoellhamer 2001 3 c i j 1 n ij l 1 l m 1 m x l i m 1 x l j m 1 where i j 1 2 k n ij is the number of available products of x l i m 1 and x l j m 1 within the sample set then the matrix c can be decomposed as c v λ v 1 λ is a diagonal matrix with k diagonal elements and v is the orthogonal matrix with the eigenvectors v k 3 calculate the principal component pc the second key difference for improved mssa is the way of calculating the pcs for incomplete time series xl t which can be written as wang et al 2019 2020 4 a l k i i j 1 s i x l i j 1 v j k i j 1 s i x l i j 1 v j k where 1 i m s i represents the available data index set and s i represents the data gap index set within the corresponding integer interval wang et al 2020 the gap can be bridged once the pcs are available the missing data in eq 4 is replaced with pcs below wang et al 2020 5 x l i j 1 n 1 k a l n i v j n then we can yield a rank deficient linear system of k equations to calculate the pcs by substituting eq 5 into 4 to solve the rank deficient equations the criterion is introduced by minimizing the weighted norm of the pcs with the weight matrix λ sorting in the same order as pcs for the details one can be referred to wang et al 2020 4 reconstruct the time series for all channels once the pcs a l k i k 1 2 k were determined the original time series x l t can be reconstructed with the calculated pcs and eigenvectors wang et al 2020 considering that the bigger singular values represent the components corresponding to signal and the smaller ones to noise guo et al 2018 we can reconstruct the original time series and bridge the gap with first d rcs for all channels 3 2 grace inversion approach the global equivalent water height ewh of mass changes are computed as wahr et al 1998 6 δ h φ λ a ρ ave 3 ρ w l 0 m 0 l p lm sin φ 2 l 1 1 k l δ c lm cos m λ δ s lm sin m λ where φ λ l and m are the latitude longitude degree and order respectively besides a and ρ ave correspond to the mean radius and density of the earth ρ w the density of water p lm sin φ the fully normalized associated legendre function kl the load love number δ c lm and δ s lm are the reconstructed spherical harmonic sh coefficients by improved mssa prevost et al 2019 wang et al 2020 4 bridging the gap between grace and grace fo missions using improved mssa to explore the potential of improved mssa for filling the gap between two grace missions the csr rl06 monthly gravity field models are analyzed from april 2002 to march 2020 with 33 months missing data the grace grace fo and swarm monthly sh coefficients are truncated to d o 60 and 40 respectively and are subtracted with the corresponding mean field bettadpur 2012 the background of the swarm solution is unified to grace and grace fo all the c20 coefficients of grace grace fo and swarm solutions are substituted with the slr estimates cheng et al 2013 in addition the c30 coefficients for grace fo are also substituted with slr estimates cheng et al 2013 and all degree one c10 c11 as well as s11 are added back from swenson et al 2008 4 1 determine gaussian smoothing radius of monthly gravity field solutions to the best of our knowledge the grace grace fo and swarm high degree sh coefficients were seriously polluted by noise requiring gaussian smoothing filtering with a certain radius to suppress the noise the gaussian smoothing radius is a key parameter for filtering monthly gravity field solutions here the smoothing radius is determined based on the criteria of the maximum ratios of the latitude weighted root mean square rms over the land and ocean signals we only adopt the ocean points farther than 500 km from the coast for the reduction of the land signal leakage chen et al 2006 7 r m s r a t i o rms m a s s land e r r rms m a s s ocean e r r where massland and massocean respectively denote the signals over the lands and oceans err is the noise it should be noted that for the improved mssa gaussian smoothing approach the window size and reconstructed order need to be determined before calculating the rms ratios the window size normally being selected as an integer multiple of the period no more than one half the total length golyandina 2010 considering the time consuming and separability of different window sizes we finally select 60 months as the window size that has the strong separability of signal and noise then we analyze the grace grace fo monthly solutions using improved mssa without a gaussian smoothing filter same as wang et al 2019 we determine the reconstructed order by using the w correlation matrix the w correlations of the first 30 pcs are presented in fig 1 it is clear to see that the w correlation values are all relatively high for the pcs i j 1 2 which means these pcs cannot be well separated the corresponding periods of the first 12 pcs are shown in fig 2 it is obvious to find that pcs 1 4 5 mainly represent the long trend signal the pcs 2 3 and pcs 11 12 mainly denote the annual and semi annual components besides these three main component signals the rest of the first 12 pcs mainly stand for other long periodic signals schmidt et al 2008 therefore the reconstructed order is chosen as 12 different from wang et al 2020 mainly due to the longer time series to the best of our knowledge the leading modes pcs of geophysical signals are nearly the same for all grace available solutions even though adopting different gaussian smoothing radius therefore we will use the first 12 pcs to reconstruct geophysical signals to determine the optimal gaussian smoothing radius for improved mssa three case studies are carried out with gaussian smoothing whose radius range from zero km to 1500 km with a step of 100 km especially including 1 grace grace fo degree 60 improved mssa gaussian smoothed 2 grace grace fo degree 60 gaussian smoothed 3 swarm degree 40 gaussian smoothed the mean rms ratios of gaussian smoothing for three case studies are presented in fig 3 where all rms ratios of improved mssa gaussian smoothing approach are larger than those of gaussian smoothing for grace solutions the rms ratios of swarm solutions are the smallest among them the optimal smoothing radius with maximum rms ratios 6 50 4 61 and 1 87 are 400 km 500 km and 1000 km for three case studies respectively which resulted in a higher correlation between grace and swarm estimates which is confirmed with the results of da encarnação et al 2016 therefore we will bridge the gap between grace and grace fo missions using improved mssa 400 km gaussian smoothing with respect to swarm solutions 1000 km gaussian smoothing 4 2 fill the gap between grace and grace fo using improved mssa approach after the optimal gaussian smoothing radius is determined the gap between two grace missions will be bridged by improved mssa 400 km gaussian smoothing and compared with those from swarm solutions 1000 km gaussian smoothing the filled grace sh coefficients c30 and s31 by improved mssa and swarm solutions are presented in fig 4 from the figure we can find that the filled gaps using improved mssa agree with swarm solutions the correlation coefficients of the infilled gravity field models and those from swarm solutions are 0 62 and 0 67 for c30 and s31 respectively note that all evaluation indexes are calculated only with the infilled gravity field models of the gap and corresponding available swarm solutions to demonstrate the performance of improved mssa in bridging the gap between the two grace missions to better compare the filled sh coefficients using improved mssa with those from swarm solutions we further present all the correlation coefficients up to d o 40 same as the maximum degree of swarm solutions in fig 5 the filled grace sh coefficients using improved mssa is strongly correlated to the swarm solutions with the degree and order below 15 weak for the high degrees mainly due to the magnitude noise of swarm da encarnação et al 2016 suggested one can adopt up to d o 20 to suppress excessive noise and lück et al 2018 suggested truncated up to d o 10 or 15 here we simply truncated the filtered sh coefficients of grace grace fo and swarm solutions up to d o 20 and 40 respectively for better comparing the performance of improved mssa in bridging the gap between two grace missions at different degrees and orders 4 3 global mass change comparisons as mentioned in section 4 2 after the gravity field models between grace and grace fo are filled by improved mssa and filtered with 400 km gaussian smoothing the filtered sh coefficients of infilled models and swarm solutions are truncated to d o 20 40 and 60 respectively and transformed into 1 1 gridded maps of ewh the global ewhs may 2018 of infilled gravity field models and swarm solutions are shown in fig 6 for the sh coefficients truncated to d o 20 40 and 60 according to forootan et al 2020 swarm solutions can detect larger scale mass changes over some strong signal regions such as greenland amazon north america etc in fig 6 the global ewhs of the infilled gravity field models agree with those of swarm solutions when the sh coefficients are truncated to d o 40 and 20 however the global mass changes in the regions such as the congo river basin cannot match well with each other the mass change signals of swarm solution are not obvious over the congo river basin in fig 6 when the sh coefficients of the infilled gravity field models 11 months and swarm solutions are truncated to d o 20 and 40 the correspondent mean rms ratios are 3 83 1 55 and 4 37 1 55 respectively if the sh coefficients up to d o 60 are used for the infilled models the mean rms ratio is 4 30 with a slightly smaller rms ratio but higher spatial resolution compared to that truncated to d o 40 in general improved mssa can reliably fill the gap between the two grace missions 4 4 mass variation tests over sahara desert to the best of our knowledge the mass variations over desert areas are anticipated to be very small and mainly caused by more significant noise of the gravity models hence the smaller the mass change signals over desert areas are the better the gravity monthly solutions will be chen et al 2019 thus we test the filled gravity field models by improved mssa relative to swarm solutions over the sahara desert 15 n 35 n 0 e 35 e we compute the time series of latitude weighted mean ewhs over the sahara desert and present them in fig 7 when the sh coefficients are truncated to d o 20 and 40 for grace grace fo and swarm solutions as well as the infilled gravity field models the results in fig 7 show that grace grace fo solutions and the infilled models have less mass variation than swarm solutions whether the sh coefficients are truncated or not besides we further compute the rms of mass variation over the sahara desert with the infilled gravity field models and present them in table 2 where all the rmss of the infilled gravity field models are smaller than those of swarm solutions indicating that the infilled gravity field models by improved mssa are reliable 4 5 mass change signal comparison with the gldas noah model over three river basins besides validating the infilled gravity field models over desert areas hydrological models have been commonly used to evaluate the infilled models over the land areas famiglietti et al 2011 piretzidis et al 2015 li et al 2019 many studies were carried out to compare grace solutions with hydrological models such as the gldas model and wghm data and concluded that there exists a good agreement between them chen et al 2016 2019 therefore we use the gldas model to verify the filled gravity field models with improved mssa following chen et al 2016 the gldas noah model is adopted to compare and evaluate the infilled models over three river basins including lena high latitude fraser mid latitude and congo basin low latitude since the differences shown in section 4 4 are not obvious for the sh coefficients truncated to different degrees and orders we only compare grace grace fo degree 60 improved mssa 400 km gaussian smoothing and swarm degree 40 1000 km gaussian smoothing with the gldas noah model to avoid signal leakage the forward modeling approach is applied to the gravity field solutions chen et al 2015 the correlation coefficients and root mean squared error rmse of mass change differences are computed to evaluate the infilled models and swarm solutions relative to the gldas noah models over the three river basins since the gldas noah model does not include groundwater variations different from grace grace fo and swarm solutions and groundwater variations are generally small over the river basins we simply eliminate their effect by subtracting the corresponding mean value before acquiring the corresponding differences another problem is that there exist obvious time lags between the gravity field models and gldas models and different gravity field models of grace grace fo swarm may own different time lags resulting in failing to evaluate them accurately to rigorously evaluate the infilled gravity field models we correct the time lag problem by acquiring the maximum correlation coefficients of the gravity field models and gldas models knapp et al 1976 and then compute the corresponding rmse using the mass change difference between the infilled gravity field models and swarm solutions relative to gldas noah model the correlation coefficients and rmses of the filled models of all grid data by improved mssa and swarm relative to gldas noah models over three river basins are respectively presented in fig 8 and fig 9 where the correlation coefficients between the infilled gravity models and the gldas noah models are higher than those of the swarm solutions over three river basins the rmse of improved mssa over lena is obviously smaller than that over the other two basins because the quality of grace grace fo solutions at higher latitude region is higher than at lower latitude region therefore the fraser basin mid latitude area ranks second and the congo basin low latitude area ranks third in fig 9 besides the time series of latitude weighted regional mean mass changes are computed based on the region 1 o 1 o gridded ewhs and presented in fig 10 for the infilled gravity field models grace grace fo and swarm solutions over three river basins to show the results clearly we only present the corresponding series from december 2013 to march 2020 whose data are all available for grace grace fo including the infilled gap and swarm solution for the three river basins seasonal changes can be picked up from the filled gravity filed models using improved mssa and swarm solutions but with slight differences relative to the gldas noah model which may be due to the lack of groundwater variations in the gldas noah model though we have subtracted the corresponding mean value to reduce their effects we further compute the correlation coefficients and rmses by using differences of the time series of the infilled gravity field models and swarm solutions relative to the gldas noah model the corresponding statistics results for three river basins are presented in table 3 the correlation coefficients r are 0 84 0 98 and 0 96 for improved mssa over congo lena and fraser river basins respectively 0 78 0 72 and 0 86 for swarm solutions the results of lena river basin in table 3 are more significant to show the advantage of improved mssa in filling the gap being confirmed in fig 9 therefore we can conclude that both improved mssa and swarm solutions can bridge the gap between two grace missions efficiently and the filled gravity field models by improved mssa seems closer to those of gldas noah model over the three river basins 5 simulation experiment analysis the improved mssa has been compared with interpolation mssa and iteration mssa in filling the missing data via randomly deleting some months of data by wang et al 2020 and the results showed that improved mssa outperforms interpolation mssa and iteration mssa in filling the missing data to demonstrate the performance of improved mssa in filling the gaps as large as that between grace and grace fo we generate the gap by deleting 11 consecutive months 2006 08 2007 06 from csr rl06 monthly solutions 2002 04 2016 08 because we focus on validating the performance of improved mssa for filling the large gaps in this section degree one is not added back gia and signal leakage are not corrected the processing methods are the same as those in the real data analysis and the reconstructed order d is determined as 11 the signals derived from the csr solutions of the whole 156 months are as reference signals for evaluating improved mssa compared to iteration mssa interpolation mssa is not used for comparison because it works even worse than iteration mssa wang et al 2020 we present the reference signals of global mass changes in august 2006 and the differences relative to the reconstructed signals by improved mssa and iteration mssa in fig 11 which indicates that the differences of improved mssa are smaller than those of iteration mssa hence improved mssa can fill the gap more exact than iteration mssa to evaluate the quality of the infilled signals we calculate the latitude weighted root mean squared errors rmse by using the global mass change differences δvi of the reference signals minus the infilled signals derived by improved mssa and iteration mssa as follows wang et al 2020 8 rmse ω i ω δ v i 2 cos φ i i ω cos φ i where φi is the corresponding latitude ω represents a specific spatial range and can be global or regional e g oceans and all grids within ω are summed based on the latitude weights cos φi the latitude weighted rmses of improved mssa and iteration mssa for global and ocean regions are shown in fig 12 for 11 months of the generated gap all rmses derived by improved mssa are obviously smaller than those by iteration mssa the mean latitude weighted rmses of improved mssa are 2 28 and 1 12 cm for global and ocean regions respectively smaller than 2 56 and 1 18 cm of iteration mssa therefore we can conclude that improved mssa performs better than iteration mssa in filling the gap the time series of latitude weighted mean regional mass changes are computed based on 1 1 gridded ewhs the results are presented in fig 13 for the 4 regions of global oceans greenland amazon and india we further compute the rmses and relative errors by using of time series differences of the infilled gravity field models relative to the reference signals the rmses and relative errors of the 4 regions are shown in table 4 where the relative errors are 6 93 5 20 6 49 and 10 15 for the global oceans greenland amazon and india respectively indicating that the infilled signals by improved mssa are quite reliable in the 4 regions all statistics results show that improved mssa can bridge the large gap of 11 months better than iteration mssa note that the relative error δ is computed by the ratio of rms of difference and rms of the corresponding reference signals we further select 25 major river basins shown in fig 14 over the world and calculate the rmses and relative errors with the differences from august 2006 to june 2007 and summarize the statistics result in table 5 the relative errors of yukon mackenzie mississippi and colorado river basins are all smaller than 15 in table 5 for the regions with a strong signal such as amazon and tocantins south america euphrates asia zambezi africa etc the correspondent relative errors are less than 15 indicating that the filled gravity field models with improved mssa are quite reliable in the strong signal regions among all 25 river basins the relative errors of 5 basins are less than 10 16 basins less than 20 and 20 basins less than 30 the relative errors of 5 river basins exceed 30 which are parana south america congo africa brahmaputra ob and kolyma asia parana basin has the largest relative error 47 59 which is probably caused by signal leakage from amazon therefore improved mssa can be used to fill the gap between grace and grace fo efficiently and reliably overall 6 conclusions in this study the gap between two grace missions is bridged by improved mssa to acquire continual global mass change signals and results are compared with swarm monthly solutions the time series of 18 year 2002 04 2020 03 csr rl06 monthly gravity field solutions d o 60 and the combined monthly swarm solutions d o 40 are analyzed the infilled gravity field model in may 2018 agrees with swarm solution in the distribution of spatial signals indicating the reliability of the infilled gravity field models to some extent then we validate the infilled gravity field models and swarm solutions over the sahara desert and the results show that the infilled gravity field models have smaller mass change signals since mass variation over deserts is very small and mainly caused by the noise of the infilled models besides the correlation coefficients and rmses over lena fraser and congo river basins are computed by using the mass change differences of the infilled gravity field models and swarm solutions relative to gldas noah models to further assess their qualities the results show that the infilled gravity field models have higher correlation coefficients and smaller rmses than the swarm solutions over all the 3 river basins indicating that improved mssa can reliably fill the gap between the two grace missions the simulation experiment using the same gap as grace and grace fo shows that improved mssa can bridge the gap very efficiently and reliably in 25 major river basins over the world credit authorship contribution statement fengwei wang methodology investigation validation
