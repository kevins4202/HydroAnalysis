21160,to give an effective response to the increasing demand to characterise wind availability and intensity for the installation of future offshore wind farms spar buoy owcs with lidar present a clear benefit due to their stability mechanical and operational simplicity and lower cost when compared to wind measuring towers serving as an alternative to the latter mainly for deep water this paper proposes a compromise between a stable spar buoy for wind measurements average speed gusts etc and a sufficiently capable energy generating owc device for long term self sustainability key parameters such as mass distribution and geometry were accounted for in order to achieve both outcomes the performance of an oceanic spar buoy owc was analysed numerically and experimentally tested at 1 16 scale under regular and irregular sea states in order to quantify its hydrodynamic behaviour and capability to generate electrical energy using two different pto configurations depending on the sea states different pto configurations result in better performance for higher significant wave heights the 39 porosity membrane used as a pto performed better from a power perspective whereas for lower significant wave height the 70 porosity membrane presented better results low energy consumption wind measuring equipment may benefit from this application index terms spar buoy floating oscillating water column boundary element method floating lidar model testing wave energy 1 introduction the main reason for the occurrence of winds is related to the irregular distribution of solar radiation the interaction between winds and the free surface of the ocean is one of the main actors in ocean wave generation cruz e and sarmento 2004 ocean waves are a renewable source of energy and provide a higher energy density when compared to other renewable sources clément et al 2002 thus triggering a considerable amount of research throughout the years the offshore wind power industry is experiencing rapid growth globally and consequently the demand for wind resource characterisation to assess the feasibility of future wind farms has been increasing this characterisation can be performed with more traditional equipment to measure just the wind velocity e g an anemometer or with a more modern one where the whole wind profile is assessed e g lidar the anemometer is one of the most common equipment to measure the wind speed while different types are available anemometers only measure the wind passing at a specific height mckeogh 2011 more recent equipment such as lidar s light detection and ranging sodars sonic detection and ranging and radar radio detection and ranging are able to perform remote measurements with good accuracy for different locations at the same time these are based on the doppler effect the physical phenomenon that relates the wave frequency emissions of a moving body with a stationary observer the difference relies on the type of emitting waves e g the waves used by a lidar are electromagnetic mckeogh 2011 adding the necessity of a broader characterisation of the wind to the fact that there are higher turbines hence higher masts for the usual anemometer lidars are a good alternative shu et al 2016 nonetheless the need for lidars to be in a stable position without significant vibration poses a challenge when performing offshore wind measurements in fact long term monitoring of the oceans allows for the acquisition of more reliable data regarding several parameters such as wind average speeds and gusts to keep costs low and to be in line with the expected eu increase in productivity to 1 billion per year european economic social committee 2014 non manned cost effective solutions are key this topic has driven researchers to analyse the possibility of using self sufficient solutions to reduce costs and risks renewable energy harvesters in opposition to batteries which have to be replaced regularly have been one of the key parameters used to address this problem yielding mixed results studies relating to wind and solar energy harvesters løken et al 2016 have generated good results in terms of harvesting though failing to meet the energy demand more recent studies implemented the use of state of the art triboelectric nano generators teng with improved results though still in a very early stage of development with a low technology readiness level trl chandrasekhar et al 2020 finally wave energy converters have been successfully applied for oceanographic sensing systems in buoys allowing for the power generation to be sufficient for the sensing system henriques et al 2016 the study presented in this paper focused on the inclusion of a lidar for wind characterisation on a spar buoy typically known for their stable behaviour equipped with a wave energy converter wec for power supply the aim is to achieve a compromise between reduced resonance motion of the spar buoy and sufficient energy generation stability is achieved whenever low responses are obtained response amplitudes close or below 1 are desired for minimal movement the oscillating water column owc emerges as one of the most studied operational principles for wave energy harvesting the first device based on the owc principle was initially named masuda device honouring its inventor yoshio masuda who started exploring the concept of a navigational buoy powered by wave energy in the late 1940s heath 1959 in general an owc device consists of a partly submerged structure that encloses a volume of air between the free surface and its top fig 1 as well as an opening to the ocean heath 1959 falcão 2010 this particularity allows the free surface inside the structure to vary its position due to the action of waves thus causing the variation of pressure and volume inside the pneumatic chamber falcão e and henriques 2016 the effects of compression and decompression inside the chamber forces the air to flow in or out through a turbine coupled to an electrical generator installed at the top of the device falcão 2010 falcão e and henriques 2016 to accommodate the oscillatory characteristics of the airflow turbines usually require rectifying valves for air guidance in order to maintain the turbine rotating in the same direction independently of the flow orientation falcão e and henriques 2016 in the mid 1970s alan arthur wells invented a self rectifying turbine also called the axial flow wells turbine with a design that eliminated the need for rectifying valves thus providing a more cost effective and robust solution falcão 2010 takao e and setoguchi 2012 recent developments were made in radial flow self rectifying impulse turbines more specifically in bi radial turbines these have shown good efficiency over a wide range of flow rates due to the aerodynamic performance however these turbines add considerable mechanical complexity falcão 2010 falcão e and henriques 2016 falcão and nunes 2012 owc devices are more advantageous when compared to other wave energy converters wecs due to their mechanical simplicity and because all the sensible parts of the power take off system are not in direct contact with the seawater single point anchor reservoirs spars are a widely studied type of floating structure due to their high stability geometrically these structures are typically considered slender bodies owing to their reduced sectional area at the waterline and significant draught commonly the body is axisymmetric allowing for an equal performance independent of wave direction with its mass mainly concentrated on the bottom this set of characteristics provide spars with high stability and low response amplitude to the excitation of the waves the use of floating platforms in place of research towers to monitor the wind resource has been attracting the scientific community the simplicity and stability of spar structures make them strong candidates to compete directly with measuring towers in addition their long term deployment capability in deep waters as well as easy transport and low maintenance costs make spars an appealing solution when considering either fixed or floating structures a clear challenge is how to power the monitoring equipment in line with this an owc spar buoy is presented in this study as an alternative to address the need for a self sustained wind resource monitoring solution an axisymmetric spar buoy with reduced diameter was studied aiming to decrease the amplitude of its response to incident waves and thus minimize the influence of its movements in the quality of the measurements inside the chamber region of the spar buoy high response amplitudes mainly in the heave motion were desired such that energy to supply the monitoring equipment on board could be harnessed through the owc principle due to its simplicity the owc principle has been widely studied sheng et al 2014a where besides the technical advances in experimental testing numerical methods were employed for better physical representation among these a prevalent method is the boundary element method bem with the use of ansys aqwa gaebele et al 2020 gao e and yu 2018 cruz e and sarmento 2004 clément et al 2002 due to the good compromise between accuracy and computational cost this method represents the water portion as a fixed body and has been providing reasonable results as such this method can be applied to different wec devices such as point absorbers gao e and yu 2018 and floating wind turbines chen et al 2019 owc spar buoy dimensioning and testing has been scarce numerical dynamic and parametric optimization of an owc spar buoy geometry has been studied as well as the corresponding optimized air turbine falcão et al 2012 falcão et al 2014 nonetheless the long term deployment of a spar buoy for wind measuring purposes requiring low response amplitude operators rao for stability of the measurements with a self sustainable energy system requiring high response amplitude operators rao for energy generation has not been conducted yet in this paper the numerical study of the owc spar buoy is carried out using a bem approach and validated with experimental results from physical model tests the scaled model of the spar buoy was tested for selected regular and irregular sea states defined based on typical values offshore the portuguese west coast the data collected allowed for the quantification of the pressure variation inside the pneumatic chamber as well as for the measurements of airflow rate and the internal water displacement these variables were used to estimate the power generation capacity the tests allowed for the characterisation of the hydrodynamic behaviour of the body to simulate the power take off pto porous membranes were used to replicate the behaviour of the air turbine the air turbine has linear characteristics since the generated power is linear proportional on the airflow and averaged pressure similar to a wells turbine 2 typical lidar application for offshore wind the lidar device emits a range of light beams between the infrared and ultraviolet regions in the electromagnetic spectrum these beams will target natural aerosols e g dust pollen or rain droplets the beam will return to the lidar at a different frequency and from the difference between the original beam and returning beam wind velocity and direction are calculated to characterise accurately the wind resource the beams from the lidar device are issued in a conical profile hence its ability in characterising the resource in multiple places in a radius defined by this profile this profile can be emitted in two different ways pulsed or continuous wave having the latter a broader range with these specifics a lidar equipment is a reasonable choice for wind characterisation in remote sites such as in an offshore location furthermore this equipment is considerably cheaper than its counterpart anemometer since there is no need for auxiliary constructions the measurement equipment in this case the lidar requires a support structure for correct functioning depending on the need there are several solutions for a wide range of prices and power consumption the use of meteorological masts for offshore applications has proven to require high installation costs whereas the inclusion of lidar equipment in buoys has a considerably lower price some up to 2 of the installation costs of a mast dodd 2018 still power consumptions of lidar equipment vary considerably table 1 3 theoretical background the equations of motion in a hydrodynamic problem result from the equilibrium between the external forces related to the existing hydrodynamic forces whenever a body is partially or fully submerged and the inertial forces due to the mass distributions the hydrodynamic forces can be obtained by integrating the pressure over the wetted surface of a body since the potential flow theory is applied the fluid surrounding the body is considered to be incompressible ρ t 0 in the navier stokes equation inviscid τ 0 rotation free v x u y 0 in the x y plane w y v z 0 in the y z plane and u z w x 0 in the x z plane while satisfying the laplace equation in all its domain 2 φ 0 where φ is the potential function associated with a potential flow field the division amongst the forces existing in the motion equation is based on a superposition principle that separates the hydrodynamic loads and the wave and diffraction loads taking into account the body bound inertial forces as well as such and analysing the dynamic pressures present in the generalized bernoulli equation the hydrodynamic problem is divided into two separate components 1 the wave and diffracting loads related to the pressure field resulting from the presence of the undisturbed wave also known as froude krylov forces and from the presence of the body in the water that has to be worked around also known as diffraction forces 2 the hydrodynamic loads related to the advance or movement of the body at a certain reduced speed while being forced to oscillate so its general form is expressed by equation 1 1 f i f r f h f e where f e f f k f d exciting forces froude krylov and diffraction forces f r radiation forces f h hydrostatic forces f i inertial forces for the heave motion as an example the equation of motion can be rewritten as shown in equation 2 2 m a z b z c z f e where m mass of the body kg a hydrodynamic added mass kg b hydrodynamic damping coefficient n s m c spring coefficient n m there are two types of approaches for solving the hydrodynamic problem 2d potential theory and 3d potential theory in this case the boundary element method bem or 3d panel method which is based on 3d potential theory was applied which uses green s second theorem to transform a three dimensional equation into a surface integral the integral equation represents a distribution of sources or sinks and dipoles on the wetted surface to solve the problem numerically the surface is divided into a number of panels so that the sources and dipoles strengths and the fluid pressure is constant over each element this method allows for the reduction of the problem from a three dimensional volume problem into a two dimensional surface problem so for n panels instead of n 3 equations it has to solve n 2 equations 3 1 frequency domain the harmonic response of floating bodies when subjected to regular waves can be obtained by dividing each equation of motion into an equation in phase cos ε z ζ and out of phase sin ε z ζ in turn derived from the complex motion amplitude for instance z ˆ a for the heave motion as shown in equation 3 and by the wave amplitude ζ a the presence of phase angles ε relates to the undisturbed wave at the origin of the steadily translating body bound axis system an example for the heave motion z is shown in equation 4 3 z ˆ z a e i ε z ζ 4 z a ζ a cos ε z ζ a n d z a ζ a sin ε z ζ therefore the frequency characteristics are presented using the transfer functions or response amplitude operators raos z a ζ a in the case of the heave motion the transfer functions present a ratio of the amplitude of a given motion in equation 3 the heave motion is presented and the wave amplitude in addition the phase angles are presented typically for an incoming wave similarly the response spectra can be obtained for irregular waves as for the regular waves 3 2 ansys aqwa ansys aqwa is a commercial software that applies the 3d panel method or bem with some particularities that must be met as follows 1 the reference frame is a fixed frame fra which translates in the x and y directions when speed is present like the o x y z 2 potential flow is applied for both frequency and time domains 3 small steepness waves ansys aqwa allows for the calculation of the raos for the 6 degrees of freedom as well as other hydrodynamic properties such as added mass radiation damping and pressure inside the chamber 4 conceptual and experimental models the conceptual model was modelled in cad and scaled to 1 16 for laboratory purposes fig 2 the spar buoy consists of two tubular shapes with different cross sections for the experimental setup the tubular shapes were manufactured from two acrylic tubes each one with different cross sections the tube with smaller cross section was partially placed inside the bottom of the larger one and bounded through two revolution parts in this way a watertight chamber was created to increase the buoyancy of the spar buoy inside the tubes the waterline oscillates on the top side of the larger one causing an oscillation of pressure and a reversible air flux from the pneumatic chamber immediately above the water line a ring plate with a central hole closed the top of the larger tube additionally three acrylic discs i e heave plates were placed at the bottom of the model these plates can add damping and added mass that will modify the hydrodynamic response of the spar buoy tao e and dray 2008 this modification will allow to delay and dampen the response to wave excitations improving the response for the energy production and the necessary stability for the measuring equipment in the lower part of the model a single steel disc was added to increase stability and damping moreover the model was designed to have the centre of gravity close to the centre of buoyancy in order to decrease the pitch amplitudes this becomes clear by analysing the pitch restoring coefficient the same could be applied for roll since the pitch restoring coefficient c θ θ is given by equation 5 5 c θ θ ρ g g m l where ρ sea water density kg m 3 g gravitational acceleration m s 2 displaced volume m3 g m l longitudinal initial metacentric height m and the longitudinal initial metacentric height by equation 6 6 g m l b m l k b k g where b m l longitudinal metacentric arm m k b centre of buoyancy m k g centre of gravity m whenever the distance between k b and k g is reduced so is the restoring coefficient and the resonance frequency this allows the frequency to be lower than the average frequencies verified at sea allowing the pitch amplitude to be reduced and stability achieved the same principle can be applied for the heave motion with the introduction of heave plates to reduce the distance between the centre of gravity and the centre of buoyancy by iterating the number of discs the distance is kept at a minimum and the resulting number of discs was obtained 3 in this case the chamber was dimensioned in such a way as to create a venturi effect thus increasing energy generating capabilities for the experimental tests two different types of porous material covered the hole in order to replicate the losses of linear air turbines since linear turbines such as the wells turbine have a pressure drop approximately proportional to the flow rate a porous material will reproduce the same effect shehata et al 2017 the mass flow rate of air through a turbine is expressed by equation 7 sarmento 1992 7 m d ρ a v d t d ρ a d t v d v d t ρ a where ρ a air density v volume of air inside the chamber the time dependent volume of air can be expressed by equation 8 8 v t v 0 z 1 t z 2 t s c the time dependent density of air can be modelled as an ideal gas and the air compression inside the chamber as an isentropic process lee et al 1996 given by equation 9 9 d ρ a d t 1 c 2 d p d t the speed of sound and air density are assumed to be constant and equal to the values under atmospheric conditions whereas the second term is related to the spring effect of the air compressibility sheng et al 2014b in fact the effect of air compressibility on owc performance increases with the increase in the average chamber height volume of air divided by the internal free surface which is not the present case since the volume of air inside the chamber is small moreover the height variations will not greatly affect the overall term thus they are negligible thus the mass flow rate can be expressed by equation 10 sarmento 1992 10 m ρ a q v 0 c 2 d p d t the physical parameters of the model were initially estimated using the cad model and validated experimentally table 2 the centres of gravity and buoyancy were measured from the waterline 5 equipment 5 1 the wave tank the experimental tests of the spar buoy owc were performed at the wave tank of the hydraulics water resources and environment section shrha of the department of civil engineering dec of the faculty of engineering of the university of porto feup fig 3 the wave tank is 28 m long 12 m wide and a maximum depth of 1 2 m the experimental tests were performed at a depth of 0 85 m on the opposite end of the wave generating system a dissipative beach for wave absorption and control of wave reflection was placed during the experimental tests the beach had a slope of 6 m with a 20 incline 5 2 pto the pto was modelled using two porous membranes 39 and 70 called respectively m1 and m2 hereinafter based on the work of sarpkaya e and isaacson 1981 fig 4 the porous membranes emulate the effects of a linear turbine such as the wells turbine which is characterised by a linear relationship between the airflow rate q and the pressure drop p sarpkaya e and isaacson 1981 5 3 sensors to determine the instantaneous generated power p of the experimental pto both airflow rate q and pressure drop p were measured so that p w p q the airflow rate was gathered through wave probes from hr wallingford on the spar buoy while the pressure drop was measured using a differential piezo resistive pressure sensor range of 250 pa fig 5 different equipment was used in order to determine the amplitudes of movements velocities and accelerations of the experimental spar buoy all the experiments were recorded using a gopro 2 and the videos were processed using the image analysis software kinovea which allows quantifying the displacements velocities and accelerations all sensors were connected to a data acquisition system from national instruments configured with a sampling rate of 100 hz 6 numerical model 6 1 bem analysis the spar buoy owc was analysed in ansys aqwa in order to determine its hydrodynamic properties namely its resonance frequency the response amplitudes under regular waves and the corresponding pressures inside the chamber as well as added mass and radiation damping coefficients this assessment took into account the full scale spar buoy to model the behaviour of the water inside the chamber two approaches were used namely a massless disk herein after referred to as piston frigaard e and brorsen 1993 and the water disk just below the waterline hasselmann et al 1973 both these modelling techniques are virtual emulations of the behaviour of the water column inside the chamber and not structural components of the spar buoy a mesh was generated table 3 and refined in order to accurately assess the vertical response and pressures fig 6 the mesh was considered appropriate when the minimum orthogonal quality is greater than 0 15 meaning non dimensional and the maximum skewness is lower than 0 85 which is verified in this case moreover since the movement of water inside the chamber is limited in the radial direction the movement of the piston was limited to the heave motion regarding the application of mooring a floating system comprises a non linear effect thus requiring a time domain analysis by determining the forces applied to the spar buoy in this case for a 14 m depth a mooring line was selected by determining the maximum breaking strength and comparing it to the maximum tension applied to the mooring line as such a synthetic fibre hmpe high modulus polyethylene cable was chosen in a catenary configuration with a prototype scale length of 40 m table 4 to apply this non linear effect in the frequency domain an additional connection stiffness has to be added to the model to represent the presence of the mooring line influencing the motion of the spar buoy the connection to the spar buoy was placed close to the centre of gravity so that the movement of the spar buoy was reduced in the heave motion 6 2 hydrodynamic assessment for the hydrodynamic assessment of the spar buoy the hydrodynamic added mass and damping coefficients are the two key parameters to be determined since ansys aqwa does not account for viscous effects if determined correctly the response of the amplitude of the numerical model should be in line with the motion response of the experimental model the lab performed free decay tests allowed for the validation of the damping coefficient of the spar buoy but not for the virtual piston as such the massless and virtual water disc damping coefficients need to be determined separately in fact this approach has been widely used in the literature to assess pto performance frigaard e and brorsen 1993 hasselmann et al 1973 for the damping analysis as a preliminary approach the equation provided by sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 costa and vitorino was applied to determine the damping coefficient by equations 11 13 11 k c 2 π ζ a d 12 β d 2 f ν 13 b 1 3 μ β d c d k c where k c keulegan carpenter number ζ a wave amplitude m d disc diameter m β frequency parameter f frequency s 1 ν kinematic viscosity of the fluid m2 s 1 μ dynamic viscosity of the fluid pa s b damping coefficient kg s 1 the results using this approach were compared to experimental results since both the spar buoy and piston are of circular shape as an initial approach the damping coefficients for spar buoy and piston were estimated using equation 10 being this equation usually used for offshore structures costa and vitorino the present geometry can be considered for this equation as well the non dimensional damping coefficient of both the spar buoy and piston was obtained with the resultant mass and averaged resonance period resulting in 0 62 and 558 respectively due to their different resonance peak periods and drag coefficients the latter being in accordance with the literature hasselmann et al 1973 the coefficient of the piston is 900 times larger than the coefficient of the spar buoy in fact the resonance peak of the spar buoy is located at 7 5 s while the resonance peak of the piston is closer to 4 37 s as such the initial rao responses for the buoy presents a maximum peak of 3 m m at 7 5 s and the piston of 0 81 m m at 4 37 s for both the massless piston and water disc fig 7 and fig 8 the obtained added mass of the spar buoy has a maximum value of 35 kg for a period of 11 5 s and stabilizes onwards when comparing the results of the massless and water disc pistons it is clear that both approaches behave in similar ways in the literature sheng et al 2014a the water disc piston has presented overall more reliable results thus this approach was applied henceforth 7 experimental procedure the outlined experimental procedure enabled 1 the validation of the numerical model and 2 monitoring of the electrical energy generating capacity to be able to feed the lidar device the mooring line was attached to a point to the side of the spar buoy fig 5 close to the centre of gravity with its scaled properties maintaining the same material table 5 for the validation free decay trials and incident reflected wave separation measurements were performed for the free decay experiments a triaxial accelerometer was used allowing for the experimental determination of the natural frequency in the heave motion as well as the corresponding total damping as mentioned earlier a dissipative beach was placed at the end of the wave tank allowing for some incoming wave energy absorption nonetheless part of the incoming wave energy was reflected to measure these phenomena sensors were placed aligned with the wave propagation to separate incident from reflected waves a fast fourier transformation fft saad e and azman 2020 was applied for the energy generating capacity assessment the spar buoy was subjected to a set of regular and irregular waves table 6 and table 7 for the irregular waves the jonswap spectra bosma et al 2017 was applied with a peak enhancement factor of 3 3 the two experimental pto configurations were tested under regular sea states only one of the membranes was studied under irregular waves due to its higher overall performance as seen further ahead the chosen sea states are based on data collected by the portuguese hydrographic institute the portuguese hydrographic institute states that for the portuguese west coast the most common waves have a peak period in the range of 7 15 s with a significant wave height ranging from 1 to 3 m the predominant peak periods are the range of 7 11 s with a wave height ranging from 0 5 to 2 m 35 8 results and discussion 8 1 laboratory validation decay experiments of the scaled model allowed for the quantification of the logarithmic decrement δ damping ratio ξ damping c natural damped frequency ω d and resonance frequency ω r having assumed an equivalent linear damping equation 11 and 12 14 δ 1 n ln z t i z t i δ t 15 ξ δ 2 π 2 δ 2 five consecutive free decay tests were performed see fig 9 for an example allowing for the determination of desired variables in the heave motion table 8 from the period of consecutive peaks it was determined that for the scaled model 1 16 the peak heave response is at a period of 1 9s applying the froude scaling laws this period represents 7 5 s in full scale as expected from the numerical model fig 8 the non dimensional damping coefficient from the sarpkaya and isaacson model resulted in a 26 difference when compared to the free decay tests for the resonance period nevertheless it is considered a good first approximation since without any damping the rao peak value in the numerical model is 39 times larger than the experimental results in the preliminary numerical rao the solution of the damping problem was approached using a semi empirical equation a new numerical model using the damping obtained from the free decay tests with a corrected damping coefficient was applied to obtain more precise numerical results fig 10 in parallel the determination of the experimental rao allowed for a comparison of the numerical and experimental models although the additional 26 in the damping coefficient poses a significant impact on the overall performance of the rao fig 10 the method of sarpkaya and isaacson in red proved to be a good first estimate namely comparing with a numerical model without any damping as mentioned earlier when comparing the results of both the numerical model with the corrected damping resulting from free decay trials in blue and the experimental model in green for the region close to the resonance period of t 7 5 s the values of the rao show a good overlap the remaining frequencies have a good overlap with both models the experimental rao was determined for the averaged non dimensional values since variations with wave amplitude were not significant the reflection coefficients table 9 and table 10 for regular and irregular sea states determined with saad e and azman 2020 result from the ratio between the heights of reflected and incident waves which according to experimental tests were in the range of 5 10 overall the achieved results demonstrate a satisfactory capacity of the beach to absorb energy from the incident waves whereby the hydrodynamic behaviour of the spar buoy was not significantly affected by the reflected waves 8 2 energy generating capacity assessment the pressures inside the chamber without the use of membrane were tested for the periods of t 7 5 s and t 9 5 s for both the numerical model and the experimental model showing accordance amongst them as expected table 11 the numerical results obtained without the use of any membrane were used as a baseline for comparison of membranes m1 and m2 for different periods fig 11 the tests were performed with a wave height corresponding to 1 m at prototype scale and covered a range of periods spanning from 7 5 s to 11 5 s the maximum average pressure 188 pa inside the pneumatic chamber occurs for incoming waves with a period of 7 5 s since it is closer to the resonance peak of the piston t 4 37 s when analysing the experimental results the m2 membrane presents higher values when compared to the baseline and lower than the m1 membrane as expected numerically the impact of the membranes in the resultant pressures was emulated as a negative damping effect on the piston performance table 12 this resulted in higher pressures as expected issues related to equipment precision are mainly responsible for the differences verified between numerical and experimental results regarding the airflow rate fig 12 a maximum peak of 0 22 m3 s was registered for wave periods of 7 5 s for m1 the resulting approximation using the damping reduction proved to be accurate in providing results for the numerical model the average velocity of the piston was used for comparison from 9 5 s onwards a stabilisation of the results is verified regarding power the highest output was 40 w for wave periods of 7 5 s using m1 fig 13 due to the high pressure verified for 7 5 s and similar values in airflow rate wave periods of 10 5 s are some of the most common off the portuguese west coast hence different wave heights were tested for this period fig 14 fig 15 and fig 16 m2 shows higher pressures when compared to the numerical model this is due to the superposition principle behind bem theory and hydrodynamic theory for the frequency domain which states that there is a linear relationship between wave height and motions velocities accelerations and pressures moreover some differences are related to equipment precision which increase significantly with the up scaling from model scale to prototype scale when analysing m1 it is clear that the behaviour remains relatively stable when compared to the numerical results although a lower airflow rate is verified for m2 its high pressure results in higher power output in fact the m2 experimental pto demonstrated a greater energy generation capacity as wave heights increased despite having previously shown the lowest capacity for 1 m waves the power generating capability of m1 stabilizes and does not increases as expected thus the m2 membrane was used for the study of irregular waves 8 3 irregular sea states based on the results obtained for regular waves where the m2 membrane outperformed the m1 membrane the scaled model was tested under irregular wave conditions exclusively with the m2 experimental pto fig 17 fig 18 and fig 19 as expected for peak periods closer to the numerical resonance period of 4 37 s both pressure and flow rate generated higher power outputs the further apart from the resonance period the lower power is generated additionally an increase in hs allowed more power to be generated as expected 9 conclusion experimental testing of a 1 16 scale spar buoy owc for lidar implementation was conducted in a wave tank for both regular and irregular sea states along with a corresponding numerical model two experimental pto configurations were compared in order to simulate the behaviour of a linear air turbine a 70 porosity membrane showed greater power generation at higher wave amplitudes whereas a 39 porosity membrane provided better outputs for lower wave amplitudes both models presented higher generating capabilities whenever closer to the resonance peak beyond monitoring a set of parameters to assess the power generation capacity a hydrodynamic assessment of the spar buoy was made this assessment showed accurate damping and heave motion amplitude determination while showing a relative stable behaviour for different sea states typical lidar equipment require a power ranging from 45 w to 100 w depending on the complexity and number of required devices this implies that the spar buoy would be viable for seas where the peak periods are close to the resonance peak of the virtual piston or alternatively seas where the significant wave height exceeds 1 m frequently nonetheless depending on the energy consumption profile the buoy might be suitable for offshore wind measuring applications moreover the continuous improvement of energy efficient equipment might soon allow for the full scale application of this concept the conceptual model of including an owc inside a buoy is reasonably valid sensing systems with low energy consumption may thus benefit from this technology and ultimately it is possible to obtain between power generation and stability in fact the buoy

experiencing rapid growth globally and consequently the demand for wind resource characterisation to assess the feasibility of future wind farms has been increasing this characterisation can be performed with more traditional equipment to measure just the wind velocity e g an anemometer or with a more modern one where the whole wind profile is assessed e g lidar the anemometer is one of the most common equipment to measure the wind speed while different types are available anemometers only measure the wind passing at a specific height mckeogh 2011 more recent equipment such as lidar s light detection and ranging sodars sonic detection and ranging and radar radio detection and ranging are able to perform remote measurements with good accuracy for different locations at the same time these are based on the doppler effect the physical phenomenon that relates the wave frequency emissions of a moving body with a stationary observer the difference relies on the type of emitting waves e g the waves used by a lidar are electromagnetic mckeogh 2011 adding the necessity of a broader characterisation of the wind to the fact that there are higher turbines hence higher masts for the usual anemometer lidars are a good alternative shu et al 2016 nonetheless the need for lidars to be in a stable position without significant vibration poses a challenge when performing offshore wind measurements in fact long term monitoring of the oceans allows for the acquisition of more reliable data regarding several parameters such as wind average speeds and gusts to keep costs low and to be in line with the expected eu increase in productivity to 1 billion per year european economic social committee 2014 non manned cost effective solutions are key this topic has driven researchers to analyse the possibility of using self sufficient solutions to reduce costs and risks renewable energy harvesters in opposition to batteries which have to be replaced regularly have been one of the key parameters used to address this problem yielding mixed results studies relating to wind and solar energy harvesters løken et al 2016 have generated good results in terms of harvesting though failing to meet the energy demand more recent studies implemented the use of state of the art triboelectric nano generators teng with improved results though still in a very early stage of development with a low technology readiness level trl chandrasekhar et al 2020 finally wave energy converters have been successfully applied for oceanographic sensing systems in buoys allowing for the power generation to be sufficient for the sensing system henriques et al 2016 the study presented in this paper focused on the inclusion of a lidar for wind characterisation on a spar buoy typically known for their stable behaviour equipped with a wave energy converter wec for power supply the aim is to achieve a compromise between reduced resonance motion of the spar buoy and sufficient energy generation stability is achieved whenever low responses are obtained response amplitudes close or below 1 are desired for minimal movement the oscillating water column owc emerges as one of the most studied operational principles for wave energy harvesting the first device based on the owc principle was initially named masuda device honouring its inventor yoshio masuda who started exploring the concept of a navigational buoy powered by wave energy in the late 1940s heath 1959 in general an owc device consists of a partly submerged structure that encloses a volume of air between the free surface and its top fig 1 as well as an opening to the ocean heath 1959 falcão 2010 this particularity allows the free surface inside the structure to vary its position due to the action of waves thus causing the variation of pressure and volume inside the pneumatic chamber falcão e and henriques 2016 the effects of compression and decompression inside the chamber forces the air to flow in or out through a turbine coupled to an electrical generator installed at the top of the device falcão 2010 falcão e and henriques 2016 to accommodate the oscillatory characteristics of the airflow turbines usually require rectifying valves for air guidance in order to maintain the turbine rotating in the same direction independently of the flow orientation falcão e and henriques 2016 in the mid 1970s alan arthur wells invented a self rectifying turbine also called the axial flow wells turbine with a design that eliminated the need for rectifying valves thus providing a more cost effective and robust solution falcão 2010 takao e and setoguchi 2012 recent developments were made in radial flow self rectifying impulse turbines more specifically in bi radial turbines these have shown good efficiency over a wide range of flow rates due to the aerodynamic performance however these turbines add considerable mechanical complexity falcão 2010 falcão e and henriques 2016 falcão and nunes 2012 owc devices are more advantageous when compared to other wave energy converters wecs due to their mechanical simplicity and because all the sensible parts of the power take off system are not in direct contact with the seawater single point anchor reservoirs spars are a widely studied type of floating structure due to their high stability geometrically these structures are typically considered slender bodies owing to their reduced sectional area at the waterline and significant draught commonly the body is axisymmetric allowing for an equal performance independent of wave direction with its mass mainly concentrated on the bottom this set of characteristics provide spars with high stability and low response amplitude to the excitation of the waves the use of floating platforms in place of research towers to monitor the wind resource has been attracting the scientific community the simplicity and stability of spar structures make them strong candidates to compete directly with measuring towers in addition their long term deployment capability in deep waters as well as easy transport and low maintenance costs make spars an appealing solution when considering either fixed or floating structures a clear challenge is how to power the monitoring equipment in line with this an owc spar buoy is presented in this study as an alternative to address the need for a self sustained wind resource monitoring solution an axisymmetric spar buoy with reduced diameter was studied aiming to decrease the amplitude of its response to incident waves and thus minimize the influence of its movements in the quality of the measurements inside the chamber region of the spar buoy high response amplitudes mainly in the heave motion were desired such that energy to supply the monitoring equipment on board could be harnessed through the owc principle due to its simplicity the owc principle has been widely studied sheng et al 2014a where besides the technical advances in experimental testing numerical methods were employed for better physical representation among these a prevalent method is the boundary element method bem with the use of ansys aqwa gaebele et al 2020 gao e and yu 2018 cruz e and sarmento 2004 clément et al 2002 due to the good compromise between accuracy and computational cost this method represents the water portion as a fixed body and has been providing reasonable results as such this method can be applied to different wec devices such as point absorbers gao e and yu 2018 and floating wind turbines chen et al 2019 owc spar buoy dimensioning and testing has been scarce numerical dynamic and parametric optimization of an owc spar buoy geometry has been studied as well as the corresponding optimized air turbine falcão et al 2012 falcão et al 2014 nonetheless the long term deployment of a spar buoy for wind measuring purposes requiring low response amplitude operators rao for stability of the measurements with a self sustainable energy system requiring high response amplitude operators rao for energy generation has not been conducted yet in this paper the numerical study of the owc spar buoy is carried out using a bem approach and validated with experimental results from physical model tests the scaled model of the spar buoy was tested for selected regular and irregular sea states defined based on typical values offshore the portuguese west coast the data collected allowed for the quantification of the pressure variation inside the pneumatic chamber as well as for the measurements of airflow rate and the internal water displacement these variables were used to estimate the power generation capacity the tests allowed for the characterisation of the hydrodynamic behaviour of the body to simulate the power take off pto porous membranes were used to replicate the behaviour of the air turbine the air turbine has linear characteristics since the generated power is linear proportional on the airflow and averaged pressure similar to a wells turbine 2 typical lidar application for offshore wind the lidar device emits a range of light beams between the infrared and ultraviolet regions in the electromagnetic spectrum these beams will target natural aerosols e g dust pollen or rain droplets the beam will return to the lidar at a different frequency and from the difference between the original beam and returning beam wind velocity and direction are calculated to characterise accurately the wind resource the beams from the lidar device are issued in a conical profile hence its ability in characterising the resource in multiple places in a radius defined by this profile this profile can be emitted in two different ways pulsed or continuous wave having the latter a broader range with these specifics a lidar equipment is a reasonable choice for wind characterisation in remote sites such as in an offshore location furthermore this equipment is considerably cheaper than its counterpart anemometer since there is no need for auxiliary constructions the measurement equipment in this case the lidar requires a support structure for correct functioning depending on the need there are several solutions for a wide range of prices and power consumption the use of meteorological masts for offshore applications has proven to require high installation costs whereas the inclusion of lidar equipment in buoys has a considerably lower price some up to 2 of the installation costs of a mast dodd 2018 still power consumptions of lidar equipment vary considerably table 1 3 theoretical background the equations of motion in a hydrodynamic problem result from the equilibrium between the external forces related to the existing hydrodynamic forces whenever a body is partially or fully submerged and the inertial forces due to the mass distributions the hydrodynamic forces can be obtained by integrating the pressure over the wetted surface of a body since the potential flow theory is applied the fluid surrounding the body is considered to be incompressible ρ t 0 in the navier stokes equation inviscid τ 0 rotation free v x u y 0 in the x y plane w y v z 0 in the y z plane and u z w x 0 in the x z plane while satisfying the laplace equation in all its domain 2 φ 0 where φ is the potential function associated with a potential flow field the division amongst the forces existing in the motion equation is based on a superposition principle that separates the hydrodynamic loads and the wave and diffraction loads taking into account the body bound inertial forces as well as such and analysing the dynamic pressures present in the generalized bernoulli equation the hydrodynamic problem is divided into two separate components 1 the wave and diffracting loads related to the pressure field resulting from the presence of the undisturbed wave also known as froude krylov forces and from the presence of the body in the water that has to be worked around also known as diffraction forces 2 the hydrodynamic loads related to the advance or movement of the body at a certain reduced speed while being forced to oscillate so its general form is expressed by equation 1 1 f i f r f h f e where f e f f k f d exciting forces froude krylov and diffraction forces f r radiation forces f h hydrostatic forces f i inertial forces for the heave motion as an example the equation of motion can be rewritten as shown in equation 2 2 m a z b z c z f e where m mass of the body kg a hydrodynamic added mass kg b hydrodynamic damping coefficient n s m c spring coefficient n m there are two types of approaches for solving the hydrodynamic problem 2d potential theory and 3d potential theory in this case the boundary element method bem or 3d panel method which is based on 3d potential theory was applied which uses green s second theorem to transform a three dimensional equation into a surface integral the integral equation represents a distribution of sources or sinks and dipoles on the wetted surface to solve the problem numerically the surface is divided into a number of panels so that the sources and dipoles strengths and the fluid pressure is constant over each element this method allows for the reduction of the problem from a three dimensional volume problem into a two dimensional surface problem so for n panels instead of n 3 equations it has to solve n 2 equations 3 1 frequency domain the harmonic response of floating bodies when subjected to regular waves can be obtained by dividing each equation of motion into an equation in phase cos ε z ζ and out of phase sin ε z ζ in turn derived from the complex motion amplitude for instance z ˆ a for the heave motion as shown in equation 3 and by the wave amplitude ζ a the presence of phase angles ε relates to the undisturbed wave at the origin of the steadily translating body bound axis system an example for the heave motion z is shown in equation 4 3 z ˆ z a e i ε z ζ 4 z a ζ a cos ε z ζ a n d z a ζ a sin ε z ζ therefore the frequency characteristics are presented using the transfer functions or response amplitude operators raos z a ζ a in the case of the heave motion the transfer functions present a ratio of the amplitude of a given motion in equation 3 the heave motion is presented and the wave amplitude in addition the phase angles are presented typically for an incoming wave similarly the response spectra can be obtained for irregular waves as for the regular waves 3 2 ansys aqwa ansys aqwa is a commercial software that applies the 3d panel method or bem with some particularities that must be met as follows 1 the reference frame is a fixed frame fra which translates in the x and y directions when speed is present like the o x y z 2 potential flow is applied for both frequency and time domains 3 small steepness waves ansys aqwa allows for the calculation of the raos for the 6 degrees of freedom as well as other hydrodynamic properties such as added mass radiation damping and pressure inside the chamber 4 conceptual and experimental models the conceptual model was modelled in cad and scaled to 1 16 for laboratory purposes fig 2 the spar buoy consists of two tubular shapes with different cross sections for the experimental setup the tubular shapes were manufactured from two acrylic tubes each one with different cross sections the tube with smaller cross section was partially placed inside the bottom of the larger one and bounded through two revolution parts in this way a watertight chamber was created to increase the buoyancy of the spar buoy inside the tubes the waterline oscillates on the top side of the larger one causing an oscillation of pressure and a reversible air flux from the pneumatic chamber immediately above the water line a ring plate with a central hole closed the top of the larger tube additionally three acrylic discs i e heave plates were placed at the bottom of the model these plates can add damping and added mass that will modify the hydrodynamic response of the spar buoy tao e and dray 2008 this modification will allow to delay and dampen the response to wave excitations improving the response for the energy production and the necessary stability for the measuring equipment in the lower part of the model a single steel disc was added to increase stability and damping moreover the model was designed to have the centre of gravity close to the centre of buoyancy in order to decrease the pitch amplitudes this becomes clear by analysing the pitch restoring coefficient the same could be applied for roll since the pitch restoring coefficient c θ θ is given by equation 5 5 c θ θ ρ g g m l where ρ sea water density kg m 3 g gravitational acceleration m s 2 displaced volume m3 g m l longitudinal initial metacentric height m and the longitudinal initial metacentric height by equation 6 6 g m l b m l k b k g where b m l longitudinal metacentric arm m k b centre of buoyancy m k g centre of gravity m whenever the distance between k b and k g is reduced so is the restoring coefficient and the resonance frequency this allows the frequency to be lower than the average frequencies verified at sea allowing the pitch amplitude to be reduced and stability achieved the same principle can be applied for the heave motion with the introduction of heave plates to reduce the distance between the centre of gravity and the centre of buoyancy by iterating the number of discs the distance is kept at a minimum and the resulting number of discs was obtained 3 in this case the chamber was dimensioned in such a way as to create a venturi effect thus increasing energy generating capabilities for the experimental tests two different types of porous material covered the hole in order to replicate the losses of linear air turbines since linear turbines such as the wells turbine have a pressure drop approximately proportional to the flow rate a porous material will reproduce the same effect shehata et al 2017 the mass flow rate of air through a turbine is expressed by equation 7 sarmento 1992 7 m d ρ a v d t d ρ a d t v d v d t ρ a where ρ a air density v volume of air inside the chamber the time dependent volume of air can be expressed by equation 8 8 v t v 0 z 1 t z 2 t s c the time dependent density of air can be modelled as an ideal gas and the air compression inside the chamber as an isentropic process lee et al 1996 given by equation 9 9 d ρ a d t 1 c 2 d p d t the speed of sound and air density are assumed to be constant and equal to the values under atmospheric conditions whereas the second term is related to the spring effect of the air compressibility sheng et al 2014b in fact the effect of air compressibility on owc performance increases with the increase in the average chamber height volume of air divided by the internal free surface which is not the present case since the volume of air inside the chamber is small moreover the height variations will not greatly affect the overall term thus they are negligible thus the mass flow rate can be expressed by equation 10 sarmento 1992 10 m ρ a q v 0 c 2 d p d t the physical parameters of the model were initially estimated using the cad model and validated experimentally table 2 the centres of gravity and buoyancy were measured from the waterline 5 equipment 5 1 the wave tank the experimental tests of the spar buoy owc were performed at the wave tank of the hydraulics water resources and environment section shrha of the department of civil engineering dec of the faculty of engineering of the university of porto feup fig 3 the wave tank is 28 m long 12 m wide and a maximum depth of 1 2 m the experimental tests were performed at a depth of 0 85 m on the opposite end of the wave generating system a dissipative beach for wave absorption and control of wave reflection was placed during the experimental tests the beach had a slope of 6 m with a 20 incline 5 2 pto the pto was modelled using two porous membranes 39 and 70 called respectively m1 and m2 hereinafter based on the work of sarpkaya e and isaacson 1981 fig 4 the porous membranes emulate the effects of a linear turbine such as the wells turbine which is characterised by a linear relationship between the airflow rate q and the pressure drop p sarpkaya e and isaacson 1981 5 3 sensors to determine the instantaneous generated power p of the experimental pto both airflow rate q and pressure drop p were measured so that p w p q the airflow rate was gathered through wave probes from hr wallingford on the spar buoy while the pressure drop was measured using a differential piezo resistive pressure sensor range of 250 pa fig 5 different equipment was used in order to determine the amplitudes of movements velocities and accelerations of the experimental spar buoy all the experiments were recorded using a gopro 2 and the videos were processed using the image analysis software kinovea which allows quantifying the displacements velocities and accelerations all sensors were connected to a data acquisition system from national instruments configured with a sampling rate of 100 hz 6 numerical model 6 1 bem analysis the spar buoy owc was analysed in ansys aqwa in order to determine its hydrodynamic properties namely its resonance frequency the response amplitudes under regular waves and the corresponding pressures inside the chamber as well as added mass and radiation damping coefficients this assessment took into account the full scale spar buoy to model the behaviour of the water inside the chamber two approaches were used namely a massless disk herein after referred to as piston frigaard e and brorsen 1993 and the water disk just below the waterline hasselmann et al 1973 both these modelling techniques are virtual emulations of the behaviour of the water column inside the chamber and not structural components of the spar buoy a mesh was generated table 3 and refined in order to accurately assess the vertical response and pressures fig 6 the mesh was considered appropriate when the minimum orthogonal quality is greater than 0 15 meaning non dimensional and the maximum skewness is lower than 0 85 which is verified in this case moreover since the movement of water inside the chamber is limited in the radial direction the movement of the piston was limited to the heave motion regarding the application of mooring a floating system comprises a non linear effect thus requiring a time domain analysis by determining the forces applied to the spar buoy in this case for a 14 m depth a mooring line was selected by determining the maximum breaking strength and comparing it to the maximum tension applied to the mooring line as such a synthetic fibre hmpe high modulus polyethylene cable was chosen in a catenary configuration with a prototype scale length of 40 m table 4 to apply this non linear effect in the frequency domain an additional connection stiffness has to be added to the model to represent the presence of the mooring line influencing the motion of the spar buoy the connection to the spar buoy was placed close to the centre of gravity so that the movement of the spar buoy was reduced in the heave motion 6 2 hydrodynamic assessment for the hydrodynamic assessment of the spar buoy the hydrodynamic added mass and damping coefficients are the two key parameters to be determined since ansys aqwa does not account for viscous effects if determined correctly the response of the amplitude of the numerical model should be in line with the motion response of the experimental model the lab performed free decay tests allowed for the validation of the damping coefficient of the spar buoy but not for the virtual piston as such the massless and virtual water disc damping coefficients need to be determined separately in fact this approach has been widely used in the literature to assess pto performance frigaard e and brorsen 1993 hasselmann et al 1973 for the damping analysis as a preliminary approach the equation provided by sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 costa and vitorino was applied to determine the damping coefficient by equations 11 13 11 k c 2 π ζ a d 12 β d 2 f ν 13 b 1 3 μ β d c d k c where k c keulegan carpenter number ζ a wave amplitude m d disc diameter m β frequency parameter f frequency s 1 ν kinematic viscosity of the fluid m2 s 1 μ dynamic viscosity of the fluid pa s b damping coefficient kg s 1 the results using this approach were compared to experimental results since both the spar buoy and piston are of circular shape as an initial approach the damping coefficients for spar buoy and piston were estimated using equation 10 being this equation usually used for offshore structures costa and vitorino the present geometry can be considered for this equation as well the non dimensional damping coefficient of both the spar buoy and piston was obtained with the resultant mass and averaged resonance period resulting in 0 62 and 558 respectively due to their different resonance peak periods and drag coefficients the latter being in accordance with the literature hasselmann et al 1973 the coefficient of the piston is 900 times larger than the coefficient of the spar buoy in fact the resonance peak of the spar buoy is located at 7 5 s while the resonance peak of the piston is closer to 4 37 s as such the initial rao responses for the buoy presents a maximum peak of 3 m m at 7 5 s and the piston of 0 81 m m at 4 37 s for both the massless piston and water disc fig 7 and fig 8 the obtained added mass of the spar buoy has a maximum value of 35 kg for a period of 11 5 s and stabilizes onwards when comparing the results of the massless and water disc pistons it is clear that both approaches behave in similar ways in the literature sheng et al 2014a the water disc piston has presented overall more reliable results thus this approach was applied henceforth 7 experimental procedure the outlined experimental procedure enabled 1 the validation of the numerical model and 2 monitoring of the electrical energy generating capacity to be able to feed the lidar device the mooring line was attached to a point to the side of the spar buoy fig 5 close to the centre of gravity with its scaled properties maintaining the same material table 5 for the validation free decay trials and incident reflected wave separation measurements were performed for the free decay experiments a triaxial accelerometer was used allowing for the experimental determination of the natural frequency in the heave motion as well as the corresponding total damping as mentioned earlier a dissipative beach was placed at the end of the wave tank allowing for some incoming wave energy absorption nonetheless part of the incoming wave energy was reflected to measure these phenomena sensors were placed aligned with the wave propagation to separate incident from reflected waves a fast fourier transformation fft saad e and azman 2020 was applied for the energy generating capacity assessment the spar buoy was subjected to a set of regular and irregular waves table 6 and table 7 for the irregular waves the jonswap spectra bosma et al 2017 was applied with a peak enhancement factor of 3 3 the two experimental pto configurations were tested under regular sea states only one of the membranes was studied under irregular waves due to its higher overall performance as seen further ahead the chosen sea states are based on data collected by the portuguese hydrographic institute the portuguese hydrographic institute states that for the portuguese west coast the most common waves have a peak period in the range of 7 15 s with a significant wave height ranging from 1 to 3 m the predominant peak periods are the range of 7 11 s with a wave height ranging from 0 5 to 2 m 35 8 results and discussion 8 1 laboratory validation decay experiments of the scaled model allowed for the quantification of the logarithmic decrement δ damping ratio ξ damping c natural damped frequency ω d and resonance frequency ω r having assumed an equivalent linear damping equation 11 and 12 14 δ 1 n ln z t i z t i δ t 15 ξ δ 2 π 2 δ 2 five consecutive free decay tests were performed see fig 9 for an example allowing for the determination of desired variables in the heave motion table 8 from the period of consecutive peaks it was determined that for the scaled model 1 16 the peak heave response is at a period of 1 9s applying the froude scaling laws this period represents 7 5 s in full scale as expected from the numerical model fig 8 the non dimensional damping coefficient from the sarpkaya and isaacson model resulted in a 26 difference when compared to the free decay tests for the resonance period nevertheless it is considered a good first approximation since without any damping the rao peak value in the numerical model is 39 times larger than the experimental results in the preliminary numerical rao the solution of the damping problem was approached using a semi empirical equation a new numerical model using the damping obtained from the free decay tests with a corrected damping coefficient was applied to obtain more precise numerical results fig 10 in parallel the determination of the experimental rao allowed for a comparison of the numerical and experimental models although the additional 26 in the damping coefficient poses a significant impact on the overall performance of the rao fig 10 the method of sarpkaya and isaacson in red proved to be a good first estimate namely comparing with a numerical model without any damping as mentioned earlier when comparing the results of both the numerical model with the corrected damping resulting from free decay trials in blue and the experimental model in green for the region close to the resonance period of t 7 5 s the values of the rao show a good overlap the remaining frequencies have a good overlap with both models the experimental rao was determined for the averaged non dimensional values since variations with wave amplitude were not significant the reflection coefficients table 9 and table 10 for regular and irregular sea states determined with saad e and azman 2020 result from the ratio between the heights of reflected and incident waves which according to experimental tests were in the range of 5 10 overall the achieved results demonstrate a satisfactory capacity of the beach to absorb energy from the incident waves whereby the hydrodynamic behaviour of the spar buoy was not significantly affected by the reflected waves 8 2 energy generating capacity assessment the pressures inside the chamber without the use of membrane were tested for the periods of t 7 5 s and t 9 5 s for both the numerical model and the experimental model showing accordance amongst them as expected table 11 the numerical results obtained without the use of any membrane were used as a baseline for comparison of membranes m1 and m2 for different periods fig 11 the tests were performed with a wave height corresponding to 1 m at prototype scale and covered a range of periods spanning from 7 5 s to 11 5 s the maximum average pressure 188 pa inside the pneumatic chamber occurs for incoming waves with a period of 7 5 s since it is closer to the resonance peak of the piston t 4 37 s when analysing the experimental results the m2 membrane presents higher values when compared to the baseline and lower than the m1 membrane as expected numerically the impact of the membranes in the resultant pressures was emulated as a negative damping effect on the piston performance table 12 this resulted in higher pressures as expected issues related to equipment precision are mainly responsible for the differences verified between numerical and experimental results regarding the airflow rate fig 12 a maximum peak of 0 22 m3 s was registered for wave periods of 7 5 s for m1 the resulting approximation using the damping reduction proved to be accurate in providing results for the numerical model the average velocity of the piston was used for comparison from 9 5 s onwards a stabilisation of the results is verified regarding power the highest output was 40 w for wave periods of 7 5 s using m1 fig 13 due to the high pressure verified for 7 5 s and similar values in airflow rate wave periods of 10 5 s are some of the most common off the portuguese west coast hence different wave heights were tested for this period fig 14 fig 15 and fig 16 m2 shows higher pressures when compared to the numerical model this is due to the superposition principle behind bem theory and hydrodynamic theory for the frequency domain which states that there is a linear relationship between wave height and motions velocities accelerations and pressures moreover some differences are related to equipment precision which increase significantly with the up scaling from model scale to prototype scale when analysing m1 it is clear that the behaviour remains relatively stable when compared to the numerical results although a lower airflow rate is verified for m2 its high pressure results in higher power output in fact the m2 experimental pto demonstrated a greater energy generation capacity as wave heights increased despite having previously shown the lowest capacity for 1 m waves the power generating capability of m1 stabilizes and does not increases as expected thus the m2 membrane was used for the study of irregular waves 8 3 irregular sea states based on the results obtained for regular waves where the m2 membrane outperformed the m1 membrane the scaled model was tested under irregular wave conditions exclusively with the m2 experimental pto fig 17 fig 18 and fig 19 as expected for peak periods closer to the numerical resonance period of 4 37 s both pressure and flow rate generated higher power outputs the further apart from the resonance period the lower power is generated additionally an increase in hs allowed more power to be generated as expected 9 conclusion experimental testing of a 1 16 scale spar buoy owc for lidar implementation was conducted in a wave tank for both regular and irregular sea states along with a corresponding numerical model two experimental pto configurations were compared in order to simulate the behaviour of a linear air turbine a 70 porosity membrane showed greater power generation at higher wave amplitudes whereas a 39 porosity membrane provided better outputs for lower wave amplitudes both models presented higher generating capabilities whenever closer to the resonance peak beyond monitoring a set of parameters to assess the power generation capacity a hydrodynamic assessment of the spar buoy was made this assessment showed accurate damping and heave motion amplitude determination while showing a relative stable behaviour for different sea states typical lidar equipment require a power ranging from 45 w to 100 w depending on the complexity and number of required devices this implies that the spar buoy would be viable for seas where the peak periods are close to the resonance peak of the virtual piston or alternatively seas where the significant wave height exceeds 1 m frequently nonetheless depending on the energy consumption profile the buoy might be suitable for offshore wind measuring applications moreover the continuous improvement of energy efficient equipment might soon allow for the full scale application of this concept the conceptual model of including an owc inside a buoy is reasonably valid sensing systems with low energy consumption may thus benefit from this technology and ultimately it is possible to obtain between power generation and stability in fact the buoy presented a stable behaviour being still capable of generating energy credit authorship contribution statement nuno mathias formal analysis numerical simulation results analysis state of the art

21161,in a swell dominated region like the northern indian ocean basin the effect of pre existing waves will play a significant role in the non linear wave wave interactions during cyclonic conditions where the sea is dominated with high frequency waves hence to include such complex phenomenon into the numerical model the present study aims at forcing a pre run two dimensional wave spectral output from an unstructured global coarser domain as a wave boundary condition to a finer regional domain the storm wave and surge simulations were performed for the duration of cyclone phailin 2013 a coupled adcirc swan model was used for both generating the spectrum as well as the estimation of surge and wave attributes additionally both storm wave and surge were simulated without considering the nested wave boundary condition followed by the comparison and analyses of the modeled results with the field data the investigation showed that the inclusion of wave boundary condition in the model resulted in closer agreement of the simulated wave parameters with the observed field data the residual surge results also correlated well with the in situ measurements while the spatial representation of maximum water levels essentially revealed the spread of surge and its associated inundation keywords storm wave storm surge coupled model wave boundary condition adcirc swan wave boundary layer model 1 introduction tropical cyclonic storms are associated with adverse consequences since storm waves and surge potentially damage the coastal regions the bay of bengal bob basin of the northern indian ocean as shown in fig 1 in particular has recorded many such devastating events as the population along the coastal stretches of bob has been expanding at phenomenal rate there is also a prospective increase in the risk of such highly vulnerable cyclonic storm surge incidents thus an accurate modeling and prediction system is mandatary to take timely precautionary actions during such extreme weather conditions over the years several researchers dube et al 1985 1997 2009 westerink and luettich 1991 jelesnianski et al 1992 westerink et al 1994 dietrich et al 2011 zheng et al 2013 bhaskaran et al 2014 have developed and adopted various numerical models iitd model slosh adcirc fvcom to predict and study the behaviour of a storm and estimate the associated surge particularly along the nearshore areas the recent computational advancement has also led to the evolution of these numerical models such that studies at both global and regional scales with very high mesh resolution could be performed the storm surge or circulation models are also integrally coupled to the wave models to better simulate the surge by including the wave effects huang et al 2010 dietrich et al 2011 phan et al 2013 murty et al 2014 numerical storm surge modeling is influenced by various parameters such as the wind intensity the central pressure tidal range translational speed and size of the cyclone local bathymetry and wave features among these the wind intensity wind stress is the most influential and considered to be more sensitive in terms of storm surge and storm wave estimations moon et al 2009 huang et al 2013 shankar et al 2019 the wind shear stress is expressed in terms of density of air ρ a wind drag coefficient cd and horizontal wind speed u 10 as shown below 1 τ ρ a c d u 10 2 the computations of wind drag coefficient have been gradually developed over the years from linear estimations smith and banke 1975 garratt 1977 large and pond 1981 wu 1982 gao et al 2006 to relationships with respect to wave growth rates hara and belcher 2002 2004 moon et al 2009 zijlema et al 2012 at high wind speeds 35 m s chen and yu 2016 has developed the enhanced wave boundary layer model herein after wblm to compute the wind drag coefficient that includes the sea spray effect which is predominant in extreme weather scenarios like cyclonic hurricane conditions into the air sea momentum exchange process further chen and yu 2017 also validated the enhanced wblm for hurricane katrina s conditions by simulating the storm wave heights and comparing them with the observed data that proved the significance of wblm in storm wave modeling the enhanced wblm was also used by shankar and behera 2019a to simulate and validate its performance in the estimation of storm surge and wave parameters for the tropical cyclones originated in the indian ocean conditions the water levels and significant wave heights computed by shankar and behera 2019a through the wind stress method of wblm gave better comparison with the field observations than that of some linear and quadratic wind stress methods however a slight mismatch underestimation in the estimations of storm wave parameters on the initial days of the simulation was observed as identified in shankar and behera 2019a the authors have stated that the error is due to the non inclusion of pre existing wave climate of the model domain into the current modeling part i e the storm surge modeling was carried out only with the best track information of the cyclone and the pre existing wind wave conditions that is already prevailing in the area before the start of the cyclone was not included hence in the present work the two dimensional wave spectrum obtained from the pre run output of a wave model for the same cyclonic time period was specified as a time series wave boundary condition to incorporate the pre existing wave climate which also includes the swell effect into the numerical storm surge and wave modeling which was not included in chen and yu 2017 and shankar and behera 2019a along with the tidal boundary condition specified in the circulation model the wave boundary condition was applied to the wave model at the open ocean boundary and the coupled model simulations were performed to estimate the storm wave and surge characteristics the present work therefore attempts to assess the effect of considering the pre existing wave climate through two dimensional spectral wave boundary condition into the numerical storm wave and surge modeling in order to execute the same the extremely severe cyclonic storm escs phailin 2013 which made its landfall at gopalpur along the odisha coast of india has been considered fig 1 two sets of simulations were carried out namely with wave boundary condition herein after wwbc and without wave boundary condition herein after wowbc while modeling the surge and waves wwbc simulations included the spectral boundary condition from the pre run output of a wave model and wowbc did not the circulation model adcirc advanced circulation model westerink and luettich 1991 and wave model swan simulating waves nearshore booij et al 1999 were coupled and used in this study to analyse the effect of wave boundary condition on storm wave and surge computations the wind stress for both the coupled model simulations wwbc and wowbc was computed through the enhanced wblm developed by chen and yu 2016 as it includes the realistic scenario of air sea interaction effect instead of assuming a cut off value or a linearly increasing method with the increase in wind speed into the estimations of wind drag coefficients at high wind speeds the successive sections briefly discuss the details of tropical cyclone phailin the origin its growth as an extremely severe cyclonic storm the landfall time and location with its associated wind intensities the methodology adopted to compute the wind drag coefficients through the wblm is also presented followed by the coupled model executions furthermore the comparison between the observed values and the numerical modeling results significant wave heights mean wave periods

atmosphere is termed to be the boundary layer which is greatly affected during extreme weather scenarios like severe tropical cyclones hurricanes where wind speeds frequently exceed 40 m s the wind

model adcirc swan for with wwbc and without wowbc considering the pre existing wave climate a detailed methodology of the executions of wwbc outlined in blue and wowbc outlined in red without wave boundary condition from the larger domain case simulation is represented through a flowchart as shown in fig 2 the wwbc scenario was simulated by forcing the pre run spectral output from a larger and coarser domain entire indian ocean region as shown in fig 3 d1 to the smaller domain as shown in fig 3 d2 to include the pre existing wave conditions and swells the pre run modeling was carried out using an unstructured triangular mesh as shown in fig 3 d1 with 692 153 elements and 356 121 nodal points the d1 mesh is discretised with 200 1000 m along the coast 200 m along the odisha coast where cyclone phailin made its landfall and the remaining coastal areas were discretised with 1000 m and 25 30 km towards the offshore region the d2 mesh fig 3 d2 is also generated using unstructured triangular elements with 494 110 elements and 255 142 nodes along the coast with the same resolution as d1 while the open ocean boundary was set to 15 20 km approximately the larger domain d1 is used in the present study to capture the wind generated waves in the indian ocean region while the smaller domain d2 is used only for simulating storm wave and surge components in the bay of bengal basin the bathymetry for both d1 and d2 is interpolated from the 30 arc second bathymetry data obtained from the general bathymetric charts of the oceans gebco the coastal bathymetry near phailin s landfall location is improved using high resolution nho national hydrographic office govt of india charts along the odisha coast the final bathymetry contour map of the domain d2 is shown in fig 4 the 3 hourly wind input specified for the pre run simulation to generate the spectral output is obtained from the era5 ecmwf dataset hersbach et al 2019 the best track details location of the cyclone wind speed and central pressure of cyclone phailin obtained from imd is used for the actual storm wave and surge modeling the wind and pressure fields for the model domains are generated using the generalised asymmetric holland model gahm which is an inbuilt module in adcirc the bottom friction is set to hybrid and its parametric values were assigned to be 0 0026 1 10 and 1 3 for cb hb θ and λ respectively murty et al 2014 shankar and behera 2019b the time step for adcirc and swan is set to 1s and 1800s respectively and the coupling interval is assigned as 1800s the wave spectra in swan are captured with 50 resolution in direction 72 segments for the logarithmic increase of wave frequency from 0 0285 to 1 1726 the effects of white capping komen et al 1984 depth induced wave breaking battjes and janssen 1978 non linear wave wave interaction hasselmann et al 1985 current wave interaction due to the coupling of adcirc swan were incorporated into the present set of simulations both wowbc and wwbc the simulations were performed for the entire duration of cyclone phailin s existence from october 7 2013 12 00 h utc to october 13 2013 12 00 h utc 7 days with a preceding 1 day ramp up period set for the model initialization 3 4 statistical performance indicators the comparison and performance of model generated results wowbc and wwbc with observed data was evaluated with various statistical error analysis methods like normalized root mean square error nrmse correlation coefficient r normalized bias nbi percentage error pe and model performance index mpi the error analysis methods were executed on a basic assumption that the observed data field measurements is error free the nrmse was computed using the following relationship 17 n r m s e r m s e o m a x o m i n 1 n s o 2 o m a x o m i n where s and o indicates the simulated and observed values respectively for a set of n while o m a x and o m i n represents the maximum and minimum values of observed data respectively mentaschi et al 2015 umesh et al 2017 the line of best fit between the simulated and observed values can be derived from nrmse it can be deduced that the best fit between simulated and observed data will have a lower nrmse value to denote a relationship between modeled and observed data the widely used indicator is the correlation coefficient r the strength of the relationship of the model to the observed data can be derived from r as follows 18 r s s o o σ s σ o where s and o are the mean of simulated and observed data respectively σ s and σ o are the standard deviation of simulations and observations respectively the correlation coefficient is interpreted as higher the value the stronger the correlation while a lower value or zero indicates the parameter to be independent normalized bias nbi which is otherwise known as normalized mean bias error nmbe gives the mean of the errors with its magnitude when specified with direction i e either positive or negative direction e g padilla hernandez et al 2007 nbi can be defined as 19 n b i b i o m a x o m i n 1 n s o o m a x o m i n the consistency of the model trend i e whether it over predicts or under predicts can be derived from nbi as the value of the bias indicates if the simulations are over estimated positive value or under estimated negative value in comparison to the observations the accuracy of the modeled values compared with observed can be better evaluated by computing the percentage error brown 2010 the percentage error pe is defined to be 20 p e 100 i 1 n s i o i o i model performance index mpi is calculated to identify how well the model performed with respect to the observed changed in the variable it is defined as one minus the ratio of r m s e r r o r and r m s c h a n g e s where r m s c h a n g e s refer to the difference between the local measured value to the incident value at the boundary umesh et al 2017 21 m p i 1 r m s e r r o r r m s c h a n g e s the value of mpi would be 1 if the model run is perfect i e when r m s e r r o r 0 whereas if the model error is as large as the variable change measured i e when r m s e r r o r r m s c h a n g e s then it would be 0 the above mentioned methods were used as statistical indicators to evaluate the model performances the results obtained from the error analysis methods are indicated through graphical representations in the following sections 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation and comparison of significant storm wave heights simulations were performed for with wave boundary condition wwbc and without wave boundary condition wowbc cases using the coupled circulation and wave model adcirc swan the two dimensional spectral time series information obtained from the pre run output using a larger domain d1 as shown in fig 3 of a wave model with era5 wind data was nested into the smaller domain d2 for the condition of wwbc and the coupled model simulations were carried out for the cyclonic storm wave and surge estimations the wind and pressure fields of the entire domain d2 for the duration of cyclone phailin were built using the gahm with the best track details obtained from imd the wowbc case was simulated using only the smaller domain d2 i e without forcing the pre run spectral output from the larger domain d1 with the wind and pressure fields built by gahm the model computed significant wave heights hs for wwbc and wowbc were compared with the observed buoy data obtained from the indian national centre for ocean information services incois and presented in fig 5 the significant wave height comparison for the shallow water buoy location of gopalpur wrbg is shown in fig 5 a while for the deep water buoy bd08 location is shown in fig 5 b through the comparison of hs from fig 5 it can be seen that the simulated hs using wwbc method is closer to the observed values especially in fig 5 a compared to that using wowbc case there is a slight underestimation of hs in the initial days of the simulation even for the case of wwbc this error is attributed towards the wind field built by the gahm wind model which considers only the cyclonic winds and not the background winds that are already present in the domain before the genesis of the cyclone a higher underestimation of hs can be noticed in the wowbc as shown in fig 5 a while the peak significant wave heights generated due to the cyclone s high wind intensity are well captured in both the cases although swan is widely regarded as a shallow water wave model it has generated better results in the deep water region as well except some mild overestimation as shown in fig 5 b to evaluate the performance of model computed hs using both wwbc and wowbc method with the observed values a set of statistical performance indicators nrmse r nbi pe and mpi were calculated and represented as bar plots in fig 6 a and b fig 6 a shows the error estimates on a scale of 0 1 for the shallow water buoy location wrbg while fig 6 b portrays the same for the deep water buoy location bd08 the nrmse is found to be 0 13 for wowbc and 0 06 for wwbc case at wrbg location while at bd08 it is 0 11 and 0 12 for wowbc and wwbc methods respectively similar trend of lower nbi 0 04 pe 0 05 and higher r 0 97 mpi 0 85 values were obtained for the case of wwbc in the shallow water region however the error estimates were more or less remained constant for both wowbc and wwbc at the deep water location the analyses carried out through statistical performance indicators shows that the significant wave heights estimated through the method of wwbc correlates slightly better with the in situ data than that of the wowbc method in particular at the shallow water location fig 6 a the results of statistical performance indicators further reinforced the significance of the wwbc method in terms of storm wave computations the maximum significant wave heights computed in the entire domain through both wowbc and wwbc method are delineated as spatial contour in fig 7 a and b respectively the peak storm wave height computed through wwbc method reached 14 5 m whereas for the method of wowbc it was 15 1 m as shown in fig 7 a and b the difference in estimation of peak storm wave heights for both the methods were observed along the eye of the cyclone track as it reached the nearshore areas the spectral input from the pre model run enhanced the non linear surge wave interaction at the centre of the cyclone and it reduced the peak storm wave height by over 0 5 m fig 7 b as the cyclone approached the nearshore areas the non linear quadruplet wave wave interactions in the deep water regions was also well simulated through the wwbc case as it can be clearly seen in the spatial representation especially along the eye of the cyclone the ocean boundary and its associated near by regions of the maximum significant wave heights shown in fig 7 b through the time series statistical and spatial analyses of significant storm wave heights computed using wwbc method it can be clearly implied that considering the pre existing wave climate is important in storm wave modeling for a cyclone hurricane condition 4 2 estimation and comparison of mean wave periods and peak wave directions in addition to the significant storm wave heights two other wave parameters mean wave period and peak wave direction were also calculated using the wwbc and wowbc methods and the results were compared with the in situ data computing these two parameters accurately is very important in terms of storm wave modeling as it can greatly enhance the mitigation measures taken to prevent damages on the coastal structures also in the deep ocean to better protect the offshore platforms oil drillers etc during cyclonic events during cyclonic storm landfall near an estuary or tidal inlet or a sharp wedge or tapered shaped coastline e g gulf of khambhat or gulf of kachchh along the gujarat coastline of india where the bore effect of surge will be predominant the mean wave period and peak wave direction will play a significant role to the prediction accuracy of storm surge along these areas the comparison of mean wave periods and peak wave directions with the in situ data are portrayed in fig s 8 9 10 and 11 fig 8 a and b and fig 9 a and b represent the time series and statistical performance comparison of mean wave period at the locations wrbg and bd08 respectively the mean wave period computed through the method of wwbc had substantial improvement to that of the wowbc case which can be clearly seen in fig 8 a and b in particular the mean wave period computed by the wwbc method on the initial days of the simulation correlated much better with the observed data than that of the wowbc case this difference is due to the wowbc simulation being performed using only the cyclonic wind field whereas wwbc method accounts for the incoming waves from the southern indian ocean along with the cyclonic wind generated waves the statistical performance indicator results are shown in fig 9 a and b where the wwbc method obtained higher r 0 92 and 0 89 for wrbg and bd08 respectively and mpi 0 87 and 0 79 for wrbg and bd08 respectively values than the wowbc method r 0 44 and 0 64 for wrbg and bd08 respectively mpi 0 62 and 0 68 for wrbg and bd08 respectively the nrmse nbi and pe values for the case of wwbc were lower than that of wowbc method as indicated in fig 9 a and b the underestimation and overestimation of simulated model results with the observed data were also clearly indicated through the performance indicator nbi values displayed in fig 9 the time series and statistical error analysis comparison of peak wave directions with the observed data is shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively model computed values at location wrbg fig 10 a and bd08 fig 10 b through wwbc method again portrays higher correlation with the field measurements than that of wowbc case the similar trend is also observed in the event of performance indicator calculations shown in fig 11 a and b where the wwbc method obtained lower error estimates for nrmse 0 07 and 0 23 for wrbg and bd08 respectively nbi 0 03 and 0 15 for wrbg and bd08 respectively and pe 0 06 and 0 18 for wrbg and bd08 respectively and higher estimates for r 0 98 and 0 81 for wrbg and bd08 respectively and mpi 0 89 and 0 74 for wrbg and bd08 respectively compared to wowbc the results of time series and statistical indicators for peak wave directions are illustrated in figs 10 and 11 respectively it also showed the significance and importance of considering the pre existing wave conditions into the storm wave modeling as it has greatly improved the model predictions the model generated values of mean wave period and peak wave direction without considering the wave boundary condition substantially differed from the observed data however the results computed using wwbc method correlated well with the observations as aforementioned the storm track and its translational direction used in the case wowbc drive the direction of waves generated due to cyclonic wind only whereas the actual sea state is driven by the pre existing wind seas and swells from farther stretches along with the cyclonic forcing these pre existing wind seas and swells are very important in improving the storm wave predictions significant wave heights mean wave periods and peak wave directions prior to the landfall and should be considered for storm wave modeling hence it is recommended that the regional scale storm wave models should be forced at the boundary with the spectral output from larger domain simulations 4 3 estimation and comparison of water levels the wave radiation stress gradients generated through the wave model were transferred into the circulation model internally in the coupled environment to estimate the total water levels and water particle velocities currents the total water level storm tide calculated by the circulation model is the sum of tidal elevation and storm surge i e the rise in water level over and above the astronomical tide due to the influence of the cyclonic storm the residual surge component in the entire domain d2 is computed by deducting the tidal elevation from the total water level storm tide obtained from the model predictions the model simulated residual surge through wowbc and wwbc methods were compared with the observed residual surge observed total water level tidal elevation data obtained from the tide gauge stations of paradip and visakhapatnam as these two stations were the closest available to the cyclone phailin s landfall location gopalpur odisha the residual surge levels computed through both the methods wowbc and wwbc are graphically presented as time series plots in fig 12 a b and c along with the observed residual surge levels fig 12 a and b fig 12 a shows the residual s comparison for paradip fig 12 b portrays the same for visakhapatnam fig 12 c displays the residual comparison between wowbc and wwbc at ganjam where the peak storm surge occurred during cyclone phailin s landfall the measured peak residual surge at paradip was observed to be 0 68 m while the model estimates through wowbc and wwbc methods were 0 81 m and 0 85 m respectively fig 12 a at visakhapatnam fig 12b the observed value was 0 49 m and the modeled value was 0 51 m and 0 54 m for wowbc and wwbc respectively the peak residual surge obtained through wowbc and wwbc methods at ganjam was 1 92 m and 2 26 m respectively fig 12 c at ganjam there was no any measured water level data available to compare the observed time series with the modeled estimates however as per the post cyclonic survey conducted by the indian meteorological department imd team had reported a peak residual surge of 2 2 5 m around the low lying areas of ganjam esso imd rsmc tropical cyclones report 2014 the wwbc and wowbc simulation results of residual surge levels shows no significant difference between them at paradip and visakhapatnam as they both correlate well with the measured data which can be seen through fig 12 a and b however the wwbc based model computation of peak residual surge at ganjam i e 2 26 m closely correlates with the imd reported range i e 2 2 5 m while the wowbc underestimates the peak surge incident by over 0 3 m the statistical performance results shown in fig 13 a and b also exhibited the same trend with the error values changing on minor scales at paradip and visakhapatnam the major reason for such low variation between the two methods could be ascribed to the fact that the stations paradip and visakhapatnam are almost 150 200 km away from phailin s landfall location one to the right side and the other on the left side of phailin s track as shown in fig 14 and neither of the stations were able to capture the peak surge event a reasonable change between these two methods wowbc and wwbc was observed at ganjam where the peak surge event occurred but as there was no measurement data available the time series statistical comparison between the modeled estimates and in situ values could not be performed the spatial representation of maximum water level contours is shown in fig 14 a and b where fig 14 a depicts the maximum water level obtained from the simulation of wowbc and fig 14 b displays the same for wwbc the spread of maximum water levels along the cyclone landfall location was found to be more prominent in case of wwbc method fig 14 b and less for the wowbc based surge estimations in general for a tropical cyclonic storm that have occurred on the northern hemisphere the winds are stronger on the right side due to the cyclone s anti clockwise translational movement of the cyclone s track hence the maximum surge is also expected to be higher on the right side as evidently fig 14 b captured by the model through wwbc method therefore it is suggested to simulate the storm surge using the coupled model with the wind stress input from wblm with wave boundary condition as its impact can be discerned in the nearshore areas majorly if the cyclone is forecasted to make its landfall along an estuary or a wide tidal inlet where the tidal range might be high 5 summary and conclusions numerical modeling of storm wave and surge with utmost accuracy is an essential factor to better assess any vulnerable cyclonic scenario the realistic representation of each and every event that is possible during such extreme weather condition has to be incorporated into the numerical model to improve the accuracy in real time predictions the present study established one such method of including the pre existing wave conditions along with swells in to the storm wave and surge modeling a two dimensional spectral input was nested from a larger domain pre run wave model output through era5 wind data to the model domain for a tropical cyclonic condition cyclone phailin and the storm wave and surge parameters were calculated i e the case of with wave boundary condition wwbc one other case was also modeled without the spectral input i e without wave boundary condition wowbc and the results of both the methods were compared and analysed with respect to the in situ data the storm wave parameters like significant wave height mean wave period and peak wave direction showed a significant improvement prior to the landfall for the simulations that considered the pre existing wave information in particular the mean wave period and peak wave directions obtained through the method of wwbc had a higher correlation to the measured values than that of wowbc the results of statistical performance indicators also portrayed the same with lower nrmse nbi pe and higher r and mpi for the storm wave attributes similar to the storm wave modeling part the peak storm surge estimations also exhibited significant difference along the cyclone landfall areas although there was inadequate measurements to capture the peak surge incidents the model estimated peak surge values through wwbc correlated well with the range reported in post cyclonic survey report the comparison between model estimated and measured residual surge at the two tide gauge stations was also well in agreement for both wwbc and wowbc the spatial representations of the maximum water levels also exhibited a notable difference of 0 3 0 4 m in the water levels between the wwbc and wowbc methods where the surge extent was more prominently captured with the wwbc procedure in accordance to this it is advocated that the storm wave and surge modeling techniques should include the effect of pre existing wave information especially to the swell dominant regions as it can improve the accuracy in near real time predictions credit authorship contribution statement c gowri shankar conceptualization methodology development validation formal analysis investigation

21161,in a swell dominated region like the northern indian ocean basin the effect of pre existing waves will play a significant role in the non linear wave wave interactions during cyclonic conditions where the sea is dominated with high frequency waves hence to include such complex phenomenon into the numerical model the present study aims at forcing a pre run two dimensional wave spectral output from an unstructured global coarser domain as a wave boundary condition to a finer regional domain the storm wave and surge simulations were performed for the duration of cyclone phailin 2013 a coupled adcirc swan model was used for both generating the spectrum as well as the estimation of surge and wave attributes additionally both storm wave and surge were simulated without considering the nested wave boundary condition followed by the comparison and analyses of the modeled results with the field data the investigation showed that the inclusion of wave boundary condition in the model resulted in closer agreement of the simulated wave parameters with the observed field data the residual surge results also correlated well with the in situ measurements while the spatial representation of maximum water levels essentially revealed the spread of surge and its associated inundation keywords storm wave storm surge coupled model wave boundary condition adcirc swan wave boundary layer model 1 introduction tropical cyclonic storms are associated with adverse consequences since storm waves and surge potentially damage the coastal regions the bay of bengal bob basin of the northern indian ocean as shown in fig 1 in particular has recorded many such devastating events as the population along the coastal stretches of bob has been expanding at phenomenal rate there is also a prospective increase in the risk of such highly vulnerable cyclonic storm surge incidents thus an accurate modeling and prediction system is mandatary to take timely precautionary actions during such extreme weather conditions over the years several researchers dube et al 1985 1997 2009 westerink and luettich 1991 jelesnianski et al 1992 westerink et al 1994 dietrich et al 2011 zheng et al 2013 bhaskaran et al 2014 have developed and adopted various numerical models iitd model slosh adcirc fvcom to predict and study the behaviour of a storm and estimate the associated surge particularly along the nearshore areas the recent computational advancement has also led to the evolution of these numerical models such that studies at both global and regional scales with very high mesh resolution could be performed the storm surge or circulation models are also integrally coupled to the wave models to better simulate the surge by including the wave effects huang et al 2010 dietrich et al 2011 phan et al 2013 murty et al 2014 numerical storm surge modeling is influenced by various parameters such as the wind intensity the central pressure tidal range translational speed and size of the cyclone local bathymetry and wave features among these the wind intensity wind stress is the most influential and considered to be more sensitive in terms of storm surge and storm wave estimations moon et al 2009 huang et al 2013 shankar et al 2019 the wind shear stress is expressed in terms of density of air ρ a wind drag coefficient cd and horizontal wind speed u 10 as shown below 1 τ ρ a c d u 10 2 the computations of wind drag coefficient have been gradually developed over the years from linear estimations smith and banke 1975 garratt 1977 large and pond 1981 wu 1982 gao et al 2006 to relationships with respect to wave growth rates hara and belcher 2002 2004 moon et al 2009 zijlema et al 2012 at high wind speeds 35 m s chen and yu 2016 has developed the enhanced wave boundary layer model herein after wblm to compute the wind drag coefficient that includes the sea spray effect which is predominant in extreme weather scenarios like cyclonic hurricane conditions into the air sea momentum exchange process further chen and yu 2017 also validated the enhanced wblm for hurricane katrina s conditions by simulating the storm wave heights and comparing them with the observed data that proved the significance of wblm in storm wave modeling the enhanced wblm was also used by shankar and behera 2019a to simulate and validate its performance in the estimation of storm surge and wave parameters for the tropical cyclones originated in the indian ocean conditions the water levels and significant wave heights computed by shankar and behera 2019a through the wind stress method of wblm gave better comparison with the field observations than that of some linear and quadratic wind stress methods however a slight mismatch underestimation in the estimations of storm wave parameters on the initial days of the simulation was observed as identified in shankar and behera 2019a the authors have stated that the error is due to the non inclusion of pre existing wave climate of the model domain into the current modeling part i e the storm surge modeling was carried out only with the best track information of the cyclone and the pre existing wind wave conditions that is already prevailing in the area before the start of the cyclone was not included hence in the present work the two dimensional wave spectrum obtained from the pre run output of a wave model for the same cyclonic time period was specified as a time series wave boundary condition to incorporate the pre existing wave climate which also includes the swell effect into the numerical storm surge and wave modeling which was not included in chen and yu 2017 and shankar and behera 2019a along with the tidal boundary condition specified in the circulation model the wave boundary condition was applied to the wave model at the open ocean boundary and the coupled model simulations were performed to estimate the storm wave and surge characteristics the present work therefore attempts to assess the effect of considering the pre existing wave climate through two dimensional spectral wave boundary condition into the numerical storm wave and surge modeling in order to execute the same the extremely severe cyclonic storm escs phailin 2013 which made its landfall at gopalpur along the odisha coast of india has been considered fig 1 two sets of simulations were carried out namely with wave boundary condition herein after wwbc and without wave boundary condition herein after wowbc while modeling the surge and waves wwbc simulations included the spectral boundary condition from the pre run output of a wave model and wowbc did not the circulation model adcirc advanced circulation model westerink and luettich 1991 and wave model swan simulating waves nearshore booij et al 1999 were coupled and used in this study to analyse the effect of wave boundary condition on storm wave and surge computations the wind stress for both the coupled model simulations wwbc and wowbc was computed through the enhanced wblm developed by chen and yu 2016 as it includes the realistic scenario of air sea interaction effect instead of assuming a cut off value or a linearly increasing method with the increase in wind speed into the estimations of wind drag coefficients at high wind speeds the successive sections briefly discuss the details of tropical cyclone phailin the origin its growth as an extremely severe cyclonic storm the landfall time and location with its associated wind intensities the methodology adopted to compute the wind drag coefficients through the wblm is also presented followed by the coupled model executions furthermore the comparison between the observed values and the numerical modeling results significant wave heights mean wave periods peak wave directions and residual surge levels obtained under the wwbc and wowbc conditions is explained 2 description of cyclone phailin a depression was formed and reported by the indian meteorological department imd during the morning hours 0300 utc of october 8 2013 centered approximately at 120 n 960 e over the north andaman sea imd national bulletin report 2013 it further

track where peak surge incident occurred were chosen based on the data availability and site significance factor the water levels and wave parameters obtained from these stations were used for a comparative analysis to study the significance of pre existing wave conditions on numerical storm surge and wave modeling 3 models and methods 3 1 hydrodynamic coupled model adcirc swan adcirc the

model adcirc swan for with wwbc and without wowbc considering the pre existing wave climate a detailed methodology of the executions of wwbc outlined in blue and wowbc outlined in red without wave boundary condition from the larger domain case simulation is represented through a flowchart as shown in fig 2 the wwbc scenario was simulated by forcing the pre run spectral output from a larger and coarser domain entire indian ocean region as shown in fig 3 d1 to the smaller domain as shown in fig 3 d2 to include the pre existing wave conditions and swells the pre run modeling was carried out using an unstructured triangular mesh as shown in fig 3 d1 with 692 153 elements and 356 121 nodal points the d1 mesh is discretised with 200 1000 m along the coast 200 m along the odisha coast where cyclone phailin made its landfall and the remaining coastal areas were discretised with 1000 m and 25 30 km towards the offshore region the d2 mesh fig 3 d2 is also generated using unstructured triangular elements with 494 110 elements and 255 142 nodes along the coast with the same resolution as d1 while the open ocean boundary was set to 15 20 km approximately the larger domain d1 is used in the present study to capture the wind generated waves in the indian ocean region while the smaller domain d2 is used only for simulating storm wave and surge components in the bay of bengal basin the bathymetry for both d1 and d2 is interpolated from the 30 arc second bathymetry data obtained from the general bathymetric charts of the oceans gebco the coastal bathymetry near phailin s landfall location is improved using high resolution nho national hydrographic office govt of india charts along the odisha coast the final bathymetry contour map of the domain d2 is shown in fig 4 the 3 hourly wind input specified for the pre run simulation to generate the spectral output is obtained from the era5 ecmwf dataset hersbach et al 2019 the best track details location of the cyclone wind speed

asymmetric holland model gahm which is an inbuilt module in adcirc the bottom friction is set to hybrid and its parametric values were assigned to be 0 0026 1 10 and 1 3 for cb hb θ and λ respectively murty et al 2014 shankar and behera 2019b the time step for adcirc and swan is set to 1s and 1800s respectively and the coupling interval is assigned as 1800s the wave spectra in swan are captured with 50 resolution in direction 72 segments for the logarithmic increase of wave frequency from 0 0285 to 1 1726 the effects of white capping komen et al 1984 depth induced wave breaking battjes and janssen 1978 non linear wave wave interaction hasselmann et al 1985 current wave interaction due to the coupling of adcirc swan were incorporated into the present set of simulations both wowbc and wwbc the simulations were performed for the entire duration of cyclone phailin s existence from october 7 2013 12 00 h utc to october 13 2013 12 00 h utc 7 days with a preceding 1 day ramp up period set for the model initialization 3 4 statistical performance indicators the comparison and performance of model generated results wowbc and wwbc with observed data was evaluated with various statistical error analysis methods like normalized root mean square error nrmse correlation coefficient r normalized bias nbi percentage error pe and model performance index mpi the error analysis methods were executed on a basic assumption that the observed data field measurements is error free the nrmse was computed using the following relationship 17 n r m s e r m s e o m a x o m i n 1 n s o 2 o m a x o m i n where s and o indicates the simulated and observed values respectively for a set of n while o m a x and o m i n represents the maximum and minimum values of observed data respectively mentaschi et al 2015 umesh et al 2017 the line of best fit between the simulated and observed values can be derived from nrmse it can be deduced that the best fit between simulated and observed data will have a lower nrmse value to denote a relationship between modeled and observed data the widely used indicator is the correlation coefficient r the strength of the relationship of the model to the observed data can be derived from r as follows 18 r s s o o σ s σ o where s and o are the mean of simulated and observed data respectively σ s and σ o are the standard deviation of simulations and observations respectively the correlation coefficient is interpreted as higher the value the stronger the correlation while a lower value or zero indicates the parameter to be independent normalized bias nbi which is otherwise known as normalized mean bias error nmbe gives the mean of the errors with its magnitude when specified with direction i e either positive or negative direction e g padilla hernandez et al 2007 nbi can be defined as 19 n b i b i o m a x o m i n 1 n s o o m a x o m i n the consistency of the model trend i e whether it over predicts or under predicts can be derived from nbi as the value of the bias indicates if the simulations are over estimated positive value or under estimated negative value in comparison to the observations the accuracy of the modeled values compared with observed can be better evaluated by computing the percentage error brown 2010 the percentage error pe is defined to be 20 p e 100 i 1 n s i o i o i model performance index mpi is calculated to identify how well the model performed with respect to the observed changed in the variable it is defined as one minus the ratio of r m s e r r o r and r m s c h a n g e s where r m s c h a n g e s refer to the difference between the local measured value to the incident value at the boundary umesh et al 2017 21 m p i 1 r m s e r r o r r m s c h a n g e s the value of mpi would be 1 if the model run is perfect i e when r m s e r r o r 0 whereas if the model error is as large as the variable change measured i e when r m s e r r o r r m s c h a n g e s then it would be 0 the above mentioned methods were used as statistical indicators to evaluate the model performances the results obtained from the error analysis methods are indicated through graphical representations in the following sections 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation and comparison of significant storm wave heights simulations were performed for with wave boundary condition wwbc and without wave boundary condition wowbc cases using the coupled circulation and wave model adcirc swan the two dimensional spectral time series information obtained from the pre run output using a larger domain d1 as shown in fig 3 of a wave model with era5 wind data was nested into the smaller domain d2 for the condition of wwbc and the coupled model simulations were carried out for the cyclonic storm wave and surge estimations the wind and pressure fields of the entire domain d2 for the duration of cyclone phailin were built using the gahm with the best track details obtained from imd the wowbc case was simulated using only the smaller domain d2 i e without forcing the pre run spectral output from the larger domain d1 with the wind and pressure fields built by gahm the model computed significant wave heights hs for wwbc and wowbc were compared with the observed buoy data obtained from the indian national centre for ocean information services incois and presented in fig 5 the significant wave height comparison for the shallow water buoy location of gopalpur wrbg is shown in fig 5 a while for the deep water buoy bd08 location is shown in fig 5 b through the comparison of hs from fig 5 it can be seen that the simulated hs using wwbc method is closer to the observed values especially in fig 5 a compared to that using wowbc case there is a slight underestimation of hs in the initial days of the simulation even for the case of wwbc this error is attributed towards the wind field built by the gahm wind model which considers only the cyclonic winds and not the background winds that are already present in the domain before the genesis of the cyclone a higher underestimation of hs can be noticed in the wowbc as shown in fig 5 a while the peak significant wave heights generated due to the cyclone s high wind intensity are well captured in both the cases although swan is widely regarded as a shallow water wave model it has generated better results in the deep water region as well except some mild overestimation as shown in fig 5 b to evaluate the performance of model computed hs using both wwbc and wowbc method with the observed values a set of statistical performance indicators nrmse r nbi pe and mpi were calculated and represented as bar plots in fig 6 a and b fig 6 a shows the error estimates on a scale of 0 1 for the shallow water buoy location wrbg while fig 6 b portrays the same for the deep water buoy location bd08 the nrmse is found to be 0 13 for wowbc and 0 06 for wwbc case at wrbg location while at bd08 it is 0 11 and 0 12 for wowbc and wwbc methods respectively similar trend of lower nbi 0 04 pe 0 05 and higher r 0 97 mpi 0 85 values were obtained for the case of wwbc in the shallow water region however the error estimates were more or less remained constant for both wowbc and wwbc at the deep water location the analyses carried out through statistical performance indicators shows that the significant wave heights estimated through the method of wwbc correlates slightly better with the in situ data than that of the wowbc method in particular at the shallow water location fig 6 a the results of statistical performance indicators further reinforced the significance of the wwbc method in terms of storm wave computations the maximum significant wave heights computed in the entire domain through both wowbc and wwbc method are delineated as spatial contour in fig 7 a and b respectively the peak storm wave height computed through wwbc method reached 14 5 m whereas for the method of wowbc it was 15 1 m as shown in fig 7 a and b the difference in estimation of peak storm wave heights for both the methods were observed along the eye of the cyclone track as it reached the nearshore areas the spectral input from the pre model run enhanced the non linear surge wave interaction at the centre of the cyclone and it reduced the peak storm wave height by over 0 5 m fig 7 b as the cyclone approached the nearshore areas the non linear quadruplet wave wave interactions in the deep water regions was also well simulated through the wwbc case as it can be clearly seen in the spatial representation especially along the eye of the cyclone the ocean boundary and its associated near by regions of the maximum significant wave heights shown in fig 7 b through the time series statistical and spatial analyses of significant storm wave heights computed using wwbc method it can be clearly implied that considering the pre existing wave climate is important in storm wave modeling for a cyclone hurricane condition 4 2 estimation and comparison of mean wave periods and peak wave directions in addition to the significant storm wave heights two other wave parameters mean wave period and peak wave direction were also calculated using the wwbc and wowbc methods and the results were compared with the in situ data computing these two parameters accurately is very important in terms of storm wave modeling as it can greatly enhance the mitigation measures taken to prevent damages on the coastal structures also in the deep ocean to better protect the offshore platforms oil drillers etc during cyclonic events during cyclonic storm landfall near an estuary or tidal inlet or a sharp wedge or tapered shaped coastline e g gulf of khambhat or gulf of kachchh along the gujarat coastline of india where the bore effect of surge will be predominant the mean wave period and peak wave direction will play a significant role to the prediction accuracy of storm surge along these areas the comparison of mean wave periods and peak wave directions with the in situ data are portrayed in fig s 8 9 10 and 11 fig 8 a and b and fig 9 a and b represent the time series and statistical performance comparison of mean wave period at the locations wrbg and bd08 respectively the mean wave period computed through the method of wwbc had substantial improvement to that of the wowbc case which can be clearly seen in fig 8 a and b in particular the mean wave period computed by the wwbc method on the initial days of the simulation correlated much better with the observed data than that of the wowbc case this difference is due to the wowbc simulation being performed using only the cyclonic wind field whereas wwbc method accounts for the incoming waves from the southern indian ocean along with the cyclonic wind generated waves the statistical performance indicator results are shown in fig 9 a and b where the wwbc method obtained higher r 0 92 and 0 89 for wrbg and bd08 respectively and mpi 0 87 and 0 79 for wrbg and bd08 respectively values than the wowbc method r 0 44 and 0 64 for wrbg and bd08 respectively mpi 0 62 and 0 68 for wrbg and bd08 respectively the nrmse nbi and pe values for the case of wwbc were lower than that of wowbc method as indicated in fig 9 a and b the underestimation and overestimation of simulated model results with the observed data were also clearly indicated through the performance indicator nbi values displayed in fig 9 the time series and statistical error analysis comparison of peak wave directions with the observed data is shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively model computed values at location wrbg fig 10 a and bd08 fig 10 b through wwbc method again portrays higher correlation with the field measurements than that of wowbc case the similar trend is also observed in the event of performance indicator calculations shown in fig 11 a and b where the wwbc method obtained lower error estimates for nrmse 0 07 and 0 23 for wrbg and bd08 respectively nbi 0 03 and 0 15 for wrbg and bd08 respectively and pe 0 06 and 0 18 for wrbg and bd08 respectively and higher estimates for r 0 98 and 0 81 for wrbg and bd08 respectively and mpi 0 89 and 0 74 for wrbg and bd08 respectively compared to wowbc the results of time series and statistical indicators for peak wave directions are illustrated in figs 10 and 11 respectively it also showed the significance and importance of considering the pre existing wave conditions into the storm wave modeling as it has greatly improved the model predictions the model generated values of mean wave period and peak wave direction without considering the wave boundary condition substantially differed from the observed data however the results computed using wwbc method correlated well with the observations as aforementioned the storm track and its translational direction used in the case wowbc drive the direction of waves generated due to cyclonic wind only whereas the actual sea state is driven by the pre existing wind seas and swells from farther stretches along with the cyclonic forcing these pre existing wind seas and swells are very important in improving the storm wave predictions significant wave heights mean wave periods and peak wave directions prior to the landfall and should be considered for storm wave modeling hence it is recommended that the regional scale storm wave models should be forced at the boundary with the spectral output from larger domain simulations 4 3 estimation and comparison of water levels the wave radiation stress gradients generated through the wave model were transferred into the circulation model internally in the coupled environment to estimate the total water levels and water particle velocities currents the total water level storm tide calculated by the circulation model is the sum of tidal elevation and storm surge i e the rise in water level over and above the astronomical tide due to the influence of the cyclonic storm the residual surge component in the entire domain d2 is computed by deducting the tidal elevation from the total water level storm tide obtained from the model predictions the model simulated residual surge through wowbc and wwbc methods were compared with the observed residual surge observed total water level tidal elevation data obtained from the tide gauge stations of paradip and visakhapatnam as these two stations were the closest available to the cyclone phailin s landfall location gopalpur odisha the residual surge levels computed through both the methods wowbc and wwbc are graphically presented as time series plots in fig 12 a b and c along with the observed residual surge levels fig 12 a and b fig 12 a shows the residual s comparison for paradip fig 12 b portrays the same for visakhapatnam fig 12 c displays the residual comparison between wowbc and wwbc at ganjam where the peak storm surge occurred during cyclone phailin s landfall the measured peak residual surge at paradip was observed to be 0 68 m while the model estimates through wowbc and wwbc methods were 0 81 m and 0 85 m respectively fig 12 a at visakhapatnam fig 12b the observed value was 0 49 m and the modeled value was 0 51 m and 0 54 m for wowbc and wwbc respectively the peak residual surge obtained through wowbc and wwbc methods at ganjam was 1 92 m and 2 26 m respectively fig 12 c at ganjam there was no any measured water level data available to compare the observed time series with the modeled estimates however as per the post cyclonic survey conducted by the indian meteorological department imd team had reported a peak residual surge of 2 2 5 m around the low lying areas of ganjam esso imd rsmc tropical cyclones report 2014 the wwbc and wowbc simulation results of residual surge levels shows no significant difference between them at paradip and visakhapatnam as they both correlate well with the measured data which can be seen through fig 12 a and b however the wwbc based model computation of peak residual surge at ganjam i e 2 26 m closely correlates with the imd reported range i e 2 2 5 m while the wowbc underestimates the peak surge incident by over 0 3 m the statistical performance results shown in fig 13 a and b also exhibited the same trend with the error values changing on minor scales at paradip and visakhapatnam the major reason for such low variation between the two methods could be ascribed to the fact that the stations paradip and visakhapatnam are almost 150 200 km away from phailin s landfall location one to the right side and the other on the left side of phailin s track as shown in fig 14 and neither of the stations were able to capture the peak surge event a reasonable change between these two methods wowbc and wwbc was observed at ganjam where the peak surge event occurred but as there was no measurement data available the time series statistical comparison between the modeled estimates and in situ values could not be performed the spatial representation of maximum water level contours is shown in fig 14 a and b where fig 14 a depicts the maximum water level obtained from the simulation of wowbc and fig 14 b displays the same for wwbc the spread of maximum water levels along the cyclone landfall location was found to be more prominent in case of wwbc method fig 14 b and less for the wowbc based surge estimations in general for a tropical cyclonic storm that have occurred on the northern hemisphere the winds are stronger on the right side due to the cyclone s anti clockwise translational movement of the cyclone s track hence the maximum surge is also expected to be higher on the right side as evidently fig 14 b captured by the model through wwbc method therefore it is suggested to simulate the storm surge using the coupled model with the wind stress input from wblm with wave boundary condition as its impact can be discerned in the nearshore areas majorly if the cyclone is forecasted to make its landfall along an estuary or a wide tidal inlet where the tidal range might be high 5 summary and conclusions numerical modeling of storm wave and surge with utmost accuracy is an essential factor to better assess any vulnerable cyclonic scenario the realistic representation of each and every event that is possible during such extreme weather condition has to be incorporated into the numerical model to improve the accuracy in real time predictions the present study established one such method of including the pre existing wave conditions along with swells in to the storm wave and surge modeling a two dimensional spectral input was nested from a larger domain pre run wave model output through era5 wind data to the model domain for a tropical cyclonic condition cyclone phailin and the storm wave and surge parameters were calculated i e the case of with wave boundary condition wwbc one other case was also modeled without the spectral input i e without wave boundary condition wowbc and the results of both the methods were compared and analysed with respect to the in situ data the storm wave parameters like significant wave height mean wave period and peak wave direction showed a significant improvement prior to the landfall for the simulations that considered the pre existing wave information in particular the mean wave period and peak wave directions obtained through the method of wwbc had a higher correlation to the measured values than that of wowbc the results of statistical performance indicators also portrayed the same with lower nrmse nbi pe and higher r and mpi for the storm wave attributes similar to the storm wave modeling part the peak storm surge estimations also exhibited significant difference along the cyclone landfall areas although there was inadequate measurements to capture the peak surge incidents the model estimated peak surge values through wwbc correlated well with the range reported in post cyclonic survey report the comparison between model estimated and measured residual surge at the two tide gauge stations was also well in agreement for both wwbc and wowbc the spatial representations of the maximum water levels also exhibited a notable difference of 0 3 0 4 m in the water levels between the wwbc and wowbc methods where the surge extent was more prominently captured with the wwbc procedure in accordance to this it is advocated that the storm wave and surge modeling techniques should include the effect of pre existing wave information especially to the swell dominant regions as it can improve the accuracy in near real time predictions credit authorship contribution statement c gowri shankar conceptualization methodology development validation formal analysis investigation

21162,mechanisms governing the sand plug behavior inside an open ended pile are examined using the discrete element method a series of numerical pile penetration tests have been conducted by considering the influence of soil density pile geometry and installation method a novel sample generation method based on the replication of unit cell is applied to produce a large and homogeneous sample efficiently according to the soil deformation pattern a nose cone with the length about one pile diameter has been observed beneath the small diameter jacked pile at the end of penetration plugging effect is shown to be more prevalent for jacked piles than dynamic installed piles also larger penetration smaller diameter and higher soil density all seem to promote plug formation while the influence of wall thickness is not that obvious this conclusion is later verified by the development of incremental filling ratio ifr and porosity distribution furthermore remarkable stress concentration has been observed at the lower part of the soil plug the development of installation resistance indicates that jacking produces the largest resistance while dynamic installation methods ease pile penetration further analysis based on particle movements contact force chain distribution and stress orientation provides a micromechanical perspective of the plug behavior finally the plug resistance mobilization process at different plugging conditions and the formation process for soil plug are illustrated keywords plugging effect open ended pile dem installation resistance load transfer 1 introduction open ended piles are frequently used as foundations for both onshore and offshore structures during the installation process part of the soil mass underneath will be pushed into the pile forming a soil column called soil plug paikowsky 1989 randolph et al 1991 the interplay of soil plug and pile which is commonly referred to as plugging effect poses a great influence on the pile installation resistance and bearing capacity thus leading to the distinctive characteristics of open ended piles compared to that of equivalent close ended piles gavin and lehane 2003 paik et al 2003 the plugging effect of open ended pile has been widely discussed in literatures many researchers have reported that the soil plug state is highly dependent on the installation method pile geometry and soil condition henke et al 2008 henke and bienen 2013 lehane and gavin 2001 hight 1996 proposed that a pile would plug when the soil plug length exceeded a critical height the value of which was influenced by the pile diameter and soil density it has also been reported that the maximum pile diameter for plug formation was 1 5m lüking and kempfert 2013 jardine et al 2005 de nicola and randolph 1997 found that the plugging effect was more remarkable in jacked piles than in driven piles and increasing sand density may lead to plug growth in driven piles but not in jacked piles furthermore henke et al 2008 2012 2014 performed systematic analysis of the influence of pile installation methods via field tests centrifuge experiments and numerical modelling the research pointed out that for dynamic installation methods the inertia of the soil mass inside the pile prevented the formation of soil plug while for jacked piles high horizontal stress could accumulate thus facilitating plug formation ko et al 2016 simulated the driving process of open ended piles in sand using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel approach parametric analysis revealed that the plugging effect was most influenced by driving energy followed by pile diameter and pile embedment depth based on centrifuge tests wang et al 2018 found that during the loading process of open ended pile the resistance components would take effect in the order of shaft resistance annular resistance and plug resistance also the ultimate bearing capacity was reached synchronously with the mobilization of the maximum plug resistance li et al 2019 proposed an innovative pile foundation design by setting up restriction plates inside the pipe pile centrifuge tests showed that the restriction plates could promote plug formation thus leading to higher bearing capacity compared to that of the conventional open ended pile however the installation resistance hammer blow counts was not provided to better predict the bearing capacity of open ended pile some of the acknowledged design methods such as hku 12 yu and yang 2012 and uwa 5 lehane et al 2005 have incorporated the plugging effect into the design guidelines by introducing correction factors related to plug length change e g plug length ratio plr incremental filling ratio ifr final filling ratio ffr however the complexity of plug behavior has made the above parameters hard to obtain and interpret in field tests meanwhile the publication of more reliable database lehane et al 2017 han et al 2019 and new design methods labenski et al 2016b lehane et al 2020 demonstrates that our knowledge of plugging effect is still advancing the above and related researches mainly focus on plug behavior at macro level while microscopic investigation on plugging effect has been less favored regarding this the discrete element method dem provides a convenient and comprehensive alternative to investigate both the macroscopic and microscopic behavior of granular soil jiang et al 2020 o sullivan 2011 zhou et al 2010 conducted model tests and dem simulations of open ended piles jacking into sands and proposed to describe the soil plug formation in three stages initial stage formation of active arch and formation of passive arch thongmunee et al 2011 carried out experimental study and dem simulation of the push up load tests where sand plugs inside steel pipe piles were pushed upwards using a rigid platen test results showed that the push up force increased significantly with increasing aspect ratio and sand relative density li et al 2019 simulated the sand plug behavior during the pile jacking process remarkable stress concentration was observed at the lower part of the pile where the soil plug was highly compacted this phenomenon has been explained by lehane and randolph 2002 that the high vertical stress acting at the base of soil plug would lead to large radial stresses since the sand was confined also liu et al 2019 found that most of the plug resistance was mobilized at the lower 2 3 diameters of the pile and the ratio of base resistance including annular resistance and plug resistance to total resistance increased with increasing pile diameter wang and yin 2020 conducted 2d dem simulation of the installation operation and failure process of caisson foundation it showed that a caisson foundation with a higher m dh homogenous moment to horizontal load ratio would fail at much lower horizontal displacement or rotational angle in this paper a systematic analysis of the plugging effect of open ended pile is conducted using dem several parameters like pile installation method pile geometry and soil density have been considered during the numerical modelling of pile penetration process the main work of this paper can be summarized as follows first the sample generation and parameter calibration process are provided then the model setup and pile installation process are introduced afterwards numerical results are presented to characterize the influence of different macroscopic parameters on the plugging effect and reveal the corresponding microscopic response 2 dem simulation process the particle flow code in two dimensions pfc2d is applied in this study though the 3d installation problem is simplified as plane strain existing studies have proven its high efficiency and satisfactory performance in simulating the pile installation response duan et al 2018 li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in pfc2d particles are simplified as rigid disks the basic response of particle assembly obeys the force displacement law and the newton s second law which are applied to the interactions among particles and the overall constitutive behavior of the model is associated with simple constitutive laws among particle contacts itasca 2014 2 1 sample preparation method in dem simulation generating a homogeneous assembly that has a reasonable stress gradient with depth is fundamental the commonly used sample generation methods include the radius expansion method cundall and strack 1979 the fixed point method katsuki et al 1989 the compression method jiang et al 2003 and methods evolved from the previous three lai et al 2014 rojek et al 2013 however inconsistencies may arise when it comes to engineering scale simulations using the tradition methods for pile installation simulation a very large sample size is required to eliminate the boundary effects ciantia et al 2017 this large sample size will desperately lower the sample generation efficiency and induce sample inhomogeneity during the equilibrium process lai et al 2014 jiang et al 2003 recently ciantia et al 2017 2018 proposed the periodic cell replication method pcrm which could produce a large and homogeneous sample in acceptable time range while matching a desirable particle size distribution psd the main idea of pcrm is to choose relatively small representative element volume rev called cell as the building block for a large sample the cell is first compacted and equilibrated to the required state under periodic boundary condition and then replicated in space to achieve the final size since the cells are already in an equilibrated state much less time is needed to re equilibrate the large sample than using the conventional methods inspired by ciantia s idea the authors take advantage of the brick component that comes with pfc software the theory behind brick is almost the same as cell and a detailed description is provided in pfc manual itasca 2014 the main procedures of the sample generation method in this paper are illustrated in fig 1 and summarized as follows 1 determine rev by checking the trend of porosity stress state and coordination number with varying sample size determine the input parameters of rev 2 compact the rev sample under a stress state that the effective vertical stress corresponds to that in the foundation sample and the stress ratio of effective horizontal stress to effective vertical stress equals the target k 0 3 once the sample is in equilibrium it is transferred to a brick using periodic boundary then copy the brick several times in horizontal and vertical directions to achieve the target sample size 4 zero the contact force and particle velocity field of the large sample and activate gravity 5 cycle the sample to the target unbalanced force ratio under normal boundary condition 2 2 construction of foundation sample uwa superfine silica sf sand is a sub rounded to sub angular sand that has been widely investigated in geotechnical research chow et al 2018 2019 henke and bienen 2013 lehane and liu 2012 some of its physical properties are presented in table 1 many researchers have pointed out the importance of particle size distribution psd to soil mechanical responses ciantia et al 2017 2018 to meet both the computational efficiency and numerical accuracy a discrete analogue of uwa sand was modelled by matching the same psd trend but scaled by a factor of 15 as presented in fig 2 in dem sand is usually simulated as discs or spheres though convenient for modelling this simplification of regular sand shape may lead to unrealistically large particle rotations and underestimation of the soil strength jiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 to address this deficiency several scholars inhibited particle rotation to mimic the rotational resistance that exists among non disc non sphere particles arroyo et al 2011 butlanska et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 even though satisfactory macroscale responses could be realized by restricting particle rotation its performance in microscale simulation like particle movements is still open to question zhang et al 2015 meanwhile zhang et al 2015 and zhang et al 2019 have recommended the application of rolling resistance contact models hence the built in rolling resistance linear model in pfc2d is applied in this paper the rolling resistance contact model provided in pfc is a linear based model that incorporates a torque acting on the contacting pieces to counteract rolling motion detailed descriptions of the model theory and properties are available in pfc manual itasca 2014 before the modelling work micro mechanical parameters and contact model parameters should be calibrated based on the known macro mechanical responses in this study calibration starts with the determination of rev size ciantia et al 2017 2018 suggested that the rev size should be as small as possible to eliminate computation cost but large enough to represent the sample behavior since there is no standard for selecting the rev size the safest approach is by trial and error shear tests were performed to determine rev by observing the change of porosity stress state and coordination number with varying sample size which produced a rev size of 4958 in this study then numerical biaxial tests were performed to calibrate the input model parameters based on indoor tests results chow et al 2019 it s recommended that relative density d r instead of porosity should be used in dem to represent the sample packing state salot et al 2009 to achieve the expected d r the corresponding porosity value is first calculated using eq 1 then the required porosity is obtained by modifying the friction parameters 1 d r n max n 1 n min n max n min 1 n based on the above procedures comparisons of the numerical results and experimental results based on stress and strain response are presented in fig 3 the deviatoric stress q is defined by eq 2 and the axial strain ε a is the strain along the y direction the stress and strain response of the numerical sample is basically consistent with the measured data however deficiency still exists especially at the initial part where the stiffness response could be improved by increasing the stiffness of particles and contacts but at the cost of calculation time to further validate the numerical model the peak and critical friction angles are plotted in fig 4 the mean effective stress is defined by eq 3 the calculation results indicate a critical state friction angle of 32 a peak state friction angle of 34 for loose sand and a peak state friction angle of 39 for dense sand the overall numerical results are in good accordance with the experiment data from chow et al 2019 which suggests that the numerical sample could basically capture the behavior of both dense and loose sand the input parameters of the numerical model are listed in table 2 2 q σ y σ x 3 p σ x σ y 2 where σ x and σ y are stress values along x and y directions since the rev size and model input parameters have been determined the next step is to build the brick component two rev samples with different initial friction coefficients were compressed under a vertical stress of 300 kpa and a horizontal stress of 150 kpa under normal boundary conditions and then transferred to the periodic boundaries this produced a dense brick with d r around 85 and a loose brick with d r around 25 then the dense brick and loose brick were copied several times in space to obtain the dense and loose foundation samples which were then cycled to equilibrium under a gravitational acceleration of 10g at last a total number of 356 976 particles was created for both foundation samples the typical computation time including brick and foundation generation took around 24 h on a pc 32 core processor 3 50 ghz while it may take around one week to generate such a sample using conventional methods the timestep dt during model equilibrium was in the range of 8 5e 7 3 9e 6 s the setup of the dense foundation sample with a height around 1 3 m and width around 1 56 m is presented in fig 5 the contact force chain distributes vertically and its magnitude increases with depth which is consistent with the field stress state since the model is in a gravitational acceleration of 10g it could reflect the characteristic of a field foundation with 13 m depth to further prove the model validity stress state and porosity of the soil sample are extracted using the measurement ciricle component in pfc2d li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 as shown in fig 6 both the horizontal and vertical stresses increase linearly with depth the vertical stress value could be back calculated using a bulk uint weight of 2100 kg m3 the distributions of porosity and initial lateral stress coefficient k 0 are basically stable the relative large k 0 value at shallow depth may be the result of disturbance at the top boundary and it is in the acceptable range an average porosity of 0 156 and k 0 of 0 41 could be provided corresponding to the characteristics of a relative dense sample the average porosity and k 0 for the loose sample are 0 17 and 0 46 2 3 simulation of pile installation after sample generation three open ended piles with d i t ranging from 5 to 25 were modelled the first pile with a prototype inside diameter d i of 500 mm and wall thickness t of 100 mm is representative of a concrete pipe pile while the pile with prototype d i of 1 m and d i t of 25 is close to the typical pile configuration used in offshore foundations randolph et al 2005 yang et al 2015 the way that pile penetrates into soil also has a big influence on the plug behavior normally pile jacking is simulated as a displacement controlled quasi static process while the dynamic installation methods are modelled as force controlled vibratory driving is always simulated by applying a dynamic force and excitation frequency on the pile head and impact driving is modelled by discrete hammer blows henke and grabe 2008 labenski and moormann 2016 to simplify the simulation of complex dynamic installation pile installation is simulated as displacement controlled which is achieved by carefully analyzing the pile displacement characteristics of several dynamic installed pile heins et al 2016 2017 zhang et al 2019 the displacement paths for the three installation methods are presented in fig 7 the jacked piles were installed at a constant rate of 2 m s 1 6 10 4 mm dt which is close to the penetration velocity in zhang et al 2015 the dynamic installed piles were first jacked to the depth of 200 mm to minimize the large oscillation close to the surface boundary then the vibratory piles were driven with a frequency of 500 hz and displacement magnitude of 6 mm and the impact piles were installed in a sinusoidal motion with a frequency of 100 hz and net displacement of 18 mm note that the driving frequency has been enlarged around 6 times to save computation time all piles penetrated to a depth of 600 mm corresponding to a prototype embedment depth of 6 m bolton et al 1999 reported that there has no apparent side boundary effect when the s b ratio exceeds 10 where s is the distance from the nearest wall boundary to the location of penetration and b is the cone diameter for pile with d i of 100 mm the s b ratio is about 7 5 however the lateral boundary effect here is proven to be minimal which is shown in later analysis in all eighteen installation tests have been simulated the test id covers two parts the pile test t and the test features including soil density d i t ratio and installation method for example td5j refers to a pile installed in a dense sample with d i t ratio of 5 and by means of jacking while tl10i represents the test for a pile with d i t ratio of 10 impact driven into a loose sample detailed information of the test feature is presented in table 3 3 simulation results and analysis 3 1 soil displacement pattern soil deformation pattern during the penetration process is first presented in fig 8 fig 8 a c show the development of soil deformation at different penetration depth for td5j at shallow penetration around 200 mm soil deformation mainly concentrates around the pile shaft and pile tip as pile penetrates deeper an obvious downward deflection for soil mass under the pile occurs and the gap between the soil plug and ground surface is larger at the final penetration depth of 600 mm a cone shape zone forms beneath the pile which is similar to the nose cone mentioned by white 2002 under the nose cone notable deformation occurs resembling the deformation pattern of closed ended pile for soil mass inside the plug upward deflection can be observed this is due to the drag of shaft friction a similar soil deformation pattern can be observed in loose sand as shown in fig 8 d for larger diameter jacked pile as shown in fig 8 e soil deformation pattern is basically the same though with less severe shearing along the pile shaft and deflection beneath the pile tip the soil displacement pattern in vibratory driven piles fig 8 f is similar to that in jacked piles with more severe distortion beneath the pile tip for the impact driven piles namely td5i the plug length is almost the same as the penetration depth though slight deformation occurs below the pile it is more likely to be the influence of tip compression rather than the formation of soil plug the numerical results in fig 8 are basically consistent with related research de nicola and randolph 1997 henke et al 2008 that plug formation is more likely to occur in jacked piles rather that in dynamic installed piles 3 2 plugging effect index to characterize the plug behavior in a more quantitative way two widely used plugging effect indexes namely plr and ifr are introduced the values of plr and ifr are defined by 4 p l r h h 5 i f r δ h δ h where h is the plug length corresponding to a penetration depth of h while h and h are their incremental values when plr 1 or ifr 1 pile penetrates in the fully unplugged mode when plr 1 or 0 ifr 1 pile penetrates in the partially plugged mode when 0 plr 1 or ifr 1 pile penetrates in the fully plugged mode and the plug length keeps stable however the plr value will keep decreasing as the penetration depth keeps increasing it s believed that ifr is a better indicator of plugging effect than plr though it s hard to measure in field test paik et al 2003 paikowsky 1990 to measure the plug length and ifr values in numerical tests the positions of several monitoring points which initially locate at the ground surface are recorded during pile installation as shown in fig 9 it is clear that at shallow penetration 200 mm plug length equals penetration depth regardless of pile geometry installation methods and soil density then the groth rate of plug length for td5j and tl5j slows down and the soil plug seems to stop growing at the penetration depth of 450 mm and the final soil plug for the loose case is relatively longer for other jacked piles with larger diameters the plug length keeps increasing and does not reach a stable value at the end of penetration since the influence of density is not obvious at this stage the plug lengths for both dense and loose sand have been averaged for t10j and t25j for the ease of illustration this technique also applies for vibratory case and impact case for impact driven piles the plug length keeps almost the same as the penetration depth the above analysis shows that larger penetration smaller pile diameter lower d i t ratio and higher soil density all seem to promote plug formation fig 10 a shows the ifr development for piles with d i t of 5 for jacked piles ifr value is close to 1 during the initial 100 mm penetration while ifr value for loose sand is even larger than 1 this maybe the result of installation disturbance at shallow penetration then both ifr values show noticeable increase with fluctuation at the penetration depth of 500 mm ifr value for td5j reaches 0 which is an indication of fully plugged mode this state keeps for a further 50 mm penetration and the ifr value increases to around 0 1 at the end of penetration in loose sand ifr value keeps decreasing but never makes it to the fully plugged mode for vibratory driven piles ifr values keep falling with penetration depth and reach around 0 6 at final penetration the ifr developments for impact driven piles are even less noticeable with a slight decrease from 1 to 0 9 for piles with inside diameters of 100 mm and d i t ratios of 10 and 25 the ifr development trends are basically the same though with higher ifr values based on the above results it can be concluded that installation method and pile diameter plays the major role in plug formation while the influence of soil density and wall thickness is not that obvious 3 3 porosity distribution the porosity distribution can provide a different perspective of the soil displacement pattern fig 11 presents the porosity distributions at the center s1 inside s2 and outside s3 sections for piles with d i t of 5 at the penetration depth of 600 mm detailed information for the setup of monitoring sections can be found in fig 5 in fig 11 the horizontal dash line indicates the depth of pile tip and the two vertical dash lines represents the initial porosities for dense and loose sand respectively at center sections as shown in fig 11 a the top part of the soil plug in jacked piles is relatively loose with porosity values larger than the initial values then the porosity value keeps decreasing along the soil plug and reaches the minimum value at the pile tip under the pile tip the porosity values increase rapidly and at the distance about two d i below the pile tip the soil mass recovers to the initial compact state this trend is almost the same for both the dense and loose sand for the dynamic installed piles the porosity distribution is similar to that in jacked piles though with less compaction and more fluctuation similar porosity distribution in impact driven piles has been reported by labenski and moormann 2016 the porosity distribution trends at inside sections are basically the same as that at the center sections for the porosity distributions at outside sections a more severe installation disturbance occurs for jacked pile while the influence on impact driven pile is the less noticeable the porosity distribution trends for piles with larger diameters are basically the same the difference is that the soil plug compaction is less severe at the bottom part for larger piles it can also be concluded that for jacked piles the densest part of the soil plug locates around the pile tip while for the dynamic installed piles the densest part locates in the vicinity below the pile tip 3 4 stress state in the soil plug fig 12 presents the horizontal stress distributions for piles with d i t of 5 at penetration depth of 600 mm the distribution of initial horizontal stress is also attached as a reference inside the soil plug the horizontal stress distributions follow similar trends regardless of installation method all the stress values are minimal at the top part and increases rapidly to the pile tip below the pile tip the horizontal stress recovers to the initial stress state quickly the above trends are similar to many reported cases liu et al 2019 lüking and kempfert 2013 also the magnitude of horizontal stress value in the numerical tests is similar to that reported by henke and grabe 2008 that the horizontal stress level inside the jacked pile is the highest while lowest for impact driven pile however the stress state at the outside pile section is quite different the different stress state inside and outside the pile may be the result of plugging effect an interesting point is that the maximum horizontal stress inside the pile locates at the pile tip for jacked pile while it is below the pile tip for dynamic installed piles this is in accordance with the location of minimum porosity for piles with larger diameters the distribution trend is basically the same while the horizontal stress develops to a higher length along the soil plug though with smaller maximum stress value 3 5 pile installation resistance for open ended pile penetration resistance q t includes base resistance on the annulus of pile wall q b shaft friction on the inside q si and outside q so wall as long as the inside shaft resistance is greater than the base resistance of the soil plug the pile will penetrate in a fully plugged mode randolph et al 1991 white 2002 the developments of the three components of installation resistance against penetration depth are depicted in figs 13 15 for jacked piles with d i t of 5 the base resistance shows a remarkable linear increase compared with the minimal shaft resistance at initial penetration at the penetration depth around 300 mm base resistance begins to fluctuate around 90 kn until the penetration depth of 500 mm where another round of rapid increase initiates one the other hand the developments of shaft resistances present an idealized exponential increase as reported by randolph et al 1994 and white 2002 the inside shaft resistance exceeds the outside shaft resistance at the penetration depth around 200 mm which may indicate that the plugging effect begins to take effect at the penetration depth of 500 mm the inside shaft resistance reaches a stable value and after a further 50 mm penetration it begins to drop until the end of penetration for all the resistance components resistance values in dense sand are relatively larger than that in loose sand especially for the inside shaft capacity it is interesting to find that the development of inside shaft resistance is highly consistent with the ifr development taking the dense sand for example when the pile penetrates from 200 mm to 400 mm ifr value experiences three main fluctuations and similar trends can be traced for q si as ifr value falls to zero which means the pile begins to penetrate in a fully plugged mode the inside shaft resistance seems to accumulate in a much slower rate as soil mass stops coming inside the pile with further penetration ifr values decreases which indicates the failure of the soil plug and this leads to the decrease of inside shaft resistance the fluctuations of ifr value and inside shaft friction have been widely reported as the result of repeated formation and destruction of soil plug or soil arch hight 1996 liu et al 2019 paikowsky 1989 for jacked piles with higher d i t values the trends of resistance development are basically the same and the inside shaft resistance gradually takes the dominance for vibratory driven piles the development of installation resistance is similar to that for jacked piles though with more fluctuations and smaller resistance value it is worth noting that the development of inside resistance is also consistent with the ifr development for impact driven piles all the resistance components increase in a relatively linear mode though with dramatic fluctuations the base resistance is the most dominant and it decreases with increasing d i t also the inside resistance is slightly higher than the outside resistance this trend is similar to the findings of labenski and moormann 2016 to make a quantitative analysis of installation resistance the overall installation resistances q t as well as the resistance components are summarized in table 4 to minimize resistance fluctuations resistance values for jacked piles are averaged over the final 10 mm penetration while for dynamic installed piles over the final 20 mm penetration generally jacked piles produce the largest penetration resistance while impact driven piles produce the lowest resistance the magnitudes of penetration resistance for different installation methods are basically consistent with engineering experience and the model test results from henke and britta 2014 what s more the numerical results indicate that from jacked piles to impact driven piles the proportion of base resistance gradually increase while the proportion of plug resistance becomes less noticeable for example for td5j q b q t is 36 4 and q si q t is 43 8 while for the same pile driven by impact namely td5i the base resistance takes up 61 7 while the proportion of inside shaft resistance is only 16 7 3 6 microscopic analysis the above analysis provides basic knowledge about the influence of pile installation methods pile geometry and soil density on the plugging effect however the mechanism behind the soil plug formation and plug resistance mobilization is yet to be uncovered in this section a microscopic view is elaborated 3 6 1 particle displacement pattern as briefly described in section 3 2 the positions of a series of particles have been tracked during the pile installation process the setup of monitoring points inside the soil plug is shown in fig 16 note that for particles locate 150 mm away from the chamber wall which are not presented in fig 16 the maximum displacement value during pile installation is less than 2 mm indicating the negligible influence of lateral boundary effect fig 17 shows the trajectories of particle movements relative to the pile tip the points represent the relative positions of particles to the pile tip at each 20 mm penetration except for the first two points in jacked piles which represent a penetration depth of 100 mm for td5j the movements of top particles are less influenced by pile installation due to the weak plugging effect for the middle particles an obvious outward inward outward movement pattern can be observed when the relative distance is around one d i remarkable horizontal movements occur at the end of penetration the middle particles which initially locate at 400 mm below the pile are pushed to the distance around one d i below the pile this maybe an indication of plug formation that prevents the inflow of soil mass this plugged mode is more obvious for the bottom particles initially located at the depth of 600 mm and the outward moving trend starts at a relative distance around three times d i the different particle movements at different depth below the pile tip certainly reflects the plug formation process for td5j while the particle behavior is a little different in loose sand for tl5j the outward movement for the top particles are minimal compared to that in the dense sand this is due to the less dilative behavior of loose sand for the middle particles a slight inside movement first occurs then a similar outward inward outward movement pattern can be observed though less horizontal displacement develops for the bottom particles the movement trend is basically similar to that in dense sand though with less horizontal displacement based on the pervious results like plug development porosity and stress distribution td5j and tl5j seem to exhibit similar plug behavior however it is believed that particles in dense and loose sand take different path to achieve the similar macroscopic response a brief explanation for the plug formation process is proposed as follows at initial penetration soil mass underneath the pile tip undergoes large deformation which leads to shear failure and dilation for soil approaching this area as soil mass passes this area and flows into the pile large horizontal compression occurs around the pile tip as the pile penetrates deeper high friction accumulates around the pile shaft and propagates to the center section which produces resistance to the inflow of soil mass though not totally restrains it with further penetration a dense zone forms at the bottom of the pile and extends below the pile tip this dense zone stops further inflow of soil mass thus leading to the plugged mode at this stage shear zone develops at the surface of the dense zone and remarkable dilation occurs as soil mass approaches some particles will be attached to the dense zone especially in loose sand and before the fully plugged mode it assumes that as pile penetrates in dense sand particles first enter the dilation zone with outwards movements then the soil particles move inward as dilation effect weakens as particles approach the dense zone they flow out along its surface for the relatively loose sand the less dilative behavior leads to smaller horizontal displacement this is in accordance with the macroscopic response that the magnitude of compaction and stress is weaker in loose sand the above theory could also explain the particle movements for td10j and td 25j soil particles also experience dilation and contraction as pile approaches it seems that a dense zone has developed below the pile at the end of penetration however it is not dense enough to plug the pile and soil mass enters in a lower speed for the dynamic installed piles similar dilation and contraction process occurs however no soil particle has been pushed outside the pile the different particle movements for td5v and td5i may be the results of different installation disturbance as vibratory driven piles will lead to cyclic shearing and the impact driven method produce strong disturbance close to the pile tip it suggests that the plugging effect in dynamic installed piles is not only influenced by the installation method but also the input driving energy 3 6 2 contact force chain in granular assemblies external loads are carried by particle contacts which forms chain like paths that transfer loads along its trajectories fig 18 a c illustrate the development of contact force at different penetration depths for td5j note that a black bar and a red bar have been added which represent the plug length and active plug length respectively the active plug length indicates the soil plug section where most of the load transfer occurs de nicola and randolph 1997 paik and lee 1993 at the initial penetration of 200 mm contact force chains develop horizontally inside the soil plug which is in stark contrast with the vertical contact force distribution at initial stress state while contacts that carry larger loads only exist at the pile tip with further penetration contact force chains propagate upwards at 600 mm penetration the active plug length is around 5d i and the contact force chains that carry larger loads mainly concentrate in the bottom 2d i section and around 2 5d i below the pile tip this is in consistent with the dramatic stress concentration at the bottom part for large diameter pile and the dynamic installed piles the active plug length is larger however the contact force chains seem to be sparser and thinner especially for the impact driven piles it can be concluded that as soil mass enters the pile upward load is transferred to horizontal force via the reorientation of particle contacts the load transfer zone propagates upwards with further penetration though it s always smaller than the plug length also most of the load transfer occurs at the bottom part of the soil plug and extends below for pile with larger diameter and installed using dynamic method the load transfer range is getting larger however with lower load magnitude it s believed that load transfer is more effective in piles with stronger plugging effect 3 6 3 stress orientation in principal load transfer through contact force chains is the reflection of stress redistribution under external disturbance it has been widely reported that the direction of force chains is close to the trajectory of maximum principal stress paikowsky 1989 1990 rothenburg and bathurst 1989 to validate the connection between force chain distribution and stress orientation the distribution of stress orientation inside and below the soil plug is presented in fig 19 the orientation angle of the maximum principal stress θ is calculated as 6 θ 1 2 arctan 2 σ x y σ x x σ y y where σ x x σ y y and σ x y represent the average stress tensor in the horizontal vertical and tangential direction inside a measurement circle the positive angle indicates a clockwise rotation of the maximum principal stress from the horizontal or vertical direction depending on the ratio of horizontal stress to vertical stress the distribution of maximum principal stress orientation can be roughly divided into four zones the zone at the top is the disturbed zone with random stress rotation due to severe shearing and disturbance this can be related to the sparse and weak contact force chain at the top of the soil plug note that for the convenience of clarification the initial depth is not from the ground surface thus the disturbed zone in some piles are not shown in fig 19 below the disturbed zone to the pile tip is the load transfer zone i in this zone the maximum principal stress rotates to the pile shaft and this rotation is weaker with closer distance to the centerline some dotted red lines are superimposed on to indicate the possible load transfer path which is similar to the compression arch proposed by lüking and kempfert 2013 however difference still exists especially at the lower part this is because that the tip compression will cause very high stress rotation and rapid increase in horizontal extension for piles with stronger plugging effect the tip influence will be less influential right below the plug bottom is the transition zone where the stress orientation is similar to that at the bottom of the load transfer zone i though with less rotation it can be seen that the transition zone in dynamic installed piles is relatively larger this may be the result of stronger tip influence from dynamic installation following the transition zone is the load transfer zone ii where the maximum principal stress rotates to the center of the pile the stress trajectory at deeper location gradually recovers to the initial vertical state so it is not further presented the trajectories of the maximum principal stress in the above four zones are basically consistent with the distribution of contact force chain 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of plug resistance development soil plug formation has a great impact on the stress state inside the pile as shown in fig 13 c the plug resistance namely the inside shaft resistance takes up around 64 of the total penetration resistance while the proportion of outside shaft resistance is only around 20 thus it is necessary to understand the mechanism of plug resistance development based on the development of penetration resistance and the stress orientation inside the soil plug the developments of plug resistance at different plugging conditions are illustrated in fig 20 during shallow penetration soil mass is first disturbed by the tip compression and shaft resistance leading to the reorientation of particle contacts and principal stress close to the pile soil interface with further penetration the influence zone of shaft resistance accumulates and propagates towards the center however for dynamic installed piles this accumulation process is hard to achieve and the influence zone is limited for piles with weak plugging effect with ifr 1 soil elements close to the pile shaft will experience similar stress and strain paths as the pile tip approaches and passes leading to similar inside and outside shaft resistance this can be verified by the development of shaft resistance for dynamic installed piles as shown in figs 14 and 15 as plugging effect strengthens with 0 ifr 1 the magnitude of load transfer inside the pile exceeds that outside the pile shaft however the influence zone is still limited as pile penetrates in the fully plugged mode with ifr 0 the soil plug works as a whole with the plug resistance fully mobilized 4 2 characterization of soil plug formation at the end of penetration for td5j and tl5j a dense zone with cone shape forms beneath the pile deflecting the around soil mass like a close ended pile a brief explanation for the formation process of the dense zone has been provided in section 3 6 1 in this section the characterization of soil plug formation is further illustrated as shown in fig 21 the soil plug could be roughly divided into three zones zone i is the densest zone that would keep relatively still to the pile and stop the inflow of soil particles this zone locates at the bottom of the pile and stretches out to around 1 4 d i zone ii is the transition zone between zone i and zone iii which is the shear zone as the pile with soil cone penetrates soil particle will first enter the shear zone where marked dilation will push the particles away then with further penetration some particles will enter the transition zone where the dilation effect weakens however it is hard for particles entering the dense zone normally they just flow out along its surface 5 conclusions in this paper the plugging effect of open ended pile installed in sand has been thoroughly analyzed using two dimensional discrete element method a series of numerical pile penetration tests are performed at 10g to simulate the deep penetration problem and the influence of soil density pile geometry and installation method has been considered the main conclusions are as follows based on the soil displacement pattern clear shear bands develop around the pile shaft a cone shaped zone with length around one diameter exists beneath the small diameter jacked piles the cone shaped zone deflects soil mass around the pile resembling the soil deformation pattern of a closed ended pile according to the development of ifr plug formation seems to be more sensitive to pile diameter and installation method than soil density and wall thickness for piles with larger diameter and installed by dynamic methods the plugging effect are weaker also stronger plugging effect will produce denser soil plug especially at the lower part where remarkable stress concentration occurs as to pile penetration resistance jacked piles produce the largest penetration resistance while impact driven piles produce the lowest resistance for piles with larger d i t the proportion of base resistance tends to fall while the proportion of inside shaft resistance will increase an idealized exponential trend for the growth of shaft resistance can be observed especially for the inside shaft resistance which is highly consistent with the fluctuation of ifr development based on the microscopic analysis of soil particle movements contact force chain distribution and principal stress orientation it suggests the plug formation is promoted by the accumulation of inside shaft resistance in the macroscopic scale and by the reorientation of particle contacts and principal stress in the microscopic scale at last the mobilization of plug resistance magnitude is related to ifr value and a simple model is proposed to characterize the formation of soil plug which could be divided into dense zone transition zone and shear zone in this paper the three dimensional pile penetration problem is simplified as plane strain condition though the penetration response could be satisfactorily simulated three dimensional simulation is still necessary also more sophisticated contact models are expected to be applied to simulate the particle breakage phenomenon during pile penetration credit authorship contribution statement lichen li numerical modelling writing original

21162,mechanisms governing the sand plug behavior inside an open ended pile are examined using the discrete element method a series of numerical pile penetration tests have been conducted by considering the influence of soil density pile geometry and installation method a novel sample generation method based on the replication of unit cell is applied to produce a large and homogeneous sample efficiently according to the soil deformation pattern a nose cone with the length about one pile diameter has been observed beneath the small diameter jacked pile at the end of penetration plugging effect is shown to be more prevalent for jacked piles than dynamic installed piles also larger penetration smaller diameter and higher soil density all seem to promote plug formation while the influence of wall thickness is not that obvious this conclusion is later verified by the development of incremental filling ratio ifr and porosity distribution furthermore remarkable stress concentration has been observed at the lower part of the soil plug the development of installation resistance indicates that jacking produces the largest resistance while dynamic installation methods ease pile penetration further analysis based on particle movements contact force chain distribution and stress orientation provides a micromechanical perspective of the plug behavior finally the plug resistance mobilization process at different plugging conditions and the formation process for soil plug are illustrated keywords plugging effect open ended pile dem installation resistance load transfer 1 introduction open ended piles are frequently used as foundations for both onshore and offshore structures during the installation process part of the soil mass underneath will be pushed into the pile forming a soil column called soil plug paikowsky 1989 randolph et al 1991 the interplay of soil plug and pile which is commonly referred to as plugging effect poses a great influence on the pile installation resistance and bearing capacity thus leading to the distinctive characteristics of open ended piles compared to that of equivalent close ended piles gavin and lehane 2003 paik et al 2003 the plugging effect of open ended pile has been widely discussed in literatures many researchers have reported that the soil plug state is highly dependent on the installation method pile geometry and soil condition henke et al 2008 henke and bienen 2013 lehane and gavin 2001 hight 1996 proposed that a pile would plug when the soil plug length exceeded a critical height the value of which was influenced by the pile diameter and soil density it has also been reported that the maximum pile diameter for plug formation was 1 5m lüking and kempfert 2013 jardine et al 2005 de nicola and randolph 1997 found that the plugging effect was more remarkable in jacked piles than in driven piles and increasing sand density may lead to plug growth in driven piles but not in jacked piles furthermore henke et al 2008 2012 2014 performed systematic analysis of the influence of pile installation methods via field tests centrifuge experiments and numerical modelling the research pointed out that for dynamic installation methods the inertia of the soil mass inside the pile prevented the formation of soil plug while for jacked piles high horizontal stress could accumulate thus facilitating plug formation ko et al 2016 simulated the driving process of open ended piles in sand using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel approach parametric analysis revealed that the plugging effect was most influenced by driving energy followed by pile diameter and pile embedment depth based on centrifuge tests wang et al 2018 found that during the loading process of open ended pile the resistance components would take effect in the order of shaft resistance annular resistance and plug resistance also the ultimate bearing capacity was reached synchronously with the mobilization of the maximum plug resistance li et al 2019 proposed an innovative pile foundation design by setting up restriction plates inside the pipe pile centrifuge tests showed that the restriction plates could promote plug formation thus leading to higher bearing capacity compared to that of the conventional open ended pile however the installation resistance hammer blow counts was not provided to better predict the bearing capacity of open ended pile some of the acknowledged design methods such as hku 12 yu and yang 2012 and uwa 5 lehane et al 2005 have incorporated the plugging effect into the design guidelines by introducing correction factors related to plug length change e g plug length ratio plr incremental filling ratio ifr final filling ratio ffr however the complexity of plug behavior has made the above parameters hard to obtain and interpret in field tests meanwhile the publication of more reliable database lehane et al 2017 han et al 2019 and new design methods labenski et al 2016b lehane et al 2020 demonstrates that our knowledge of plugging effect is still advancing the above and related researches mainly focus on plug behavior at macro level while microscopic investigation on plugging effect has been less favored regarding this the discrete element method dem provides a convenient and comprehensive alternative to investigate both the macroscopic and microscopic behavior of granular soil jiang et al 2020 o sullivan 2011 zhou et al 2010 conducted model tests and dem simulations of open ended piles jacking into sands and proposed to describe the soil plug formation in three stages initial stage formation of active arch and formation of passive arch thongmunee et al 2011 carried out experimental study and dem simulation of the push up load tests where sand plugs inside steel pipe piles were pushed upwards using a rigid platen test results showed that the push up force increased significantly with increasing aspect ratio and sand relative density li et al 2019 simulated the sand plug behavior during the pile jacking process remarkable stress concentration was observed at the lower part of the pile where the soil plug was highly compacted this phenomenon has been explained by lehane and randolph 2002 that the high vertical stress acting at the base of soil plug would lead to large radial stresses since the sand was confined also liu et al 2019 found that most of the plug resistance was mobilized at the lower 2 3 diameters of the pile and the ratio of base resistance including annular resistance and plug resistance to total resistance increased with increasing pile diameter wang and yin 2020 conducted 2d dem simulation of the installation operation and failure process of caisson foundation it showed that a caisson foundation with a higher m dh homogenous moment to horizontal load ratio would fail at much lower horizontal displacement or rotational angle in this paper a systematic analysis of the plugging effect of open ended pile is conducted using dem several parameters like pile installation method pile geometry and soil density have been considered during the numerical modelling of pile penetration process the main work of this paper can be summarized as follows first the sample generation and parameter calibration process are provided then the model setup and pile installation process are introduced afterwards numerical results are presented to characterize the influence of different macroscopic parameters on the plugging effect and reveal the corresponding microscopic response 2 dem simulation process the particle flow code in two dimensions pfc2d is applied in this study though the 3d installation problem is simplified as plane strain existing studies have proven its high efficiency and satisfactory performance in simulating the pile installation response duan et al 2018 li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in pfc2d particles are simplified as rigid disks the basic response of particle assembly obeys the force displacement law and the newton s second law which are applied to the interactions among particles and the overall constitutive behavior of the model is associated with simple constitutive laws among particle contacts itasca 2014 2 1 sample preparation method in dem simulation generating a homogeneous assembly that has a reasonable stress gradient with depth is fundamental the commonly used sample generation methods include the radius expansion method cundall and strack 1979 the fixed point method katsuki et al 1989 the compression method jiang et al 2003 and methods evolved from the previous three lai et al 2014 rojek et al 2013 however inconsistencies may arise when it comes to engineering scale simulations using the tradition methods for pile installation simulation a very large sample size is required to eliminate the boundary effects ciantia et al 2017 this large sample size will desperately lower the sample generation efficiency and induce sample inhomogeneity during the equilibrium process lai et al 2014 jiang et al 2003 recently ciantia et al 2017 2018 proposed the periodic cell replication method pcrm which could produce a large and homogeneous sample in acceptable time range while matching a desirable particle size distribution psd the main idea of pcrm is to choose relatively small representative element volume rev called cell as the building block for a large sample the cell is first compacted and equilibrated to the required state under periodic boundary condition and then replicated in space to achieve the final size since the cells are already in an equilibrated state much less time is needed to re equilibrate the large sample than using the conventional methods inspired by ciantia s idea the authors take advantage of the brick component that comes with pfc software the theory behind brick is almost the same as cell and a detailed description is provided in pfc manual itasca 2014 the main procedures of the sample generation method in this paper are illustrated in fig 1 and summarized as follows 1 determine rev by checking the trend of porosity stress state and coordination number with varying sample size determine the input parameters of rev 2 compact the rev sample under a stress state that the effective vertical stress corresponds to that in the foundation sample and the stress ratio of effective horizontal stress to effective vertical stress equals the target k 0 3 once the sample is in equilibrium it is transferred to a brick using periodic boundary then copy the brick several times in horizontal and vertical directions to achieve the target sample size 4 zero the contact force and particle velocity field of the large sample and activate gravity 5 cycle the sample to the target unbalanced force ratio under normal boundary condition 2 2 construction of foundation sample uwa superfine silica sf sand is a sub rounded to sub angular sand that has been widely investigated in geotechnical research chow et al 2018 2019 henke and bienen 2013 lehane and liu 2012 some of its physical properties are presented in table 1 many researchers have pointed out the importance of particle size distribution psd to soil mechanical responses ciantia et al 2017 2018 to meet both the computational efficiency and numerical accuracy a discrete analogue of uwa sand was modelled by matching the same psd trend but scaled by a factor of 15 as presented in fig 2 in dem sand is usually simulated as discs or spheres though convenient for modelling this simplification of regular sand shape may lead to unrealistically large particle rotations and underestimation of the soil strength jiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 to address this deficiency several scholars inhibited particle rotation to mimic the rotational resistance that exists among non disc non sphere particles arroyo et al 2011 butlanska et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 even though satisfactory macroscale responses could be realized by restricting particle rotation its performance in microscale simulation like particle movements is still open to question zhang et al 2015 meanwhile zhang et al 2015 and zhang et al 2019 have recommended the application of rolling resistance contact models hence the built in rolling resistance linear model in pfc2d is applied in this paper the rolling resistance contact model provided in pfc is a linear based model that incorporates a torque acting on the contacting pieces to counteract rolling motion detailed descriptions of the model theory and properties are available in pfc manual itasca 2014 before the modelling work micro mechanical parameters and contact model parameters should be calibrated based on the known macro mechanical responses in this study calibration starts with the determination of rev size ciantia et al 2017 2018 suggested that the rev size should be as small as possible to eliminate computation cost but large enough to represent the sample behavior since there is no standard for selecting the rev size the safest approach is by trial and error shear tests were performed to determine rev by observing the change of porosity stress state and coordination number with varying sample size which produced a rev size of 4958 in this study then numerical biaxial tests were performed to calibrate the input model parameters based on indoor tests results chow et al 2019 it s recommended that relative density d r instead of porosity should be used in dem to represent the sample packing state salot et al 2009 to achieve the expected d r the corresponding porosity value is first calculated using eq 1 then the required porosity is obtained by modifying the friction parameters 1 d r n max n 1 n min n max n min 1 n based on the above procedures comparisons of the numerical results and experimental results based on stress and strain response are presented in fig 3 the deviatoric stress q is defined by eq 2 and the axial strain ε a is the strain along the y direction the stress and strain response of the numerical sample is basically consistent with the measured data however deficiency still exists especially at the initial part where the stiffness response could be improved by increasing the stiffness of particles and contacts but at the cost of calculation time to further validate the numerical model the peak and critical friction angles are plotted in fig 4 the mean effective stress is defined by eq 3 the calculation results indicate a critical state friction angle of 32 a peak state friction angle of 34 for loose sand and a peak state friction angle of 39 for dense sand the overall numerical results are in good accordance with the experiment data from chow et al 2019 which suggests that the numerical sample could basically capture the behavior of both dense and loose sand the input parameters of the numerical model are listed in table 2 2 q σ y σ x 3 p σ x σ y 2 where σ x and σ y are stress values along x and y directions since the rev size and model input parameters have been determined the next step is to build the brick component two rev samples with different initial friction coefficients were compressed under a vertical stress of 300 kpa and a horizontal stress of 150 kpa under normal boundary conditions and then transferred to the periodic boundaries this produced a dense brick with d r around 85 and a loose brick with d r around 25 then the dense brick and loose brick were copied several times in space to obtain the dense and loose foundation samples which were then cycled to equilibrium under a gravitational acceleration of 10g at last a total number of 356 976 particles was created for both foundation samples the typical computation time including brick and foundation generation took around 24 h on a pc 32 core processor 3 50 ghz while it may take around one week to generate such a sample using conventional methods the timestep dt during model equilibrium was in the range of 8 5e 7 3 9e 6 s the setup of the dense foundation sample with a height around 1 3 m and width around 1 56 m is presented in fig 5 the contact force chain distributes vertically and its magnitude increases with depth which is consistent with the field stress state since the model is in a gravitational acceleration of 10g it could reflect the characteristic of a field foundation with 13 m depth to further prove the model validity stress state and porosity of the soil sample are extracted using the measurement ciricle component in pfc2d li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 as shown in fig 6 both the horizontal and vertical stresses increase linearly with depth the vertical stress value could be back calculated using a bulk uint weight of 2100 kg m3 the distributions of porosity and initial lateral stress coefficient k 0 are basically stable the relative large k 0 value at shallow depth may be the result of disturbance at the top boundary and it is in the acceptable range an average porosity of 0 156 and k 0 of 0 41 could be provided corresponding to the characteristics of a relative dense sample the average porosity and k 0 for the loose sample are 0 17 and 0 46 2 3 simulation of pile installation after sample generation three open ended piles with d i t ranging from 5 to 25 were modelled the first pile with a prototype inside diameter d i of 500 mm and wall thickness t of 100 mm is representative of a concrete pipe pile while the pile with prototype d i of 1 m and d i t of 25 is close to the typical pile configuration used in offshore foundations randolph et al 2005 yang et al 2015 the way that pile penetrates into soil also has a big influence on the plug behavior normally pile jacking is simulated as a displacement controlled quasi static process while the dynamic installation methods are modelled as force controlled vibratory driving is always simulated by applying a dynamic force and excitation frequency on the pile head and impact driving is modelled by discrete hammer blows henke and grabe 2008 labenski and moormann 2016 to simplify the simulation of complex dynamic installation pile installation is simulated as displacement controlled which is achieved by carefully analyzing the pile displacement characteristics of several dynamic installed pile heins et al 2016 2017 zhang et al 2019 the displacement paths for the three installation methods are presented in fig 7 the jacked piles were installed at a constant rate of 2 m s 1 6 10 4 mm dt which is close to the penetration velocity in zhang et al 2015 the dynamic installed piles were first jacked to the depth of 200 mm to minimize the large oscillation close to the surface boundary then the vibratory piles were driven with a frequency of 500 hz and displacement magnitude of 6 mm and the impact piles were installed in a sinusoidal motion with a frequency of 100 hz and net displacement of 18 mm note that the driving frequency has been enlarged around 6 times to save computation time all piles penetrated to a depth of 600 mm corresponding to a prototype embedment depth of 6 m bolton et al 1999 reported that there has no apparent side boundary effect when the s b ratio exceeds 10 where s is the distance from the nearest wall boundary to the location of penetration and b is the cone diameter for pile with d i of 100 mm the s b ratio is about 7 5 however the lateral boundary effect here is proven to be minimal which is shown in later analysis in all eighteen installation tests have been simulated the test id covers two parts the pile test t and the test features including soil density d i t ratio and installation method for example td5j refers to a pile installed in a dense sample with d i t ratio of 5 and by means of jacking while tl10i represents the test for a pile with d i t ratio of 10 impact driven into a loose sample detailed information of the test feature is presented in table 3 3 simulation results and analysis 3 1 soil displacement pattern soil deformation pattern during the penetration process is first presented in fig 8 fig 8 a c show the development of soil deformation at different penetration depth for td5j at shallow penetration around 200 mm soil deformation mainly concentrates around the pile shaft and pile tip as pile penetrates deeper an obvious downward deflection for soil mass under the pile occurs and the gap between the soil plug and ground surface is larger at the final penetration depth of 600 mm a cone shape zone forms beneath the pile which is similar to the nose cone mentioned by white 2002 under the nose cone notable deformation occurs resembling the deformation pattern of closed ended pile for soil mass inside the plug upward deflection can be observed this is due to the drag of shaft friction a similar soil deformation pattern can be observed in loose sand as shown in fig 8 d for larger diameter jacked pile as shown in fig 8 e soil deformation pattern is basically the same though with less severe shearing along the pile shaft and deflection beneath the pile tip the soil displacement pattern in vibratory driven piles fig 8 f is similar to that in jacked piles with more severe distortion beneath the pile tip for the impact driven piles namely td5i the plug length is almost the same as the penetration depth though slight deformation occurs below the pile it is more likely to be the influence of tip compression rather than the formation of soil plug the numerical results in fig 8 are basically consistent with related research de nicola and randolph 1997 henke et al 2008 that plug formation is more likely to occur in jacked piles rather that in dynamic installed piles 3 2 plugging effect index to characterize the plug behavior in a more quantitative way two widely used plugging effect indexes namely plr and ifr are introduced the values of plr and ifr are defined by 4 p l r h h 5 i f r δ h δ h where h is the plug length corresponding to a penetration depth of h while h and h are their incremental values when plr 1 or ifr 1 pile penetrates in the fully unplugged mode when plr 1 or 0 ifr 1 pile penetrates in the partially plugged mode when 0 plr 1 or ifr 1 pile penetrates in the fully plugged mode and the plug length keeps stable however the plr value will keep decreasing as the penetration depth keeps increasing it s believed that ifr is a better indicator of plugging effect than plr though it s hard to measure in field test paik et al 2003 paikowsky 1990 to measure the plug length and ifr values in numerical tests the positions of several monitoring points which initially locate at the ground surface are recorded during pile installation as shown in fig 9 it is clear that at shallow penetration 200 mm plug length equals penetration depth regardless of pile geometry installation methods and soil density then the groth rate of plug length for td5j and tl5j slows down and the soil plug seems to stop growing at the penetration depth of 450 mm and the final soil plug for the loose case is relatively longer for other jacked piles with larger diameters the plug length keeps increasing and does not reach a stable value at the end of penetration since the influence of density is not obvious at this stage the plug lengths for both dense and loose sand have been averaged for t10j and t25j for the ease of illustration this technique also applies for vibratory case and impact case for impact driven piles the plug length keeps almost the same as the penetration depth the above analysis shows that larger penetration smaller pile diameter lower d i t ratio and higher soil density all seem to promote plug formation fig 10 a shows the ifr development for piles with d i t of 5 for jacked piles ifr value is close to 1 during the initial 100 mm penetration while ifr value for loose sand is even larger than 1 this maybe the result of installation disturbance at shallow penetration then both ifr values show noticeable increase with fluctuation at the penetration depth of 500 mm ifr value for td5j reaches 0 which is an indication of fully plugged mode this state keeps for a further 50 mm penetration and the ifr value increases to around 0 1 at the end of penetration in loose sand ifr value keeps decreasing but never makes it to the fully plugged mode for vibratory driven piles ifr values keep falling with penetration depth and reach around 0 6 at final penetration the ifr developments for impact driven piles are even less noticeable with a slight decrease from 1 to 0 9 for piles with inside diameters of 100 mm and d i t ratios of 10 and 25 the ifr development trends are basically the same though with higher ifr values based on the above results it can be concluded that installation method and pile diameter plays the major role in plug formation while the influence of soil density and wall thickness is not that obvious 3 3 porosity distribution the porosity distribution can provide a different perspective of the soil displacement pattern fig 11 presents the porosity distributions at the center s1 inside s2 and outside s3 sections for piles with d i t of 5 at the penetration depth of 600 mm detailed information for the setup of monitoring sections can be found in fig 5 in fig 11 the horizontal dash line indicates the depth of pile tip and the two vertical dash lines represents the initial porosities for dense and loose sand respectively at center sections as shown in fig 11 a the top part of the soil plug in jacked piles is relatively loose with porosity values larger than the initial values then the porosity value keeps decreasing along the soil plug and reaches the minimum value at the pile tip under the pile tip the porosity values increase rapidly and at the distance about two d i below the pile tip the soil mass recovers to the initial compact state this trend is almost the same for both the dense and loose sand for the dynamic installed piles the porosity distribution is similar to that in jacked piles though with less compaction and more fluctuation similar porosity distribution in impact driven piles has been reported by labenski and moormann 2016 the porosity distribution trends at inside sections are basically the same as that at the center sections for the porosity distributions at outside sections a more severe installation disturbance occurs for jacked pile while the influence on impact driven pile is the less noticeable the porosity distribution trends for piles with larger diameters are basically the same the difference is that the soil plug compaction is less severe at the bottom part for larger piles it can also be concluded that for jacked piles the densest part of the soil plug locates around the pile tip while for the dynamic installed piles the densest part locates in the vicinity below the pile tip 3 4 stress state in the soil plug fig 12 presents the horizontal stress distributions for piles with d i t of 5 at penetration depth of 600 mm the distribution of initial horizontal stress is also attached as a reference inside the soil plug the horizontal stress distributions follow similar trends regardless of installation method all the stress values are minimal at the top part and increases rapidly to the pile tip below the pile tip the horizontal stress recovers to the initial stress state quickly the above trends are similar to many reported cases liu et al 2019 lüking and kempfert 2013 also the magnitude of horizontal stress value in the numerical tests is similar to that reported by henke and grabe 2008 that the horizontal stress level inside the jacked pile is the highest while lowest for impact driven pile however the stress state at the outside pile section is quite different the different stress state inside and outside the pile may be the result of plugging effect an interesting point is that the maximum horizontal stress inside the pile locates at the pile tip for jacked pile while it is below the pile tip for dynamic installed piles this is in accordance with the location of minimum porosity for piles with larger diameters the distribution trend is basically the same while the horizontal stress develops to a higher length along the soil plug though with smaller maximum stress value 3 5 pile installation resistance for open ended pile penetration resistance q t includes base resistance on the annulus of pile wall q b shaft friction on the inside q si and outside q so wall as long as the inside shaft resistance is greater than the base resistance of the soil plug the pile will penetrate in a fully plugged mode randolph et al 1991 white 2002 the developments of the three components of installation resistance against penetration depth are depicted in figs 13 15 for jacked piles with d i t of 5 the base resistance shows a remarkable linear increase compared with the minimal shaft resistance at initial penetration at the penetration depth around 300 mm base resistance begins to fluctuate around 90 kn until the penetration depth of 500 mm where another round of rapid increase initiates one the other hand the developments of shaft resistances present an idealized exponential increase as reported by randolph et al 1994 and white 2002 the inside shaft resistance exceeds the outside shaft resistance at the penetration depth around 200 mm which may indicate that the plugging effect begins to take effect at the penetration depth of 500 mm the inside shaft resistance reaches a stable value and after a further 50 mm penetration it begins to drop until the end of penetration for all the resistance components resistance values in dense sand are relatively larger than that in loose sand especially for the inside shaft capacity it is interesting to find that the development of inside shaft resistance is highly consistent with the ifr development taking the dense sand for example when the pile penetrates from 200 mm to 400 mm ifr value experiences three main fluctuations and similar trends can be traced for q si as ifr value falls to zero which means the pile begins to penetrate in a fully plugged mode the inside shaft resistance seems to accumulate in a much slower rate as soil mass stops coming inside the pile with further penetration ifr values decreases which indicates the failure of the soil plug and this leads to the decrease of inside shaft resistance the fluctuations of ifr value and inside shaft friction have been widely reported as the result of repeated formation and destruction of soil plug or soil arch hight 1996 liu et al 2019 paikowsky 1989 for jacked piles with higher d i t values the trends of resistance development are basically the same and the inside shaft resistance gradually takes the dominance for vibratory driven piles the development of installation resistance is similar to that for jacked piles though with more fluctuations and smaller resistance value it is worth noting that the development of inside resistance is also consistent with the ifr development for impact driven piles all the resistance components increase in a relatively linear mode though with dramatic fluctuations the base resistance is the most dominant and it decreases with increasing d i t also the inside resistance is slightly higher than the outside resistance this trend is similar to the findings of labenski and moormann 2016 to make a quantitative analysis of installation resistance the overall installation resistances q t as well as the resistance components are summarized in table 4 to minimize resistance fluctuations resistance values for jacked piles are averaged over the final 10 mm penetration while for dynamic installed piles over the final 20 mm penetration generally jacked piles produce the largest penetration resistance while impact driven piles produce the lowest resistance the magnitudes of penetration resistance for different installation methods are basically consistent with engineering experience and the model test results from henke and britta 2014 what s more the numerical results indicate that from jacked piles to impact driven piles the proportion of base resistance gradually increase while the proportion of plug resistance becomes less noticeable for example for td5j q b q t is 36 4 and q si q t is 43 8 while for the same pile driven by impact namely td5i the base resistance takes up 61 7 while the proportion of inside shaft resistance is only 16 7 3 6 microscopic analysis the above analysis provides basic knowledge about the influence of pile installation methods pile geometry and soil density on the plugging effect however the mechanism behind the soil plug formation and plug resistance mobilization is yet to be uncovered in this section a microscopic view is elaborated 3 6 1 particle displacement pattern as briefly described in section 3 2 the positions of a series of particles have been tracked during the pile installation process the setup of monitoring points inside the soil plug is shown in fig 16 note that for particles locate 150 mm away from the chamber wall which are not presented in fig 16 the maximum displacement value during pile installation is less than 2 mm indicating the negligible influence of lateral boundary effect fig 17 shows the trajectories of particle movements relative to the pile tip the points represent the relative positions of particles to the pile tip at each 20 mm penetration except for the first two points in jacked piles which represent a penetration depth of 100 mm for td5j the movements of top particles are less influenced by pile installation due to the weak plugging effect for the middle particles an obvious outward inward outward movement pattern can be observed when the relative distance is around one d i remarkable horizontal movements occur at the end of penetration the middle particles which initially locate at 400 mm below the pile are pushed to the distance around one d i below the pile this maybe an indication of plug formation that prevents the inflow of soil mass this plugged mode is more obvious for the bottom particles initially located at the depth of 600 mm and the outward moving trend starts at a relative distance around three times d i the different particle movements at different depth below the pile tip certainly reflects the plug formation process for td5j while the particle behavior is a little different in loose sand for tl5j the outward movement for the top particles are minimal compared to that in the dense sand this is due to the less dilative behavior of loose sand for the middle particles a slight inside movement first occurs then a similar outward inward outward movement pattern can be observed though less horizontal displacement develops for the bottom particles the movement trend is basically similar to that in dense sand though with less horizontal displacement based on the pervious results like plug development porosity and stress distribution td5j and tl5j seem to exhibit similar plug behavior however it is believed that particles in dense and loose sand take different path to achieve the similar macroscopic response a brief explanation for the plug formation process is proposed as follows at initial penetration soil mass underneath the pile tip undergoes large deformation which leads to shear failure and dilation for soil approaching this area as soil mass passes this area and flows into the pile large horizontal compression occurs around the pile tip as the pile penetrates deeper high friction accumulates around the pile shaft and propagates to the center section which produces resistance to the inflow of soil mass though not totally restrains it with further penetration a dense zone forms at the bottom of the pile and extends below the pile tip this dense zone stops further inflow of soil mass thus leading to the plugged mode at this stage shear zone develops at the surface of the dense zone and remarkable dilation occurs as soil mass approaches some particles will be attached to the dense zone especially in loose sand and before the fully plugged mode it assumes that as pile penetrates in dense sand particles first enter the dilation zone with outwards movements then the soil particles move inward as dilation effect weakens as particles approach the dense zone they flow out along its surface for the relatively loose sand the less dilative behavior leads to smaller horizontal displacement this is in accordance with the macroscopic response that the magnitude of compaction and stress is weaker in loose sand the above theory could also explain the particle movements for td10j and td 25j soil particles also experience dilation and contraction as pile approaches it seems that a dense zone has developed below the pile at the end of penetration however it is not dense enough to plug the pile and soil mass enters in a lower speed for the dynamic installed piles similar dilation and contraction process occurs however no soil particle has been pushed outside the pile the different particle movements for td5v and td5i may be the results of different installation disturbance as vibratory driven piles will lead to cyclic shearing and the impact driven method produce strong disturbance close to the pile tip it suggests that the plugging effect in dynamic installed piles is not only influenced by the installation method but also the input driving energy 3 6 2 contact force chain in granular assemblies external loads are carried by particle contacts which forms chain like paths that transfer loads along its trajectories fig 18 a c illustrate the development of contact force at different penetration depths for td5j note that a black bar and a red bar have been added which represent the plug length and active plug length respectively the active plug length indicates the soil plug section where most of the load transfer occurs de nicola and randolph 1997 paik and lee 1993 at the initial penetration of 200 mm contact force chains develop horizontally inside the soil plug which is in stark contrast with the vertical contact force distribution at initial stress state while contacts that carry larger loads only exist at the pile tip with further penetration contact force chains propagate upwards at 600 mm penetration the active plug length is around 5d i and the contact force chains that carry larger loads mainly concentrate in the bottom 2d i section and around 2 5d i below the pile tip this is in consistent with the dramatic stress concentration at the bottom part for large diameter pile and the dynamic installed piles the active plug length is larger however the contact force chains seem to be sparser and thinner especially for the impact driven piles it can be concluded that as soil mass enters the pile upward load is transferred to horizontal force via the reorientation of particle contacts the load transfer zone propagates upwards with further penetration though it s always smaller than the plug length also most of the load transfer occurs at the bottom part of the soil plug and extends below for pile with larger diameter and installed using dynamic method the load transfer range is getting larger however with lower load magnitude it s believed that load transfer is more effective in piles with stronger plugging effect 3 6 3 stress orientation in principal load transfer through contact force chains is the reflection of stress redistribution under external disturbance it has been widely reported that the direction of force chains is close to the trajectory of maximum principal stress paikowsky 1989 1990 rothenburg and bathurst 1989 to validate the connection between force chain distribution and stress orientation the distribution of stress orientation inside and below the soil plug is presented in fig 19 the orientation angle of the maximum principal stress θ is calculated as 6 θ 1 2 arctan 2 σ x y σ x x σ y y where σ x x σ y y and σ x y represent the average stress tensor in the horizontal vertical and tangential direction inside a measurement circle the positive angle indicates a clockwise rotation of the maximum principal stress from the horizontal or vertical direction depending on the ratio of horizontal stress to vertical stress the distribution of maximum principal stress orientation can be roughly divided into four zones the zone at the top is the disturbed zone with random stress rotation due to severe shearing and disturbance this can be related to the sparse and weak contact force chain at the top of the soil plug note that for the convenience of clarification the initial depth is not from the ground surface thus the disturbed zone in some piles are not shown in fig 19 below the disturbed zone to the pile tip is the load transfer zone i in this zone the maximum principal stress rotates to the pile shaft and this rotation is weaker with closer distance to the centerline some dotted red lines are superimposed on to indicate the possible load transfer path which is similar to the compression arch proposed by lüking and kempfert 2013 however difference still exists especially at the lower part this is because that the tip compression will cause very high stress rotation and rapid increase in horizontal extension for piles with stronger plugging effect the tip influence will be less influential right below the plug bottom is the transition zone where the stress orientation is similar to that at the bottom of the load transfer zone i though with less rotation it can be seen that the transition zone in dynamic installed piles is relatively larger this may be the result of stronger tip influence from dynamic installation following the transition zone is the load transfer zone ii where the maximum principal stress rotates to the center of the pile the stress trajectory at deeper location gradually recovers to the initial vertical state so it is not further presented the trajectories of the maximum principal stress in the above four zones are basically consistent with the distribution of contact force chain 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of plug resistance development soil plug formation has a great impact on the stress state inside the pile as shown in fig 13 c the plug resistance namely the inside shaft resistance takes up around 64 of the total penetration resistance while the proportion of outside shaft resistance is only around 20 thus it is necessary to understand the mechanism of plug resistance development based on the development of penetration resistance and the stress orientation inside the soil plug the developments of plug resistance at different plugging conditions are illustrated in fig 20 during shallow penetration soil mass is first disturbed by the tip compression and shaft resistance leading to the reorientation of particle contacts and principal stress close to the pile soil interface with further penetration the influence zone of shaft resistance accumulates and propagates towards the center however for dynamic installed piles this accumulation process is hard to achieve and the influence zone is limited for piles with weak plugging effect with ifr 1 soil elements close to the pile shaft will experience similar stress and strain paths as the pile tip approaches and passes leading to similar inside and outside shaft resistance this can be verified by the development of shaft resistance for dynamic installed piles as shown in figs 14 and 15 as plugging effect strengthens with 0 ifr 1 the magnitude of load transfer inside the pile exceeds that outside the pile shaft however the influence zone is still limited as pile penetrates in the fully plugged mode with ifr 0 the soil plug works as a whole with the plug resistance fully mobilized 4 2 characterization of soil plug formation at the end of penetration for td5j and tl5j a dense zone with cone shape forms beneath the pile deflecting the around soil mass like a close ended pile a brief explanation for the formation process of the dense zone has been provided in section 3 6 1 in this section the characterization of soil plug formation is further illustrated as shown in fig 21 the soil plug could be roughly divided into three zones zone i is the densest zone that would keep relatively still to the pile and stop the inflow of soil particles this zone locates at the bottom of the pile and stretches out to around 1 4 d i zone ii is the transition zone between zone i and zone iii which is the shear zone as the pile with soil cone penetrates soil particle will first enter the shear zone where marked dilation will push the particles away then with further penetration some particles will enter the transition zone where the dilation effect weakens however it is hard for particles entering the dense zone normally they just flow out along its surface 5 conclusions in this paper the plugging effect of open ended pile installed in sand has been thoroughly analyzed using two dimensional discrete element method a series of numerical pile penetration tests are performed at 10g to simulate the deep penetration problem and the influence of soil density pile geometry and installation method has been considered the main conclusions are as follows based on the soil displacement pattern clear shear bands develop around the pile shaft a cone shaped zone with length around one diameter exists beneath the small diameter jacked piles the cone shaped zone deflects soil mass around the pile resembling the soil deformation pattern of a closed ended pile according to the development of ifr plug formation seems to be more sensitive to pile diameter and installation method than soil density and wall thickness for piles with larger diameter and installed by dynamic methods the plugging effect are weaker also stronger plugging effect will produce denser soil plug especially at the lower part where remarkable stress concentration occurs as to pile penetration resistance jacked piles produce the largest penetration resistance while impact driven piles produce the lowest resistance for piles with larger d i t the proportion of base resistance tends to fall while the proportion of inside shaft resistance will increase an idealized exponential trend for the growth of shaft resistance can be observed especially for the inside shaft resistance which is highly consistent with the fluctuation of ifr development based on the microscopic analysis of soil particle movements contact force chain distribution and principal stress orientation it suggests the plug formation is promoted by the accumulation of inside shaft resistance in the macroscopic scale and by the reorientation of particle contacts and principal stress in the microscopic scale at last the mobilization of plug resistance magnitude is related to ifr value and a simple model is proposed to characterize the formation of soil plug which could be divided into dense zone transition zone and shear zone in this paper the three dimensional pile penetration problem is simplified as plane strain condition though the penetration response could be satisfactorily simulated three dimensional simulation is still necessary also more sophisticated contact models are expected to be applied to simulate the particle breakage phenomenon during pile penetration credit authorship contribution statement lichen li numerical modelling writing original

sph method regular wave and irregular wave triple pipe bundle scouring wave force 1 introduction the wave impact on coastal structures is one of the biggest concerns for designing safe ocean structures the interactions between wave and offshore structures are widely studied for example the interaction between wave and marine pipelines platform cylinders and other structures are widely used thus it provides some practical value for future practical engineering applications in offshore engineering offshore oil and gas pipelines are not only composed of vertical circular cylinder cc risers but installed with injection liquid pipes cable pipes and cc risers to form a triple cylinder bundle tpb zhu et al 2017 the tpb is used to connect subsea wellheads and floating structures which also acts as the channel to transport the oil and gas in addition tpb works under ocean currents wave impact and scouring which would inevitably cause fatigue damage for structures therefore how to reduce fatigue damages for the tpb structure and maintain its normal operation are very important in ocean engineering some scholars maccamy and fuchs 1954 kriebel 1987 kriebel 1992 kriebel 1998

et al 2019 lara et al 2012 jesus et al 2012 have studied the interaction between wave and structures mainly focusing on the interaction between wave and cc hu et al 2016 conducted a test on the interaction between the numerical wave and cylinder structures with active absorption system based on the open source code openfoam the results demonstrated the correctness of overlapping grid in the

qq model could correctly control wave numerical dissipation with no phase difference under the same grid size and time step conditions regarding the study of the interactions between the wave and vertical cylinder maccamy and fuchs 1954 proposed the diffraction problem of wave moving along a cylinder and the theory of linear diffraction which laid the foundation for future research on the problem of wave diffraction subsequently kriebel 1987 1992 1998 did a study for the wave running up effect and wave force around the vertical cylinder based on the second order diffraction theory then the experimental research on the wave running up problem was conducted for large scale vertical cylinders with the regular wave finally a semi theoretical calculation formula of second order wave force was proposed based on linear diffraction theory which was mainly used to theoretically calculate the wave force generated by the second order stokes wave against the vertical cylinder aggarwal et al 2016 2017 2019 applied the open source computational fluid dynamics model reef3d to numerically look into the interaction of regular wave and irregular wave with cylinders the detailed information about wave fluid dynamics was provided including fluid pressure velocity and free surface in addition the irregular wave based on jonswap spectrum was calculated the spectra of different wave gauges around the cylinder were compared it was observed that the regular wave with higher steepness presented a clear diffraction pattern around the cylinder for irregular wave the diffraction pattern was not significant lara et al 2012 mainly simulated the interaction between waves and the impermeable breakwater as well as the breakwater with porous media based on physical experiment models the interactions between second order stokes regular wave and structures were mainly verified the change of free surface elevation at different positions and the change of the pressure at the measuring point were compared with the results of ih 3vof it was found that they were in good agreement hereafter jesus et al 2012 studied the interaction between wave and slope preventing with porous media based on the ih 3vof model which verified that the model can reliably simulate the interaction characteristics of wave and coastal structures in addition considering the existence of porous and air the model was further verified with the experimental data results compared with traditional grid based methods the smooth particle hydrodynamics sph method which involves the lagrangian meshless particle method can better handle large deformations and capture fast moving interfaces and free surfaces for the fluid structure interaction problems the sph method has been widely applied to engineering design and scientific research by many investigators liu and zhang 2019 ye et al 2019 dias et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 monaghan 2005 based on the sph method szmidt and hedzielski 2014 simulated the two dimensional characteristics of the flow around a cylinder under the action of wave mainly discretizing the fluid flow around the cylinder and calculating the pressure distribution along the circumference of the cylinder by focusing on the boundary conditions of the solid fluid boundary of the curved surface in the problem domain the results show that the sph method could accurately describe the flow characteristics around the cylinder based on the sph les model wen et al 2016 2018a and wen and ren 2018 numerically investigated the interaction between wave and coastal structures in 3 d among them the interaction between wave and porous media was studied in order to eliminate the effects of reflected wave passive viscous absorption as well as active absorption system was introduced the results show that the sph method was capable of simulating large scale numerical wave tank and solving the interaction between wave and structure ren et al 2014 2016 also utilized the sph algorithm to numerically study the coupling effect of wave and porous media based on the existing numerical calculation results and experimental data the sph porous model was verified the validated model was applied to study the interaction between wave and double layer porous media submerged dikes and floating dikes the calculated results were in good agreement with the experimental data indicating that the model had the ability to predict general turbulent flow in porous media crespo et al 2017 did a research on the interaction between sea wave and ocean risers by using dualsphysics code with comparing the sph model with the experimental results in addition three different numerical models were studied to demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the dynamic response of the structure for sph model with the impact of 2 d and 3 d wave the weakly compressible sph model was applied by altomare et al 2017 to make a thorough inquiry on the generation of second order bound long wave and random wave for which the performance of reflected wave absorption systems was tested passive absorption and active absorption the experimental results of the time history of the wave force on the structure were introduced for comparison studies show that the sph can perfectly model the motion characteristics of wave subsequently altomare et al 2015 studied the wave structure interaction force based on the sph method and compared with the results of theoretical calculation formulas army corps of engineer 2002 obtained by sanflous goda and takahashi the dynamic characteristics of the interaction between wave and coastal structure were compared with the experimental results the study found that the present results were basically consistent with the theoretical calculation results and the existing experimental data the literature above mainly aims at the analysis of the dynamic characteristics of waves on the single vertical cylinder and other forms of structure aggarwal et al 2016 2017 2019 by using different numerical calculation methods wen et al 2016 hu et al 2016 furthermore there is little concern about the 3 d flow and force characteristics of the triple cylinder bundle with consideration of different wave parameters based on the code dualsphysics a 3 d numerical water tank nwt is set up and the interactions between waves

computational results de padova et al 2014 for which it has a great influence on wave field characteristics furthermore he et al 2020 also found that the artificial coefficient has a great influence on the dissipation characteristics of wave energy since the fluid in the sph method is regarded as weakly compressible the equation of state can be used to establish the connection between the particle density and the fluid pressure can be obtained 5 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where ρ 0 1000 kg m3 is the reference density of the fluid γ is the geometric constant and the value range is 1 7 the parameter b c 2 ρ 0 γ is related to the compressibility of the fluid and c is the speed of sound at reference density which can be defined by 6 c c ρ 0 p ρ ρ 0 where c should be restricted within the scale of at least ten times larger than that of the maximum fluid velocity in order to keep the theoretical density change less than 1 and maintain the incompressible water flow furthermore the value of time step is determined by the counrant freidrich levy cfl condition pressure term and viscous diffusion term all cfl of calculation models is set to 0 2 in this paper 2 2 boundary conditions in the sph method for solid boundary condition the boundary is composed of a group of independent fluid particles crespo et al 2007 proposed dynamic boundary conditions dbc where the particles can not only satisfy the same motion equation as fluid particles but also maintain a fixed position or move according to a predefined motion function the dynamic boundary conditions are adopted to simulate the upstream boundary and bottom boundary of the numerical water tank while the damping zone is set at downstream furthermore the upstream boundary conditions are implemented by the movable wave maker wave making paddle in this study where the same settings can also be found in liu and wang 2020 and liu et al 2019 on the other hand the periodic boundary condition pbc is adopted as the lateral boundary condition to eliminate the numerical dissipation problem near the boundary particles gómez gesteira et al 2012 which is also applied by wen et al 2016 to investigate the influence of different dynamic boundary conditions on the calculation results a modified dynamic boundary condition mdbc is also adopted in this study based on the theory of english et al 2019 meanwhile mdbc can improve the shortcomings of dbc in which a cavity between the fluid and boundary particle may lead to unphysical values for those particles in mdbc the arrangement of boundary particles is the same as that of boundary particles in dbc whose boundary interface is located at half the distance between the innermost particles of the boundary particles for each boundary particle a ghost node is projected into the fluid through the boundary interface in addition the pressure correction algorithms for the boundary particles have also been proposed by wen et al 2018b 3 wave elimination and generation 3 1 passive wave absorption the wave in numerical water tank is prone to produce wave reflections during the propagation which may cause incorrect calculation results in order to reduce the influence of reflected wave the passive absorption system is implemented by the damping zone in dualsphysics the damping system can reduce the velocity of particles at each time step according to their position at the rate of quadratic decay subsequently the modified velocity can be expressed by 7 v v 0 1 δ t β r x x 0 x 1 x 0 2 where v 0 is the initial velocity of the particle i and v indicates the final velocity δt is the duration of the last time step and x is the position of the particles x 0 and x 1 are the initial and final position of the damping zone respectively the modifications in particle velocity at each time step can be controlled by the reduction coefficient β r and the value of 10 is used in this paper which is also adopted by liu and wang 2020 3 2 regular wave madsen second order wave theory is reliable and easy to implement in scientific research madsen 1971 which is also utilized in this study in order to eliminate the influence of the reflected wave during the wave propagation passive wave absorption is adopted in the numerical water tank for which a fixed size artificial viscous wave damping zone is set at downstream for the second order stokes

where d is the average water depth k is the wave number k 2π l l is wave length the wave maker moves in translation in present study according to madsen theory and dbc theory the expression of the stokes second order regular wave maker for translational motion of displacement motion function e t is as follows 9 e t s 0 2 sin ω t δ h 2 32 d 3 cos k d sinh 3 k d 2 m 1 sin 2 ω t 2 δ where ω 2π t is angular frequency and t is wave period the initial phase can be expressed as δ the first term is the displacement motion function of the first order linear wave the second term is the additional term of the second order displacement motion function 3 3 irregular wave the irregular wave is composed of m linear regular waves aggarwal et al 2016 2017 goda 1985 the free surface can be expressed as 10 η t i 1 m a i cos ω i t δ i 11 a i 2 s η f i δ f where s η f i is spectral density from jonwasp m is the number of wave ω i 2πf i is angular frequency a i is the amplitude of each wave component δ i is a random phase angle between 0 and 2π f i f iδf 0 5δf is the wave frequency irregular wave generation is performed in dualsphysics based on theories proposed by liu and frigaard 2001 jonswap spectrum is set as target spectrum which can be defined by 12 s f α r h s 2 f p 4 f 5 γ r β exp 1 25 f p f 4 13 α r 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ r 0 185 1 9 γ r 14 β exp f f p 2 2 σ 2 f p 2 15 σ 0 07 f f p 0 09 f f p where f is the frequency γ r 3 3 is the peak enhancement factor t p and f p denote the wave period and the frequency at the spectral peak respectively h s is significant wave height β is the peak shape parameter σ 1 f is the circle frequency and α r is a function of γ r starting from an assigned wave spectrum the biesel transfer function eq 8 is applied to each component in which the spectrum is dispersed the time series of free surface are converted into the time series of piston movement to be fed to the piston type wave paddle by using the biesel transfer function frigaard et al 1993 16 h i s 0 i 2 sinh 2 k i d sinh k i d cos k i d k i d 4 validation of wave 4 1 regular wave in this subsection the three dimensional nwt is established and the reliability of the sph method for numerical wave generation is verified the scale of the 3 d nwt is 12 m 2 m 1 m length width height wen et al 2016 the initial still water level is 0 5 m the wave maker is 0 2 m away from the upstream boundary and a damping zone is set at 9 m away from the upstream boundary as shown in fig 1 a the second order stokes regular wave is adopted as the incident wave for which the wave height and wave period are h 0 12 m and t 1 2s respectively fig 1 b shows the 3 d wave surface diagram at t t 10 it can be seen that the 2 d characteristics of the incident wave are strong and the damping zone works well moreover it is found from fig 1 c that the profiles of wave surface have the dissipation along the wave propagation direction fig 2 a shows the time history curve of the free surface at fixed position x 1 m y 1 m at different particle spacing it can be seen that the results of different particle spacing are basically indifferent considering the consumption of computing resources and the reliability of the solution model the initial particle spacing is set as dp 0 02 m the smooth length is 1 5dp and the total number of particles is about 1 6 million moreover as shown in fig 2 b 2 d the time history of the free surface simulated by sph is in a good agreement with the theoretical results at different fixed positions x 1 m y 0 5 m 1 5 m x 5 m y 0 5 m 1 5 m and x 8 m y 0 5 m 1 5 m there is no obvious phase difference between the sph and theoretical data this further illustrates that the sph method can be considered as a reliable and feasible method to well simulate the wave motion the wave force on a cc is numerically calculated and compared with the corresponding literature results kriebel 1998 hu et al 2016 the primary parameters of the verification model can be seen in table 1 where the size of the nwt is 12 m 1 2 m 0 9 m and the diameter of the cylinder is d 0 325 m the distance between the center of the cylinder and the wave maker plate is about one wavelength and a damping zone of 3 m long is set downstream of the nwt as shown in fig 3 a the wave force is dimensionless and defined by f x f 0 where f 0 ρgr c hd tanh kd d k denotes wave number r c is the radius of the cylinder d represents mean water depth ρ is the fluid density and g is the acceleration of gravity the top part of fig 3 b shows the wave force time history curve which is calculated by sph model with the results of dbc and mdbc and the sph result of the bottom part of fig 3 b is selected from the data in the top part with only one wave period the bottom of fig 3 b shows the comparison of the time history of the wave force on the cc of the sph dbc and mdbc with the second order theoretical data simulation results and experimental results it can be found from the top part of fig 3 b that different boundary conditions have little effect on the amplitudes of the wave forces on the structure the results of sph dbc are in good agreement with the second order theoretical values as well as openfoam solution results in this paper on the other hand compared with mdbc the results of sph dbc are more consistent with the literature results as shown in the bottom part of fig 3 b the sph dbc model is applied in this study there is a slight numerical deviation in the comparison with the experimental results but the trend is basically the same therefore it further demonstrates the reliability and correctness of the sph method for solving the wave structure interaction besides three different particle spacing dp 0 018 m dp 0 02 m and dp 0 022 m are also presented it can be found that the results of three particle spacing are practically consistent 4 2 irregular wave the motion characteristics of irregular wave are mainly verified in this subsection fig 4 shows the results of the comparison of the instantaneous three dimensional free surface and the wave spectrum at different positions x 2 m x 6 m under irregular wave case in addition the parameter settings of the nwt of irregular wave are consistent with those in section 4 1 where the peak period is t p 1 2s and the significant wave height h s is 0 12 m it can be seen from fig 4 b that the wave spectrum of the sph results is in good agreement with the jonwap theoretical results in which a slight difference in the values can be observed this shows that sph can perfectly describe the motion characteristics of irregular wave in addition fig 5 shows the change of free surface and the change of velocity with time at fixed positions x 2 m y 0 5 m 1 5 m as well as the comparison with the theoretical values the sph simulation results are basically consistent with theoretical results which further demonstrate the correctness and reliability of sph model for irregular wave simulation the width of nwt may affect the mechanical properties of the structure so it is very important to verify the results of different widths dias et al 2017 huang et al 2018 taking the second order stokes regular wave as typical example the interaction of the wave and cc is calculated the influence of different calculation domain widths y d 7 5 15 of nwt on wave force is compared and analyzed as shown in fig 6 the definition of corresponding parameters in this study is as follows f is wave force and f max is the amplitude of the wave force time history respectively the mean wave force and the root mean square r m s of wave force are defined as 17 f m e a n 1 n n 1 n f 18 f r m s n 1 n f f m e a n 2 n where n is the total number of samples the wave force and the maximum wave force are dimensionless which are expressed as f ρgh 0 d 2 8 and f max ρgh 0 d 2 8 respectively here d is the diameter of a cc it can be seen from fig 6 a that no significant phase difference is found for the wave force time history with different calculation domain widths but some differences in the peak value can be observed fig 6 b shows the influence of different calculation domain widths on the maximum wave force the maximum wave force at y d 7 5 is 16 7 different from the result at y d 12 5 while the maximum wave force of width y d 10 is only 3 different from it therefore the calculation domain width of all cases can be selected as y d 10 in this paper 5 problem description on the basis of section 4 2 the size of nwt is set as 12 m 4 m 1 m while the diameter of the cc and the primary cylinder of tpb are d d 0 0 4 m in this paper the center of the cylinder and tpb is located at a distance of 6 3 m from the wave maker and the distance is more than 3 times the wavelength which can reduce the effect of the reflected wave generated from the surface of the structure ketabdari and sepyani 2010 a 3 m long damping zone is set at the downstream boundary the still water level is 0 5 m and the height of the structure is 0 8 m as depicted in fig 7 a the wave maker plate is located 0 3 m away from the upstream boundary and its thickness is fixed at 5 times the particle spacing in addition the setting of the nwt is the same as fig 3 a in section 4 1 in present study the schematic diagram of the tpb and the different rotation angles are shown in fig 7 b the specific dimensional parameters of the tpb are listed in table 2 where the diameter of the primary cylinder is d 0 0 4 m the diameter of the middle cylinder is d 1 0 2 m and the diameter of the small cylinder is d 2 0 1 m in addition in order to conveniently describe the calculation results a basic wave case is defined by wave0 table 3 shows the wave0 specific parameters of the regular wave and irregular wave where the period of the wave0 is expressed by t 0 and the wave height is expressed by h 0 all the data are based on the dimensionless results of t 0 and h 0 in this paper the total simulation dimensionless time is t 20s for all regular wave based on the wave0 case of regular wave the effects of different wave periods t 1 0s 1 8s and different wave heights kh 0 122 0 367 on the force characteristics of tpb are analyzed with different rotation angles α together with different water depths being considered kd 1 224 1 836 furthermore the force characteristics of the tpb are also analyzed based on the wave0 case of irregular wave at different rotation angles α for the wave0 case the particle spacing is also set to dp 0 02 m with a total number of 3 0 million particles and the smooth length of h 1 5dp liu and wang 2020 in order to improve computational efficiency the open source code dualsphysics can provide the code based on the cuda toolkit and run it under gpu acceleration the gpu card nvidia geforce gtx 1080 ti is utilized in this study table 4 summarizes the computing device configurations the calculation time for 20s simulation is about 21 h 6 results and discussions 6 1 force characteristics of tpb based on the wave0 case the wave force characteristics of 9 groups of tpb are studied with different rotation angles α 0 180 and the results of a cc are introduced for comparison as shown in fig 8 before the analysis the dimensionless treatment of the wave force is expressed as f f ρgh 0 d 0 2 8 which also applies to f mean and f r m s for regular wave case the wave force of tpb is significantly larger than that of irregular wave case which is mainly due to the small energy input of irregular wave as the spatial position of the tpb changes the maximum wave force exhibits an inverted v shaped distribution as shown in fig 8 a when the rotation angle is 90 for tpb the maximum wave force reaches the maximum value in fact the region of the wave structure interaction interface is the largest at α 90 it is worth noting that the mean wave force reaches its maximum value for the tpb with α 120 for the α 120 case the time averaged impact of wave on the structure is stronger than that of α 90 which results in larger mean wave force for the irregular wave case as depicted in fig 8 b the average wave force on the structure is almost close to zero compared with the results of regular waves it indicates that the time averaged force of irregular wave on the structure cannot be considered and more attention should be paid to the interaction between regular wave and structures moreover the average wave force is close to 0 when the angle is α 180 for tpb in the case of the regular wave in addition the change of r m s of the wave force is consistent with the trend of its maximum wave force for the tpb the r m s of the wave force reflects the oscillation of the wave force as shown in fig 8 c the r m s of wave force also reaches the maximum value at α 90 fig 9 shows the time history curve of the regular wave force and the irregular wave force at α 90 for the irregular wave force a calculation formula is established by borgman 1967 to determine the spectral density function per unit length of force at a point on the vertical pile based on the sea surface spectral density which is further explained in sarpakaya and issacson 1981 it can be seen from the fig 9 that the wave force time history curve shows a steady periodic change for regular wave while the irregular wave time history curve shows a random change meanwhile it can be observed that the maximum wave force and the r m s of wave force under the action of regular wave are significantly larger than those of irregular wave 6 2 flow field near the tube bundle structure since the tpb suffers the largest wave force at α 90 it has the smallest wave force at α 180 taking the case of 90 as classic examples for tpb structure the hydrodynamic characteristics of the interaction of wave with the tpb structure are explored and the results of the cc are introduced for comparison figs 10 13 show the wave fields of the interaction between the wave and the structure at different times for which the wave surface is rendered with the magnitude of the wave velocity for the convenience of analysis the time when the wave crest is about to move to structure t t 0 7 71 the time when the wave crest is passing through the structure t t 0 7 92 the time when the wave crest is about to pass through the structure t t 0 8 13 are given under the case of regular wave rw and irregular wave irw as well as the time when the wave crest passes through the structure t t 0 8 33 it can be seen from fig 10 that the structure has an effect on the wave motion the diffraction phenomenon may occur when the wave passes through the structure so the wave energy will be transferred from the high energy basin to the low energy basin along the peak line aggarwal et al 2016 2017 2019 and ohl et al 2001a 2001b investigated the interaction between wave and vertical cylinder and found the phenomenon of wave diffraction at t t 0 7 92 and t t 0 8 13 fig 10 b and c there is no obvious diffraction phenomenon around the vertical cylinder but the velocity is large near the two sides of the cylinder it indicates that the lateral sides of the structure are subjected to strong scouring by wave and wen et al 2016 also found a similar phenomenon in particular as shown in fig 10 a a reflected wave generates along the opposite way to the wave propagation direction at the upstream surface of the structure the reflected wave will affect the motion characteristics of the next wave peak there is a certain phase difference between the regular wave motion and irregular wave motion as shown in fig 11 the irregular wave crest deforms greatly in the y direction when passing through the vertical cylinder and it returns to a linear shape when the wave crest leaves for the irw case there is a certain diffraction phenomenon during the propagation of the wave at upstream of the structure for which a semi circular light spot can be observed as depicted in fig 11 b when the wave continues to move to the position shown in fig 11 c the peak of the free surface is semicircular at upstream of the structure and a large diffraction effect can be observed for the tpb of α 90 the contact region interacting with wave increases a lot for rw causing a significant increase in the wave force of the tpb structure compared with the cc case thus its shielding effect on the flank of tpb is strong as shown in fig 12 the scouring effect of the wave is the same as the results of cc for which the impact and scouring effects are more likely to occur at the flank of tpb structure in addition the scouring effect of the wave significantly enhances for the tpb and affects its mechanical properties unfortunately no diffraction phenomenon is found when the wave impacts the tpb structure for the irw case compared with cc the impact of wave on the tpb structure is also significantly stronger furthermore the diffraction phenomenon cannot be observed during the impact of the wave on the tpb structure as depicted in fig 13 in summary it can be seen that the diffraction phenomenon is more likely to occur in cc structure 6 3 velocity vector and vorticity distribution around the structure due to the existence of the tpb the wave motion response and hydrodynamic characteristics change significantly which affects the force characteristics of the tpb in order to further reveal the coupling mechanism between tpb and wave it is very important to understand the velocity distribution around the structure figs 14 17 show the three dimensional velocity vector distribution around the tpb at z 0 05 m at three different times t t 0 7 67 8 0 8 33 and the result of the cc is introduced for comparative analysis for the rw cases it can be observed that there is a strong three dimensional flow effect around the cc and the tpb due to the blocking and shielding effect of the cc and the tpb structure the velocity of the fluid particles of the upstream surface and downstream surface is smaller than that of the flank as shown in fig 14 c therefore the wave scouring is more likely to occur on the flank of the structure which has a similar record in related literature wen et al 2016 it can be found that the fluid particles impact the structure with a larger velocity at t t 0 7 67 fig 14 a the fluid particles with a higher velocity gather at the centerline of the rear surface of the structure at t t 0 8 00 fig 14 b furthermore the velocity vector distribution of the tpb at α 0 is similar to that of the cc which directly leads to the similar wave force characteristics as shown in fig 15 for the case of α 90 for tpb due to the significant increment for the contact region interacting with the wave the wave force significantly increases as depicted in fig 16 it can also be observed that the scouring of the wave mainly occurs on its upper and lower sides for structure which is consistent with the distribution of the wave field when the rotation angle moves to α 120 for the tpb structure the contact region interacting with the wave narrows significantly resulting in a reduction for wave force as shown in fig 17 for the irw case the magnitude of fluid particle velocity is significantly smaller than that of the rw case this is mainly due to the smaller energy input of irregular wave and a small amount of energy can be transported along the water depth direction compared with the rw case it can be observed that the impact and scouring strength of wave is weak on the tpb structure for irregular wave at z 0 05 m it can be found from the findings in section 6 1 that the maximum wave force of α 90 is the largest for tpb structure and the maximum wave force of α 180 is the smallest however the maximum wave force of α 0 is close to the data of cc in order to further analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics of the wave force for the tpb with α 90 fig 18 shows three vorticity components ω x ω y ω z of the fluid particles at different rotation angles and different moments t t 0 7 67 8 0 8 33 the three vorticity components ω x ω y ω z can be defined by 19 ω x w y v z ω y u z w x ω z v x u y where u v and w are the velocity in the x direction the y direction and the z direction for rw case it can be seen from fig 18 that the ω x and ω z around a cc present a symmetrical distribution along x axis of the cylinder however the ω y distribution shows a symmetrical distribution along y axis of the cylinder in addition with the wave motion in t t 0 8 33 the magnitude of ω x and ω y is large for cc indicating that the flank of the cylinder is strongly washed by the wave in t t 0 8 33 the magnitude of ω z is smaller than that of t t 0 7 67 and t t 0 8 0 for the irregular wave the magnitude of the vorticity is significantly smaller than that of the regular wave which denotes that the scour effect of the cc under the irregular wave is weaker than the results of the regular wave for the tpb structure of α 90 at the rw the contact region interacted with the wave increases significantly the ω x is mainly focused on the flank of the tpb structure when the wave moves to t t 0 8 33 the ω y distribution on the upstream and downstream surfaces of the tpb structure is larger than that other cases under the action of the rw the magnitude of ω z is small it indicates that the axial scouring effect of wave is weak for tpb structure moreover the scouring effect in the x axis and y axis directions is strong based on the fact that a large value of ω x and ω y can be found in fig 19 under the action of the irw the value of ω z is also smaller than ω x and ω y and the feeble scouring effect in the vertical direction can be found for the irw case it is very meaningful to understand the time averaged data of the wave field fig 20 shows the distribution of the time averaged velocity along the y axis at specific locations x 6 2 m and x 7 0 m for the tpb structure with different height sections z 0 05 m z 0 25 m and z 0 5 m the abbreviation like x 6 2 m z 0 05 m denotes the monitoring line at x 6 6 m and z 0 05 m taking the bottom of the numerical water tank as a reference point where the height is set as z 0 m the dimensionless velocity in x direction is processed by u 100u t 0 d 0 as well as the velocity in the y direction v and the z direction w for u and v the time averaged velocity of z 0 25 m along the y axis is close to 0 the magnitude of the mean vertical velocity approaches 0 at z 0 05 m at z 0 05 m the time averaged streamwise velocity reaches a large value near y 2 m as shown in fig 20 a in addition the time averaged velocity in x direction is larger than 0 with the position of x 6 2 m and x 7 0 m at z 0 5 m which shows that fluid particles have the same direction of motion it can be seen from fig 20 b that the time averaged v distribution of x 6 2 m is the same as that of x 7 0 m at z 0 05 m at z 0 5 m the time averaged longitudinal velocity of x 6 2 m is symmetrical and opposite to that of x 7 0 m the time averaged vertical velocity w at the upstream and downstream positions reach maximum values near y 2 m at z 0 25 m respectively as shown in fig 20 c meanwhile the time averaged vertical velocity of x 6 2 m is significantly larger than that of x 7 0 m at z 0 25 m in conclusion it can be found that the hindering effect of the tpb on w is larger than that of u and v 6 4 mechanical characteristics of different wave parameters on the structure compared with the irregular wave cases the structure is strongly impacted by the regular wave thus the mechanical characteristics of the structure are only analyzed under regular wave in this section the characteristics of the maximum wave force of tpb structure are mainly analyzed with the special cases of α 0 α 90 α 120 and α 180 figs 21 23 show statistical analysis with regard to the effect of different regular wave parameters wave period t wave height kh water depth kd on the wave force of the tpb structure and the result of cc is also listed the maximum wave force gradually increases with the wave period increasing it reaches a peak at t 1 6s and then gradually decreases slowly as shown in fig 21 a it is worth noting that the maximum wave force is almost identical in the interval of t 1 4s 1 8s for the cc the tpb of α 0 and α 180 for which its interval is called the maximum wave force interval in addition it can be found that the change of the maximum wave force of cc is basically consistent with the results of the tpb α 0 this phenomenon can also be observed in the velocity vector distribution the distribution curve of tpb α 180 is basically below the results of other cases which corresponds to the previous analysis of the vorticity and velocity vector distribution the change of mean wave force with different wave periods is significantly different from the maximum wave force result the mean wave force shows a large jump and reaches the maximum value at t 1 6s as depicted in fig 21 b therefore with the wave period of t 1 6s the time averaged effect of the wave on the structure is greater than other cases the root mean square of wave force represents the oscillation of the wave force time history it can be found from fig 21 c that the r m s of wave force increases with the wave period changing which is same as the maximum wave force result it can be seen from fig 22 a that the maximum wave force basically increases linearly with the changing wave height as the wave height increases the energy of the wave gradually increases which leads to a stronger impact effect it is worth noting that curve of the maximum wave force for tpb α 0 with basically coincides with the results of cc the maximum wave force of the structure is directly related to the strength of the wave impact however the scouring effect also contributes to the maximum wave force as the incident wave height increases the mean wave force and the r m s of wave force gradually increase as shown in fig 22 b and c it is worth noting that the mean wave force of cc is larger than that of the tpb structure at α 0 and α 180 for different wave heights however the r m s of cc is close to the result of tpb with α 0 in addition the maximum wave force increases slowly with increasing water depth and keeps stable with the range of kd 1 38 1 84 as shown in fig 23 a it also indicates that a low correlation exists between the maximum wave force and water depths furthermore the maximum wave force of cc is almost the same as that of tpb with α 90 at different water depth meanwhile the mean wave force of tpb with α 0 and α 90 show a trough at kd 1 38 with increasing water depth as shown in fig 23 b the mean wave force of the tpb with α 120 reaches the minimum value of 0 18 at kd 1 53 which is different from the results of α 0 and α 90 for tpb the mean wave force of α 120 is larger than the result of α 90 the r m s of wave force gradually increases in the interval kd 1 22 1 53 for all cases and reaches the maximum value at kd 1 53 with increasing water depth of kd 1 53 1 84 the r m s of wave force gradually decreases for all cases which is distinguished from the results of maximum wave force in order to further analyze the influence of different wave periods on the mechanical characteristics of the structure fig 24 shows the time history curves of the wave force of the cc and tpb structure with different wave periods the time history curves of wave force have obvious phase difference at different periods the fluctuation of the curve at t 1 0s is obviously smaller than that of other cases in fact the wave force time history curve shows a large peak at t 1 6s the peak decreases by 22 with increasing simulation time this is mainly due to the findings that the structure has an obstructive effect on the wave motion and the wave propagation at the upstream surface of the structure in which the reflected wave forms and further dissipates part of the incident wave energy for the tpb structure at α 90 as the wave period increases the frequency of the peak gradually decreases within the time interval of t t 0 4 12 in the same time interval the number of peak points reduces from 9 to 5 at t 1 0s 1 8s as shown in fig 24 b it shows that the oscillation frequency of the wave force on the tpb is weakened with increasing wave period in the range of t 1 0s 1 8s which can reduce the fatigue loss of tpb and a certain difference in the fluctuation of wave force can be found which is consistent with the characteristics of the maximum wave force 6 5 three dimensional pressure distribution characteristics of tpb it is very important to further understand the three dimensional pressure distribution around the tpb structure and the corresponding results are introduced in this section fig 25 shows the setting of the measuring points wg a wg g on the circumferential wall of the tpb structure under wave0 case of rw at α 90 and 180 the range of each measuring point is z d 0 025 1 25 fig 26 shows the curve of the maximum pressure along the spanwise direction of the tpb structure at each measurement point the dimensionless maximum pressure is defined by p max 8p max ρgh where h is the wave height at wave0 case for the case of α 90 with the range of z d 0 025 0 8 the identical value of p max shown in fig 26 a can be observed at some measuring points except for wg d and wg f for the case of α 180 the overlap of the maximum pressure of each measurement point can be found in the height interval z d 0 025 0 8 which shows a diagonal hook type depicted in fig 26 b however p max fluctuates greatly in the interval z d 0 8 1 25 at α 90 and 180 with the case of α 90 the distribution of the maximum pressure shows quite different at different measurement points this indicates that the wave breaking occurs at the height range of z d 0 8 1 25 and the 3 d characteristics are strong under the action of wave however the three dimensional impact of the wave on the tpb structure is weak within z d 0 025 0 8 and the wave energy dissipates substantially along the depth of the water in addition the maximum value of p max on the upstream surface of tpb appears in the interval z d 0 8 1 25 while the maximum value of p max on its flank and downstream surface appears near z d 0 2 it can be seen that the wave breaking effect mainly occurs on the upstream surface of the tpb structure when the rotation angle is 180 the maximum of p max appears near z d 0 2 due to the wave breaking effect p max fluctuates greatly in the height range z d 0 83 1 25 it can be found that the wave breaking effect with α 180 is significantly smaller than the results of α 90 the maximum value of p max of wg g does not show a jump change in the interval z d 0 83 1 25 which is mainly attributed to the shielding effect of tpb on the wave action the wg h is located at the upstream position of the tpb structure in which the strong wave breaking effect causes large fluctuations in p max with the range of z d 0 83 1 25 in order to further understand the 3 d distribution of the wave force and pressure characteristics of the tpb with regular wave case at α 90 fig 27 shows the spatial temporal distribution characteristics of the pressure along the axial height at different measurement points the spatial temporal of the force coefficients distribution characteristics are also analyzed by zhang et al 2020 the spatial temporal distribution of pressure is composed of many filament like lines and exhibits periodic changes in addition the color shades of filaments represent the pressure value of the tpb surface the maximum pressure mainly appears in the range of z d 0 8 1 25 which is consistent with the results in fig 26 a in the interval of z d 0 8 1 25 some jump changes can be found for p max in the specific region which is called the mutation region mr in fact the formation of the mr goes hand in hand with the interaction between wave and structure which depends on the strength of wave breaking furthermore the occurrence of wave breaking is mainly concentrated in the upstream of tpb so the mr can be observed in the spatial temporal distribution of the pressure of the upstream measurement points the periodic variation of the highlight zone is related to the wave period of the incident wave the core region of the highlight region is mainly concentrated near z d 0 2 in which a large value of the pressure can be observed in order to further analyze the three dimensional flow characteristics of the tpb the spanwise correlation of pressure is introduced which is an important indicator of three dimensional characteristics gabbai and benaroya 2005 zhang et al 2016 it also has significance for the vortex induced vibration of the structure the correlation coefficient is computed as follows 20 ρ z z 1 z 2 ε z 1 μ z 1 z 2 μ z 2 σ z 1 σ z 2 where μ x and σ x are the mean and standard deviation variables and x z 1 and z 2 can be represented at any two different span positions in this section the bottom of the cylinder is used as a reference point so the correlation coefficient of the pressure can be expressed as ρ z 0 z fig 28 shows the correlation coefficients of the pressure of the tpb structure along the spanwise direction at α 90 and α 180 the correlation coefficient reaches the minimum value at z d 1 25 in the height interval z d 0 2 0 8 the correlation coefficient of pressure remains fixed at each measurement point indicating that the three dimensional effect of pressure distribution can be neglected in this interval with the region of 0 8 z d 1 25 the correlation coefficient of pressure decreases rapidly for the case of α 90 the pressure correlation coefficient of wg a is ρ z 0 1 25 0 03 at z d 1 25 the pressure correlation coefficients of the upstream measurement points are smaller than that of the downstream and flank for tpb as depicted in fig 28 a for wg a the pressure correlation coefficient curve is below that of other cases which indicates that it has the strongest three dimensional characteristics among them for wg h the pressure correlation coefficient is 0 48 at z d 1 25 which is larger than the numerical results of other cases it shows that the three dimensional distribution of pressure is small at wg h situated in the flank of tpb with the case of α 180 it can be seen from fig 28 b that the minimum correlation coefficient of wg f is ρ z 0 1 25 0 185 which is obviously smaller than the result of α 90 ρ z 0 1 25 0 22 for wg a the pressure correlation coefficient curve is also below that of other cases in the range of z d 0 2 0 8 which also indicates that the strongest three dimensional characteristics can be observed among them for wg g with a larger value of ρ z 0 1 25 0 53 it is at the most downstream position of the tpb structure for some measurement points apart from the wg e and wg h with the range of l d 0 8 1 2 the pressure correlation coefficient decreases rapidly as the spanwise height of the structure increases 7 conclusion based on the sph method the numerical water tank is established and the wave maker wave making plate is applied to simulate the second order regular wave as well as the first order irregular wave the viscous damping zone is used to realize the wave elimination function by comparing the sph simulation results with theoretical and experimental data the results are in good agreement with each other then the effects of wave with different rotation angles α and different wave parameters are analyzed on the mechanical characteristics of tpb the distribution characteristics of three dimensional flow field around the structure velocity distribution vorticity distribution maximum wave force distribution and maximum pressure distribution along spanwise height are analyzed emphatically the main conclusions are as follows 1 the sph method can accurately simulate the motion of three dimensional wave that includes the regular wave and the irregular wave meanwhile the sph dbc model can accurately obtain the results of the wave forces on the structure with experimental results and theoretical results being introduced for contrast 2 the timed averaged wave force of the structure reaches the maximum at α 120 for the regular wave case the statistical value of wave forces is significantly larger than the results of irregular wave case the changes of the maximum wave force with the rotation angle are consistent with that of the root mean square of the wave force 3 for the irregular wave case the diffraction phenomenon of wave can be observed when it passes through the vertical cylinder the scouring effect of the structure with regular wave is stronger than that of the irw case for cc the ω x and ω z are mainly distributed symmetrically along the upper and lower sides of the structure the strong suction in the region with a large value of vorticity components can be found which leads to a strong scouring effect near the surface of the structure for the irregular wave case the tpb structure has the greatest hindrance to vertical velocity 4 the maximum wave force varies greatly with different wave parameters in which the interval of maximum wave force can be observed with the increasing wave periods and water depth the mean wave force reaches the maximum value at t 1 4s and the variation of r m s of wave force is close to the data of maximum wave force with the change of wave period the frequency of wave force peaks is larger at the small wave period case 5 there is a strong three dimensional characteristic of the pressure distribution for measuring points at different locations in the z d 0 8 1 25 for the tpb structure the 3 d characteristic of the pressure distribution of α 90 is stronger than that of α 180 for which its maximum pressure is significantly higher than that of α 180 the correlation coefficient of the pressure maintains a relatively stable in the range of z d 0 2 0 8 which the 3 d characteristic of the pressure can be ignored in this range credit authorship contribution statement

sph method regular wave and irregular wave triple pipe bundle scouring wave force 1 introduction the wave impact on coastal structures is one of the biggest concerns for designing safe ocean structures the interactions between wave and offshore structures are widely studied for example the interaction between wave and marine pipelines platform cylinders and other structures are widely used thus it provides some practical value for future practical engineering applications in offshore engineering offshore oil and gas pipelines are not only composed of vertical circular cylinder cc risers but installed with injection liquid pipes cable pipes and cc risers to form a triple cylinder bundle tpb zhu et al 2017 the tpb is used to connect subsea wellheads and floating structures which also acts as the channel to transport the oil and gas in addition tpb works under ocean currents wave impact and scouring which would inevitably cause fatigue damage for structures therefore how to reduce fatigue damages for the tpb structure and maintain its normal operation are very important in ocean engineering some scholars maccamy and fuchs 1954 kriebel 1987 kriebel 1992 kriebel 1998 szmidt and hedzielski 2014 wen et al 2016 2018a wen and ren 2018 ren et al 2014 ren et al 2016 crespo et al 2017 altomare et al 2017 altomare et al 2015 army corps of engineer 2002 hu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 lara et al 2012 jesus et al 2012 have studied the interaction between wave and structures mainly focusing on the interaction between wave and cc hu et al 2016 conducted a test on the interaction between the numerical wave and cylinder structures with active absorption system based on the open source code openfoam the results demonstrated the correctness of overlapping grid in the 3 d two phase fluid domain which solved the fluid structure coupling problem and it can accurately describe the coupling characteristics of the interaction between wave and structure zhang et al 2019 used the finite volume method including volume average point value multi moment vpm scheme to solve the navier stokes equation together with the hyperbolic tangent function method with quadratic surface properties and gaussian integration the influences of grid size and time step on numerical wave motion characteristics were mainly analyzed the corresponding result showed that the vpm thinc qq model could correctly control wave numerical dissipation with no phase difference under the same grid size and time step conditions regarding the study of the interactions between the wave and vertical cylinder maccamy and fuchs 1954 proposed the diffraction problem of wave moving along a cylinder and the theory of linear diffraction which laid the foundation for future research on the problem of wave diffraction subsequently kriebel 1987 1992 1998 did a study for the wave running up effect and wave force around the vertical cylinder based on the second order diffraction theory then the experimental research on the wave running up problem was conducted for large scale vertical cylinders with the regular wave finally a semi theoretical calculation formula of second order wave force was proposed based on linear diffraction theory which was mainly used to theoretically calculate the wave force generated by the second order stokes wave against the vertical cylinder aggarwal et al 2016 2017 2019 applied the open source computational fluid dynamics model reef3d to numerically look into the interaction of regular wave and irregular wave with cylinders the detailed information about wave fluid dynamics was provided including fluid pressure velocity and free surface in addition the irregular wave based on jonswap spectrum was calculated the spectra of different wave gauges around the cylinder were compared it was observed that the regular wave with higher steepness presented a clear diffraction pattern around the cylinder for irregular wave the diffraction pattern was not significant lara et al 2012 mainly simulated the interaction between waves and the impermeable breakwater as well as the breakwater with porous media based on physical experiment models the interactions between second order stokes regular wave and structures were mainly verified the change of free surface elevation at different positions and the change of the pressure at the measuring point were compared with the results of ih 3vof it was found that they were in good agreement hereafter jesus et al 2012 studied the interaction between wave and slope preventing with porous media based on the ih 3vof model which verified that the model can reliably simulate the interaction characteristics of wave and coastal structures in addition considering the existence of porous and air the model was further verified with the experimental data results compared with traditional grid based methods the smooth particle hydrodynamics sph method which involves the lagrangian meshless particle method can better handle large deformations and capture fast moving interfaces and free surfaces for the fluid structure interaction problems the sph method has been widely applied to engineering design and scientific research by many investigators liu and zhang 2019 ye et al 2019 dias et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 monaghan 2005 based on the sph method szmidt and hedzielski 2014 simulated the two dimensional characteristics of the flow around a cylinder under the action of wave mainly discretizing the fluid flow around the cylinder and calculating the pressure distribution along the circumference of the cylinder by focusing on the boundary conditions of the solid fluid boundary of the curved surface in the problem domain the results show that the sph method could accurately describe the flow characteristics around the cylinder based on the sph les model wen et al 2016 2018a and wen and ren 2018 numerically investigated the interaction between wave and coastal structures in 3 d among them the interaction between wave and porous media was studied in order to eliminate the effects of reflected wave passive viscous absorption as well as active absorption system was introduced the results show that the sph method was capable of simulating large scale numerical wave tank and solving the interaction between wave and structure ren et al 2014 2016 also utilized the sph algorithm to numerically study the coupling effect of wave and porous media based on the existing numerical calculation results and experimental data the sph porous model was verified the validated model was applied to study the interaction between wave and double layer porous media submerged dikes and floating dikes the calculated results were in good agreement with the experimental data indicating that the model had the ability to predict general turbulent flow in porous media crespo et al 2017 did a research on the interaction between sea wave and ocean risers by using dualsphysics code with comparing the sph model with the experimental results in addition three different numerical models were studied to demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the dynamic response of the structure for sph model with the impact of 2 d and 3 d wave the weakly compressible sph model was applied by altomare et al 2017 to make a thorough inquiry on the generation of second order bound long wave and random wave for which the performance of reflected wave absorption systems was tested passive absorption and active absorption the experimental results of the time history of the wave force on the structure were introduced for comparison studies show that the sph can perfectly model the motion characteristics of wave subsequently altomare et al 2015 studied the wave structure interaction force based on the sph method and compared with the results of theoretical calculation formulas army corps of engineer 2002 obtained by sanflous goda and takahashi the dynamic characteristics of the interaction between wave and coastal structure were compared with the experimental results the study found that the present results were basically consistent with the theoretical calculation results and the existing experimental data the literature above mainly aims at the analysis of the dynamic characteristics of waves on the single vertical cylinder and other forms of structure aggarwal et al 2016 2017 2019 by using different numerical calculation methods wen et al 2016 hu et al 2016 furthermore there is little concern about the 3 d flow and force characteristics of the triple cylinder bundle with consideration of different wave parameters based on the code dualsphysics a 3 d numerical water tank nwt is set up and the interactions between waves and the vertical cylinder are simulated in this study to verify the accuracy and reliability of the sph model then the sph model is used to explore the interaction between the wave and the vertical tpb by considering different rotation angles α and different wave parameters furthermore the result of a cc is introduced for comparative analysis on the other hand in order to explain the interaction mechanism between the wave and the tpb the wave field distribution characteristics vorticity distribution characteristics and velocity distribution characteristics are analyzed and discussed as well as three dimensional pressure distribution characteristics the paper is organized as follows the numerical methodology and the boundary conditions are presented in section 2 following this the theory of regular wave and irregular wave are shown in section 3 then the validation cases of regular wave and irregular wave are depicted in section 4 in section 5 the primary research content is presented the three dimensional characteristics of the interaction between waves and structures are revealed in section 6 in section 7 the main findings are summarized 2 numerical method 2 1 sph governing equation sph is a lagrangian meshless computing method which represents the problem domain by a series of randomly distributed particles in the sph the field function is approximated by an integral which is called kernel approximation the momentum equation and the continuity equation used to calculate the corresponding density change in the sph method can be written as follow crespo et al 2015 1 d v a d t b m b p b p a ρ b ρ a a b a w a b g 2 d ρ a d t b m b v a b a w a b where p a and p b represent the pressure of particles a and b w is the smooth kernel function and represents the artificial viscosity which is used to replace the real viscosity of the fluid that provides the shear force in order to reach the stability of numerical integration ρ a and ρ b represent the density of particles a and b and g is the acceleration of gravity the w and ab can be further expressed as 3 w r h α d 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 0 q 2 4 a b α μ a b c a b ρ a b v a b r a b 0 0 v a b r a b 0 where q r h denotes the dimensionless distance between any two given particles a and b here r and h are the real distance and the smoothed length respectively the values of αd are 7 4πh 2 for 2 d and 21 16πh 3 for 3 d respectively the size of the support domain is 2h which is used in eq 3 and r ab r a r b v ab v a v b and v a r a represent the velocity and displacement of particle a respectively c a b 0 5 c a c b is the average sound velocity and μab h v ab r ab r 2 ab η 2 where η 2 0 01h 2 α 0 01 is an artificial viscous coefficient altomare et al 2015 the magnitude of α can drastically change the computational results de padova et al 2014 for which it has a great influence on wave field characteristics furthermore he et al 2020 also found that the artificial coefficient has a great influence on the dissipation characteristics of wave energy since the fluid in the sph method is regarded as weakly compressible the equation of state can be used to establish the connection between the particle density and the fluid pressure can be obtained 5 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where ρ 0 1000 kg m3 is the reference density of the fluid γ is the geometric constant and the value range is 1 7 the parameter b c 2 ρ 0 γ is related to the compressibility of the fluid and c is the speed of sound at reference density which can be defined by 6 c c ρ 0 p ρ ρ 0 where c should be restricted within the scale of at least ten times larger than that of the maximum fluid velocity in order to keep the theoretical density change less than 1 and maintain the incompressible water flow furthermore the value of time step is determined by the counrant freidrich levy cfl condition pressure term and viscous diffusion term all cfl of calculation models is set to 0 2 in this paper 2 2 boundary conditions in the sph method for solid boundary condition the boundary is composed of a group of independent fluid particles crespo et al 2007 proposed dynamic boundary conditions dbc where the particles can not only satisfy the same motion equation as fluid particles but also maintain a fixed position or move according to a predefined motion function the dynamic boundary conditions are adopted to simulate the upstream boundary and bottom boundary of the numerical water tank while the damping zone is set at downstream furthermore the upstream boundary conditions are implemented by the movable wave maker wave making paddle in this study where the same settings can also be found in liu and wang 2020 and liu et al 2019 on the other hand the periodic boundary condition pbc is adopted as the lateral boundary condition to eliminate the numerical dissipation problem near the boundary particles gómez gesteira et al 2012 which is also applied by wen et al 2016 to investigate the influence of different dynamic boundary conditions on the calculation results a modified dynamic boundary condition mdbc is also adopted in this study based on the theory of english et al 2019 meanwhile mdbc can improve the shortcomings of dbc in which a cavity between the fluid and boundary particle may lead to unphysical values for those particles in mdbc the arrangement of boundary particles is the same as that of boundary particles in dbc whose boundary interface is located at half the distance between the innermost particles of the boundary particles for each boundary particle a ghost node is projected into the fluid through the boundary interface in addition the pressure correction algorithms for the boundary particles have also been proposed by wen et al 2018b 3 wave elimination and generation 3 1 passive wave absorption the wave in numerical water tank is prone to produce wave reflections during the propagation which may cause incorrect calculation results in order to reduce the influence of reflected wave the passive absorption system is implemented by the damping zone in dualsphysics the damping system can reduce the velocity of particles at each time step according to their position at the rate of quadratic decay subsequently the modified velocity can be expressed by 7 v v 0 1 δ t β r x x 0 x 1 x 0 2 where v 0 is the initial velocity of the particle i and v indicates the final velocity δt is the duration of the last time step and x is the position of the particles x 0 and x 1 are the initial and final position of the damping zone respectively the modifications in particle velocity at each time step can be controlled by the reduction coefficient β r and the value of 10 is used in this paper which is also adopted by liu and wang 2020 3 2 regular wave madsen second order wave theory is reliable and easy to implement in scientific research madsen 1971 which is also utilized in this study in order to eliminate the influence of the reflected wave during the wave propagation passive wave absorption is adopted in the numerical water tank for which a fixed size artificial viscous wave damping zone is set at downstream for the second order stokes wave the relationship between the wave plate motion amplitude s 0 and the wave height h is s 0 h m 1 and m 1 is the conversion factor which can be defined by 8 m 1 2 sinh 2 k d sinh k d cos k d k d where d is the average water depth k is the wave number k 2π l l is wave length the wave maker moves in translation in present study according to madsen theory and dbc theory the expression of the stokes second order regular wave maker for translational motion of displacement motion function e t is as follows 9 e t s 0 2 sin ω t δ h 2 32 d 3 cos k d sinh 3 k d 2 m 1 sin 2 ω t 2 δ where ω 2π t is angular frequency and t is wave period the initial phase can be expressed as δ the first term is the displacement motion function of the first order linear wave the second term is the additional term of the second order displacement motion function 3 3 irregular wave the irregular wave is composed of m linear regular waves aggarwal et al 2016 2017 goda 1985 the free surface can be expressed as 10 η t i 1 m a i cos ω i t δ i 11 a i 2 s η f i δ f where s η f i is spectral density from jonwasp m is the number of wave ω i 2πf i is angular frequency a i is the amplitude of each wave component δ i is a random phase angle between 0 and 2π f i f iδf 0 5δf is the wave frequency irregular wave generation is performed in dualsphysics based on theories proposed by liu and frigaard 2001 jonswap spectrum is set as target spectrum which can be defined by 12 s f α r h s 2 f p 4 f 5 γ r β exp 1 25 f p f 4 13 α r 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ r 0 185 1 9 γ r 14 β exp f f p 2 2 σ 2 f p 2 15 σ 0 07 f f p 0 09 f f p where f is the frequency γ r 3 3 is the peak enhancement factor t p and f p denote the wave period and the frequency at the spectral peak respectively h s is significant wave height β is the peak shape parameter σ 1 f is the circle frequency and α r is a function of γ r starting from an assigned wave spectrum the biesel transfer function eq 8 is applied to each component in which the spectrum is dispersed the time series of free surface are converted into the time series of piston movement to be fed to the piston type wave paddle by using the biesel transfer function frigaard et al 1993 16 h i s 0 i 2 sinh 2 k i d sinh k i d cos k i d k i d 4 validation of wave 4 1 regular wave in this subsection the three dimensional nwt is established and the reliability of the sph method for numerical wave generation is verified the scale of the 3 d nwt is 12 m 2 m 1 m length width height wen et al 2016 the initial still water level is 0 5 m the wave maker is 0 2 m away from the upstream boundary and a damping zone is set at 9 m away from the upstream boundary as shown in fig 1 a the second order stokes regular wave is adopted as the incident wave for which the wave height and wave period are h 0 12 m and t 1 2s respectively fig 1 b shows the 3 d wave surface diagram at t t 10 it can be seen that the 2 d characteristics of the incident wave are strong and the damping zone works well moreover it is found from fig 1 c that the profiles of wave surface have the dissipation along the wave propagation direction fig 2 a shows the time history curve of the free surface at fixed position x 1 m y 1 m at different particle spacing it can be seen that the results of different particle spacing are basically indifferent considering the consumption of computing resources and the reliability of the solution model the initial particle spacing is set as dp 0 02 m the smooth length is 1 5dp and the total number of particles is about 1 6 million moreover as shown in fig 2 b 2 d the time history of the free surface simulated by sph is in a good agreement with the theoretical results at different fixed positions x 1 m y 0 5 m 1 5 m x 5 m y 0 5 m 1 5 m and x 8 m y 0 5 m 1 5 m there is no obvious phase difference between the sph and theoretical data this further illustrates that the sph method can be considered as a reliable and feasible method to well simulate the wave motion the wave force on a cc is numerically calculated and compared with the corresponding literature results kriebel 1998 hu et al 2016 the primary parameters of the verification model can be seen in table 1 where the size of the nwt is 12 m 1 2 m 0 9 m and the diameter of the cylinder is d 0 325 m the distance between the center of the cylinder and the wave maker plate is about one wavelength and a damping zone of 3 m long is set downstream of the nwt as shown in fig 3 a the wave force is dimensionless and defined by f x f 0 where f 0 ρgr c hd tanh kd d k denotes wave number r c is the radius of the cylinder d represents mean water depth ρ is the fluid density and g is the acceleration of gravity the top part of fig 3 b shows the wave force time history curve which is calculated by sph model with the results of dbc and mdbc and the sph result of the bottom part of fig 3 b is selected from the data in the top part with only one wave period the bottom of fig 3 b shows the comparison of the time history of the wave force on the cc of the sph dbc and mdbc with the second order theoretical data simulation results and experimental results it can be found from the top part of fig 3 b that different boundary conditions have little effect on the amplitudes of the wave forces on the structure the results of sph dbc are in good agreement with the second order theoretical values as well as openfoam solution results in this paper on the other hand compared with mdbc the results of sph dbc are more consistent with the literature results as shown in the bottom part of fig 3 b the sph dbc model is applied in this study there is a slight numerical deviation in the comparison with the experimental results but the trend is basically the same therefore it further demonstrates the reliability and correctness of the sph method for solving the wave structure interaction besides three different particle spacing dp 0 018 m dp 0 02 m and dp 0 022 m are also presented it can be found that the results of three particle spacing are practically consistent 4 2 irregular wave the motion characteristics of irregular wave are mainly verified in this subsection fig 4 shows the results of the comparison of the instantaneous three dimensional free surface and the wave spectrum at different positions x 2 m x 6 m under irregular wave case in addition the parameter settings of the nwt of irregular wave are consistent with those in section 4 1 where the peak period is t p 1 2s and the significant wave height h s is 0 12 m it can be seen from fig 4 b that the wave spectrum of the sph results is in good agreement with the jonwap theoretical results in which a slight difference in the values can be observed this shows that sph can perfectly describe the motion characteristics of irregular wave in addition fig 5 shows the change of free surface and the change of velocity with time at fixed positions x 2 m y 0 5 m 1 5 m as well as the comparison with the theoretical values the sph simulation results are basically consistent with theoretical results which further demonstrate the correctness and reliability of sph model for irregular wave simulation the width of nwt may affect the mechanical properties of the structure so it is very important to verify the results of different widths dias et al 2017 huang et al 2018 taking the second order stokes regular wave as typical example the interaction of the wave and cc is calculated the influence of different calculation domain widths y d 7 5 15 of nwt on wave force is compared and analyzed as shown in fig 6 the definition of corresponding parameters in this study is as follows f is wave force and f max is the amplitude of the wave force time history respectively the mean wave force and the root mean square r m s of wave force are defined as 17 f m e a n 1 n n 1 n f 18 f r m s n 1 n f f m e a n 2 n where n is the total number of samples the wave force and the maximum wave force are dimensionless which are expressed as f ρgh 0 d 2 8 and f max ρgh 0 d 2 8 respectively here d is the diameter of a cc it can be seen from fig 6 a that no significant phase difference is found for the wave force time history with different calculation domain widths but some differences in the peak value can be observed fig 6 b shows the influence of different calculation domain widths on the maximum wave force the maximum wave force at y d 7 5 is 16 7 different from the result at y d 12 5 while the maximum wave force of width y d 10 is only 3 different from it therefore the calculation domain width of all cases can be selected as y d 10 in this paper 5 problem description on the basis of section 4 2 the size of nwt is set as 12 m 4 m 1 m while the diameter of the cc and the primary cylinder of tpb are d d 0 0 4 m in this paper the center of the cylinder and tpb is located at a distance of 6 3 m from the wave maker and the distance is more than 3 times the wavelength which can reduce the effect of the reflected wave generated from the surface of the structure ketabdari and sepyani 2010 a 3 m long damping zone is set at the downstream boundary the still water level is 0 5 m and the height of the structure is 0 8 m as depicted in fig 7 a the wave maker plate is located 0 3 m away from the upstream boundary and its thickness is fixed at 5 times the particle spacing in addition the setting of the nwt is the same as fig 3 a in section 4 1 in present study the schematic diagram of the tpb and the different rotation angles are shown in fig 7 b the specific dimensional parameters of the tpb are listed in table 2 where the diameter of the primary cylinder is d 0 0 4 m the diameter of the middle cylinder is d 1 0 2 m and the diameter of the small cylinder is d 2 0 1 m in addition in order to conveniently describe the calculation results a basic wave case is defined by wave0 table 3 shows the wave0 specific parameters of the regular wave and irregular wave where the period of the wave0 is expressed by t 0 and the wave height is expressed by h 0 all the data are based on the dimensionless results of t 0 and h 0 in this paper the total simulation dimensionless time is t 20s for all regular wave based on the wave0 case of regular wave the effects of different wave periods t 1 0s 1 8s and different wave heights kh 0 122 0 367 on the force characteristics of tpb are analyzed with different rotation angles α together with different water depths being considered kd 1 224 1 836 furthermore the force characteristics of the tpb are also analyzed based on the wave0 case of irregular wave at different rotation angles α for the wave0 case the particle spacing is also set to dp 0 02 m with a total number of 3 0 million particles and the smooth length of h 1 5dp liu and wang 2020 in order to improve computational efficiency the open source code dualsphysics can provide the code based on the cuda toolkit and run it under gpu acceleration the gpu card nvidia geforce gtx 1080 ti is utilized in this study table 4 summarizes the computing device configurations the calculation time for 20s simulation is about 21 h 6 results and discussions 6 1 force characteristics of tpb based on the wave0 case the wave force characteristics of 9 groups of tpb are studied with different rotation angles α 0 180 and the results of a cc are introduced for comparison as shown in fig 8 before the analysis the dimensionless treatment of the wave force is expressed as f f ρgh 0 d 0 2 8 which also applies to f mean and f r m s for regular wave case the wave force of tpb is significantly larger than that of irregular wave case which is mainly due to the small energy input of irregular wave as the spatial position of the tpb changes the maximum wave force exhibits an inverted v shaped distribution as shown in fig 8 a when the rotation angle is 90 for tpb the maximum wave force reaches the maximum value in fact the region of the wave structure interaction interface is the largest at α 90 it is worth noting that the mean wave force reaches its maximum value for the tpb with α 120 for the α 120 case the time averaged impact of wave on the structure is stronger than that of α 90 which results in larger mean wave force for the irregular wave case as depicted in fig 8 b the average wave force on the structure is almost close to zero compared with the results of regular waves it indicates that the time averaged force of irregular wave on the structure cannot be considered and more attention should be paid to the interaction between regular wave and structures moreover the average wave force is close to 0 when the angle is α 180 for tpb in the case of the regular wave in addition the change of r m s of the wave force is consistent with the trend of its maximum wave force for the tpb the r m s of the wave force reflects the oscillation of the wave force as shown in fig 8 c the r m s of wave force also reaches the maximum value at α 90 fig 9 shows the time history curve of the regular wave force and the irregular wave force at α 90 for the irregular wave force a calculation formula is established by borgman 1967 to determine the spectral density function per unit length of force at a point on the vertical pile based on the sea surface spectral density which is further explained in sarpakaya and issacson 1981 it can be seen from the fig 9 that the wave force time history curve shows a steady periodic change for regular wave while the irregular wave time history curve shows a random change meanwhile it can be observed that the maximum wave force and the r m s of wave force under the action of regular wave are significantly larger than those of irregular wave 6 2 flow field near the tube bundle structure since the tpb suffers the largest wave force at α 90 it has the smallest wave force at α 180 taking the case of 90 as classic examples for tpb structure the hydrodynamic characteristics of the interaction of wave with the tpb structure are explored and the results of the cc are introduced for comparison figs 10 13 show the wave fields of the interaction between the wave and the structure at different times for which the wave surface is rendered with the magnitude of the wave velocity for the convenience of analysis the time when the wave crest is about to move to structure t t 0 7 71 the time when the wave crest is passing through the structure t t 0 7 92 the time when the wave crest is about to pass through the structure t t 0 8 13 are given under the case of regular wave rw and irregular wave irw as well as the time when the wave crest passes through the structure t t 0 8 33 it can be seen from fig 10 that the structure has an effect on the wave motion the diffraction phenomenon may occur when the wave passes through the structure so the wave energy will be transferred from the high energy basin to the low energy basin along the peak line aggarwal et al 2016 2017 2019 and ohl et al 2001a 2001b investigated the interaction between wave and vertical cylinder and found the phenomenon of wave diffraction at t t 0 7 92 and t t 0 8 13 fig 10 b and c there is no obvious diffraction phenomenon around the vertical cylinder but the velocity is large near the two sides of the cylinder it indicates that the lateral sides of the structure are subjected to strong scouring by wave and wen et al 2016 also found a similar phenomenon in particular as shown in fig 10 a a reflected wave generates along the opposite way to the wave propagation direction at the upstream surface of the structure the reflected wave will affect the motion characteristics of the next wave peak there is a certain phase difference between the regular wave motion and irregular wave motion as shown in fig 11 the irregular wave crest deforms greatly in the y direction when passing through the vertical cylinder and it returns to a linear shape when the wave crest leaves for the irw case there is a certain diffraction phenomenon during the propagation of the wave at upstream of the structure for which a semi circular light spot can be observed as depicted in fig 11 b when the wave continues to move to the position shown in fig 11 c the peak of the free surface is semicircular at upstream of the structure and a large diffraction effect can be observed for the tpb of α 90 the contact region interacting with wave increases a lot for rw causing a significant increase in the wave force of the tpb structure compared with the cc case thus its shielding effect on the flank of tpb is strong as shown in fig 12 the scouring effect of the wave is the same as the results of cc for which the impact and scouring effects are more likely to occur at the flank of tpb structure in addition the scouring effect of the wave significantly enhances for the tpb and affects its mechanical properties unfortunately no diffraction phenomenon is found when the wave impacts the tpb structure for the irw case compared with cc the impact of wave on the tpb structure is also significantly stronger furthermore the diffraction phenomenon cannot be observed during the impact of the wave on the tpb structure as depicted in fig 13 in summary it can be seen that the diffraction phenomenon is more likely to occur in cc structure 6 3 velocity vector and vorticity distribution around the structure due to the existence of the tpb the wave motion response and hydrodynamic characteristics change significantly which affects the force characteristics of the tpb in order to further reveal the coupling mechanism between tpb and wave it is very important to understand the velocity distribution around the structure figs 14 17 show the three dimensional velocity vector distribution around the tpb at z 0 05 m at three different times t t 0 7 67 8 0 8 33 and the result of the cc is introduced for comparative analysis for the rw cases it can be observed that there is a strong three dimensional flow effect around the cc and the tpb due to the blocking and shielding effect of the cc and the tpb structure the velocity of the fluid particles of the upstream surface and downstream surface is smaller than that of the flank as shown in fig 14 c therefore the wave scouring is more likely to occur on the flank of the structure which has a similar record in related literature wen et al 2016 it can be found that the fluid particles impact the structure with a larger velocity at t t 0 7 67 fig 14 a the fluid particles with a higher velocity gather at the centerline of the rear surface of the structure at t t 0 8 00 fig 14 b furthermore the velocity vector distribution of the tpb at α 0 is similar to that of the cc which directly leads to the similar wave force characteristics as shown in fig 15 for the case of α 90 for tpb due to the significant increment for the contact region interacting with the wave the wave force significantly increases as depicted in fig 16 it can also be observed that the scouring of the wave mainly occurs on its upper and lower sides for structure which is consistent with the distribution of the wave field when the rotation angle moves to α 120 for the tpb structure the contact region interacting with the wave narrows significantly resulting in a reduction for wave force as shown in fig 17 for the irw case the magnitude of fluid particle velocity is significantly smaller than that of the rw case this is mainly due to the smaller energy input of irregular wave and a small amount of energy can be transported along the water depth direction compared with the rw case it can be observed that the impact and scouring strength of wave is weak on the tpb structure for irregular wave at z 0 05 m it can be found from the findings in section 6 1 that the maximum wave force of α 90 is the largest for tpb structure and the maximum wave force of α 180 is the smallest however the maximum wave force of α 0 is close to the data of cc in order to further analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics of the wave force for the tpb with α 90 fig 18 shows three vorticity components ω x ω y ω z of the fluid particles at different rotation angles and different moments t t 0 7 67 8 0 8 33 the three vorticity components ω x ω y ω z can be defined by 19 ω x w y v z ω y u z w x ω z v x u y where u v and w are the velocity in the x direction the y direction and the z direction for rw case it can be seen from fig 18 that the ω x and ω z around a cc present a symmetrical distribution along x axis of the cylinder however the ω y distribution shows a symmetrical distribution along y axis of the cylinder in addition with the wave motion in t t 0 8 33 the magnitude of ω x and ω y is large for cc indicating that the flank of the cylinder is strongly washed by the wave in t t 0 8 33 the magnitude of ω z is smaller than that of t t 0 7 67 and t t 0 8 0 for the irregular wave the magnitude of the vorticity is significantly smaller than that of the regular wave which denotes that the scour effect of the cc under the irregular wave is weaker than the results of the regular wave for the tpb structure of α 90 at the rw the contact region interacted with the wave increases significantly the ω x is mainly focused on the flank of the tpb structure when the wave moves to t t 0 8 33 the ω y distribution on the upstream and downstream surfaces of the tpb structure is larger than that other cases under the action of the rw the magnitude of ω z is small it indicates that the axial scouring effect of wave is weak for tpb structure moreover the scouring effect in the x axis and y axis directions is strong based on the fact that a large value of ω x and ω y can be found in fig 19 under the action of the irw the value of ω z is also smaller than ω x and ω y and the feeble scouring effect in the vertical direction can be found for the irw case it is very meaningful to understand the time averaged data of the wave field fig 20 shows the distribution of the time averaged velocity along the y axis at specific locations x 6 2 m and x 7 0 m for the tpb structure with different height sections z 0 05 m z 0 25 m and z 0 5 m the abbreviation like x 6 2 m z 0 05 m denotes the monitoring line at x 6 6 m and z 0 05 m taking the bottom of the numerical water tank as a reference point where the height is set as z 0 m the dimensionless velocity in x direction is processed by u 100u t 0 d 0 as well as the velocity in the y direction v and the z direction w for u and v the time averaged velocity of z 0 25 m along the y axis is close to 0 the magnitude of the mean vertical velocity approaches 0 at z 0 05 m at z 0 05 m the time averaged streamwise velocity reaches a large value near y 2 m as shown in fig 20 a in addition the time averaged velocity in x direction is larger than 0 with the position of x 6 2 m and x 7 0 m at z 0 5 m which shows that fluid particles have the same direction of motion it can be seen from fig 20 b that the time averaged v distribution of x 6 2 m is the same as that of x 7 0 m at z 0 05 m at z 0 5 m the time averaged longitudinal velocity of x 6 2 m is symmetrical and opposite to that of x 7 0 m the time averaged vertical velocity w at the upstream and downstream positions reach maximum values near y 2 m at z 0 25 m respectively as shown in fig 20 c meanwhile the time averaged vertical velocity of x 6 2 m is significantly larger than that of x 7 0 m at z 0 25 m in conclusion it can be found that the hindering effect of the tpb on w is larger than that of u and v 6 4 mechanical characteristics of different wave parameters on the structure compared with the irregular wave cases the structure is strongly impacted by the regular wave thus the mechanical characteristics of the structure are only analyzed under regular wave in this section the characteristics of the maximum wave force of tpb structure are mainly analyzed with the special cases of α 0 α 90 α 120 and α 180 figs 21 23 show statistical analysis with regard to the effect of different regular wave parameters wave period t wave height kh water depth kd on the wave force of the tpb structure and the result of cc is also listed the maximum wave force gradually increases with the wave period increasing it reaches a peak at t 1 6s and then gradually decreases slowly as shown in fig 21 a it is worth noting that the maximum wave force is almost identical in the interval of t 1 4s 1 8s for the cc the tpb of α 0 and α 180 for which its interval is called the maximum wave force interval in addition it can be found that the change of the maximum wave force of cc is basically consistent with the results of the tpb α 0 this phenomenon can also be observed in the velocity vector distribution the distribution curve of tpb α 180 is basically below the results of other cases which corresponds to the previous analysis of the vorticity and velocity vector distribution the change of mean wave force with different wave periods is significantly different from the maximum wave force result the mean wave force shows a large jump and reaches the maximum value at t 1 6s as depicted in fig 21 b therefore with the wave period of t 1 6s the time averaged effect of the wave on the structure is greater than other cases the root mean square of wave force represents the oscillation of the wave force time history it can be found from fig 21 c that the r m s of wave force increases with the wave period changing which is same as the maximum wave force result it can be seen from fig 22 a that the maximum wave force basically increases linearly with the changing wave height as the wave height increases the energy of the wave gradually increases which leads to a stronger impact effect it is worth noting that curve of the maximum wave force for tpb α 0 with basically coincides with the results of cc the maximum wave force of the structure is directly related to the strength of the wave impact however the scouring effect also contributes to the maximum wave force as the incident wave height increases the mean wave force and the r m s of wave force gradually increase as shown in fig 22 b and c it is worth noting that the mean wave force of cc is larger than that of the tpb structure at α 0 and α 180 for different wave heights however the r m s of cc is close to the result of tpb with α 0 in addition the maximum wave force increases slowly with increasing water depth and keeps stable with the range of kd 1 38 1 84 as shown in fig 23 a it also indicates that a low correlation exists between the maximum wave force and water depths furthermore the maximum wave force of cc is almost the same as that of tpb with α 90 at different water depth meanwhile the mean wave force of tpb with α 0 and α 90 show a trough at kd 1 38 with increasing water depth as shown in fig 23 b the mean wave force of the tpb with α 120 reaches the minimum value of 0 18 at kd 1 53 which is different from the results of α 0 and α 90 for tpb the mean wave force of α 120 is larger than the result of α 90 the r m s of wave force gradually increases in the interval kd 1 22 1 53 for all cases and reaches the maximum value at kd 1 53 with increasing water depth of kd 1 53 1 84 the r m s of wave force gradually decreases for all cases which is distinguished from the results of maximum wave force in order to further analyze the influence of different wave periods on the mechanical characteristics of the structure fig 24 shows the time history curves of the wave force of the cc and tpb structure with different wave periods the time history curves of wave force have obvious phase difference at different periods the fluctuation of the curve at t 1 0s is obviously smaller than that of other cases in fact the wave force time history curve shows a large peak at t 1 6s the peak decreases by 22 with increasing simulation time this is mainly due to the findings that the structure has an obstructive effect on the wave motion and the wave propagation at the upstream surface of the structure in which the reflected wave forms and further dissipates part of the incident wave energy for the tpb structure at α 90 as the wave period increases the frequency of the peak gradually decreases within the time interval of t t 0 4 12 in the same time interval the number of peak points reduces from 9 to 5 at t 1 0s 1 8s as shown in fig 24 b it shows that the oscillation frequency of the wave force on the tpb is weakened with increasing wave period in the range of t 1 0s 1 8s which can reduce the fatigue loss of tpb and a certain difference in the fluctuation of wave force can be found which is consistent with the characteristics of the maximum wave force 6 5 three dimensional pressure distribution characteristics of tpb it is very important to further understand the three dimensional pressure distribution around the tpb structure and the corresponding results are introduced in this section fig 25 shows the setting of the measuring points wg a wg g on the circumferential wall of the tpb structure under wave0 case of rw at α 90 and 180 the range of each measuring point is z d 0 025 1 25 fig 26 shows the curve of the maximum pressure along the spanwise direction of the tpb structure at each measurement point the dimensionless maximum pressure is defined by p max 8p max ρgh where h is the wave height at wave0 case for the case of α 90 with the range of z d 0 025 0 8 the identical value of p max shown in fig 26 a can be observed at some measuring points except for wg d and wg f for the case of α 180 the overlap of the maximum pressure of each measurement point can be found in the height interval z d 0 025 0 8 which shows a diagonal hook type depicted in fig 26 b however p max fluctuates greatly in the interval z d 0 8 1 25 at α 90 and 180 with the case of α 90 the distribution of the maximum pressure shows quite different at different measurement points this indicates that the wave breaking occurs at the height range of z d 0 8 1 25 and the 3 d characteristics are strong under the action of wave however the three dimensional impact of the wave on the tpb structure is weak within z d 0 025 0 8 and the wave energy dissipates substantially along the depth of the water in addition the maximum value of p max on the upstream surface of tpb appears in the interval z d 0 8 1 25 while the maximum value of p max on its flank and downstream surface appears near z d 0 2 it can be seen that the wave breaking effect mainly occurs on the upstream surface of the tpb structure when the rotation angle is 180 the maximum of p max appears near z d 0 2 due to the wave breaking effect p max fluctuates greatly in the height range z d 0 83 1 25 it can be found that the wave breaking effect with α 180 is significantly smaller than the results of α 90 the maximum value of p max of wg g does not show a jump change in the interval z d 0 83 1 25 which is mainly attributed to the shielding effect of tpb on the wave action the wg h is located at the upstream position of the tpb structure in which the strong wave breaking effect causes large fluctuations in p max with the range of z d 0 83 1 25 in order to further understand the 3 d distribution of the wave force and pressure characteristics of the tpb with regular wave case at α 90 fig 27 shows the spatial temporal distribution characteristics of the pressure along the axial height at different measurement points the spatial temporal of the force coefficients distribution characteristics are also analyzed by zhang et al 2020 the spatial temporal distribution of pressure is composed of many filament like lines and exhibits periodic changes in addition the color shades of filaments represent the pressure value of the tpb surface the maximum pressure mainly appears in the range of z d 0 8 1 25 which is consistent with the results in fig 26 a in the interval of z d 0 8 1 25 some jump changes can be found for p max in the specific region which is called the mutation region mr in fact the formation of the mr goes hand in hand with the interaction between wave and structure which depends on the strength of wave breaking furthermore the occurrence of wave breaking is mainly concentrated in the upstream of tpb so the mr can be observed in the spatial temporal distribution of the pressure of the upstream measurement points the periodic variation of the highlight zone is related to the wave period of the incident wave the core region of the highlight region is mainly concentrated near z d 0 2 in which a large value of the pressure can be observed in order to further analyze the three dimensional flow characteristics of the tpb the spanwise correlation of pressure is introduced which is an important indicator of three dimensional characteristics gabbai and benaroya 2005 zhang et al 2016 it also has significance for the vortex induced vibration of the structure the correlation coefficient is computed as follows 20 ρ z z 1 z 2 ε z 1 μ z 1 z 2 μ z 2 σ z 1 σ z 2 where μ x and σ x are the mean and standard deviation variables and x z 1 and z 2 can be represented at any two different span positions in this section the bottom of the cylinder is used as a reference point so the correlation coefficient of the pressure can be expressed as ρ z 0 z fig 28 shows the correlation coefficients of the pressure of the tpb structure along the spanwise direction at α 90 and α 180 the correlation coefficient reaches the minimum value at z d 1 25 in the height interval z d 0 2 0 8 the correlation coefficient of pressure remains fixed at each measurement point indicating that the three dimensional effect of pressure distribution can be neglected in this interval with the region of 0 8 z d 1 25 the correlation coefficient of pressure decreases rapidly for the case of α 90 the pressure correlation coefficient of wg a is ρ z 0 1 25 0 03 at z d 1 25 the pressure correlation coefficients of the upstream measurement points are smaller than that of the downstream and flank for tpb as depicted in fig 28 a for wg a the pressure correlation coefficient curve is below that of other cases which indicates that it has the strongest three dimensional characteristics among them for wg h the pressure correlation coefficient is 0 48 at z d 1 25 which is larger than the numerical results of other cases it shows that the three dimensional distribution of pressure is small at wg h situated in the flank of tpb with the case of α 180 it can be seen from fig 28 b that the minimum correlation coefficient of wg f is ρ z 0 1 25 0 185 which is obviously smaller than the result of α 90 ρ z 0 1 25 0 22 for wg a the pressure correlation coefficient curve is also below that of other cases in the range of z d 0 2 0 8 which also indicates that the strongest three dimensional characteristics can be observed among them for wg g with a larger value of ρ z 0 1 25 0 53 it is at the most downstream position of the tpb structure for some measurement points apart from the wg e and wg h with the range of l d 0 8 1 2 the pressure correlation coefficient decreases rapidly as the spanwise height of the structure increases 7 conclusion based on the sph method the numerical water tank is established and the wave maker wave making plate is applied to simulate the second order regular wave as well as the first order irregular wave the viscous damping zone is used to realize the wave elimination function by comparing the sph simulation results with theoretical and experimental data the results are in good agreement with each other then the effects of wave with different rotation angles α and different wave parameters are analyzed on the mechanical characteristics of tpb the distribution characteristics of three dimensional flow field around the structure velocity distribution vorticity distribution maximum wave force distribution and maximum pressure distribution along spanwise height are analyzed emphatically the main conclusions are as follows 1 the sph method can accurately simulate the motion of three dimensional wave that includes the regular wave and the irregular wave meanwhile the sph dbc model can accurately obtain the results of the wave forces on the structure with experimental results and theoretical results being introduced for contrast 2 the timed averaged wave force of the structure reaches the maximum at α 120 for the regular wave case the statistical value of wave forces is significantly larger than the results of irregular wave case the changes of the maximum wave force with the rotation angle are consistent with that of the root mean square of the wave force 3 for the irregular wave case the diffraction phenomenon of wave can be observed when it passes through the vertical cylinder the scouring effect of the structure with regular wave is stronger than that of the irw case for cc the ω x and ω z are mainly distributed symmetrically along the upper and lower sides of the structure the strong suction in the region with a large value of vorticity components can be found which leads to a strong scouring effect near the surface of the structure for the irregular wave case the tpb structure has the greatest hindrance to vertical velocity 4 the maximum wave force varies greatly with different wave parameters in which the interval of maximum wave force can be observed with the increasing wave periods and water depth the mean wave force reaches the maximum value at t 1 4s and the variation of r m s of wave force is close to the data of maximum wave force with the change of wave period the frequency of wave force peaks is larger at the small wave period case 5 there is a strong three dimensional characteristic of the pressure distribution for measuring points at different locations in the z d 0 8 1 25 for the tpb structure the 3 d characteristic of the pressure distribution of α 90 is stronger than that of α 180 for which its maximum pressure is significantly higher than that of α 180 the correlation coefficient of the pressure maintains a relatively stable in the range of z d 0 2 0 8 which the 3 d characteristic of the pressure can be ignored in this range credit authorship contribution statement

21164,pile soil interaction affects the pile dynamic characteristics and its response to dynamic loads the one dimensional rod model widely used to analyze the response of pipe pile is inaccurate especially for large diameter pipe piles an axisymmetric pipe pile soil interaction model is proposed to account for vertical and radial displacements of both the pile and soil medium analytical solutions are deduced for vertical vibration of open end and closed end pipe piles under harmonic excitation based on the obtained solutions soil resistance factor srf is defined to evaluate the dynamic soil resistance along the pile shaft the model is verified by comparing its predictions with those obtained from existing solutions the verified model is then used to conduct an extensive parametric study to evaluate the influence of different parameters on the dynamic soil resistance of the pipe pile supported by inner and outer soils the results show that the inner srf is much smaller compared to outer srf it is also found that stiffness factors of srfs of inner and outer soils are almost independent of each other however the damping of inner srf is greatly influenced by

concrete pipe piles are growing in popularity due to their high bearing capacity and remarkable economic advantage de nicola and randolph 1999 liu et al 2009 li and gao 2019a vertical vibration characteristics of pipe piles ai and liu 2017 are important for the design piles subjected to dynamic loads such as applications of machine foundations and offshore structures dynamic interaction between the pile and soil is significant during vertical vibration because it modifies the pile stiffness and generates damping mechanisms of the dynamic soil resistance along solid cross section piles have been sufficiently studied nogami and novak 1976 wang et al 2005 anoyatis and mylonakis 2012 however the dynamic pile soil interaction of the pipe pile is a more complex coupling problem and there is still lack of understanding of its mechanisms especially the coupling effect of the pipe pile inner and outer soil the crux of the problem is to establish a reasonable model to simulate the behaviour of soil and pipe pile for the outer soil winkler model was extensively used to simulate the soil resistance for its simplicity and convenience el naggar and novak 1994a 1994b wang et al 2010 anoyatis and mylonakis 2012 however it ignores the continuity of the soil medium and calibration of its parameters is difficult while they greatly influence the calculated results novak 1974 and novak et al 1978 assumed the surrounding soil as independent horizontal layers extending to infinity in the radial direction and derived the dynamic soil resistance acting along the embedded pile shaft assuming plane strain conditions this model can simulate the basic characteristics of the pile soil interaction el naggar 2000 cui et al 2018 however it does not account for the vertical stress gradient in the soil medium which leads to its poor performance at low frequency to overcome this limitation nogami and novak 1976 proposed an axisymmetric continuum model and defined a resistance factor to investigate the dynamic pile soil interaction nevertheless it only considers the vertical displacement of the soil medium and stress equilibrium in radial direction is ignored wang et al 2005 investigated the dynamic soil resistance considering both vertical and radial displacements of the soil medium and compared the results with those obtained considering soil vertical displacement only they demonstrated that consideration of both vertical and radial displacements provides more realistic predictions of dynamic response of piles this rigorous axisymmetric model has been used to investigate several problems involving vertical vibration of piles ai et al 2016 ai and liu 2015 liu et al 2021 wu et al 2013 for inner soil a one dimensional 1d pile in pile model was initially developed by heerema and de jong 1979 in this model the inner soil and pile were simulated as discretized mass spring systems with frictional forces acting between soil nodes and pile nodes this model was further refined afterwards simons 1985 simons and randolph 1985 however it fails to reflect the continuity of the soil and pile body the additional mass model was proposed to simulate the dynamic interaction between the inner soil and pipe pile system by assuming the pile as 1d rod wu et al 2017 2020 liu et al 2018 and its validity was verified through comparison with experimental results however determining its relevant parameters is empirical and could be inaccurate liu et al 2014 zheng et al 2015 and li and gao 2019b simulated the inner soil as a linear elastic continuum in a manner similar to that of the outer soil model this continuum model is accurate and its parameters can be determined from standard geotechnical tests in order to simulate the pipe pile itself the 1d rod model based on the plane section assumption is widely used owing to its simplicity however it only considers the vertical displacement of the pile body and the plane section assumption can be unreasonable especially for large diameter pipe piles numerical simulations have demonstrated that vertical vibration characteristics of the pipe pile were significantly influenced by the three dimensional 3d effect of the pile body chen and luo 2004 fei et al 2007 lu et al 2012 gazis 1959 established a theoretical model with consideration of the 3d wave propagation in the pipe pile due to the dynamic loads however the pile was assumed as an infinite hollow cylinder which would not conform to practical applications ding et al 2011 2014 and zheng et al 2016 derived 3d solutions of the vertical vibration of the pipe pile with finite length nevertheless only the vertical stress equilibrium of the pile body was considered and the soil models were over simplified it is evident from above review that there is a need to develop a rigorous theoretical model for the pipe pile soil system that can account for the 3d effect of the pipe body as well as the continuity of the inner and outer soil therefore this study proposes a new axisymmetric pipe pile soil interaction appsi model that attempts to accurately account for the 3d effects of both the pile body and adjoining soil the pipe pile inner and outer soil are all modelled as three dimensional axisymmetric continuum with consideration of both vertical and radial displacements based on the proposed model theoretical solutions are derived for the vertical vibration of the closed end and open end pipe piles 2 model description and basic assumptions 2 1 conceptual model fig 1 displays a schematic of the axisymmetric pipe pile soil interaction appsi model based on the cylindrical coordinate system with the origin at the pile top the whole system includes the inner soil cylindrical pipe pile and outer soil e r and e z denote the unit vectors in radial and vertical directions respectively the entire pipe pile soil system rests on a rigid base as shown in fig 1 the pile top is subjected to uniform vertical harmonic load q t q eiωt furthermore the conceptual model can also be extended to analyze the closed end pipe pile by removing the inner soil soil plug from the model 2 2 basic assumptions the following assumptions are adopted in the mathematical derivation of the model 1 the dynamic motion of the whole system is time harmonic under vertical harmonic excitation the pile inner space cavity is full of soil for open end pipe pile while no soil exists in the cavity for closed end pipe pile 2 the pipe pile inner and outer soil are elastic axisymmetric continua with consideration of both vertical and radial displacements damping effect of pile material is ignored while soil damping is accounted for using hysteretic frequency independent damping model 3 top surfaces of the outer and inner soils are free of stress and no vertical displacement occurs at the bottom of the pipe pile soil system 4 displacements of the outer soil approach zero at an infinite radial distance nogami and novak 1976 displacements of points at the central shaft of the inner soil are bounded 5 the pipe pile has perfect contact with the outer and inner soils i e displacements compatibility and contact

exclusive of terms with i 0 and sin then eq 15 can be rearranged as 16 φ b 3 k 0 η s o r sin ξ s o z ψ a 3 k 0 κ s o r cos ξ s o z where a 3 and b 3 are undetermined coefficients by substituting eq 16

satisfying the boundary condition 10a demands that general solutions for the displacement field of the inner soil should eliminate terms including the second kind bessel function k 0 and k 1 because

and outer soils 3 3 4 solving for undetermined coefficients the dynamic motion of the whole pipe pile soil system can be mathematically described after solving the undetermined coefficients in eq 17 a b 26 a b and 28 a b satisfying displacement continuity and stress equilibrium at two pile soil interfaces eqs 7a c and 9 a c are applied to establish a set of linear equations i e 30 x 1 n x 2 n x 3 n

coefficients in mathematical expressions of the displacement and stress fields can be determined by using eqs 30 and 31 for open end and closed end pipe pile respectively 3 4 definition of dynamic soil resistance factor up to now the analytical solutions for the displacement and stress fields of the pipe pile soil system are obtained based on these analytical solutions the dynamic soil resistance factor srf of the pipe pile is defined for open end pipe pile there exist two kinds of dynamic srfs supported by outer and inner soil respectively similar to the resistance factor definition of solid pile proposed by nogami and novak 1976 the outer srf f on is defined as 32 f o n r p τ s n o r r p μ s o u p z n r r p 2 b 3 n r p ξ n η s n o k 1 η s n o r p a 3 n r p κ s n o ξ n

only outer surrounding soil and the definition of the dynamic outer srf is the same as eq 32 but with different coefficients calculated using eq 31 4 comparison with existing solutions srfs obtained by eqs 32 and 33 reflect the characteristics of the pile soil interaction under vertical dynamic load which is very significant for revealing the dynamic bearing mechanism of the pile foundation the srfs are complex numbers with the real part representing the dynamic stiffness and the imaginary part representing damping factor the total soil reaction results from the action of individual mode waves each of which features particular stiffness and damping factors nogami and novak 1976 the stiffness and damping factors of specific modes are discussed in this section to simplify the analysis properties of the inner soil are set to be equal to those of the outer soil in this section specific parameter values of the pipe pile and outer soil are assigned as shown in table 1 they remain constant unless otherwise noted besides the circular frequency is normalized as ω ω d p v s d p 2 r p is the outer diameter of the pipe pile and v s denotes the shear wave velocity of the outer soil medium 4 1 closed end pipe pile for the closed end pipe pile obtained by eq 31 there only exists outer soil resistance by assuming the pile as one dimensional 1d rod and the surrounding soil as 3d axisymmetric continuum wang et al 2005 studied the characteristics of the outer soil resistance the outer srfs obtained by the appsi model are compared with those obtained by wang et al 2005 to verify the developed model to facilitate the comparison the first three modes of the srf n 1 3 are presented and discussed fig 2 a b compare the stiffness factors of the outer srfs for closed end pipe pile obtained by different solutions with different outer radius values fig 2 a shows clearly that the stiffness factor curve features two cutoff frequencies ω o 1 n and ω o 2 n of the n th mode at which the stiffness factor decreases markedly nogami and novak 1976 wang et al 2005 and zheng et al 2017 gave methods to calculate these cutoff frequencies the shear wave generated by the radial motion of the pile propagating in the soil along the vertical direction forms standing wave at the first cutoff frequency ω o 1 while the longitudinal wave generated by the vertical motion of the pile propagating in the soil along the vertical direction forms standing wave at the second cutoff frequency ω o 2 as exhibited in fig 2 a and b the cutoff frequency values employing the present appsi model are identical to that by wang et al 2005 and the stiffness factor curves of the first mode obtained by different solutions coincide these consistencies can prove the feasibility and correctness of the proposed appsi model however below the second cutoff frequency the deficiency between the present solution and existing solution becomes more obvious as the mode number increases especially when the outer radius is increased to 1 0 m as illustrated in fig 2 b that is because the present appsi model removes the limitation of no radial displacement at the pile soil interface made by the 1d rod existing solution and the stiffness factor of the srf decreases accordingly radial displacement at the pile soil interface gets significant for large outer radius which may lead to the failure of the 1d rod solution as a result the developed appsi model is more reasonable for analyzing the pile soil interaction for large diameter pipe piles fig 3 a b compares the damping factors of the outer soil srfs for closed end pipe pile obtained by different solutions for different outer radius values again the damping factor curve features two cutoff frequencies as shown in fig 3 a and b whose values are the same as those in fig 2 a and b below the first cutoff frequency the damping is minimal and stems mostly from material damping rather than energy radiation nogami and novak 1976 after that wave propagation starts and damping mostly due to frequency dependent radiation damping when the frequency increases to the second cutoff frequency the longitudinal wave propagating along the vertical direction forms standing wave as described above which consequently leads to a decrease of the radiation damping after the second cutoff frequency the damping continues to increase proportional to the frequency damping factor curves obtained by different solutions agree well for n 1 nevertheless the damping factor predicted by the new appsi model is higher than that predicted by the existing 1d rod model for high modes and large outer radius as exhibited in fig 3 a and b the reason for these differences is the same as that for the case of stiffness factor after all the excellent agreement with the results of existing 1d rod solution obtained by wang et al 2005 demonstrates the validity of the proposed model and solutions 4 2 open end pipe pile for open end pipe pile there exist outer and inner soil resistance and hence outer and inner srfs calculated by eqs 30 32 and 33 are obtained the same pile soil system parameters shown in table 1 are used in this analysis to verify the outer srf of the open end pipe pile the outer srf of the closed end pipe pile is used for comparison while the existing solution obtained by zheng et al 2017 is used to verify the inner srf fig 4 a b compare stiffness and damping factors of the outer srf between closed end and open end pipe pile with r d 0 3 m and r p 0 5 m as shown in fig 4 a and b the stiffness and damping factor curves of each mode for the open end pipe pile coincide with those for the closed end pipe pile which has been verified previously the consistency of the outer srf of the open end and closed end pipe pile also implies that the existence of the inner soil soil plug has trivial impact on the characteristics of the dynamic outer soil resistance this phenomenon will be studied further in the following analysis fig 5 a b display curves of stiffness factors of the inner srf obtained by different solutions with different inner and outer radius values as depicted in fig 5 a and b the stiffness factor curves of the first mode calculated by different solutions almost overlap and variation of stiffness factor with frequency predicted by different methods is identical these observations indicate the correctness of stiffness factor obtained by the present appsi model however the appsi model predicts a smaller stiffness factor for high modes this is because the boundary condition of zero radial displacement at the circumferential surface of the inner soil stipulated by zheng et al 2017 leads to overestimation of the stiffness factor of the inner srf this also demonstrates the superiority and accuracy of the new model and solutions in analyzing the dynamic pile soil interaction of pipe pile moreover it is noted that the stiffness factor of the inner srf curve does no feature cutoff frequency as shown in fig 5 a and b however there exists a frequency ω z n at which the stiffness factor of the n th mode becomes zero and its value gradually increases with the increasing mode number n the physical meaning of this zeroing frequency has been given by zheng et al 2017 namely that when the excitation frequency is higher than the zeroing frequency the inner soil moves with the pipe pile rather than providing any resistance to further investigate this zeroing frequency we notice that the dynamic inner soil frictional force τ s n i of the n th mode in eq 33 is calculated by linear combination of two modified bessel functions i 1 η s n i r d and i 1 κ s n i r d fig 6 a b display the variation of real parts of these two bessel functions with frequency when r d 0 3 m and r d 0 6 m fig 6 a and b clearly show that the real parts of these bessel functions of the n th mode all decrease with the increase of frequency moreover both approach zero when the frequency is higher than ω b n for the n th mode as marked in fig 6 a and b this indicates that the inner soil frictional force of the n th mode may disappear when frequency exceeds ω b n compared with fig 5 a and b it is easy to find ω b n ω z n under the same r d so it can be concluded that the zeroing frequency ω z n for the stiffness factor of the inner srf is due to the dynamic inner soil frictional force of the n th mode tends to zero when frequency is higher than ω z n which confirms the soil plug moves with the pile and does not offer any resistance when exceeding this frequency fig 7 a b present damping factors of the inner srfs obtained by different solutions with different inner and outer radius values it is clear to see from fig 7 a and b that the damping factor at the same frequency increases with the increasing mode number n as predicted by both solutions however the variation of damping factor of each mode with frequency is quite different for the two solutions as shown in fig 7 a the damping factor of each mode initially attains very low values and then increases gradually with increasing frequency for the existing solution by zheng et al 2017 while for the present solution there exist two cutoff frequencies ω i 1 n and ω i 2 n on the damping factor curve of the n th mode whose values are identical to ω o 1 n and ω o 2 n as marked in fig 3 a as far as each mode in the considered frequency range damping factor remains almost unchanged below the first cutoff frequency ω i 1 after which a sudden increase occurs and then damping factor tend to increase proportional to the frequency at the second cutoff frequency ω i 2 a sudden decrease occurs and then damping factor continues to increase with frequency it is noticed that the variation of the damping factor of the inner srf with frequency is similar to that of the outer srf as depicted in fig 4 b thus it can be concluded that energy of the inner soil resulting from the pile vertical vibration within the considered frequency can be transmitted to the outer soil and dissipated by the radiation damping of the outer soil solution of zheng et al 2017 ignored the coupling effect of the inner soil pipe pile and outer soil hence it fails to predict the significant relationship between the damping factor of the inner srf and that of the outer srf as described above however damping factor predictions by two solutions tend to be consistent after the second cutoff frequency as shown in fig 7 a for large diameter pipe pile with bigger inner and outer radius values as illustrated in fig 7 b cases are similar to those shown in fig 7 a except for more obvious divergence between the two solutions after the second cutoff frequency i e the damping factor predicted by the present solution is much greater than that predicted by the existing solution that is because the existing solution ignored the radial displacement at the inner soil pile interface which may lead to less energy is transmitted to the soil for the relatively high frequency range fig 8 a b compare the characteristics of the inner srf predicted by the present solution with that calculated by zheng et al 2017 as expected stiffness factors of the inner srfs of each mode obtained by both solutions agree well as shown in fig 8 a similarly the damping factors agree well as shown in fig 8 b that is because waves with higher frequency have shorter wave length which may make it more difficult for them to propagate through the wall of the pipe pile so as to be trapped in the inner soil as a result the effect of the outer soil becomes trivial and characteristics of the inner srf mostly depend on the inner soil overall the comparisons described above confirm the feasibility and accuracy of the new appsi model and solutions to investigate the dynamic pile soil interaction of closed end and open end pipe piles as well as its superiority when used for large diameter pipe piles besides it should be noticed that stiffness and damping factors of the outer srf of certain mode can be one or more orders of magnitude higher than those of the inner srf of the same mode 5 parametric analysis to further elucidate the characteristics of the dynamic pile soil interaction during vertical vibration of pipe pile the proposed appsi model and solutions are used to conduct a parametric study when certain properties are discussed the other properties are kept unchanged as listed in table 1 srf of each mode shows the same variation trend as certain properties change to clearly demonstrate the results only the stiffness and damping factors of the third mode are compared it should be noted that the dimensionless frequency used in this section is given by ω ω h p ρ p e p and we only focus on the characteristics of the srf in relatively low frequency because they are more meaningful in engineering practice the stress and strain states of soil vary due to construction disturbance li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 besides confining pressure exerted by the wall of the pipe pile to the inner soil may greatly influence the soil poisson s ratio kumar and madhusudhan 2010 thus the inner soil soil plug always possesses different properties than the outer soil because of the pile penetration hence the outer and inner srfs of the open end pipe pile are investigated considering outer and inner soils with different properties including poisson s ratio and elastic modulus meanwhile considering the different types of pipe pile used in actual engineering practice the influences of the pile radius are also discussed in this section 5 1 influence of poisson s ratio of inner and outer soil fig 9 a b compare the stiffness and damping factors of the inner srfs calculated with different poisson s ratio values of outer and inner soil fig 9 a shows that stiffness factor increases as poisson s ratio of inner soil increases and the zeroing frequency w 0 also increases however it is marginally affected by the variation of the poisson s ratio of the outer soil on the other hand fig 9 b shows that the damping factor notably increases as the poisson s ratio of the inner soil increases but the influence of the poisson s ratio of the outer soil is obvious the second cutoff frequency ω i 2 marked in fig 9 b increases as poisson s ratio of the outer soil increases this is because the damping factor of the inner srf is greatly influenced by the coupling effect of the whole system as explained above and the cutoff frequencies are actually determined by the outer soil properties for the same elastic modulus the soil shear wave velocity decreases and the longitudinal wave velocity increases as its poisson s ratio increases thus the first cutoff frequency ω i 1 decreases and the second cutoff frequency ω i 2 increases however compared to ω i 2 the variation of ω i 1 is too small to be distinguished from fig 9 b fig 9 b also shows that the damping factor below the first cutoff frequency hardly changes with the poisson s ratio of the outer soil indicating that the damping factor of the inner srf below the first cutoff frequency is mostly controlled by the properties of the inner soil fig 10 a and b display the stiffness and damping factors of the outer srfs considering different poisson s ratio values of outer and inner soil fig 10 a and b clearly show that stiffness and damping factor curves of the outer srf barely change due to different poisson s ratio of the inner soil that indicates characteristics of the dynamic outer soil resistance are not influenced by the inner soil confirming previous observations made from fig 4 a and b meanwhile the second cutoff frequency ω o 2 of the stiffness and damping factor curves increases when the outer soil poisson s ratio increases as marked in fig 10 a and b this can explain the variation of ω i 2 in fig 9 b in addition stiffness factor at frequencies below ω o 1 increases as outer soil poisson s ratio increases while the damping factor hardly changes with the variation of poisson s ratio of the outer soil however damping factor between ω o 1 and ω o 2 increases when outer soil poisson s ratio increases but this effect is gradually absent as the frequency exceeds ω o 2 5 2 influence of soil elastic modulus fig 11 a and b exhibit the influence of elastic modulus of the inner and outer soil on the stiffness and damping factors of the inner srf as shown in fig 11 a the stiffness factor of the inner srf increases as the elastic modulus of the inner soil increases especially at higher frequency on the other hand the variation of the elastic modulus of the outer soil has no effect on the stiffness factor of the inner srf this again confirms that the stiffness factor of the inner srf is hardly affected by the outer soil properties the variation of damping factor of the inner srf is quite different as shown in fig 11 b the increase in inner soil elastic modulus leads to the decrease of the damping factor but has no influence on the values of cutoff frequencies as expected cutoff frequencies of the damping factor of the inner srf are closely related to the outer soil elastic modulus e s o both cutoff frequencies on the damping factor curve increase as e s o increases the mechanism for the phenomenon i e damping factor of the inner srf is greatly influenced by the outer soil properties but neither for the stiffness factor is that the stiffness factor only depends on the properties of the pile inner soil interaction while the damping factor depends on the wave energy dissipation and is greatly influenced by the radiation damping of the outer soil fig 12 a and b exhibit the influence of elastic modulus of the inner and outer soil on the stiffness and damping factors of the outer srf the increase of the elastic modulus of the inner soil has no influence on the stiffness and damping factors of the outer srf as demonstrated by the overlapped curves in fig 12 a and b so characteristics of the outer srf are mostly governed by the properties of the outer soil when the elastic modulus of the outer soil increases the stiffness factor below the first cutoff frequency also increases and when frequency is higher than the second cutoff frequency stiffness factor tends to be consistent for different elastic modulus of the outer soil as shown in fig 12 a for damping factor depicted in fig 12 b outer soil with greater elastic modulus leads to a reduction of the damping factor and variation of the cutoff frequencies is identical to that observed from fig 11 b 5 3 influence of pipe pile radius fig 13 a and b compare the stiffness and damping factors of the inner srf calculated for different values of pipe pile inner and outer radii fig 13 a shows that stiffness factor increases as the inner radius increases for frequency below the zeroing frequency but is not affected by the variation of outer radius it is also noted that the zeroing frequency remains almost constant for different inner and outer radius values because it is controlled by the properties of the inner soil fig 13 b shows that damping factor curve displays an obvious increase as the pile inner radius increases however it decreases slightly when the outer radius increases this is because the wall thickness is larger for larger outer radius when the inner radius keeps unchanged which shields inner waves propagating through the pipe pile to the outer soil besides the cutoff frequencies of the damping factor hardly change with the variation of the radii of the pipe pile fig 14 a and b compare the stiffness and damping factors of the outer srf considering different inner and outer radius values of the pipe pile as expected variation of the inner radius has trivial influence on the stiffness and damping factor of the outer srf as well as the cutoff frequencies however stiffness and damping factors increases with the increase of outer radius of the pipe pile the results of the parametric analysis provide better understanding about the mechanism of dynamic soil resistance along the pipe pile shaft during vertical vibration and its relationships with properties of the pile and soil moreover the consideration of coupling effect of the pipe pile inner and outer soil reveals the differences and relationship between the dynamic soil resistance of the inner soil and that of the outer soil observations obtained above can offer useful guidance for the dynamic design of the pipe pile foundation 6 conclusion an axisymmetric pipe pile soil interaction appsi model is proposed with consideration of the vertical and radial displacements of the pile soil system theoretical solutions of the vertical vibration of the closed end and open end pipe pile are deduced based on the developed appsi model soil resistance factor srf is defined by referring to the concept introduced by nogami and novak 1976 to evaluate the characteristics of the dynamic soil resistance results of comparison with existing solutions and extensive parametric analysis show great potential of the new appsi model to investigate the dynamic soil resistance along the pipe pile shaft during vertical vibration the main finds and conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the proposed appsi model can consider the vertical and radial displacements of pile points and coupling effect of the pipe pile inner and outer soil it is more accurate to investigate the characteristics of the dynamic soil resistance along the pipe pile shaft especially for large diameter pipe piles it also should be noted that the obtained solutions and conclusions in this paper are limited to end bearing pipe pile with uniform cross section and homogeneous outer and inner soil 2 stiffness and damping factors of the outer srf of certain mode can be one or more orders of magnitude higher than those of the inner srf of the same mode vertical vibration of the pipe pile is mainly influenced by the dynamic outer soil resistance 3 the stiffness factor of inner srf of each mode decreases as the frequency increases and there exists a zeroing frequency at which the stiffness factor decreases to zero which means the inner soil vibrates with the pipe pile and does not offer any resistance stiffness factor is influenced by properties of the inner soil and inner radius of the pipe pile but is barely influenced by properties the outer soil and outer radius of the pipe pile 4 the damping factor of the inner srf of each mode has two cutoff frequencies which are controlled by properties of the outer soil damping factor is greatly influenced by properties of both inner and outer soils because of the coupling effect of the pile soil system this coupling effect is trivial at high frequency as inner waves are difficult to propagate through the pipe pile wall to the outer soil 5 the outer srf of each mode is evidently influenced by properties of the outer soil but not the inner soil properties there are two cutoff frequencies for the stiffness and damping factors which are identical with those for the damping factor of the inner srf of the same mode credit authorship contribution

21164,pile soil interaction affects the pile dynamic characteristics and its response to dynamic loads the one dimensional rod model widely used to analyze the response of pipe pile is inaccurate especially for large diameter pipe piles an axisymmetric pipe pile soil interaction model is proposed to account for vertical and radial displacements of both the pile and soil medium analytical solutions are deduced for vertical vibration of open end and closed end pipe piles under harmonic excitation based on the obtained solutions soil resistance factor srf is defined to evaluate the dynamic soil resistance along the pile shaft the model is verified by comparing its predictions with those obtained from existing solutions the verified model is then used to conduct an extensive parametric study to evaluate the influence of different parameters on the dynamic soil resistance of the pipe pile supported by inner and outer soils the results show that the inner srf is much smaller compared to outer srf it is also found that stiffness factors of srfs of inner and outer soils are almost independent of each other however the damping of inner srf is greatly influenced by

concrete pipe piles are growing in popularity due to their high bearing capacity and remarkable economic advantage de nicola and randolph 1999 liu et al 2009 li and gao 2019a vertical vibration characteristics of pipe piles ai and liu 2017 are important for the design piles subjected to dynamic loads such as applications of machine foundations and offshore structures dynamic interaction between the pile and soil is significant during vertical vibration because it modifies the pile stiffness and generates damping mechanisms of the dynamic soil resistance along solid cross section piles have been sufficiently studied nogami and novak 1976 wang et al 2005 anoyatis and mylonakis 2012 however the dynamic pile soil interaction of the pipe pile is a more complex coupling problem and there is still lack of understanding of its mechanisms especially the coupling effect of the pipe pile inner and outer soil the crux of the problem is to establish a reasonable model to simulate the behaviour of soil and pipe pile for the outer soil winkler model was extensively used to simulate the soil resistance for its simplicity and convenience el naggar and novak 1994a 1994b wang et al 2010 anoyatis and mylonakis 2012 however it ignores the continuity of the soil medium and calibration of its parameters is difficult while they greatly influence the calculated results novak 1974 and novak et al 1978 assumed the surrounding soil as independent horizontal layers extending to infinity in the radial direction and derived the dynamic soil resistance acting along the embedded pile shaft assuming plane strain conditions this model can simulate the basic characteristics of the pile soil interaction el naggar 2000 cui et al 2018 however it does not account for the vertical stress gradient in the soil medium which leads to its poor performance at low frequency to overcome this limitation nogami and novak 1976 proposed an axisymmetric continuum model and defined a resistance factor to investigate the dynamic pile soil interaction nevertheless it only considers the vertical displacement of the soil medium and stress equilibrium in radial direction is ignored wang et al 2005 investigated the dynamic soil resistance considering both vertical and radial displacements of the soil medium and compared the results with those obtained considering soil vertical displacement only they demonstrated that consideration of both vertical and radial displacements provides more realistic predictions of dynamic response of piles this rigorous axisymmetric model has been used to investigate several problems involving vertical vibration of piles ai et al 2016 ai and liu 2015 liu et al 2021 wu et al 2013 for inner soil a one dimensional 1d pile in pile model was initially developed by heerema and de jong 1979 in this model the inner soil and pile were simulated as discretized mass spring systems with frictional forces acting between soil nodes and pile nodes this model was further refined afterwards simons 1985 simons and randolph 1985 however it fails to reflect the continuity of the soil and pile body the additional mass model was proposed to simulate the dynamic interaction between the inner soil and pipe pile system by assuming the pile as 1d rod wu et al 2017 2020 liu et al 2018 and its validity was verified through comparison with experimental results however determining its relevant parameters is empirical and could be inaccurate liu et al 2014 zheng et al 2015 and li and gao 2019b simulated the inner soil as a linear elastic continuum in a manner similar to that of the outer soil model this continuum model is accurate and its parameters can be determined from standard geotechnical tests in order to simulate the pipe pile itself the 1d rod model based on the plane section assumption is widely used owing to its simplicity however it only considers the vertical displacement of the pile body and the plane section assumption can be unreasonable especially for large diameter pipe piles numerical simulations have demonstrated that vertical vibration characteristics of the pipe pile were significantly influenced by the three dimensional 3d effect of the pile body chen and luo 2004 fei et al 2007 lu et al 2012 gazis 1959 established a theoretical model with consideration of the 3d wave propagation in the pipe pile due to the dynamic loads however the pile was assumed as an infinite hollow cylinder which would not conform to practical applications ding et al 2011 2014 and zheng et al 2016 derived 3d solutions of the vertical vibration of the pipe pile with finite length nevertheless only the vertical stress equilibrium of the pile body was considered and the soil models were over simplified it is evident from above review that there is a need to develop a rigorous theoretical model for the pipe pile soil system that can account for the 3d effect of the pipe body as well as the continuity of the inner and outer soil therefore this study proposes a new axisymmetric pipe pile soil interaction appsi model that attempts to accurately account for the 3d effects of both the pile body and adjoining soil the pipe pile inner and outer soil are all modelled as three dimensional axisymmetric continuum with consideration of both vertical and radial displacements based on the proposed model theoretical solutions are derived for the vertical vibration of the closed end and open end pipe piles 2 model description and basic assumptions 2 1 conceptual model fig 1 displays a schematic of the axisymmetric pipe pile soil interaction appsi model based on the cylindrical coordinate system with the origin at the pile top the whole system includes the inner soil cylindrical pipe pile and outer soil e r and e z denote the unit vectors in radial and vertical directions respectively the entire pipe pile soil system rests on a rigid base as shown in fig 1 the pile top is subjected to uniform vertical harmonic load q t q eiωt furthermore the conceptual model can also be extended to analyze the closed end pipe pile by removing the inner soil soil plug from the model 2 2 basic assumptions the following assumptions are adopted in the mathematical derivation of the model 1 the dynamic motion of the whole system is time harmonic under vertical harmonic excitation the pile inner space cavity is full of soil for open end pipe pile while no soil exists in the cavity for closed end pipe pile 2 the pipe pile inner and outer soil are elastic axisymmetric continua with consideration of both vertical and radial displacements damping effect of pile material is ignored while soil damping is accounted for using hysteretic frequency independent damping model 3 top surfaces of the outer and inner soils are free of stress and no vertical displacement occurs at the bottom of the pipe pile soil system 4 displacements of the outer soil approach zero at an infinite radial distance nogami and novak 1976 displacements of points at the central shaft of the inner soil are bounded 5 the pipe pile has perfect contact with the outer and inner soils i e displacements compatibility and contact

and outer soils 3 3 4 solving for undetermined coefficients the dynamic motion of the whole pipe pile soil system can be mathematically described after solving the undetermined coefficients in eq 17 a b 26 a b and 28 a b satisfying displacement continuity and stress equilibrium at two pile soil interfaces eqs 7a c and 9 a c are applied to establish a set of linear equations i e 30 x 1 n x 2 n x 3 n

coefficients in mathematical expressions of the displacement and stress fields can be determined by using eqs 30 and 31 for open end and closed end pipe pile respectively 3 4 definition of dynamic soil resistance factor up to now the analytical solutions for the displacement and stress fields of the pipe pile soil system are obtained based on these analytical solutions the dynamic soil resistance factor srf of the pipe pile is defined for open end pipe pile there exist two kinds of dynamic srfs supported by outer and inner soil respectively similar to the resistance factor definition of solid pile proposed by nogami and novak 1976 the outer srf f on is defined as 32 f o n r p τ s n o r r p μ s o u p z n r r p 2 b 3 n r p ξ n η s n o k 1 η s n o r p a 3 n r p κ s n o ξ n

only outer surrounding soil and the definition of the dynamic outer srf is the same as eq 32 but with different coefficients calculated using eq 31 4 comparison with existing solutions srfs obtained by eqs 32 and 33 reflect the characteristics of the pile soil interaction under vertical dynamic load which is very significant for revealing the dynamic bearing mechanism of the pile foundation the srfs are complex numbers with the real part representing the dynamic stiffness and the imaginary part representing damping factor the total soil reaction results from the action of individual mode waves each of which features particular stiffness and damping factors nogami and novak 1976 the stiffness and damping factors of specific modes are discussed in this section to simplify the analysis properties of the inner soil are set to be equal to those of the outer soil in this section specific parameter values of the pipe pile and outer soil are assigned as shown in table 1 they remain constant unless otherwise noted besides the circular frequency is normalized as ω ω d p v s d p 2 r p is the outer diameter of the pipe pile and v s denotes the shear wave velocity of the outer soil medium 4 1 closed end pipe pile for the closed end pipe pile obtained by eq 31 there only exists outer soil resistance by assuming the pile as one dimensional 1d rod and the surrounding soil as 3d axisymmetric continuum wang et al 2005 studied the characteristics of the outer soil resistance the outer srfs obtained by the appsi model are compared with those obtained by wang et al 2005 to verify the developed model to facilitate the comparison the first three modes of the srf n 1 3 are presented and discussed fig 2 a b compare the stiffness factors of the outer srfs for closed end pipe pile obtained by different solutions with different outer radius values fig 2 a shows clearly that the stiffness factor curve features two cutoff frequencies ω o 1 n and ω o 2 n of the n th mode at which the stiffness factor decreases markedly nogami and novak 1976 wang et al 2005 and zheng et al 2017 gave methods to calculate these cutoff frequencies the shear wave generated by the radial motion of the pile propagating in the soil along the vertical direction forms standing wave at the first cutoff frequency ω o 1 while the longitudinal wave generated by the vertical motion of the pile propagating in the soil along the vertical direction forms standing wave at the second cutoff frequency ω o 2 as exhibited in fig 2 a and b the cutoff frequency values employing the present appsi model are identical to that by wang et al 2005 and the stiffness factor curves of the first mode obtained by different solutions coincide these consistencies can prove the feasibility and correctness of the proposed appsi model however below the second cutoff frequency the deficiency between the present solution and existing solution becomes more obvious as the mode number increases especially when the outer radius is increased to 1 0 m as illustrated in fig 2 b that is because the present appsi model removes the limitation of no radial displacement at the pile soil interface made by the 1d rod existing solution and the stiffness factor of the srf decreases accordingly radial displacement at the pile soil interface gets significant for large outer radius which may lead to the failure of the 1d rod solution as a result the developed appsi model is more reasonable for analyzing the pile soil interaction for large diameter pipe piles fig 3 a b compares the damping factors of the outer soil srfs for closed end pipe pile obtained by different solutions for different outer radius values again the damping factor curve features two cutoff frequencies as shown in fig 3 a and b whose values are the same as those in fig 2 a and b below the first cutoff frequency the damping is minimal and stems mostly from material damping rather than energy radiation nogami and novak 1976 after that wave propagation starts and damping mostly due to frequency dependent radiation damping when the frequency increases to the second cutoff frequency the longitudinal wave propagating along the vertical direction forms standing wave as described above which consequently leads to a decrease of the radiation damping after the second cutoff frequency the damping continues to increase proportional to the frequency damping factor curves obtained by different solutions agree well for n 1 nevertheless the damping factor predicted by the new appsi model is higher than that predicted by the existing 1d rod model for high modes and large outer radius as exhibited in fig 3 a and b the reason for these differences is the same as that for the case of stiffness factor after all the excellent agreement with the results of existing 1d rod solution obtained by wang et al 2005 demonstrates the validity of the proposed model and solutions 4 2 open end pipe pile for open end pipe pile there exist outer and inner soil resistance and hence outer and inner srfs calculated by eqs 30 32 and 33 are obtained the same pile soil system parameters shown in table 1 are used in this analysis to verify the outer srf of the open end pipe pile the outer srf of the closed end pipe pile is used for comparison while the existing solution obtained by zheng et al 2017 is used to verify the inner srf fig 4 a b compare stiffness and damping factors of the outer srf between closed end and open end pipe pile with r d 0 3 m and r p 0 5 m as shown in fig 4 a and b the stiffness and damping factor curves of each mode for the open end pipe pile coincide with those for the closed end pipe pile which has been verified previously the consistency of the outer srf of the open end and closed end pipe pile also implies that the existence of the inner soil soil plug has trivial impact on the characteristics of the dynamic outer soil resistance this phenomenon will be studied further in the following analysis fig 5 a b display curves of stiffness factors of the inner srf obtained by different solutions with different inner and outer radius values as depicted in fig 5 a and b the stiffness factor curves of the first mode calculated by different solutions almost overlap and variation of stiffness factor with frequency predicted by different methods is identical these observations indicate the correctness of stiffness factor obtained by the present appsi model however the appsi model predicts a smaller stiffness factor for high modes this is because the boundary condition of zero radial displacement at the circumferential surface of the inner soil stipulated by zheng et al 2017 leads to overestimation of the stiffness factor of the inner srf this also demonstrates the superiority and accuracy of the new model and solutions in analyzing the dynamic pile soil interaction of pipe pile moreover it is noted that the stiffness factor of the inner srf curve does no feature cutoff frequency as shown in fig 5 a and b however there exists a frequency ω z n at which the stiffness factor of the n th mode becomes zero and its value gradually increases with the increasing mode number n the physical meaning of this zeroing frequency has been given by zheng et al 2017 namely that when the excitation frequency is higher than the zeroing frequency the inner soil moves with the pipe pile rather than providing any resistance to further investigate this zeroing frequency we notice that the dynamic inner soil frictional force τ s n i of the n th mode in eq 33 is calculated by linear combination of two modified bessel functions i 1 η s n i r d and i 1 κ s n i r d fig 6 a b display the variation of real parts of these two bessel functions with frequency when r d 0 3 m and r d 0 6 m fig 6 a and b clearly show that the real parts of these bessel functions of the n th mode all decrease with the increase of frequency moreover both approach zero when the frequency is higher than ω b n for the n th mode as marked in fig 6 a and b this indicates that the inner soil frictional force of the n th mode may disappear when frequency exceeds ω b n compared with fig 5 a and b it is easy to find ω b n ω z n under the same r d so it can be concluded that the zeroing frequency ω z n for the stiffness factor of the inner srf is due to the dynamic inner soil frictional force of the n th mode tends to zero when frequency is higher than ω z n which confirms the soil plug moves with the pile and does not offer any resistance when exceeding this frequency fig 7 a b present damping factors of the inner srfs obtained by different solutions with different inner and outer radius values it is clear to see from fig 7 a and b that the damping factor at the same frequency increases with the increasing mode number n as predicted by both solutions however the variation of damping factor of each mode with frequency is quite different for the two solutions as shown in fig 7 a the damping factor of each mode initially attains very low values and then increases gradually with increasing frequency for the existing solution by zheng et al 2017 while for the present solution there exist two cutoff frequencies ω i 1 n and ω i 2 n on the damping factor curve of the n th mode whose values are identical to ω o 1 n and ω o 2 n as marked in fig 3 a as far as each mode in the considered frequency range damping factor remains almost unchanged below the first cutoff frequency ω i 1 after which a sudden increase occurs and then damping factor tend to increase proportional to the frequency at the second cutoff frequency ω i 2 a sudden decrease occurs and then damping factor continues to increase with frequency it is noticed that the variation of the damping factor of the inner srf with frequency is similar to that of the outer srf as depicted in fig 4 b thus it can be concluded that energy of the inner soil resulting from the pile vertical vibration within the considered frequency can be transmitted to the outer soil and dissipated by the radiation damping of the outer soil solution of zheng et al 2017 ignored the coupling effect of the inner soil pipe pile and outer soil hence it fails to predict the significant relationship between the damping factor of the inner srf and that of the outer srf as described above however damping factor predictions by two solutions tend to be consistent after the second cutoff frequency as shown in fig 7 a for large diameter pipe pile with bigger inner and outer radius values as illustrated in fig 7 b cases are similar to those shown in fig 7 a except for more obvious divergence between the two solutions after the second cutoff frequency i e the damping factor predicted by the present solution is much greater than that predicted by the existing solution that is because the existing solution ignored the radial displacement at the inner soil pile interface which may lead to less energy is transmitted to the soil for the relatively high frequency range fig 8 a b compare the characteristics of the inner srf predicted by the present solution with that calculated by zheng et al 2017 as expected stiffness factors of the inner srfs of each mode obtained by both solutions agree well as shown in fig 8 a similarly the damping factors agree well as shown in fig 8 b that is because waves with higher frequency have shorter wave length which may make it more difficult for them to propagate through the wall of the pipe pile so as to be trapped in the inner soil as a result the effect of the outer soil becomes trivial and characteristics of the inner srf mostly depend on the inner soil overall the comparisons described above confirm the feasibility and accuracy of the new appsi model and solutions to investigate the dynamic pile soil interaction of closed end and open end pipe piles as well as its superiority when used for large diameter pipe piles besides it should be noticed that stiffness and damping factors of the outer srf of certain mode can be one or more orders of magnitude higher than those of the inner srf of the same mode 5 parametric analysis to further elucidate the characteristics of the dynamic pile soil interaction during vertical vibration of pipe pile the proposed appsi model and solutions are used to conduct a parametric study when certain properties are discussed the other properties are kept unchanged as listed in table 1 srf of each mode shows the same variation trend as certain properties change to clearly demonstrate the results only the stiffness and damping factors of the third mode are compared it should be noted that the dimensionless frequency used in this section is given by ω ω h p ρ p e p and we only focus on the characteristics of the srf in relatively low frequency because they are more meaningful in engineering practice the stress and strain states of soil vary due to construction disturbance li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 besides confining pressure exerted by the wall of the pipe pile to the inner soil may greatly influence the soil poisson s ratio kumar and madhusudhan 2010 thus the inner soil soil plug always possesses different properties than the outer soil because of the pile penetration hence the outer and inner srfs of the open end pipe pile are investigated considering outer and inner soils with different properties including poisson s ratio and elastic modulus meanwhile considering the different types of pipe pile used in actual engineering practice the influences of the pile radius are also discussed in this section 5 1 influence of poisson s ratio of inner and outer soil fig 9 a b compare the stiffness and damping factors of the inner srfs calculated with different poisson s ratio values of outer and inner soil fig 9 a shows that stiffness factor increases as poisson s ratio of inner soil increases and the zeroing frequency w 0 also increases however it is marginally affected by the variation of the poisson s ratio of the outer soil on the other hand fig 9 b shows that the damping factor notably increases as the poisson s ratio of the inner soil increases but the influence of the poisson s ratio of the outer soil is obvious the second cutoff frequency ω i 2 marked in fig 9 b increases as poisson s ratio of the outer soil increases this is because the damping factor of the inner srf is greatly influenced by the coupling effect of the whole system as explained above and the cutoff frequencies are actually determined by the outer soil properties for the same elastic modulus the soil shear wave velocity decreases and the longitudinal wave velocity increases as its poisson s ratio increases thus the first cutoff frequency ω i 1 decreases and the second cutoff frequency ω i 2 increases however compared to ω i 2 the variation of ω i 1 is too small to be distinguished from fig 9 b fig 9 b also shows that the damping factor below the first cutoff frequency hardly changes with the poisson s ratio of the outer soil indicating that the damping factor of the inner srf below the first cutoff frequency is mostly controlled by the properties of the inner soil fig 10 a and b display the stiffness and damping factors of the outer srfs considering different poisson s ratio values of outer and inner soil fig 10 a and b clearly show that stiffness and damping factor curves of the outer srf barely change due to different poisson s ratio of the inner soil that indicates characteristics of the dynamic outer soil resistance are not influenced by the inner soil confirming previous observations made from fig 4 a and b meanwhile the second cutoff frequency ω o 2 of the stiffness and damping factor curves increases when the outer soil poisson s ratio increases as marked in fig 10 a and b this can explain the variation of ω i 2 in fig 9 b in addition stiffness factor at frequencies below ω o 1 increases as outer soil poisson s ratio increases while the damping factor hardly changes with the variation of poisson s ratio of the outer soil however damping factor between ω o 1 and ω o 2 increases when outer soil poisson s ratio increases but this effect is gradually absent as the frequency exceeds ω o 2 5 2 influence of soil elastic modulus fig 11 a and b exhibit the influence of elastic modulus of the inner and outer soil on the stiffness and damping factors of the inner srf as shown in fig 11 a the stiffness factor of the inner srf increases as the elastic modulus of the inner soil increases especially at higher frequency on the other hand the variation of the elastic modulus of the outer soil has no effect on the stiffness factor of the inner srf this again confirms that the stiffness factor of the inner srf is hardly affected by the outer soil properties the variation of damping factor of the inner srf is quite different as shown in fig 11 b the increase in inner soil elastic modulus leads to the decrease of the damping factor but has no influence on the values of cutoff frequencies as expected cutoff frequencies of the damping factor of the inner srf are closely related to the outer soil elastic modulus e s o both cutoff frequencies on the damping factor curve increase as e s o increases the mechanism for the phenomenon i e damping factor of the inner srf is greatly influenced by the outer soil properties but neither for the stiffness factor is that the stiffness factor only depends on the properties of the pile inner soil interaction while the damping factor depends on the wave energy dissipation and is greatly influenced by the radiation damping of the outer soil fig 12 a and b exhibit the influence of elastic modulus of the inner and outer soil on the stiffness and damping factors of the outer srf the increase of the elastic modulus of the inner soil has no influence on the stiffness and damping factors of the outer srf as demonstrated by the overlapped curves in fig 12 a and b so characteristics of the outer srf are mostly governed by the properties of the outer soil when the elastic modulus of the outer soil increases the stiffness factor below the first cutoff frequency also increases and when frequency is higher than the second cutoff frequency stiffness factor tends to be consistent for different elastic modulus of the outer soil as shown in fig 12 a for damping factor depicted in fig 12 b outer soil with greater elastic modulus leads to a reduction of the damping factor and variation of the cutoff frequencies is identical to that observed from fig 11 b 5 3 influence of pipe pile radius fig 13 a and b compare the stiffness and damping factors of the inner srf calculated for different values of pipe pile inner and outer radii fig 13 a shows that stiffness factor increases as the inner radius increases for frequency below the zeroing frequency but is not affected by the variation of outer radius it is also noted that the zeroing frequency remains almost constant for different inner and outer radius values because it is controlled by the properties of the inner soil fig 13 b shows that damping factor curve displays an obvious increase as the pile inner radius increases however it decreases slightly when the outer radius increases this is because the wall thickness is larger for larger outer radius when the inner radius keeps unchanged which shields inner waves propagating through the pipe pile to the outer soil besides the cutoff frequencies of the damping factor hardly change with the variation of the radii of the pipe pile fig 14 a and b compare the stiffness and damping factors of the outer srf considering different inner and outer radius values of the pipe pile as expected variation of the inner radius has trivial influence on the stiffness and damping factor of the outer srf as well as the cutoff frequencies however stiffness and damping factors increases with the increase of outer radius of the pipe pile the results of the parametric analysis provide better understanding about the mechanism of dynamic soil resistance along the pipe pile shaft during vertical vibration and its relationships with properties of the pile and soil moreover the consideration of coupling effect of the pipe pile inner and outer soil reveals the differences and relationship between the dynamic soil resistance of the inner soil and that of the outer soil observations obtained above can offer useful guidance for the dynamic design of the pipe pile foundation 6 conclusion an axisymmetric pipe pile soil interaction appsi model is proposed with consideration of the vertical and radial displacements of the pile soil system theoretical solutions of the vertical vibration of the closed end and open end pipe pile are deduced based on the developed appsi model soil resistance factor srf is defined by referring to the concept introduced by nogami and novak 1976 to evaluate the characteristics of the dynamic soil resistance results of comparison with existing solutions and extensive parametric analysis show great potential of the new appsi model to investigate the dynamic soil resistance along the pipe pile shaft during vertical vibration the main finds and conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the proposed appsi model can consider the vertical and radial displacements of pile points and coupling effect of the pipe pile inner and outer soil it is more accurate to investigate the characteristics of the dynamic soil resistance along the pipe pile shaft especially for large diameter pipe piles it also should be noted that the obtained solutions and conclusions in this paper are limited to end bearing pipe pile with uniform cross section and homogeneous outer and inner soil 2 stiffness and damping factors of the outer srf of certain mode can be one or more orders of magnitude higher than those of the inner srf of the same mode vertical vibration of the pipe pile is mainly influenced by the dynamic outer soil resistance 3 the stiffness factor of inner srf of each mode decreases as the frequency increases and there exists a zeroing frequency at which the stiffness factor decreases to zero which means the inner soil vibrates with the pipe pile and does not offer any resistance stiffness factor is influenced by properties of the inner soil and inner radius of the pipe pile but is barely influenced by properties the outer soil and outer radius of the pipe pile 4 the damping factor of the inner srf of each mode has two cutoff frequencies which are controlled by properties of the outer soil damping factor is greatly influenced by properties of both inner and outer soils because of the coupling effect of the pile soil system this coupling effect is trivial at high frequency as inner waves are difficult to propagate through the pipe pile wall to the outer soil 5 the outer srf of each mode is evidently influenced by properties of the outer soil but not the inner soil properties there are two cutoff frequencies for the stiffness and damping factors which are identical with those for the damping factor of the inner srf of the same mode credit authorship contribution
