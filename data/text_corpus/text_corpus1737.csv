exists but have only an incomplete description of the drivers and or possible management solutions we will be uncertain about future returns from and risks to private and public investments in capital i e social natural economic cultural and political incomplete descriptions of problems or their outcomes limit applications of standard expected utility paradigms 1 where there will be insufficient observations of outcomes to inform beneficial decision making as a consequence investors considering long lived benefits and costs irreversibilities and unique one time investments may favour real option approaches as a basis for decision making 2 however this is usually only true for a small number of projects ibid and in the majority of cases decision makers must compare the probability of future failure with the probability of achieving minimum required rewards to assess risk reduction given the uncertainty of future shocks 3 an example of this problem is any complex agricultural and environmental choice reliant on increasingly uncertain water inputs to exist and function water risk and uncertainty could arise through increased unawareness via changes to the frequency of current state e g drought flood occurrences 4 the reality that expected future water supply states will evolve 5 and or a need to explore how current management solutions may fail in response 1 or tipping points in existing institutional arrangements herein we define risk as known knowns 6 that can be described with some certainty via a probability distribution for example a water entitlement right with expected probability of receiving a full allocation in 90 of years by contrast we treat uncertainty as a known unknown that fundamentally changes identifies existing new probability distributions that trigger altered management responses for example new climatic arrangements that reduce the previous reliability of allocations to 65 of years but with uncertainty as to if when this may occur 1 1 for simplicity this article ignores unknown unknowns that is events about which we have no information when such positive negative water supply is realised water demand may be dramatically altered and optimal management solutions difficult to identify e g non convex outcomes under a motivation by decision makers to protect capital investments the greater the uncertainty i e known unknowns the risker a future water investment becomes and the greater the need to identify risk sharing or mitigating opportunities in such representations decision maker behaviour will evolve in response to varied states of nature e g drought flood events enabling analysts to explore any limits associated with bounded rationality from insufficient observations in support of choices 7 this may allow analysts to identify how people inform decisions via self discovery or heuristics 8 and some clarity when compared with standard expected utility function applications where decision makers may be incapable of accurately distributing probabilities to alternative state occurrences 9 such analysis also provides some capacity to explore decision maker awareness of current possible future state outcomes knowledge about relevant rules of the game and how learning to manage current possible state outcomes drives eventual decision making 10 possible state outcomes may thus occur in individual or combined forms as alternative descriptions of previous states or novel management solutions about which decision makers were previously unaware 3 as such we may be able to explore how decision makers might adapt to sudden and or altered states rather than expected outcomes in this paper we focus specifically on how any failure to understand or appreciate the consequences ofsudden tipping points e g the over allocation of scarce and variable resource inputs given unawareness with respect to thresholds may lead to irreversible capital loss outcomes 11 2 2 this article follows arrow fisher s 1974 definition of irreversible loss which may be both immediately permanent and or subsequent due to a positive rate of time required for regeneration that essentially makes the loss irreversible our motivation for this study draws on numerous recent examples of management response failures in the water sector where decision makers have been surprised by changes to both the frequency of states of nature and evolutions in the volume of water supplied i e the description of the state and have rapidly adapted to avoid irreversible consequences in cape town south africa after three years of drought 2015 2017 domestic water supplies were near fully exhausted through severe water restrictions and a significant rainfall event a critical day zero outcome of municipal supply being shut off was narrowly avoided a similar period of drought 2015 2017 resulted in the alqueva dam in portugal europe s largest water storage facility reaching critically low levels this threatened water supplies to perennial e g olive and almond irrigators who had been guaranteed annual water allocations some restrictions were possible and applied but ultimately a significant rainfall event prevented large scale capital loss finally a six year drought event in california united states 2011 2017 reduced surface water availability for irrigation and municipal users forcing greater consumption of groundwater with groundwater aquifers already heavily depleted increased usage resulted in land subsidence and an estimated irreversible loss of 2 of the aquifer storage 12 as the relevant institutions battled to manage the issue and to come up with solutions for water users a break in the drought meant that supply was reinstated and the pressure to reform was reduced these cases illustrate a common theme where current institutions and infrastructure are being tested to meet the existing demands for water under increasing requirements to deal with new and uncertain water supply patterns increased water supply uncertainty and or inappropriate institutional management arrangements for dealing with scarcity may therefore drive systems to rapidly approach or exceed critical tipping points resulting in capital i e social economic cultural and natural losses increased experience of such outcomes is forcing radical change in management adaptation adoption and or cropping choice sets to prevent water supplies systems reaching critical failure but from a reactive rather that proactive perspective on reflection all water managers should be questioning how these tipping points were so rapidly reached could more have been done to identify these tipping points in advance and what additional radical future management change or strategies may now be needed these answers are not straightforward and involve finer scale commodity data over a long historical record if dynamic change is to be analysed 13 and representations of real world complexity tied closely to an improved capacity to represent and incorporate unawareness uncertainty into institutional arrangements and assessments of future risk 1 however risk and uncertainty do not typically feature in public policy and or private assessments of the future especially in terms of investments even as many contexts commit globally to programs aimed at increased efficiency in the extraction and consumption of water resources this may be because the means to represent unawareness uncertainty in decision making is difficult creating challenges for properly discounting future effects on our current enjoyment of resources and or deliberate disregard of any uncomfortable and or dynamic information via denial dismissal design and displacement 14 therefore in this paper we examine how risk uncertainty has been considered in past investment and irreversible loss assessments based on representations of water input use as a combination of additive risk where any reliance on additional water inputs increases exposure uniformly which we term g and multiplicative risk where decisions to use additional inputs depends on the decision makers relative risk aversion function which we term h and the limits to those approaches we then outline a framework based on stochastic states of nature that is being applied to represent state outcomes as either greater less than some defined threshold which can accommodate tipping point concepts this approach advances our thinking about the role of water as g and h inputs to explore investment risk decision making and the need to better identify critical thresholds we further argue that an appreciation of g and h water input requirements improves our understanding of proximity to critical tipping points better informs capital investment risk exposure and highlights the importance of flexible institutions policies to manage increasingly uncertain futures 2 representing uncertainty in decision making when exploring unawareness and uncertainty with respect to water resources it is important to realise that supply uncertainty is inversely correlated with the total demand for production inputs that is the less water that is available the greater the total demand for scarce resources as the future becomes more difficult to predict e g climate change impacts on both the supply and demand for water a combination of decision maker unawareness with respect to appropriate responses i e behavioural adaptation to incomplete sets of information and natural constraints within our existing institutions to deal with future realised lower supplies of inputs may drive us rapidly towards tipping points that result in irreversible loss in general terms a tipping point is one at which a small change or incident becomes important enough to cause larger more significant potentially exponential or non convex change requiring critical decision making in response examples in the literature frequently discuss socio political regimes 15 climate systems 16 disease epidemics 17 safety parameters 18 and leverage points for public intervention 19 tipping points can also be thought of as a discontinuity between current and future states based on the probability of future state distributions 20 it is the future state distribution notion of tipping points that provides a basis for the thinking in this paper we can begin our discussion using a 21 production function equation 1 that explores the output z of a given system from the use of a single input x 1 z g x h x ε the just pope production function describes both additive risk g x where the distribution of outputs is not linked to the use of inputs and multiplicative risk h x ε where the distribution of outputs is directly linked to the use of inputs in this case the error term ε is often derived from historical data where established i e known mean variance values parameterise a probability distribution function in a monte carlo simulation just and pope 22 23 later challenged the use of mean variance approaches to stylise risk and or uncertainty in their reviews of stochastic production functions rothschild and stiglitz 24 25 also noted the limits of relying on mean and variance by exploring outcomes from choosing between variables that have the same expected value but different distributions their critical finding was that decision makers who fail to understand alternative weights in the distribution of tails may choose riskier rather than safer investments further while the notion of representing risk and or uncertainty as a deviation around a mean number may be appealing for partial equilibrium analysis rothenberg and smith 26 explored how uncertainty alone impacted resource input allocations within a general equilibrium model the adoption of the general equilibrium approach allowed for an exploration of feedbacks on the allocation of capital to maximise profits in response to uncertainty represented by a production function with a random parameter three of their findings ibid p 458 are useful for considering long term capital investment outcomes i short run production flexibility provides the greatest protection against uncertainty ii national income tends to fall if the production function has a random variable with diminishing returns but increases when a plausible production function involves a multiplicative random parameter and iii while uncertainty thus decreases aggregate income the economy will experience both winners and losers put another way the use allocation of water inputs can be risk increasing risk decreasing and or shared inequitably based on the nature of the capital investment 2 1 the state contingent approach to representing uncertainty past exploration of risk increasing and risk decreasing inputs based on mean variance and changes to asset net returns can provide misleading outcomes that may expose public private investment options to tipping points and irreversible loss outcomes how then might that assessment change if we accounted for a future state in which necessary water inputs cannot be reliably sourced i e there is no supply we suggest that a state contingent analysis sca framework offers effective approaches for considering such risk uncertainty unawareness the sca framework broadly allows exploration of how decision makers behavioural responses change for realised state outcomes further the sca framework can enable existing institutional arrangements to be tested for suitability in response to realised or predicted future states that is identifying where institutions may fail to provide appropriate adaptations to changes in state descriptions and or frequency of occurrence insights learned may suggest the need for altered behavioural responses institutions as a consequence early studies used the term states of nature when discussing investment choices under risk uncertainty original work undertaken by arrow 27 and debreu 28 examined how decision makers respond to realised state outcomes e g drought flood events hirshleifer 29 30 further articulated differences between dominant mean variance approaches for representing risk and uncertainty and state of nature approaches to inform investment choice theory according to hirshleifer 29 state of nature approaches reduced the vagueness pg 534 associated with other uncertainty methodologies allowing decision makers to identify both the natural endowments in a given state and any additional required factors of production to obtain an output in that state chambers and quiggin 31 extended the state of nature approach by merging it with dual optimisation to illustrate how resources can be used to optimise input use in all states by time place and type 32 3 3 refers to three input types i non state specific or state general inputs that must be allocated ex ante to the s being realised and which influence z in all s ii state specific inputs that are applied ex post to the realisation of s and which influence z in only that s and iii state allocable flexible inputs costs that are applied ex ante to s being realised but where benefits accrue once s is realised this established what is now known as the state contingent analysis sca approach in sca models nature ω defines the complete uncertainty space and ω can be divided into a series of states of nature s to define real and mutually exclusive sets s which describe that uncertainty ω 1 2 s s importantly the decision maker has no ability to influence which s occurs further a decision makers subjective belief about the frequency probability π of each s occurring is a vector described by π π 1 π s however for each s the decision maker has a set of management options for alternative production systems technology this can be represented equation 2 by a continuous input correspondence x r s r n which maps state contingent outputs into input sets that are capable of producing that state contingent output vector 33 pg 514 2 x z x r n x can produce z for each s the vector of inputs x x 1 x n their prices w w 1 w n and output prices p are known so that revenue can now be represented as 3 v s z s p s s ω while costs are also now represented as 4 c s w s x s s ω and expected net profit across nature ω is 5 e y s ω π v c s ω under the above conditions and with perfect foresight regarding inputs input prices and output prices and where the decision maker s management responses to alternative s doesn t alter we are able to collapse the total nature set ω then once s is realised there is no vagueness about how decision makers should respond as such not only is risk uncertainty completely described but decision makers actively respond to that risk uncertainty by reallocating inputs to obtain known returns this combination of completely describing the risk uncertainty and its outcomes limits the positive negative impact of unknown unknowns this is because when parameterising risk uncertainty unknown unknowns can only be either greater than or less than the chosen parameter for example in the case where total supply of water i e quantity of water is the source of risk uncertainty the state outcome can only result in more or less water than was expected however the severity of the realised water supply outcome may suggest better future technologies for adoption adaptation in response consequently sensitivity analysis could play a role in determining the thresholds at which existing technologies and institutional frameworks fail at those failure tipping points if new technologies emerge over time then a new set of s may be required expanding the total nature set ω 2 2 rethinking total input uncertainty we can now return to the just pope production function equation 1 specifying output as a function of inputs to underline the importance of thinking about water inputs differently recall that inputs in a just pope production function include additive g and multiplicative h risk chambers and quiggin 34 respecified the just pope production function into an sca format as z s g x h x s ε showing that stochastic information may help to explain adaptive decision maker responses to revealed states of nature following that approach mallawaararchchi et al 35 further modified chambers and quiggin s equation into z s ζ s h x s ε where variability is derived from the natural resource base land quality ricardian rent ζ s together with a multiplicative risk derived from a vector of inputs including water this model was used to explain dairy farmer adaptation during drought also in the context of drought adaptation adamson et al 36 separated water inputs into two distinct types i water used to generate outputs and ii water used to maintain perennial production systems i e keep them alive although they did not specify this mathematically herein we merge the concepts from mallawaarachchi et al 35 and adamson et al 36 allowing a further modification of the sca production function to separately account for maintenance and productive water inputs as shown in equation 6 6 z s ζ s g x s ε h x s ε the equation illustrates how z is produced by each s on a given land area using a combination of additive risk from natural soil fertility ζ and two multiplicative risk signals for inputs x minimum water inputs required to keep the capital invested in production systems alive g and inputs required to generate output categories h the addition of an error term ε for g beyond chambers and quiggin s original equation is deliberate to account for the decision makers unawareness of maintenance inputs required in each state the error term can also represent any uncertainty over a decision makers attitude to risk for example a risk averse producer may over estimate g water requirements thus contributing in part to h water requirements logically the equation could also include additive risk from water for greater explanatory power we contend that this relatively simple separation of inputs into g capital preserving water and h productive water to generate output categories extends beyond the simple game theoretic approach used by adamson et al 36 providing a powerful illustration of a range of issues relevant to water resource users managers and policy makers worldwide critically a better quantification of minimum g x input requirements enables more informed decision making as well as some improved capacity to compare and contrast available policy options particularly with regard to future uncertainty unawareness and resource tipping points in the next section we expand upon these initial concepts to explore total input availability how decision making adjustments may be required when inputs reduce by state and the importance of tipping points in systems for informing a range of future public private decision making 3 theoretical relevance of fixed g input requirements we begin with our consideration of total water input availability supply which is conditional upon the revealed state of nature s within a stochastic supply distribution each state has an independent distribution curve which represents the probability of occurrence as well as the stochastic supply of water likely during such events some states s 2 may have a relatively moderate probability of occurrence but result in a significant quantity of input resources other state outcomes s 3 have both a lower probability but with a reduced total input availability importantly note the minimum g and maximum g input requirements illustrated by the solid arrowed line at the base of the figure and the vertical dashed lines at the extreme tails of the outcome distributions these indicate the point at which no further inputs can be used by the system to facilitate productive outputs g or the absolute minimum inputs required to maintain the capital base g hence the distance between a zero input availability and the minimum g requirement in fig 1 for example this could be thought of as the minimum water required to keep a rootstock alive for current and future production if we treat g as the minimum then as stated earlier all available h inputs by state above that water requirement can be used to facilitate productive outputs the sum of g and h inputs will therefore fall along the solid line between the zero intercept and g however it follows that if total supply is reduced then as long as g water input requirements are met some reallocation at the margin of available h inputs will have to occur e g reductions in input allocation between users as total availability falls from h b to h c in fig 2 to achieve this the system must have some capacity for flexibility in its design and arrangements e g market based mechanisms to reallocate resources between users importantly in s 3 the system is moving closer to minimum input requirements g if total input availability falls beyond that tipping point then irreversible capital i e natural social cultural and economic losses may eventuate we can think about this another way if we consider total input demand d for h inputs by state against total water input supply x we can match that to total input availability and movements towards minimum g requirement levels as total input availability shrinks lhs of fig 3 this shows the positive negative as illustrated by the arrows tipping points between state outcomes but that all states of nature are grounded by the minimum g input requirement red dashed line above the grey shaded area we could envisage the grey shaded area as minimum input requirements in water systems for ecological base flows and or conveyance water requirements to ensure system operation from this we can identify how tipping points or changes to the total g input requirement in particular will result in i a significant need for trade offs among existing new users ii an increasing requirement for the implementation of adaptive private public systems to facilitate reallocations where currently not available else iii irreversible capital losses will result to illustrate this point let us shrink our focus to the fixed g requirements from total available inputs indicated by the dotted red lines in fig 4 if the sum of demand for inputs is less than the total available supply fig 4a the more flexibility the system enjoys to cope with shock or changed state events as the system approaches the minimum threshold tipping point fig 4b its capacity to cope will be reduced respectively and the probability of significant change will be increased if the system breaches the tipping point fig 4c recalling that this can result in rapid and exponential change capital exposure will also grow exponentially and the system will likely fail system failures will be especially significant where the minimum water input requirements relate to identified critical functions e g ecological as shown here in the grey shaded area where these requirements are fundamentally breached all other system functions will likely fail under a cascading impact effect resulting in multiplicative capital losses which may also perversely increase during low supply conditions 37 a critical point to note is that tipping point breaches of the system in this example impact heaviest during low supply states fig 4c when systems and users will be most vulnerable to uncertainty and capital losses a d g i s g i b d g i s g i c d g i s g i 3 1 an empirical example we have stated that this simple illustrative theory is both powerful and important for the users managers and policy makers of resource systems as an example of the power of these concepts we next examine the transformation that has occurred in the australian almond industry over the last two decades fig 5 perennial crops such as almonds require substantial capital investment and survive for decades they cannot be fallowed during drought without significant economic losses resulting in demand hardening for critical inputs 38 but they also generate more revenue per unit of water used 39 our illustrative australian example explores how the changing demand for g water inputs has rapidly increased as fruit bearing trees or those aged six years and older have reached maturity it seems likely that during the height of the millennium drought 2005 06 to 2008 09 several factors comparatively high almond commodity prices severe restrictions on the supply of agricultural water and government packages to structurally adjust combined to transform land use from traditional cropping e g 35 reduction in winegrapes between 2005 and 2017 40 to new almond plantings with lower water requirements until fully matured i e new perennial plantings between 2005 and 2008 new plantings comprised up to 30 of total area this resulted in a step change and by 2011 production had reached around 58 000 kernel tonnes by 2020 the almond industry estimates that production will be around 100 000 kernel tonnes requiring an area of about 48 000 ha of trees 41 we note that the linear demand trend line superimposed onto fig 5 dotted line may suggest a change in total water requirements leading toward a potential tipping point dependent upon where that g input supply point might be in fact the almond industry does have some idea with respect to tipping point water supply levels in the united states studies have set a minimum g for almonds crops at 50 of total water inputs 13 for australia brown 42 suggests a tipping point of 3 80 megalitres ml one million litres or 0 810 acre foot per hectare ha and that most growers prefer to have at least 5 04ml ha as a minimum supply to prevent future yield losses on the basis of industry estimates suggesting mature irrigated crops in australia consume 14ml ha 41 using this figure and the number of hectares planted over time we can see that the industry has a g tipping point of approximately 26 of typical water supply and a preferred minimum supply of at least 36 this allows us to calculate a range of g water requirements across the above industry planting values to identify minimum supply values to maintain industry perennial rootstock fig 6 we can note an initial step wise shift in the g water requirements following new plantings in 2003 then later step wide shifts which have increased potential water requirements between 85 gl gl or billion megalitres and 120 gl in 2007 to between 176 gl 26 and 244 gl 36 by 2020 the slightly more pronounced exponential increase from 2015 to 2020 based on industry forecasts is particularly worrying in this regard however we do not fully understand how this changes for almond crop planting density differences different scales i e basin catchment or local area how this may be affected by scope issues such as efficiency changes or sectoral adjustment incentives how different users may adapt and adjust independently in the face of uncertain outcomes and or how climate change may impact upon these issues to shift water supply and demand in the future this provides us with a great deal of future uncertainty that must be addressed urgently as the australian almond industry experiences step changes in water demand to service now largely matured tree stocks during periods of low water supply many new industry decision makers will likely be unaware of their total set of adaptation management strategies in the short run this may lead to a willingness to pay prices well above market average to secure water inputs and preserve capital 36 however if those markets are unable to fully satisfy water demand decision makers faced with extreme downside risk 43 may feel justified in extracting water illegally from other users including the environment this may place increased pressure on existing institutions to protect non economic rights and prevent natural social and cultural capital losses alternatively in the absence of these two former solutions farm decision makers may create a substantial rural debt bomb which may ultimately have to be met by national interventions as the insurer of last resort these issues are expanded upon in the next section 4 discussion the theory and basic empirical analysis outlined above suggest a number of issues that could drive a future research agenda these issues include 4 1 increased incorporation of uncertainty into investment assessments here we return to our earlier discussion of state contingent analysis sca as a useful tool for incorporating uncertainty unawareness into models of resource use and decision making and for informing future choices the recent improvements discussed in section 2 2 above which define uncertainty unawareness outcomes that are greater or less than a minimum g tipping point enable analysts to better optimise allocation choices for various constraints or objectives alternatively reversing the process that is specifying a management strategy in advance and evaluating it against tipping point outcomes is also possible however both outcomes in this instance are predicated on the availability of good quality data and best practice water accounting approaches to resource management therefore as our appreciation of the need to incorporate uncertainty unawareness into public policy grows there is an urgent requirement to collect useful data on the minimum g inputs for a range of issues to implement proper water accounting arrangements and to explore tipping point outcomes including supply or other shocks e g high prices using sca techniques for example a current global focus on water use efficiency investments both privately and publicly to free up scarce water resources for use elsewhere may be pushing systems towards tipping points where previous supply buffers in the system no longer exist reducing total system capacity to cope with future supply shortages investments in augmented input storage e g dams and weirs in river systems may also perversely exacerbate these problems by increasing total demand for g inputs under expectations of increased reliability and supply capacity 44 hence in the context of real options theory which looks at trigger prices under a capacity to suspend production during periods of unfavourable conditions or avoid investment totally 45 it may instead be useful to couple sca and benefit cost analysis bca techniques to explore longer term investment planning and the impact of shocks on private investment choices sca bca combined analysis may provide some capacity to examine minimum input levels i e h inputs above fixed minimum g inputs needed to achieve npv 0 breakeven outcomes for investment options this could increase our capacity for evaluating investment choice options to sustain capital or rebound from shock events prior to committing to an investment and should thus feature in future sca research 4 2 adaptive institutions an alternative form of investment assessment especially for public institutions may involve the use of transaction costs put simply private transaction costs can be thought of as the price of contracting between parties but at the public policy scale we can define transaction costs as the expenditure required to design test and administer a public policy together with the costs of monitoring performance and altering policy arrangements should it become necessary in future if we are constrained in our capacity to alter future policy then this is an example of lock in transition costs to minimise lock in costs and enable institutional arrangements capable of coping with future risk uncertainty we must identify and develop adaptive public institutions via comparative analysis theory in support of adaptive institutions has recently emerged 46 and some empirical transaction cost analysis tca in support of that theory using ex post examinations of historic investments and state outcomes has thus far been conducted 47 more study is needed but at present the capacity to incorporate future risk uncertainty is limited thus similar to the combined research approach discussed above a coupled sca tca framework including optimisation and or bca could offer similar public policy investment assessment opportunities further adaptive policy ideas could also be parameterised for inclusion as constraints or other objective functions in the model and then tested against state outcomes as defined in the sca framework to identify potential policy failure points this has important implications for public resource managers suggesting that this too should feature in future sca research 4 3 expanded scope as a basis for identifying future risk uncertainty for many contexts these issues will seem distant and challenging suggesting that they can be safely ignored or delayed due to insufficient current evidence or indicators of tipping point thresholds yet where insufficient evidence or data in support of robust policy investment choices exists appropriate decision making will suffer under an inability to adequately represent and consider risk or uncertainty in such contexts it may be useful to identify more advanced stage jurisdictions that have dealt with these issues to determine what lessons could be applied locally this may highlight potential transformations toward inflexible future arrangements e g policy lock in 48 novel arrangements for dealing with future uncertainty risk and or growing requirements for adaptation especially where risk assessments do not typically feature in current policy assurance review processes an example of this may relate to minimum base flow requirements as discussed above with respect to conveyance water to deliver minimum g water and which may be several multiples of that minimum volume fig 3 early attempts to address environmental water input requirements in australia focused on planned water where legislation and regulation was altered to accommodate and legally ensure minimum river flows while in practice this was somewhat possible in river systems downstream of large dam storage facilities in other areas the absence of river infrastructure has made maintaining minimum system flows in support of ecological functions more challenging this has been highlighted in two recent reports investigating large scale fish deaths along the darling river system in south western new south wales 49 50 where upstream large scale infrastructure does not exist planned water has thus been identified as a useful concept within regulated river systems but of less value outside those areas further while market based reallocations have resulted in the transfer of water to create large quantities of actual environmental rights alternative measures are still needed to supply base flows in unregulated systems this continues to be a focus of research and planning work in australia with important links to the sca framework ultimately it may be necessary to install prioritised rights to environmental water to ensure that so called lower or temporally newer rights are fully properly recognised with regard to their higher role in providing a fundamental base for water systems as well as ensuring that other users do not rely on those rights as a source of risk minimisation during low supply states of nature instead it may be necessary to implement greater private risk mitigation responsibilities on consumptive water users as a means of adaptation to future supply uncertainty 45 this will be especially important where consumptive users continue to ignore system limits tipping point risks and or call for access to supply under fair share principles during low supply periods 4 4 incentives to act illegally as we have seen from the earlier illustrative example there has been some transformation of land use in australia where winegrapes have reduced their area and almonds appear to have replaced them however while both crops are perennials they experience different water input needs winegrapes average approximately 7 ml ha while almonds use 14 ml ha thus while the transformation of land use may be roughly equivalent the change in water use is not putting aside issues of possible future water delivery constraints under those changes it is foreseeable that almond producers faced with supply shortages or shocks may have to pay significant future market prices to secure minimum g inputs and avoid irreversible capital loss tipping points as discussed by adamson et al 36 alternatively in the context of poor monitoring and compliance arrangements in many of australia s river systems 51 producers may opt to extract water illegally without adequate legal protection and enforcement all other right owners may face considerable risk along with natural capital and national welfare gains this would result in a system comprising significant winners and losers consistent with rothenberg and smith 26 and increased future uncertainty of sustainable water supply systems into the future agricultural water theft is not well studied in the literature and as such requires further examination and thought with regard to risk uncertainty and unawareness drivers contingent upon scale and temporal effects it may be possible to include as a shock parameter in future sca model analyses 4 5 a limitation to consider finally a word of caution while we have espoused the value of the sca framework for representing and incorporating risk uncertainty into assessments it must be noted that the framework presented here assumes a single decision maker that is possessed of perfect foresight a heroic assumption but much the same limitations apply to other models that attempt to shed light on these issues e g positive mathematical programming 52 or agent based models 53 high quality data consultation with stakeholders and actual decision makers and careful iteration at all development steps of the model may assist to overcome some of these limits however the realities comprised of problem scale capacity to represent the full scope of relevant issues and temporal changes will always be at odds with modelled outcomes just as mean variance values have been previously viewed as inadequate representations of uncertainty unawareness so too the peril of the single number answer when seeking to inform decision makers these constraints on our capacity to interact with and inform both private and public decision makers must also feature in our future sca model development and output discussions as an example future modelling work may explore over watering decision responses based on an individual s multiplicative risk attitudes 5 conclusion future analysis of water resource issues must include strategies for exploring uncertainty a recent separation of water resource inputs into two major functions that protect capital and generate outputs provides a novel insight into adaptation and the rationale for decision making that does not conform to expected utility paradigms non convex solutions the capacity of sca to model these non convex behavioural responses within each state of nature helps explore what may occur at the farm scale level as individuals reallocate water resources in response to alternative supply states by examining individual actions industry wide transformations from market or policy signals and the capacity of institutions to respond to expected future states of nature researchers may be able to examine a variety of potential tipping points at management basin scale levels within a free market based economy many contexts will experience a reduced capacity to use command and control methods to constrain production system growth this will drive an increased requirement to explore and test new policy or program arrangements and their capacity to cope with risky or uncertain outcomes i e their capacity to reduce or address future unawareness about the risk to capital for example as we struggle with tried and recurring policy political responses to realised droughts and drought relief this remains an on going debate we may be willing to tolerate losses for a period or even total loss of capital in some cases although repeated requirements to meet increased private debt in the agricultural sector by public funders may test this resolve especially where the incidence of acting as an insurer of last resort grows exponentially under risky and uncertain tipping point outcomes such repeated bail out requirements reduce the efficient sustainable and resilient nature of many local global objectives thus a greater appreciation of future tipping points may be helpful for avoiding such outcomes reducing total losses and identifying the juncture at which risk sharing responsibility must finally shift in this paper we have explored the development of analytical approaches to risk and uncertainty with respect to water investment and decision making assessments and presented a powerful separation of water inputs into their fundamental roles while this approach may be relevant in other applications e g fishing limits biosecurity pest impacts energy limits environmental watering applications we contend that there is considerable future scope for further research examining the implications of resource separation in the water context especially a range of initial research requirements have been proposed and where the scarcity of total water requirement becomes clearer and the demand for water grows daily there is an urgent need to follow these suggestions to inform

exists but have only an incomplete description of the drivers and or possible management solutions we will be uncertain about future returns from and risks to private and public investments in capital i e social natural economic cultural and political incomplete descriptions of problems or their outcomes limit applications of standard expected utility paradigms 1 where there will be insufficient observations of outcomes to inform beneficial decision making as a consequence investors considering long lived benefits and costs irreversibilities and unique one time investments may favour real option approaches as a basis for decision making 2 however this is usually only true for a small number of projects ibid and in the majority of cases decision makers must compare the probability of future failure with the probability of achieving minimum required rewards to assess risk reduction given the uncertainty of future shocks 3 an example of this problem is any complex agricultural and environmental choice reliant on increasingly uncertain water inputs to exist and function water risk and uncertainty could arise through increased unawareness via changes to the frequency of current state e g drought flood occurrences 4 the reality that expected future water supply states will evolve 5 and or a need to explore how current management solutions may fail in response 1 or tipping points in existing institutional arrangements herein we define risk as known knowns 6 that can be described with some certainty via a probability distribution for example a water entitlement right with expected probability of receiving a full allocation in 90 of years by contrast we treat uncertainty as a known unknown that fundamentally changes identifies existing new probability distributions that trigger altered management responses for example new climatic arrangements that reduce the previous reliability of allocations to 65 of years but with uncertainty as to if when this may occur 1 1 for simplicity this article ignores unknown unknowns that is events about which we have no information when such positive negative water supply is realised water demand may be dramatically altered and optimal management solutions difficult to identify e g non convex outcomes under a motivation by decision makers to protect capital investments the greater the uncertainty i e known unknowns the risker a future water investment becomes and the greater the need to identify risk sharing or mitigating opportunities in such representations decision maker behaviour will evolve in response to varied states of nature e g drought flood events enabling analysts to explore any limits associated with bounded rationality from insufficient observations in support of choices 7 this may allow analysts to identify how people inform decisions via self discovery or heuristics 8 and some clarity when compared with standard expected utility function applications where decision makers may be incapable of accurately distributing probabilities to alternative state occurrences 9 such analysis also provides some capacity to explore decision maker awareness of current possible future state outcomes knowledge about relevant rules of the game and how learning to manage current possible state outcomes drives eventual decision making 10 possible state outcomes may thus occur in individual or combined forms as alternative descriptions of previous states or novel management solutions about which decision makers were previously unaware 3 as such we may be able to explore how decision makers might adapt to sudden and or altered states rather than expected outcomes in this paper we focus specifically on how any failure to understand or appreciate the consequences ofsudden tipping points e g the over allocation of scarce and variable resource inputs given unawareness with respect to thresholds may lead to irreversible capital loss outcomes 11 2 2 this article follows arrow fisher s 1974 definition of irreversible loss which may be both immediately permanent and or subsequent due to a positive rate of time required for regeneration that essentially makes the loss irreversible our motivation for this study draws on numerous recent examples of management response failures in the water sector where decision makers have been surprised by changes to both the frequency of states of nature and evolutions in the volume of water supplied i e the description of the state and have rapidly adapted to avoid irreversible consequences in cape town south africa after three years of drought 2015 2017 domestic water supplies were near fully exhausted through severe water restrictions and a significant rainfall event a critical day zero outcome of municipal supply being shut off was narrowly avoided a similar period of drought 2015 2017 resulted in the alqueva dam in portugal europe s largest water storage facility reaching critically low levels this threatened water supplies to perennial e g olive and almond irrigators who had been guaranteed annual water allocations some restrictions were possible and applied but ultimately a significant rainfall event prevented large scale capital loss finally a six year drought event in california united states 2011 2017 reduced surface water availability for irrigation and municipal users forcing greater consumption of groundwater with groundwater aquifers already heavily depleted increased usage resulted in land subsidence and an estimated irreversible loss of 2 of the aquifer storage 12 as the relevant institutions battled to manage the issue and to come up with solutions for water users a break in the drought meant that supply was reinstated and the pressure to reform was reduced these cases illustrate a common theme where current institutions and infrastructure are being tested to meet the existing demands for water under increasing requirements to deal with new and uncertain water supply patterns increased water supply uncertainty and or inappropriate institutional management arrangements for dealing with scarcity may therefore drive systems to rapidly approach or exceed critical tipping points resulting in capital i e social economic cultural and natural losses increased experience of such outcomes is forcing radical change in management adaptation adoption and or cropping choice sets to prevent water supplies systems reaching critical failure but from a reactive rather that proactive perspective on reflection all water managers should be questioning how these tipping points were so rapidly reached could more have been done to identify these tipping points in advance and what additional radical future management change or strategies may now be needed these answers are not straightforward and involve finer scale commodity data over a long historical record if dynamic change is to be analysed 13 and representations of real world complexity tied closely to an improved capacity to represent and incorporate unawareness uncertainty into institutional arrangements and assessments of future risk 1 however risk and uncertainty do not typically feature in public policy and or private assessments of the future especially in terms of investments even as many contexts commit globally to programs aimed at increased efficiency in the extraction and consumption of water resources this may be because the means to represent unawareness uncertainty in decision making is difficult creating challenges for properly discounting future effects on our current enjoyment of resources and or deliberate disregard of any uncomfortable and or dynamic information via denial dismissal design and displacement 14 therefore in this paper we examine how risk uncertainty has been considered in past investment and irreversible loss assessments based on representations of water input use as a combination of additive risk where any reliance on additional water inputs increases exposure uniformly which we term g and multiplicative risk where decisions to use additional inputs depends on the decision makers relative risk aversion function which we term h and the limits to those approaches we then outline a framework based on stochastic states of nature that is being applied to represent state outcomes as either greater less than some defined threshold which can accommodate tipping point concepts this approach advances our thinking about the role of water as g and h inputs to explore investment risk decision making and the need to better identify critical thresholds we further argue that an appreciation of g and h water input requirements improves our understanding of proximity to critical tipping points better informs capital investment risk exposure and highlights the importance of flexible institutions policies to manage increasingly uncertain futures 2 representing uncertainty in decision making when exploring unawareness and uncertainty with respect to water resources it is important to realise that supply uncertainty is inversely correlated with the total demand for production inputs that is the less water that is available the greater the total demand for scarce resources as the future becomes more difficult to predict e g climate change impacts on both the supply and demand for water a combination of decision maker unawareness with respect to appropriate responses i e behavioural adaptation to incomplete sets of information and natural constraints within our existing institutions to deal with future realised lower supplies of inputs may drive us rapidly towards tipping points that result in irreversible loss in general terms a tipping point is one at which a small change or incident becomes important enough to cause larger more significant potentially exponential or non convex change requiring critical decision making in response examples in the literature frequently discuss socio political regimes 15 climate systems 16 disease epidemics 17 safety parameters 18 and leverage points for public intervention 19 tipping points can also be thought of as a discontinuity between current and future states based on the probability of future state distributions 20 it is the future state distribution notion of tipping points that provides a basis for the thinking in this paper we can begin our discussion using a 21 production function equation 1 that explores the output z of a given system from the use of a single input x 1 z g x h x ε the just pope production function describes both additive risk g x where the distribution of outputs is not linked to the use of inputs and multiplicative risk h x ε where the distribution of outputs is directly linked to the use of inputs in this case the error term ε is often derived from historical data where established i e known mean variance values parameterise a probability distribution function in a monte carlo simulation just and pope 22 23 later challenged the use of mean variance approaches to stylise risk and or uncertainty in their reviews of stochastic production functions rothschild and stiglitz 24 25 also noted the limits of relying on mean and variance by exploring outcomes from choosing between variables that have the same expected value but different distributions their critical finding was that decision makers who fail to understand alternative weights in the distribution of tails may choose riskier rather than safer investments further while the notion of representing risk and or uncertainty as a deviation around a mean number may be appealing for partial equilibrium analysis rothenberg and smith 26 explored how uncertainty alone impacted resource input allocations within a general equilibrium model the adoption of the general equilibrium approach allowed for an exploration of feedbacks on the allocation of capital to maximise profits in response to uncertainty represented by a production function with a random parameter three of their findings ibid p 458 are useful for considering long term capital investment outcomes i short run production flexibility provides the greatest protection against uncertainty ii national income tends to fall if the production function has a random variable with diminishing returns but increases when a plausible production function involves a multiplicative random parameter and iii while uncertainty thus decreases aggregate income the economy will experience both winners and losers put another way the use allocation of water inputs can be risk increasing risk decreasing and or shared inequitably based on the nature of the capital investment 2 1 the state contingent approach to representing uncertainty past exploration of risk increasing and risk decreasing inputs based on mean variance and changes to asset net returns can provide misleading outcomes that may expose public private investment options to tipping points and irreversible loss outcomes how then might that assessment change if we accounted for a future state in which necessary water inputs cannot be reliably sourced i e there is no supply we suggest that a state contingent analysis sca framework offers effective approaches for considering such risk uncertainty unawareness the sca framework broadly allows exploration of how decision makers behavioural responses change for realised state outcomes further the sca framework can enable existing institutional arrangements to be tested for suitability in response to realised or predicted future states that is identifying where institutions may fail to provide appropriate adaptations to changes in state descriptions and or frequency of occurrence insights learned may suggest the need for altered behavioural responses institutions as a consequence early studies used the term states of nature when discussing investment choices under risk uncertainty original work undertaken by arrow 27 and debreu 28 examined how decision makers respond to realised state outcomes e g drought flood events hirshleifer 29 30 further articulated differences between dominant mean variance approaches for representing risk and uncertainty and state of nature approaches to inform investment choice theory according to hirshleifer 29 state of nature approaches reduced the vagueness pg 534 associated with other uncertainty methodologies allowing decision makers to identify both the natural endowments in a given state and any additional required factors of production to obtain an output in that state chambers and quiggin 31 extended the state of nature approach by merging it with dual optimisation to illustrate how resources can be used to optimise input use in all states by time place and type 32 3 3 refers to three input types i non state specific or state general inputs that must be allocated ex ante to the s being realised and which influence z in all s ii state specific inputs that are applied ex post to the realisation of s and which influence z in only that s and iii state allocable flexible inputs costs that are applied ex ante to s being realised but where benefits accrue once s is realised this established what is now known as the state contingent analysis sca approach in sca models nature ω defines the complete uncertainty space and ω can be divided into a series of states of nature s to define real and mutually exclusive sets s which describe that uncertainty ω 1 2 s s importantly the decision maker has no ability to influence which s occurs further a decision makers subjective belief about the frequency probability π of each s occurring is a vector described by π π 1 π s however for each s the decision maker has a set of management options for alternative production systems technology this can be represented equation 2 by a continuous input correspondence x r s r n which maps state contingent outputs into input sets that are capable of producing that state contingent output vector 33 pg 514 2 x z x r n x can produce z for each s the vector of inputs x x 1 x n their prices w w 1 w n and output prices p are known so that revenue can now be represented as 3 v s z s p s s ω while costs are also now represented as 4 c s w s x s s ω and expected net profit across nature ω is 5 e y s ω π v c s ω under the above conditions and with perfect foresight regarding inputs input prices and output prices and where the decision maker s management responses to alternative s doesn t alter we are able to collapse the total nature set ω then once s is realised there is no vagueness about how decision makers should respond as such not only is risk uncertainty completely described but decision makers actively respond to that risk uncertainty by reallocating inputs to obtain known returns this combination of completely describing the risk uncertainty and its outcomes limits the positive negative impact of unknown unknowns this is because when parameterising risk uncertainty unknown unknowns can only be either greater than or less than the chosen parameter for example in the case where total supply of water i e quantity of water is the source of risk uncertainty the state outcome can only result in more or less water than was expected however the severity of the realised water supply outcome may suggest better future technologies for adoption adaptation in response consequently sensitivity analysis could play a role in determining the thresholds at which existing technologies and institutional frameworks fail at those failure tipping points if new technologies emerge over time then a new set of s may be required expanding the total nature set ω 2 2 rethinking total input uncertainty we can now return to the just pope production function equation 1 specifying output as a function of inputs to underline the importance of thinking about water inputs differently recall that inputs in a just pope production function include additive g and multiplicative h risk chambers and quiggin 34 respecified the just pope production function into an sca format as z s g x h x s ε showing that stochastic information may help to explain adaptive decision maker responses to revealed states of nature following that approach mallawaararchchi et al 35 further modified chambers and quiggin s equation into z s ζ s h x s ε where variability is derived from the natural resource base land quality ricardian rent ζ s together with a multiplicative risk derived from a vector of inputs including water this model was used to explain dairy farmer adaptation during drought also in the context of drought adaptation adamson et al 36 separated water inputs into two distinct types i water used to generate outputs and ii water used to maintain perennial production systems i e keep them alive although they did not specify this mathematically herein we merge the concepts from mallawaarachchi et al 35 and adamson et al 36 allowing a further modification of the sca production function to separately account for maintenance and productive water inputs as shown in equation 6 6 z s ζ s g x s ε h x s ε the equation illustrates how z is produced by each s on a given land area using a combination of additive risk from natural soil fertility ζ and two multiplicative risk signals for inputs x minimum water inputs required to keep the capital invested in production systems alive g and inputs required to generate output categories h the addition of an error term ε for g beyond chambers and quiggin s original equation is deliberate to account for the decision makers unawareness of maintenance inputs required in each state the error term can also represent any uncertainty over a decision makers attitude to risk for example a risk averse producer may over estimate g water requirements thus contributing in part to h water requirements logically the equation could also include additive risk from water for greater explanatory power we contend that this relatively simple separation of inputs into g capital preserving water and h productive water to generate output categories extends beyond the simple game theoretic approach used by adamson et al 36 providing a powerful illustration of a range of issues relevant to water resource users managers and policy makers worldwide critically a better quantification of minimum g x input requirements enables more informed decision making as well as some improved capacity to compare and contrast available policy options particularly with regard to future uncertainty unawareness and resource tipping points in the next section we expand upon these initial concepts to explore total input availability how decision making adjustments may be required when inputs reduce by state and the importance of tipping points in systems for informing a range of future public private decision making 3 theoretical relevance of fixed g input requirements we begin with our consideration of total water input availability supply which is conditional upon the revealed state of nature s within a stochastic supply distribution each state has an independent distribution curve which represents the probability of occurrence as well as the stochastic supply of water likely during such events some states s 2 may have a relatively moderate probability of occurrence but result in a significant quantity of input resources other state outcomes s 3 have both a lower probability but with a reduced total input availability importantly note the minimum g and maximum g input requirements illustrated by the solid arrowed line at the base of the figure and the vertical dashed lines at the extreme tails of the outcome distributions these indicate the point at which no further inputs can be used by the system to facilitate productive outputs g or the absolute minimum inputs required to maintain the capital base g hence the distance between a zero input availability and the minimum g requirement in fig 1 for example this could be thought of as the minimum water required to keep a rootstock alive for current and future production if we treat g as the minimum then as stated earlier all available h inputs by state above that water requirement can be used to facilitate productive outputs the sum of g and h inputs will therefore fall along the solid line between the zero intercept and g however it follows that if total supply is reduced then as long as g water input requirements are met some reallocation at the margin of available h inputs will have to occur e g reductions in input allocation between users as total availability falls from h b to h c in fig 2 to achieve this the system must have some capacity for flexibility in its design and arrangements e g market based mechanisms to reallocate resources between users importantly in s 3 the system is moving closer to minimum input requirements g if total input availability falls beyond that tipping point then irreversible capital i e natural social cultural and economic losses may eventuate we can think about this another way if we consider total input demand d for h inputs by state against total water input supply x we can match that to total input availability and movements towards minimum g requirement levels as total input availability shrinks lhs of fig 3 this shows the positive negative as illustrated by the arrows tipping points between state outcomes but that all states of nature are grounded by the minimum g input requirement red dashed line above the grey shaded area we could envisage the grey shaded area as minimum input requirements in water systems for ecological base flows and or conveyance water requirements to ensure system operation from this we can identify how tipping points or changes to the total g input requirement in particular will result in i a significant need for trade offs among existing new users ii an increasing requirement for the implementation of adaptive private public systems to facilitate reallocations where currently not available else iii irreversible capital losses will result to illustrate this point let us shrink our focus to the fixed g requirements from total available inputs indicated by the dotted red lines in fig 4 if the sum of demand for inputs is less than the total available supply fig 4a the more flexibility the system enjoys to cope with shock or changed state events as the system approaches the minimum threshold tipping point fig 4b its capacity to cope will be reduced respectively and the probability of significant change will be increased if the system breaches the tipping point fig 4c recalling that this can result in rapid and exponential change capital exposure will also grow exponentially and the system will likely fail system failures will be especially significant where the minimum water input requirements relate to identified critical functions e g ecological as shown here in the grey shaded area where these requirements are fundamentally breached all other system functions will likely fail under a cascading impact effect resulting in multiplicative capital losses which may also perversely increase during low supply conditions 37 a critical point to note is that tipping point breaches of the system in this example impact heaviest during low supply states fig 4c when systems and users will be most vulnerable to uncertainty and capital losses a d g i s g i b d g i s g i c d g i s g i 3 1 an empirical example we have stated that this simple illustrative theory is both powerful and important for the users managers and policy makers of resource systems as an example of the power of these concepts we next examine the transformation that has occurred in the australian almond industry over the last two decades fig 5 perennial crops such as almonds require substantial capital investment and survive for decades they cannot be fallowed during drought without significant economic losses resulting in demand hardening for critical inputs 38 but they also generate more revenue per unit of water used 39 our illustrative australian example explores how the changing demand for g water inputs has rapidly increased as fruit bearing trees or those aged six years and older have reached maturity it seems likely that during the height of the millennium drought 2005 06 to 2008 09 several factors comparatively high almond commodity prices severe restrictions on the supply of agricultural water and government packages to structurally adjust combined to transform land use from traditional cropping e g 35 reduction in winegrapes between 2005 and 2017 40 to new almond plantings with lower water requirements until fully matured i e new perennial plantings between 2005 and 2008 new plantings comprised up to 30 of total area this resulted in a step change and by 2011 production had reached around 58 000 kernel tonnes by 2020 the almond industry estimates that production will be around 100 000 kernel tonnes requiring an area of about 48 000 ha of trees 41 we note that the linear demand trend line superimposed onto fig 5 dotted line may suggest a change in total water requirements leading toward a potential tipping point dependent upon where that g input supply point might be in fact the almond industry does have some idea with respect to tipping point water supply levels in the united states studies have set a minimum g for almonds crops at 50 of total water inputs 13 for australia brown 42 suggests a tipping point of 3 80 megalitres ml one million litres or 0 810 acre foot per hectare ha and that most growers prefer to have at least 5 04ml ha as a minimum supply to prevent future yield losses on the basis of industry estimates suggesting mature irrigated crops in australia consume 14ml ha 41 using this figure and the number of hectares planted over time we can see that the industry has a g tipping point of approximately 26 of typical water supply and a preferred minimum supply of at least 36 this allows us to calculate a range of g water requirements across the above industry planting values to identify minimum supply values to maintain industry perennial rootstock fig 6 we can note an initial step wise shift in the g water requirements following new plantings in 2003 then later step wide shifts which have increased potential water requirements between 85 gl gl or billion megalitres and 120 gl in 2007 to between 176 gl 26 and 244 gl 36 by 2020 the slightly more pronounced exponential increase from 2015 to 2020 based on industry forecasts is particularly worrying in this regard however we do not fully understand how this changes for almond crop planting density differences different scales i e basin catchment or local area how this may be affected by scope issues such as efficiency changes or sectoral adjustment incentives how different users may adapt and adjust independently in the face of uncertain outcomes and or how climate change may impact upon these issues to shift water supply and demand in the future this provides us with a great deal of future uncertainty that must be addressed urgently as the australian almond industry experiences step changes in water demand to service now largely matured tree stocks during periods of low water supply many new industry decision makers will likely be unaware of their total set of adaptation management strategies in the short run this may lead to a willingness to pay prices well above market average to secure water inputs and preserve capital 36 however if those markets are unable to fully satisfy water demand decision makers faced with extreme downside risk 43 may feel justified in extracting water illegally from other users including the environment this may place increased pressure on existing institutions to protect non economic rights and prevent natural social and cultural capital losses alternatively in the absence of these two former solutions farm decision makers may create a substantial rural debt bomb which may ultimately have to be met by national interventions as the insurer of last resort these issues are expanded upon in the next section 4 discussion the theory and basic empirical analysis outlined above suggest a number of issues that could drive a future research agenda these issues include 4 1 increased incorporation of uncertainty into investment assessments here we return to our earlier discussion of state contingent analysis sca as a useful tool for incorporating uncertainty unawareness into models of resource use and decision making and for informing future choices the recent improvements discussed in section 2 2 above which define uncertainty unawareness outcomes that are greater or less than a minimum g tipping point enable analysts to better optimise allocation choices for various constraints or objectives alternatively reversing the process that is specifying a management strategy in advance and evaluating it against tipping point outcomes is also possible however both outcomes in this instance are predicated on the availability of good quality data and best practice water accounting approaches to resource management therefore as our appreciation of the need to incorporate uncertainty unawareness into public policy grows there is an urgent requirement to collect useful data on the minimum g inputs for a range of issues to implement proper water accounting arrangements and to explore tipping point outcomes including supply or other shocks e g high prices using sca techniques for example a current global focus on water use efficiency investments both privately and publicly to free up scarce water resources for use elsewhere may be pushing systems towards tipping points where previous supply buffers in the system no longer exist reducing total system capacity to cope with future supply shortages investments in augmented input storage e g dams and weirs in river systems may also perversely exacerbate these problems by increasing total demand for g inputs under expectations of increased reliability and supply capacity 44 hence in the context of real options theory which looks at trigger prices under a capacity to suspend production during periods of unfavourable conditions or avoid investment totally 45 it may instead be useful to couple sca and benefit cost analysis bca techniques to explore longer term investment planning and the impact of shocks on private investment choices sca bca combined analysis may provide some capacity to examine minimum input levels i e h inputs above fixed minimum g inputs needed to achieve npv 0 breakeven outcomes for investment options this could increase our capacity for evaluating investment choice options to sustain capital or rebound from shock events prior to committing to an investment and should thus feature in future sca research 4 2 adaptive institutions an alternative form of investment assessment especially for public institutions may involve the use of transaction costs put simply private transaction costs can be thought of as the price of contracting between parties but at the public policy scale we can define transaction costs as the expenditure required to design test and administer a public policy together with the costs of monitoring performance and altering policy arrangements should it become necessary in future if we are constrained in our capacity to alter future policy then this is an example of lock in transition costs to minimise lock in costs and enable institutional arrangements capable of coping with future risk uncertainty we must identify and develop adaptive public institutions via comparative analysis theory in support of adaptive institutions has recently emerged 46 and some empirical transaction cost analysis tca in support of that theory using ex post examinations of historic investments and state outcomes has thus far been conducted 47 more study is needed but at present the capacity to incorporate future risk uncertainty is limited thus similar to the combined research approach discussed above a coupled sca tca framework including optimisation and or bca could offer similar public policy investment assessment opportunities further adaptive policy ideas could also be parameterised for inclusion as constraints or other objective functions in the model and then tested against state outcomes as defined in the sca framework to identify potential policy failure points this has important implications for public resource managers suggesting that this too should feature in future sca research 4 3 expanded scope as a basis for identifying future risk uncertainty for many contexts these issues will seem distant and challenging suggesting that they can be safely ignored or delayed due to insufficient current evidence or indicators of tipping point thresholds yet where insufficient evidence or data in support of robust policy investment choices exists appropriate decision making will suffer under an inability to adequately represent and consider risk or uncertainty in such contexts it may be useful to identify more advanced stage jurisdictions that have dealt with these issues to determine what lessons could be applied locally this may highlight potential transformations toward inflexible future arrangements e g policy lock in 48 novel arrangements for dealing with future uncertainty risk and or growing requirements for adaptation especially where risk assessments do not typically feature in current policy assurance review processes an example of this may relate to minimum base flow requirements as discussed above with respect to conveyance water to deliver minimum g water and which may be several multiples of that minimum volume fig 3 early attempts to address environmental water input requirements in australia focused on planned water where legislation and regulation was altered to accommodate and legally ensure minimum river flows while in practice this was somewhat possible in river systems downstream of large dam storage facilities in other areas the absence of river infrastructure has made maintaining minimum system flows in support of ecological functions more challenging this has been highlighted in two recent reports investigating large scale fish deaths along the darling river system in south western new south wales 49 50 where upstream large scale infrastructure does not exist planned water has thus been identified as a useful concept within regulated river systems but of less value outside those areas further while market based reallocations have resulted in the transfer of water to create large quantities of actual environmental rights alternative measures are still needed to supply base flows in unregulated systems this continues to be a focus of research and planning work in australia with important links to the sca framework ultimately it may be necessary to install prioritised rights to environmental water to ensure that so called lower or temporally newer rights are fully properly recognised with regard to their higher role in providing a fundamental base for water systems as well as ensuring that other users do not rely on those rights as a source of risk minimisation during low supply states of nature instead it may be necessary to implement greater private risk mitigation responsibilities on consumptive water users as a means of adaptation to future supply uncertainty 45 this will be especially important where consumptive users continue to ignore system limits tipping point risks and or call for access to supply under fair share principles during low supply periods 4 4 incentives to act illegally as we have seen from the earlier illustrative example there has been some transformation of land use in australia where winegrapes have reduced their area and almonds appear to have replaced them however while both crops are perennials they experience different water input needs winegrapes average approximately 7 ml ha while almonds use 14 ml ha thus while the transformation of land use may be roughly equivalent the change in water use is not putting aside issues of possible future water delivery constraints under those changes it is foreseeable that almond producers faced with supply shortages or shocks may have to pay significant future market prices to secure minimum g inputs and avoid irreversible capital loss tipping points as discussed by adamson et al 36 alternatively in the context of poor monitoring and compliance arrangements in many of australia s river systems 51 producers may opt to extract water illegally without adequate legal protection and enforcement all other right owners may face considerable risk along with natural capital and national welfare gains this would result in a system comprising significant winners and losers consistent with rothenberg and smith 26 and increased future uncertainty of sustainable water supply systems into the future agricultural water theft is not well studied in the literature and as such requires further examination and thought with regard to risk uncertainty and unawareness drivers contingent upon scale and temporal effects it may be possible to include as a shock parameter in future sca model analyses 4 5 a limitation to consider finally a word of caution while we have espoused the value of the sca framework for representing and incorporating risk uncertainty into assessments it must be noted that the framework presented here assumes a single decision maker that is possessed of perfect foresight a heroic assumption but much the same limitations apply to other models that attempt to shed light on these issues e g positive mathematical programming 52 or agent based models 53 high quality data consultation with stakeholders and actual decision makers and careful iteration at all development steps of the model may assist to overcome some of these limits however the realities comprised of problem scale capacity to represent the full scope of relevant issues and temporal changes will always be at odds with modelled outcomes just as mean variance values have been previously viewed as inadequate representations of uncertainty unawareness so too the peril of the single number answer when seeking to inform decision makers these constraints on our capacity to interact with and inform both private and public decision makers must also feature in our future sca model development and output discussions as an example future modelling work may explore over watering decision responses based on an individual s multiplicative risk attitudes 5 conclusion future analysis of water resource issues must include strategies for exploring uncertainty a recent separation of water resource inputs into two major functions that protect capital and generate outputs provides a novel insight into adaptation and the rationale for decision making that does not conform to expected utility paradigms non convex solutions the capacity of sca to model these non convex behavioural responses within each state of nature helps explore what may occur at the farm scale level as individuals reallocate water resources in response to alternative supply states by examining individual actions industry wide transformations from market or policy signals and the capacity of institutions to respond to expected future states of nature researchers may be able to examine a variety of potential tipping points at management basin scale levels within a free market based economy many contexts will experience a reduced capacity to use command and control methods to constrain production system growth this will drive an increased requirement to explore and test new policy or program arrangements and their capacity to cope with risky or uncertain outcomes i e their capacity to reduce or address future unawareness about the risk to capital for example as we struggle with tried and recurring policy political responses to realised droughts and drought relief this remains an on going debate we may be willing to tolerate losses for a period or even total loss of capital in some cases although repeated requirements to meet increased private debt in the agricultural sector by public funders may test this resolve especially where the incidence of acting as an insurer of last resort grows exponentially under risky and uncertain tipping point outcomes such repeated bail out requirements reduce the efficient sustainable and resilient nature of many local global objectives thus a greater appreciation of future tipping points may be helpful for avoiding such outcomes reducing total losses and identifying the juncture at which risk sharing responsibility must finally shift in this paper we have explored the development of analytical approaches to risk and uncertainty with respect to water investment and decision making assessments and presented a powerful separation of water inputs into their fundamental roles while this approach may be relevant in other applications e g fishing limits biosecurity pest impacts energy limits environmental watering applications we contend that there is considerable future scope for further research examining the implications of resource separation in the water context especially a range of initial research requirements have been proposed and where the scarcity of total water requirement becomes clearer and the demand for water grows daily there is an urgent need to follow these suggestions to inform

8686,the reduction of damage due to water pollution requires good knowledge of the quality of surface waters the water quality monitoring networks wqmns have evolved over time according to the objectives of each one of them knowledge of long term quality evolution search for the origin of pollution detection of accidental pollution etc information provided by wqmns could be improved by a spatial approach optimizing the location or the number of monitoring stations or by a temporal approach optimizing the sampling frequency however there is a cost for monitoring water quality in this article we show for the first time how the estimation of the economic value of information evoi can be used to determine the spatio temporal design of the network with the example of a network that aims to detect accidental pollution we show how to calculate the evoi according to the spatial and temporal network design number and location of stations temporal accuracy of measurement and how to define this design by maximizing the evoi this will allow us to answer questions such as are the expenses invested in the networks justified with an additional budget is it better to add a station or to increase the temporal accuracy of the measurement of existing stations what is the optimal spatial and temporal design of the network when working with a fixed budget keywords water resource management water quality monitoring network economic value of information 1 introduction a water quality monitoring networks wqmn is defined as the acquisition of information regarding chemical biological and physical characteristics of a water body over time and space 1 wqmns were developed later to answer different types of questions such as pollution trend pollution source and policies to be implemented to improve water quality in 2000 article 8 of the wfd 2 reaffirmed the need to ensure the establishment of programs for the monitoring of water status in order to establish a coherent and comprehensive overview of water it imposes two types of networks the surveillance control network a permanent monitoring network that aims to monitor the evolution of pollution over the long term and the operational control network a temporary monitoring network that aims to identify the pollution source and to make sure that the measures taken make it possible to achieve good status however other networks exist locally for other purposes e g identification of seasonal variations in pollution or detection of accidental pollution this article focuses on this last objective wqmns have been the research topic for several studies part of these studies focused on the physical optimization of the wqmn while the other part focused on the economic value of information evoi provided by the wqmn the first type focused on optimizing the network by taking hydrological considerations into account with the aim of minimizing imprecisions regarding water quality monitoring the optimization can be spatial and or temporal on the one hand spatial issues comprise the optimization of the location and the number of monitoring stations alvarez vázquez et al 3 determined the location of the monitoring stations that decreased the average deviation for the water pollution index telci et al 4 focused on determining the location of the monitoring network that minimized the detection time for accidental pollution for destandau and point 5 the wqmn aimed at the identification of blackspots finally park et al 6 used a genetic algorithm to resolve a multi objective network including representativeness of the river system compliance with water quality standards supervision of water use surveillance of pollution sources and examination of water quality changes on the other hand temporal issues deal with the optimization of the sampling frequency these articles aim to minimize frequency by eliminating redundant information in liu et al 7 the objective of the network was to determine the average annual pollution in naddeo et al 8 the objective was to determine the pollution trend upward downward or no trend in kim et al 9 the objective was to determine the seasonal variation of water quality finally zhou 10 implemented a multi objective model with these three objectives trend detection determination of periodic fluctuation and estimation of mean values of the stationary component more recently pourshahabi et al 11 tried to find the optimal spatio temporal design of a wqmn in the karkheh reservoir they presented a multi criteria methodology based on maximizing a statistical value of information minimizing the number of monitoring stations and the sampling frequency and eliminating redundant information other studies have focused on determining the evoi provided by a wqmn the evoi analysis is based on the bayesian method the bayesian method makes it possible to revise knowledge about the states of nature more precisely the probability of being in a state of nature on the basis of initial beliefs and new information obtained from experimental data several authors have used this concept to determine the value of information provided by the wqmn bouma et al 12 tried to find the best policy to manage eutrophication they used satellite observation as additional information bouma et al 13 used this concept to try to choose between a spatialized or uniform policy to protect the great barrier reef destandau and diop 14 identified the parameters that have an impact on the evoi prior probabilities on states of nature costs linked to a bad decision and the accuracy of additional information they constructed a theoretical model to study the impact of these parameters on the evoi in this article we combine the literature on physical network design optimization and evoi in order to determine the spatio temporal design of the wqmn that maximizes the evoi to our knowledge this has never been done before in the first case the optimization of the network design was solely based on hydrological considerations without regard for the economic benefit or evoi generated by these networks in the second case the literature focused on the economic benefit generated by a network with a predefined design determining the design of a water quality monitoring network by maximizing the evoi helps the system manager to answer questions such as is the money invested in the network justified by generating benefits in excess of costs is it better to increase the number of stations or the temporal accuracy of the measurement of existing stations what is the optimal spatial and temporal design of the network when working with a fixed budget in our article we illustrate the method by which these questions can be answered by a network whose objective is to detect potential accidental pollution on a stretch of river two scenarios are studied the case where the accidental pollution generates uniform damage along the river and the case where the damage is decreasing from upstream to downstream in section 2 we present the theoretical framework the geographic context and our hypothesis in section 3 we define the optimal locations of the monitoring stations for our two damage scenarios in section 4 we analyse the tradeoff between spatial and temporal dimensions of the wqmn design section 5 includes a discussion and concludes the paper 2 methods 2 1 evoi and the bayesian method the benefit generated by monitoring networks can be estimated by the evoi 12 14 the evoi is determined by implementing the bayesian decision theory bayes theorem is used in the field of decision making under uncertainty where the decision maker dm updates his prior beliefs by acquiring new information when a dm faces uncertainty his decision will be based on the highest expected outcome the expected value for his utility this expected utility depends on the prior probabilities of the states of nature that make it possible to reach a certain outcome if the dm is uncertain about the states of nature he will try to obtain additional information on the likelihood of the potential states of nature when the dm obtains new information on the states of nature he uses this information to update his prior beliefs by implementing bayes theorem hence the bayesian method relies on the fact that additional information makes it possible to update the beliefs concerning the states of nature and therefore to make more appropriate decisions the evoi is calculated as the difference between utilities of the decisions after acquiring new information and decisions that could have been taken without additional information to each state of nature corresponds a preferable action thus by considering k states of nature and k possible actions the evoi can be written as follows 1 e v o i k 1 k p i k k 1 k p s k i k u a k s k where p i k probability that the network indicates the state of nature s k p s k i k probability of being in the state of nature s k when the network indicates i k u a k s k utility of the action a k more appropriate for the state of nature k when the state of nature is s k in the context of the evoi generated by a water quality monitoring network the states of nature will depend on the objective of the network the water framework directive defines two types of networks the surveillance control network which aims to monitor the evolution of water quality in the long term and the operational control network which aims to understand why a water body does not reach good status and to act accordingly in the first case the states of nature may be the improving stable or deteriorating water quality in the second case it could be the origin of the pollution i e urban or agricultural this information will help to better target policies however there are not only wfd networks but in addition other local networks with other objectives such as the identification of seasonal variations in quality 9 environmental vulnerability 14 or the detection of accidental pollution 4 it is the latter case that interests us in this article the states of nature inform us as to whether or not there is accidental pollution by applying bayes theorem the evoi 1 becomes e v o i k 1 k p i k k 1 k p s k p i k s k p i k u a k k 2 e v o i k 1 k k 1 k p s k p i k s k u a k k to determine the evoi the network manager must define the a priori probability of being in each of the states of nature the probability that his network will give him a good or wrong message and the economic consequences of his decisions according to the states of nature 2 2 geographic context in order to study a monitoring network aimed at detecting accidental pollution we assume a stretch of river represented by a segment 0 1 the potential target of this type of pollution and whose vulnerability 1 1 a stretch of river may be more or less vulnerable depending on hydrological concentration of pollution according to flow chemical capacity for self purification of the environment or economic characteristics according to water use an exceptional fish population water used for swimming or to produce drinking water will require a higher quality makes this detection a significant environmental issue the location l 0 is the most upstream point and location l 1 is the most downstream point of the river outlet we assume that accidental pollution could be emitted at any point in the stream with probability p accidents can be of various types overflow from a waste water treatment plant in the case of an exceptional rain event or an industrial accident as in the case of the chemical company sandoz in switzerland in 1986 where a fire caused the discharge of polluted water into the rhine there may however be other situations e g where unidentified soil pollution may persist on industrial sites that have been closed for a long time and that may end up years later in a river after rainfall events and soil erosion one example is jec industrie a company specializing in the manufacture of metal furniture which operated tetrachloroethylene metal degreasing installations in the rhône department of france until 2004 however it wasn t until 2012 that tetrachloroethylene was detected in the saône this pollution generates an environmental damage d we note d l x o u t the damage between the location of the emission l x and the outlet of the river we assume that downstream of our stretch of river the water has a flow purifying capacity or water use that makes the pollution non damaging however if a monitoring station is located in l y downstream from the location of the emission the station could detect the accidental pollution in that case an action a at a cost c will be implemented to stop environmental damage environmental damage then becomes d l x l y the effect of the action is therefore immediate but it cannot act retrospectively on the damage generated between the emission and the pollution detection thus if pollution is detected at the outlet of the river it will be too late to implement an action and stop environmental damage we can mention for example the huningue station in france when pollution is detected canals are cut off to prevent the pollution from flowing into the groundwater or into canal systems that feed rivers in downstream alsace we can also cite the example of pollution by tetrachloroethylene in the saône in 2013 mentioned above where the immediate action was to close drinking water supply wells to prevent drinking water from being contaminated nevertheless the monitoring at each station is obviously not continuous a probability α exists such that the monitoring stations may not detect pollution this allows the introduction of the temporal issue in the design of the monitoring network obviously this probability decreases when the sampling frequency increases 2 2 to link the alpha probability to a number of measurements per year it would be necessary to perform a non parametric analysis based on data this considerable task which could itself be the subject of an article is not useful for the purpose of our article moreover we assume that the probability α is the same for all stations of the network and that there is independence between the events specifically the probability for detection non detection at a station does not depend on the number of stations that do not detect this pollution upstream 2 3 evoi in our geographical context in our model we assume that the wqmn comprises n monitoring stations hence with n monitoring stations we have n 2 states of nature depending on the location of the emission of the accidental pollution if l y n is the location of the y t h monitoring station for n monitoring stations then s l y 1 n l y n is the state of nature where accidental pollution is emitted between l y 1 n l y n s l n n o u t is the state of nature where accidental pollution is emitted between the last station and the outlet of the stream and s is the state of nature where no accidental pollution is emitted the states of nature are then s 0 l 1 n s l 1 n l 2 n s l y 1 n l y n s l n n o u t s the network can deliver n 2 messages as well pollution is detected by the y t h monitoring station i l y n accidental pollution is detected at the outlet of the stream i o u t and no pollution is detected i i l 1 n i l 2 n i l y n i o u t i the probability of detecting accidental pollution depends on the state of nature on the basis of our hypotheses this can be written as follows 3 p i l y n s l y 1 n l y n 1 α p i l y 1 n s l y 1 n l y n α 1 α p i l y z n s l y 1 n l y n α z 1 α obviously if any pollution is emitted downstream of the station or if no pollution is emitted the probability of detection is null we can deduce the probability that the network delivers the message i l y n p i l y n 1 α p s l y 1 n l y n α 1 α p s l y 2 n l y 1 n α y 1 1 α p s 0 l 1 n p i l y n p 1 α l y 1 n l y n α 1 α l y 2 n l y 1 n α y 1 l 1 n p i l y n p 1 α j 0 y α j l y j n l y 1 j n in equation 2 utility u a k k is evaluated based on the status quo no action is taken in the example of detection of accidental pollution we compute the utility as the difference between environmental damage saved thanks to the action taken following the detection of pollution i k called d i k and the cost c of implementing the action in the event of detection hence the evoi from equation 2 becomes 4 e v o i k 1 k k 1 k p s k p i k s k d i k c on the basis of our hypotheses of uniformity of accidental pollution distribution the same probability of accidental pollution for areas as well as for lengths and equation 3 the evoi 4 for n stations and a probability of non detection α becomes 5 e v o i n α p 1 α y 1 n d l y n o u t c y 1 y l y n l y 1 n α y y it appears from equation 5 that the evoi increases when the probability p and damage d l y n o u t increase and when the cost of action c decreases 2 4 network cost and net benefit we assume a monitoring cost θ α for each station given by the following function 6 θ α λ α λ expresses the slope of the function an increase in the value of this parameter means that it is more expensive to reduce α the monitoring cost of a wqmn with n stations and a probability of non detection α is 7 θ n α n λ α we compute the net benefit of monitoring π n α as the difference between the economic value of information and the monitoring cost π n α e v o i n α θ n α with 5 and 7 8 π n α p 1 α y 1 n d l y n o u t c y 1 y l y n l y 1 n α y y n λ α 2 5 optimal spatio temporal combination with a fixed budget in this section we suppose that the network manager has a fixed budget to establish the monitoring network in that case a combination of the optimal number of monitoring stations with optimized locations and the optimal probability of detection has to be chosen the optimal spatio temporal design must be defined i e the one that maximizes the evoi under the constraint of fixed budget β the optimization problem is defined as follows max n 1 α e v o i n α s u b j e c t t o θ n α β the methodology consists of finding the optimum by combining the iso cost curves and the indifference curves the iso cost curves give the combination of the number of stations and the probability of detection that can be obtained with the same budget the indifference curves give the combination of the number of stations and the probability of detection that generated the same evoi the methodology then consists of choosing the combination in the iso cost curve that reaches the highest indifference curve the iso cost curve 9 is deduced from equation 7 9 θ n α n λ α β 1 α 1 λ β n based on our hypotheses the iso cost curve is a line with a decreasing slope in β and an increasing slope in λ an indifference curve is the combination of the number of monitoring stations and the probability of detecting accidental pollution that generates the same e v o i 10 e v o i n α e v o i consequently the most efficient combination in an indifference curve is the one that reaches the lowest iso cost curve the indifference curve has the form of the following function g 11 1 α g n p d c e v o i with a fixed budget the optimal combination is the combination n 1 α of the iso cost curve 9 that reaches the highest indifference curve 11 2 6 damage scenarios we will now study two scenarios in the first one uniform damage the damage caused by pollution d l x l y is proportional to the distance between the location of the emission l x and the location of the detection l y fig 1 with this first hypothesis the damage saved d l y n o u t of equation 5 is 12 d l y n o u t δ 1 l y n in the second one decreasing damage the damage caused by pollution d l x l y is represented by fig 2 below decreasing damage can be explained by the presence of tributaries consequently the flow of the river increases from upstream to downstream thus the concentration of the same mass of pollution and therefore the damage decreases from upstream to downstream with this second hypothesis the damage saved d l y n o u t of equation 5 is 13 d l y n o u t l y n 1 2 δ l 2 δ d l δ 1 l y n 2 3 calculations 3 1 location of the monitoring stations and evoi 3 1 1 scenario 1 uniform damage close to the outlet of the river the cost of the action could be higher than the damage avoided 12 consequently no station is useful in this part of the river with the uniform damage scenario we can write this condition as follows 14 δ 1 l y n c n є 1 y є 1 n 15 l y n 1 c δ n є 1 y є 1 n it can be deduced that there is no station in the river if 1 c δ 0 c δ this means that there is no interest in implementing any monitoring station when the cost of action is higher than the marginal cost of the environmental damage it can be deduced from hypothesis of environmental damage uniformity that the locations of the monitoring stations have to be at equal distances appendix 1 then 16 l y n y n 1 1 c δ n є 1 y є 1 n then the environmental damage avoided when pollution is detected in l y n is 17 d l y n o u t δ 1 y n 1 1 c δ by implementing the conditions 16 and 17 in equation 5 we rewrite evoi as follows 18 e v o i n α p 1 α y 1 n δ 1 y n 1 1 c δ c y 1 y l y n l y 1 n α y y e v o i n α p 1 α y 1 n δ 1 y n 1 1 c δ c y 1 y α y y y n 1 1 c δ y 1 n 1 1 c δ e v o i n α p 1 α δ c δ n 1 y 1 n δ 1 y n

the outlet of the river the cost of the action could be higher than the damage avoided 13 consequently no station is useful in this part of the river with the decreasing damage scenario this condition can be written as follows 20 δ 1 l y n 2 c n є 1 y є 1 n 21 l y n 1 c δ n є 1 y є 1 n with two stations located in l y 1 n and l y 1 n the optimal location l y n of the y t h station can be found as follows 3 3 this condition should be verified in the case of decreasing vulnerability to ensure that the location of the stations minimizes damage 22 m i n d l y 1 n l y n l x l y n 2 δ l 2 δ d l d l

2 6 l y 1 n 4 n є 1 y є 1 n the locations of stations in the evoi 19 must comply with 21 and 22 4 results in this section we present our results we also show how our work can help the network manager to answer questions such as what benefits are generated by the network is the cost of the network justified how to decide between increasing the spatial and temporal intensity of the measurement with a fixed budget for this we run a simulation using stata and excel by arbitrarily choosing parameters as follows p 10 δ 100 000 m u c 1 000 m u λ 100 m u parameters c δ and λ are expressed in any monetary unit mu thereafter we will not note the mu unit to simplify writing the above values of the parameters p δ c and λ of the theoretical model in sections 2 and 3 used for our simulation were chosen in order to have an order of magnitude that justifies the implementation of this monitoring network indeed if the cost of action c is too high in relation to the damage represented by the δ parameter the action will be too costly in comparison with its benefit making detection of the pollution unhelpful similarly if the monitoring cost represented by the λ parameter is too high the monitoring network is not justified in terms of the benefit generated 4 1 what benefit does my network generate the benefit generated by the network corresponding to the evoi is calculated for both scenarios using the results 18 19 21 and 22 we thus obtain the following figs 3 and 4 that express the evoi as a function of the number of stations optimally located and the temporal intensity of the measurement probability of detection the figures show both ways to increase the evoi by increasing the spatial accuracy or the temporal accuracy in both cases we observe that the higher the probability of detection 1 α or the greater the number of monitoring stations is the higher the evoi will be but at a decreasing rate in relative terms we earn less if the probability of detection or the number of stations increases moreover the evoi is significantly lower with the decreasing damage scenario about a third less the benefit generated by the network is therefore directly linked to the socio geographical context 4 2 is the cost of the network justified by generating benefits in excess of costs by subtracting the cost of the network 7 from the evoi of scenario 1 18 and scenario 2 19 taking the location constraints of stations 21 and 22 for scenario 2 into account we obtain the net benefit when the damage is uniform fig 5 and when the damage is decreasing fig 6 as we previously saw in section 4 1 since the evoi is lower in scenario 2 we logically find a lower net benefit as well in order to answer the question is the cost of the network justified the network manager will be interested in the sign of the net benefit a positive net benefit will justify the expenses to the funders for our two scenarios figs 7 and 8 illustrate for which combinations number of stations probability of detection the net benefit is positive negative or zero we note that there are two areas where the net benefit will be negative in the upper part of figs 7 and 8 the net benefit is negative due to the prohibitive cost of the network in the lower part of these figures the net benefit is negative due to the insufficient evoi due to the lower evoi for the decreasing damage scenario the area where the net profit is positive is logically smaller it can be observed in figs 7 and 8 that the more less the number of monitoring stations increases the more the maximum of the net benefit curve nb max is obtained with a lower higher probability of detection for example with two or eight monitoring stations the maximum net benefit is obtained with detection probabilities of 79 8 and 48 6 respectively for the uniform damage scenario and 66 7 and 42 5 for the decreasing damage scenario 4 3 what is the optimal spatio temporal design when working with a fixed budget after having seen which combination of spatial and temporal intensity the network manager must choose to maximize the net benefit of his network in the previous section we will now see how this manager must define the network design if he is constrained by a fixed budget to do this we simulate the method developed in section 2 5 using a solver and assuming two budgets 300 and 500 for both scenarios fig 9 above shows that with a uniform damage scenario a budget of 300 makes it possible to reach an indifference curve corresponding to an evoi of 1650 whereas a budget of 500 makes it possible to reach an evoi of 2230 for the decreasing damage scenario illustrated in fig 10 the evoi reached are lower 1000 and 1350 respectively with budgets of 300 and 500 however in both cases the network manager seems to have to make the same choice of network design namely for a budget of 300 to opt for a single station with a detection probability of 67 and with a budget of 500 to opt for two stations with a detection probability of 60 however the choice will still differ as to the location of the monitoring stations for the uniform damage scenario a single station will be located at 0 495 on the river segment 0 1 according to equation 15 and for two stations at locations 0 33 and 0 66 for the decreasing damage scenario according to equations 19 and 20 the sole station will be located at 0 328 and the two stations at 0 214 and 0 47 see appendix 2 for all the station locations in our simulation in both cases going from one to two stations for the same budget of 300 would lead to a reduction in the probability of detection to 33 and all this for a lower evoi for a budget of 500 an increase in the number of stations from two to three would make it necessary to decrease the probability of detection from 60 to 40 and to increase the number of monitoring stations from three to four would make it necessary to decrease the probability of detection from 40 to 20 once again for an ever lower evoi it is therefore interesting to note that increasing the budget leads to a reduction in the probability of detection it is therefore more interesting to increase the spatial intensity of the measurement in this case this can be explained by the fact that the slope of the iso cost line 9 decreases with the budget however as can be seen in figs 9 and 10 a decreasing slope to the right of the iso cost line leads to finding an optimal combination more to the lower right of the figures which corresponds to more stations and a lower probability of detection 5 discussion and conclusions to estimate the economic value of information evoi according to the location of the stations and the temporal intensity of the measurement it is necessary to clearly define the objective of the network beforehand in order to identify the states of nature namely the quality indicator useful for decision making in our example of an objective of detecting accidental pollution the states of nature refer to the presence and location of this pollution in order to act accordingly to stop the potential damage the network design is thus chosen in such a way as to maximize the evoi i e to allow for economic considerations that are not taken into account in traditional network optimization where only statistical and hydrological considerations are important we can see in appendix 2 that the stations will not be located in the same place according to our two scenarios since the decreasing damage requires locations further upstream the knowledge of this benefit generated by the network allows the network manager to carry out a cost benefit analysis by integrating the cost of the network according to the number of stations and the temporal intensity of the measurement we can note that the network benefit calculated here only refers to one objective the detection of accidental pollution to stop the damage in the short term however the information provided can provide other services in the medium or long term in the case of accidental pollution a follow up in the medium or long term can indicate whether the number of accidental pollution events increases stabilizes or decreases or allows the sources and reasons for these accidents to be identified in order to make the appropriate decisions thus the calculated evoi is only a low estimate of the benefits generated by the network however this information remains valuable as we have seen when defining the network design as well as when justifying the cost of the network in section 4 2 we see for which combinations of spatial and temporal intensity a network operator can justify the interest of these measures to its funders being in the low range of the benefit estimate does not mean that the network is not justified when the net benefit is negative this article shows how a network manager can optimize and therefore justify the choice of a spatio temporal combination of the measurement by maximizing the net benefit section 4 2 or by maximizing the economic value of information with a fixed budget section 4 3 it is interesting to note results that may appear to be counter intuitive such as reducing the frequency of the measurement when the budget increases indeed depending on the context adding an optimally located monitoring station may be more advantageous even if the frequency of the measurement is reduced over the entire network acting on water quality means above all knowing about it water quality monitoring networks have been developed to provide this knowledge however perfect knowledge subsequent to continuous measurement in time and space is not possible thus the network manager must define the network design i e the number of stations their location and the frequency of the measurement a first category of literature has focused on optimizing this structure in order to minimize the statistical inaccuracy of the information in a second category of literature authors have estimated the economic value of information of a pre defined network design using the bayesian method in this article we combine both categories of literature for the first time by optimizing the design of a monitoring network via the maximization of the economic value of the information generated to develop our methodology we take the example of a monitoring network whose sole objective is to detect any accidental pollution that may occur with a uniform probability over a stretch of river we compare two damage scenarios the first one where pollution generates the same damage regardless of the emission point and the second one where this damage is decreasing downstream this hypothesis can be explained by the increase in flow and therefore the dilution effect from upstream to downstream we first show how to estimate the economic value of information evoi according to the location of the stations and the temporal intensity of the measurement the knowledge of this benefit generated by the network allows the network manager to carry out a cost benefit analysis by integrating the cost of the network the methodology outlined in this article provides network managers with tools to answer key questions such as are the costs of monitoring justified by generating benefits in excess of costs what network design spatial and temporal intensity of the measurement should be adopted to maximize the net benefit generated what is the optimal network design when working with a fixed budget in this paper the choice of a single objective for the network i e detecting an accidental pollution allow us to assume simplified working hypotheses the latter concern environmental damage that is inexistent downstream from the outlet of the river and that can be stopped as soon as the pollution is detected to justify this hypothesis we relied on the huningue alert station in france where the canal s closure is based on the detection of accidental pollution to prevent the spread of pollution and downstream damages however as these hypotheses may limit the generalization of our results it would be interesting in a future study to apply our model to other monitoring objectives or a multi objective network we could for example integrate the objectives of the water framework directive namely does the water body have a good status or not and if not what are the types of pollution sources urban or rural that cause the downgrading of the water body based on a field study the network design that offers the best trade off between the different objectives will be determined moreover it would also be interesting to associate the annual measurement frequency with the probability of identifying the real state of nature probability of detecting accidental pollution in this paper for this purpose it would be necessary to perform a non parametric analysis based on data this would clarify the trade off for a network manager to choose between increasing the measurement in space number of stations and in time annual frequency declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest appendix 1 location of the monitoring stations with uniform damage we attempt to find the optimal locations of the monitoring stations namely those that minimize environmental damage according to our hypothesis the damage is proportional to the distance between emission and detection we then look for the location that minimizes this distance we designate l as the whole distance between potential emissions and the n monitoring stations the program is written as follows m i n l m i n y 1 n 1 l y 1 n l y n l y n l x d l x n є 1 where l 0 n is the source of the river and l n 1 n is the outlet then l 0 n 0 and l n 1 n 1 with two monitoring stations located at l y 1 n and l y 1 n the optimal location of the y t h station l y n is obtained as follows l l y 1 n l y n l y n l x d l x l y n l y 1 n l y 1 n l x d l x l l y n 2 l y 1 n l y n l y n l y 1 n l y 1 n 2 2 l y 1 n 2 2 l l y n 2 l y n l y 1 n l y 1 n 0 l y n l y 1 n l y 1 n 2 furthermore 2 l l y n 2 2 0 hence the optimal location is the one that divides the stream into two equal parts consequently the stations must be

8686,the reduction of damage due to water pollution requires good knowledge of the quality of surface waters the water quality monitoring networks wqmns have evolved over time according to the objectives of each one of them knowledge of long term quality evolution search for the origin of pollution detection of accidental pollution etc information provided by wqmns could be improved by a spatial approach optimizing the location or the number of monitoring stations or by a temporal approach optimizing the sampling frequency however there is a cost for monitoring water quality in this article we show for the first time how the estimation of the economic value of information evoi can be used to determine the spatio temporal design of the network with the example of a network that aims to detect accidental pollution we show how to calculate the evoi according to the spatial and temporal network design number and location of stations temporal accuracy of measurement and how to define this design by maximizing the evoi this will allow us to answer questions such as are the expenses invested in the networks justified with an additional budget is it better to add a station or to increase the temporal accuracy of the measurement of existing stations what is the optimal spatial and temporal design of the network when working with a fixed budget keywords water resource management water quality monitoring network economic value of information 1 introduction a water quality monitoring networks wqmn is defined as the acquisition of information regarding chemical biological and physical characteristics of a water body over time and space 1 wqmns were developed later to answer different types of questions such as pollution trend pollution source and policies to be implemented to improve water quality in 2000 article 8 of the wfd 2 reaffirmed the need to ensure the establishment of programs for the monitoring of water status in order to establish a coherent and comprehensive overview of water it imposes two types of networks the surveillance control network a permanent monitoring network that aims to monitor the evolution of pollution over the long term and the operational control network a temporary monitoring network that aims to identify the pollution source and to make sure that the measures taken make it possible to achieve good status however other networks exist locally for other purposes e g identification of seasonal variations in pollution or detection of accidental pollution this article focuses on this last objective wqmns have been the research topic for several studies part of these studies focused on the physical optimization of the wqmn while the other part focused on the economic value of information evoi provided by the wqmn the first type focused on optimizing the network by taking hydrological considerations into account with the aim of minimizing imprecisions regarding water quality monitoring the optimization can be spatial and or temporal on the one hand spatial issues comprise the optimization of the location and the number of monitoring stations alvarez vázquez et al 3 determined the location of the monitoring stations that decreased the average deviation for the water pollution index telci et al 4 focused on determining the location of the monitoring network that minimized the detection time for accidental pollution for destandau and point 5 the wqmn aimed at the identification of blackspots finally park et al 6 used a genetic algorithm to resolve a multi objective network including representativeness of the river system compliance with water quality standards supervision of water use surveillance of pollution sources and examination of water quality changes on the other hand temporal issues deal with the optimization of the sampling frequency these articles aim to minimize frequency by eliminating redundant information in liu et al 7 the objective of the network was to determine the average annual pollution in naddeo et al 8 the objective was to determine the pollution trend upward downward or no trend in kim et al 9 the objective was to determine the seasonal variation of water quality finally zhou 10 implemented a multi objective model with these three objectives trend detection determination of periodic fluctuation and estimation of mean values of the stationary component more recently pourshahabi et al 11 tried to find the optimal spatio temporal design of a wqmn in the karkheh reservoir they presented a multi criteria methodology based on maximizing a statistical value of information minimizing the number of monitoring stations and the sampling frequency and eliminating redundant information other studies have focused on determining the evoi provided by a wqmn the evoi analysis is based on the bayesian method the bayesian method makes it possible to revise knowledge about the states of nature more precisely the probability of being in a state of nature on the basis of initial beliefs and new information obtained from experimental data several authors have used this concept to determine the value of information provided by the wqmn bouma et al 12 tried to find the best policy to manage eutrophication they used satellite observation as additional information bouma et al 13 used this concept to try to choose between a spatialized or uniform policy to protect the great barrier reef destandau and diop 14 identified the parameters that have an impact on the evoi prior probabilities on states of nature costs linked to a bad decision and the accuracy of additional information they constructed a theoretical model to study the impact of these parameters on the evoi in this article we combine the literature on physical network design optimization and evoi in order to determine the spatio temporal design of the wqmn that maximizes the evoi to our knowledge this has never been done before in the first case the optimization of the network design was solely based on hydrological considerations without regard for the economic benefit or evoi generated by these networks in the second case the literature focused on the economic benefit generated by a network with a predefined design determining the design of a water quality monitoring network by maximizing the evoi helps the system manager to answer questions such as is the money invested in the network justified by generating benefits in excess of costs is it better to increase the number of stations or the temporal accuracy of the measurement of existing stations what is the optimal spatial and temporal design of the network when working with a fixed budget in our article we illustrate the method by which these questions can be answered by a network whose objective is to detect potential accidental pollution on a stretch of river two scenarios are studied the case where the accidental pollution generates uniform damage along the river and the case where the damage is decreasing from upstream to downstream in section 2 we present the theoretical framework the geographic context and our hypothesis in section 3 we define the optimal locations of the monitoring stations for our two damage scenarios in section 4 we analyse the tradeoff between spatial and temporal dimensions of the wqmn design section 5 includes a discussion and concludes the paper 2 methods 2 1 evoi and the bayesian method the benefit generated by monitoring networks can be estimated by the evoi 12 14 the evoi is determined by implementing the bayesian decision theory bayes theorem is used in the field of decision making under uncertainty where the decision maker dm updates his prior beliefs by acquiring new information when a dm faces uncertainty his decision will be based on the highest expected outcome the expected value for his utility this expected utility depends on the prior probabilities of the states of nature that make it possible to reach a certain outcome if the dm is uncertain about the states of nature he will try to obtain additional information on the likelihood of the potential states of nature when the dm obtains new information on the states of nature he uses this information to update his prior beliefs by implementing bayes theorem hence the bayesian method relies on the fact that additional information makes it possible to update the beliefs concerning the states of nature and therefore to make more appropriate decisions the evoi is calculated as the difference between utilities of the decisions after acquiring new information and decisions that could have been taken without additional information to each state of nature corresponds a preferable action thus by considering k states of nature and k possible actions the evoi can be written as follows 1 e v o i k 1 k p i k k 1 k p s k i k u a k s k where p i k probability that the network indicates the state of nature s k p s k i k probability of being in the state of nature s k when the network indicates i k u a k s k utility of the action a k more appropriate for the state of nature k when the state of nature is s k in the context of the evoi generated by a water quality monitoring network the states of nature will depend on the objective of the network the water framework directive defines two types of networks the surveillance control network which aims to monitor the evolution of water quality in the long term and the operational control network which aims to understand why a water body does not reach good status and to act accordingly in the first case the states of nature may be the improving stable or deteriorating water quality in the second case it could be the origin of the pollution i e urban or agricultural this information will help to better target policies however there are not only wfd networks but in addition other local networks with other objectives such as the identification of seasonal variations in quality 9 environmental vulnerability 14 or the detection of accidental pollution 4 it is the latter case that interests us in this article the states of nature inform us as to whether or not there is accidental pollution by applying bayes theorem the evoi 1 becomes e v o i k 1 k p i k k 1 k p s k p i k s k p i k u a k k 2 e v o i k 1 k k 1 k p s k p i k s k u a k k to determine the evoi the network manager must define the a priori probability of being in each of the states of nature the probability that his network will give him a good or wrong message and the economic consequences of his decisions according to the states of nature 2 2 geographic context in order to study a monitoring network aimed at detecting accidental pollution we assume a stretch of river represented by a segment 0 1 the potential target of this type of pollution and whose vulnerability 1 1 a stretch of river may be more or less vulnerable depending on hydrological concentration of pollution according to flow chemical capacity for self purification of the environment or economic characteristics according to water use an exceptional fish population water used for swimming or to produce drinking water will require a higher quality makes this detection a significant environmental issue the location l 0 is the most upstream point and location l 1 is the most downstream point of the river outlet we assume that accidental pollution could be emitted at any point in the stream with probability p accidents can be of various types overflow from a waste water treatment plant in the case of an exceptional rain event or an industrial accident as in the case of the chemical company sandoz in switzerland in 1986 where a fire caused the discharge of polluted water into the rhine there may however be other situations e g where unidentified soil pollution may persist on industrial sites that have been closed for a long time and that may end up years later in a river after rainfall events and soil erosion one example is jec industrie a company specializing in the manufacture of metal furniture which operated tetrachloroethylene metal degreasing installations in the rhône department of france until 2004 however it wasn t until 2012 that tetrachloroethylene was detected in the saône this pollution generates an environmental damage d we note d l x o u t the damage between the location of the emission l x and the outlet of the river we assume that downstream of our stretch of river the water has a flow purifying capacity or water use that makes the pollution non damaging however if a monitoring station is located in l y downstream from the location of the emission the station could detect the accidental pollution in that case an action a at a cost c will be implemented to stop environmental damage environmental damage then becomes d l x l y the effect of the action is therefore immediate but it cannot act retrospectively on the damage generated between the emission and the pollution detection thus if pollution is detected at the outlet of the river it will be too late to implement an action and stop environmental damage we can mention for example the huningue station in france when pollution is detected canals are cut off to prevent the pollution from flowing into the groundwater or into canal systems that feed rivers in downstream alsace we can also cite the example of pollution by tetrachloroethylene in the saône in 2013 mentioned above where the immediate action was to close drinking water supply wells to prevent drinking water from being contaminated nevertheless the monitoring at each station is obviously not continuous a probability α exists such that the monitoring stations may not detect pollution this allows the introduction of the temporal issue in the design of the monitoring network obviously this probability decreases when the sampling frequency increases 2 2 to link the alpha probability to a number of measurements per year it would be necessary to perform a non parametric analysis based on data this considerable task which could itself be the subject of an article is not useful for the purpose of our article moreover we assume that the probability α is the same for all stations of the network and that there is independence between the events specifically the probability for detection non detection at a station does not depend on the number of stations that do not detect this pollution upstream 2 3 evoi in our geographical context in our model we assume that the wqmn comprises n monitoring stations hence with n monitoring stations we have n 2 states of nature depending on the location of the emission of the accidental pollution if l y n is the location of the y t h monitoring station for n monitoring stations then s l y 1 n l y n is the state of nature where accidental pollution is emitted between l y 1 n l y n s l n n o u t is the state of nature where accidental pollution is emitted between the last station and the outlet of the stream and s is the state of nature where no accidental pollution is emitted the states of nature are then s 0 l 1 n s l 1 n l 2 n s l y 1 n l y n s l n n o u t s the network can deliver n 2 messages as well pollution is detected by the y t h monitoring station i l y n accidental pollution is detected at the outlet of the stream i o u t and no pollution is detected i i l 1 n i l 2 n i l y n i o u t i the probability of detecting accidental pollution depends on the state of nature on the basis of our hypotheses this can be written as follows 3 p i l y n s l y 1 n l y n 1 α p i l y 1 n s l y 1 n l y n α 1 α p i l y z n s l y 1 n l y n α z 1 α obviously if any pollution is emitted downstream of the station or if no pollution is emitted the probability of detection is null we can deduce the probability that the network delivers the message i l y n p i l y n 1 α p s l y 1 n l y n α 1 α p s l y 2 n l y 1 n α y 1 1 α p s 0 l 1 n p i l y n p 1 α l y 1 n l y n α 1 α l y 2 n l y 1 n α y 1 l 1 n p i l y n p 1 α j 0 y α j l y j n l y 1 j n in equation 2 utility u a k k is evaluated based on the status quo no action is taken in the example of detection of accidental pollution we compute the utility as the difference between environmental damage saved thanks to the action taken following the detection of pollution i k called d i k and the cost c of implementing the action in the event of detection hence the evoi from equation 2 becomes 4 e v o i k 1 k k 1 k p s k p i k s k d i k c on the basis of our hypotheses of uniformity of accidental pollution distribution the same probability of accidental pollution for areas as well as for lengths and equation 3 the evoi 4 for n stations and a probability of non detection α becomes 5 e v o i n α p 1 α y 1 n d l y n o u t c y 1 y l y n l y 1 n α y y it appears from equation 5 that the evoi increases when the probability p and damage d l y n o u t increase and when the cost of action c decreases 2 4 network cost and net benefit we assume a monitoring cost θ α for each station given by the following function 6 θ α λ α λ expresses the slope of the function an increase in the value of this parameter means that it is more expensive to reduce α the monitoring cost of a wqmn with n stations and a probability of non detection α is 7 θ n α n λ α we compute the net benefit of monitoring π n α as the difference between the economic value of information and the monitoring cost π n α e v o i n α θ n α with 5 and 7 8 π n α p 1 α y 1 n d l y n o u t c y 1 y l y n l y 1 n α y y n λ α 2 5 optimal spatio temporal combination with a fixed budget in this section we suppose that the network manager has a fixed budget to establish the monitoring network in that case a combination of the optimal number of monitoring stations with optimized locations and the optimal probability of detection has to be chosen the optimal spatio temporal design must be defined i e the one that maximizes the evoi under the constraint of fixed budget β the optimization problem is defined as follows max n 1 α e v o i n α s u b j e c t t o θ n α β the methodology consists of finding the optimum by combining the iso cost curves and the indifference curves the iso cost curves give the combination of the number of stations and the probability of detection that can be obtained with the same budget the indifference curves give the combination of the number of stations and the probability of detection that generated the same evoi the methodology then consists of choosing the combination in the iso cost curve that reaches the highest indifference curve the iso cost curve 9 is deduced from equation 7 9 θ n α n λ α β 1 α 1 λ β n based on our hypotheses the iso cost curve is a line with a decreasing slope in β and an increasing slope in λ an indifference curve is the combination of the number of monitoring stations and the probability of detecting accidental pollution that generates the same e v o i 10 e v o i n α e v o i consequently the most efficient combination in an indifference curve is the one that reaches the lowest iso cost curve the indifference curve has the form of the following function g 11 1 α g n p d c e v o i with a fixed budget the optimal combination is the combination n 1 α of the iso cost curve 9 that reaches the highest indifference curve 11 2 6 damage scenarios we will now study two scenarios in the first one uniform damage the damage caused by pollution d l x l y is proportional to the distance between the location of the emission l x and the location of the detection l y fig 1 with this first hypothesis the damage saved d l y n o u t of equation 5 is 12 d l y n o u t δ 1 l y n in the second one decreasing damage the damage caused by pollution d l x l y is represented by fig 2 below decreasing damage can be explained by the presence of tributaries consequently the flow of the river increases from upstream to downstream thus the concentration of the same mass of pollution and therefore the damage decreases from upstream to downstream with this second hypothesis the damage saved d l y n o u t of equation 5 is 13 d l y n o u t l y n 1 2 δ l 2 δ d l δ 1 l y n 2 3 calculations 3 1 location of the monitoring stations and evoi 3 1 1 scenario 1 uniform damage close to the outlet of the river the cost of the action could be higher than the damage avoided 12 consequently no station is useful in this part of the river with the uniform damage scenario we can write this condition as follows 14 δ 1 l y n c n є 1 y є 1 n 15 l y n 1 c δ n є 1 y є 1 n it can be deduced that there is no station in the river if 1 c δ 0 c δ this means that there is no interest in implementing any monitoring station when the cost of action is higher than the marginal cost of the environmental damage it can be deduced from hypothesis of environmental damage uniformity that the locations of the monitoring stations have to be at equal distances appendix 1 then 16 l y n y n 1 1 c δ n є 1 y є 1 n then the environmental damage avoided when pollution is detected in l y n is 17 d l y n o u t δ 1 y n 1 1 c δ by implementing the conditions 16 and 17 in equation 5 we rewrite evoi as follows 18 e v o i n α p 1 α y 1 n δ 1 y n 1 1 c δ c y 1 y l y n l y 1 n α y y e v o i n α p 1 α y 1 n δ 1 y n 1 1 c δ c y 1 y α y y y n 1 1 c δ y 1 n 1 1 c δ e v o i n α p 1 α δ c δ n 1 y 1 n δ 1 y n

the outlet of the river the cost of the action could be higher than the damage avoided 13 consequently no station is useful in this part of the river with the decreasing damage scenario this condition can be written as follows 20 δ 1 l y n 2 c n є 1 y є 1 n 21 l y n 1 c δ n є 1 y є 1 n with two stations located in l y 1 n and l y 1 n the optimal location l y n of the y t h station can be found as follows 3 3 this condition should be verified in the case of decreasing vulnerability to ensure that the location of the stations minimizes damage 22 m i n d l y 1 n l y n l x l y n 2 δ l 2 δ d l d l

2 6 l y 1 n 4 n є 1 y є 1 n the locations of stations in the evoi 19 must comply with 21 and 22 4 results in this section we present our results we also show how our work can help the network manager to answer questions such as what benefits are generated by the network is the cost of the network justified how to decide between increasing the spatial and temporal intensity of the measurement with a fixed budget for this we run a simulation using stata and excel by arbitrarily choosing parameters as follows p 10 δ 100 000 m u c 1 000 m u λ 100 m u parameters c δ and λ are expressed in any monetary unit mu thereafter we will not note the mu unit to simplify writing the above values of the parameters p δ c and λ of the theoretical model in sections 2 and 3 used for our simulation were chosen in order to have an order of magnitude that justifies the implementation of this monitoring network indeed if the cost of action c is too high in relation to the damage represented by the δ parameter the action will be too costly in comparison with its benefit making detection of the pollution unhelpful similarly if the monitoring cost represented by the λ parameter is too high the monitoring network is not justified in terms of the benefit generated 4 1 what benefit does my network generate the benefit generated by the network corresponding to the evoi is calculated for both scenarios using the results 18 19 21 and 22 we thus obtain the following figs 3 and 4 that express the evoi as a function of the number of stations optimally located and the temporal intensity of the measurement probability of detection the figures show both ways to increase the evoi by increasing the spatial accuracy or the temporal accuracy in both cases we observe that the higher the probability of detection 1 α or the greater the number of monitoring stations is the higher the evoi will be but at a decreasing rate in relative terms we earn less if the probability of detection or the number of stations increases moreover the evoi is significantly lower with the decreasing damage scenario about a third less the benefit generated by the network is therefore directly linked to the socio geographical context 4 2 is the cost of the network justified by generating benefits in excess of costs by subtracting the cost of the network 7 from the evoi of scenario 1 18 and scenario 2 19 taking the location constraints of stations 21 and 22 for scenario 2 into account we obtain the net benefit when the damage is uniform fig 5 and when the damage is decreasing fig 6 as we previously saw in section 4 1 since the evoi is lower in scenario 2 we logically find a lower net benefit as well in order to answer the question is the cost of the network justified the network manager will be interested in the sign of the net benefit a positive net benefit will justify the expenses to the funders for our two scenarios figs 7 and 8 illustrate for which combinations number of stations probability of detection the net benefit is positive negative or zero we note that there are two areas where the net benefit will be negative in the upper part of figs 7 and 8 the net benefit is negative due to the prohibitive cost of the network in the lower part of these figures the net benefit is negative due to the insufficient evoi due to the lower evoi for the decreasing damage scenario the area where the net profit is positive is logically smaller it can be observed in figs 7 and 8 that the more less the number of monitoring stations increases the more the maximum of the net benefit curve nb max is obtained with a lower higher probability of detection for example with two or eight monitoring stations the maximum net benefit is obtained with detection probabilities of 79 8 and 48 6 respectively for the uniform damage scenario and 66 7 and 42 5 for the decreasing damage scenario 4 3 what is the optimal spatio temporal design when working with a fixed budget after having seen which combination of spatial and temporal intensity the network manager must choose to maximize the net benefit of his network in the previous section we will now see how this manager must define the network design if he is constrained by a fixed budget to do this we simulate the method developed in section 2 5 using a solver and assuming two budgets 300 and 500 for both scenarios fig 9 above shows that with a uniform damage scenario a budget of 300 makes it possible to reach an indifference curve corresponding to an evoi of 1650 whereas a budget of 500 makes it possible to reach an evoi of 2230 for the decreasing damage scenario illustrated in fig 10 the evoi reached are lower 1000 and 1350 respectively with budgets of 300 and 500 however in both cases the network manager seems to have to make the same choice of network design namely for a budget of 300 to opt for a single station with a detection probability of 67 and with a budget of 500 to opt for two stations with a detection probability of 60 however the choice will still differ as to the location of the monitoring stations for the uniform damage scenario a single station will be located at 0 495 on the river segment 0 1 according to equation 15 and for two stations at locations 0 33 and 0 66 for the decreasing damage scenario according to equations 19 and 20 the sole station will be located at 0 328 and the two stations at 0 214 and 0 47 see appendix 2 for all the station locations in our simulation in both cases going from one to two stations for the same budget of 300 would lead to a reduction in the probability of detection to 33 and all this for a lower evoi for a budget of 500 an increase in the number of stations from two to three would make it necessary to decrease the probability of detection from 60 to 40 and to increase the number of monitoring stations from three to four would make it necessary to decrease the probability of detection from 40 to 20 once again for an ever lower evoi it is therefore interesting to note that increasing the budget leads to a reduction in the probability of detection it is therefore more interesting to increase the spatial intensity of the measurement in this case this can be explained by the fact that the slope of the iso cost line 9 decreases with the budget however as can be seen in figs 9 and 10 a decreasing slope to the right of the iso cost line leads to finding an optimal combination more to the lower right of the figures which corresponds to more stations and a lower probability of detection 5 discussion and conclusions to estimate the economic value of information evoi according to the location of the stations and the temporal intensity of the measurement it is necessary to clearly define the objective of the network beforehand in order to identify the states of nature namely the quality indicator useful for decision making in our example of an objective of detecting accidental pollution the states of nature refer to the presence and location of this pollution in order to act accordingly to stop the potential damage the network design is thus chosen in such a way as to maximize the evoi i e to allow for economic considerations that are not taken into account in traditional network optimization where only statistical and hydrological considerations are important we can see in appendix 2 that the stations will not be located in the same place according to our two scenarios since the decreasing damage requires locations further upstream the knowledge of this benefit generated by the network allows the network manager to carry out a cost benefit analysis by integrating the cost of the network according to the number of stations and the temporal intensity of the measurement we can note that the network benefit calculated here only refers to one objective the detection of accidental pollution to stop the damage in the short term however the information provided can provide other services in the medium or long term in the case of accidental pollution a follow up in the medium or long term can indicate whether the number of accidental pollution events increases stabilizes or decreases or allows the sources and reasons for these accidents to be identified in order to make the appropriate decisions thus the calculated evoi is only a low estimate of the benefits generated by the network however this information remains valuable as we have seen when defining the network design as well as when justifying the cost of the network in section 4 2 we see for which combinations of spatial and temporal intensity a network operator can justify the interest of these measures to its funders being in the low range of the benefit estimate does not mean that the network is not justified when the net benefit is negative this article shows how a network manager can optimize and therefore justify the choice of a spatio temporal combination of the measurement by maximizing the net benefit section 4 2 or by maximizing the economic value of information with a fixed budget section 4 3 it is interesting to note results that may appear to be counter intuitive such as reducing the frequency of the measurement when the budget increases indeed depending on the context adding an optimally located monitoring station may be more advantageous even if the frequency of the measurement is reduced over the entire network acting on water quality means above all knowing about it water quality monitoring networks have been developed to provide this knowledge however perfect knowledge subsequent to continuous measurement in time and space is not possible thus the network manager must define the network design i e the number of stations their location and the frequency of the measurement a first category of literature has focused on optimizing this structure in order to minimize the statistical inaccuracy of the information in a second category of literature authors have estimated the economic value of information of a pre defined network design using the bayesian method in this article we combine both categories of literature for the first time by optimizing the design of a monitoring network via the maximization of the economic value of the information generated to develop our methodology we take the example of a monitoring network whose sole objective is to detect any accidental pollution that may occur with a uniform probability over a stretch of river we compare two damage scenarios the first one where pollution generates the same damage regardless of the emission point and the second one where this damage is decreasing downstream this hypothesis can be explained by the increase in flow and therefore the dilution effect from upstream to downstream we first show how to estimate the economic value of information evoi according to the location of the stations and the temporal intensity of the measurement the knowledge of this benefit generated by the network allows the network manager to carry out a cost benefit analysis by integrating the cost of the network the methodology outlined in this article provides network managers with tools to answer key questions such as are the costs of monitoring justified by generating benefits in excess of costs what network design spatial and temporal intensity of the measurement should be adopted to maximize the net benefit generated what is the optimal network design when working with a fixed budget in this paper the choice of a single objective for the network i e detecting an accidental pollution allow us to assume simplified working hypotheses the latter concern environmental damage that is inexistent downstream from the outlet of the river and that can be stopped as soon as the pollution is detected to justify this hypothesis we relied on the huningue alert station in france where the canal s closure is based on the detection of accidental pollution to prevent the spread of pollution and downstream damages however as these hypotheses may limit the generalization of our results it would be interesting in a future study to apply our model to other monitoring objectives or a multi objective network we could for example integrate the objectives of the water framework directive namely does the water body have a good status or not and if not what are the types of pollution sources urban or rural that cause the downgrading of the water body based on a field study the network design that offers the best trade off between the different objectives will be determined moreover it would also be interesting to associate the annual measurement frequency with the probability of identifying the real state of nature probability of detecting accidental pollution in this paper for this purpose it would be necessary to perform a non parametric analysis based on data this would clarify the trade off for a network manager to choose between increasing the measurement in space number of stations and in time annual frequency declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest appendix 1 location of the monitoring stations with uniform damage we attempt to find the optimal locations of the monitoring stations namely those that minimize environmental damage according to our hypothesis the damage is proportional to the distance between emission and detection we then look for the location that minimizes this distance we designate l as the whole distance between potential emissions and the n monitoring stations the program is written as follows m i n l m i n y 1 n 1 l y 1 n l y n l y n l x d l x n є 1 where l 0 n is the source of the river and l n 1 n is the outlet then l 0 n 0 and l n 1 n 1 with two monitoring stations located at l y 1 n and l y 1 n the optimal location of the y t h station l y n is obtained as follows l l y 1 n l y n l y n l x d l x l y n l y 1 n l y 1 n l x d l x l l y n 2 l y 1 n l y n l y n l y 1 n l y 1 n 2 2 l y 1 n 2 2 l l y n 2 l y n l y 1 n l y 1 n 0 l y n l y 1 n l y 1 n 2 furthermore 2 l l y n 2 2 0 hence the optimal location is the one that divides the stream into two equal parts consequently the stations must be located at equal distance appendix 2 location of the monitoring stations in the simulation δ 100 000 c 1 000 uniform damage according to equation 16 n 1 0 495 2 0 330 0 660 3 0 2475 0 495 0 743 4 0

8687,the paper examines the response of twelve u s agricultural stock returns to el niño southern oscillation enso shocks using a recursive var model baseline results indicate that for seven of the stock returns an enso shock has positive and significant effects the effects however are shortlived generally becoming statistically indistinguishable from zero three to six months after the shock variance decomposition analyses show that enso shocks have little explanatory power for fluctuations in u s agricultural stock returns we also provide evidence that historically movements in the stock returns of u s food and agricultural companies have been driven by other shocks rather than enso shocks keywords vector autoregression el niño southern oscillation agriculture stock returns jel classification q41 c32 1 introduction el niño southern oscillation enso is a naturally occurring weather phenomenon that involves fluctuations in winds and ocean surface temperatures in the central and east central equatorial pacific ocean the weather pattern which usually occurs around december can have varying intensities el niño refers to the warm phase of the enso cycle while la niña refers to the cool phase the impacts of el niño and la niña are strongest in the winter immediately following the onset of the event fig 1 shows the typical wintertime effects of el niño and la niña for the u s the northern tier of the 48 contiguous u s states generally experiences above normal temperatures in the fall and winter seasons during el niño episodes while the gulf coast states exhibit below average temperatures an unusually strong and more southerly subtropical jet stream during the el niño phase brings above normal precipitation in southern california the gulf coast and southeastern u s states in hawaii el niño causes drier than normal conditions in the winter and early spring months below average dry season precipitation in guam and above normal precipitation in american samoa in the eastern and central pacific regions of the u s higher sea surface temperatures associated with el niño increase the likelihood of hurricanes in these regions 1 2 the effects of the la niña phase of enso are generally the opposite of those of the el niño phase although the magnitudes spatial dimension and duration of its effects may differ these weather changes tend to have considerable impacts on the world s distribution of water resources and water supply during the start of a typical enso cycle trade winds blow westward warming up surface waters in oceania off the west coast of south america these warmer ocean waters force nutrient rich colder waters further down in the ocean to rise disrupting fisheries anchovies for example which typically flourish in the cold waters off the coasts of peru and ecuador are forced to flee south for colder waters as already mentioned enso can cause drought conditions or an increase in precipitation depending on the enso phase as many countries depend on rainfall and groundwater as sources of freshwater enso can have significant impacts on freshwater resources which in turn may have considerable effects on human health agricultural production and even stock prices extensive research has documented significant relationships between enso occurrences and u s agricultural output while estimates of the impact of enso vary across studies and spatial areas and the impacts differ depending on the enso phase el niño versus la niña there is no longer a debate on whether agricultural yields are affected following an enso occurrence 3 4 and 5 document evidence that deviations in corn yields from long term trend for several midwestern states are associated with enso occurrences in the equatorial pacific ocean 6 show that for several southeastern u s states enso phases significantly affect corn and tobacco yields the volume of soybean and cotton harvested and the values of corn soybean peanut and tobacco 7 provide evidence of lower than expected corn yields during the la niña phase of enso for states in the u s cornbelt but higher than average yields during the el niño phase other papers that report significant associations between enso and u s agricultural output include 8 11 and 12 the finding that enso affects agricultural output has motivated another line of research examining the impact of enso on agricultural commodity prices using a vector autoregressive var model 13 provides evidence that a one standard deviation positive surprise in enso increases real commodity price inflation by 3 5 4 points he also finds that enso accounts for almost 20 of the variation in commodity price inflation and between 10 and 20 of the variability of world consumer price inflation and output growth 14 reports a close link between monthly soybean futures prices and the la niña phase of the enso cycle but no significant responses of corn and wheat futures price movements 15 17 also provide evidence of a link between enso cycles and commodity prices to the extent that enso affects agricultural output and agricultural commodity prices it should affect the stock prices of major food and agricultural companies as well an enso cycle may affect food and agricultural stock prices in at least two possible ways on the one hand an enso cycle that decreases increases agricultural output should reduce increase current and expected cash flows to food and agricultural companies which should in turn cause a decrease increase in their stock prices on the other hand if farmers respond to a fall rise in their output by raising decreasing current and future prices firm cash flows may remain unchanged or even rise fall the overall effect of enso on the stock prices of food and agribusiness firms will depend on whether the fall rise in cash flows to these companies resulting from the decrease increase in output exceeds the increase decrease in cash flows caused by higher lower agricultural commodity prices therefore while it is known that enso affects agricultural output and agricultural commodity prices its impact on food and agricultural stock returns has received little or no attention thereby motivating the need to study the impact of enso on agricultural stock returns the purpose of this paper is to estimate the effect of enso on the stock returns of major u s food and agricultural companies in doing so the paper makes several contributions to the literature on the economic and financial effects of enso first this paper represents the first attempt to estimate and evaluate the effects of enso on the stock returns of u s food and agricultural companies second unlike previous studies that use dummy variable measures to identify periods of enso and non enso events our econometric specification employs a continuous measure of enso intensity based on sea surface temperature anomalies ssta third the dynamic effects of enso on agricultural stock returns are estimated using a recursively identified vector autoregression var model our baseline results indicate that for seven of the twelve stock returns considered an enso shock has a positive and significant effect while the responses of the remaining stock returns are not significantly different from zero forecast error variance decompositions reveal that enso shocks explain only a relatively small proportion of the unpredictable movements in u s agricultural stock returns with other factors responsible for much of the variability of these returns the remainder of the paper is as follows the next section discusses the data and its time series properties section 3 presents the empirical methodology while section 4 reports the baseline results a concluding section is presented in section 5 2 data and time series properties all the data used in this paper are monthly data on most of the stock prices for the food and agricultural companies considered begin in march 1980 although for other variables the data start in january 1978 all series end in december 2018 section 2 1 provides more details on the data on the stock prices of the food and agricultural companies considered section 2 2 describes the data on el niño southern oscillation enso while section 2 3 discusses other variables used in the analysis section 2 4 examines the time series properties of the data as related to stationarity 2 1 data on stock prices of u s food and agricultural companies the dataset contains monthly data on the closing values of the stock prices of twelve u s food and agricultural companies namely the archer daniels midland company the campbell soup company conagra brands inc fmc corporation general mills inc the hershey company hormel foods corporation mccormick company the mosaic company the j m smucker company sysco corporation and tyson foods inc the data on the stock prices of these companies were collected from the center for research in security prices crsp these firms were selected for several reasons first they represent some of the largest publicly traded food and agribusiness firms trading in u s stock exchanges in fact all twelve firms are components of the s p 500 index based on the global industry classification standard gics we narrow down the number of companies to those in the consumer staples and materials sectors from these sectors we further narrow down the number of companies by selecting those in the packaged foods and meats and the fertilizers and agricultural chemicals gics subsectors leaving us with sixteen of the largest u s food and agricultural companies we then consider only companies with long enough data on their stock prices as our empirical methodology requires long time series hence for all companies selected we have monthly stock price data starting in march 1980 except for the mosaic company and the j m smucker company which begin in january 1988 and october 1994 respectively the start dates were dictated by data availability second the output and therefore prices of these companies are most likely to be impacted by enso events than those of other agribusiness companies this implies that their stock prices as well are more likely to be affected by enso events we take a brief look at the companies below 2 1 1 the archer daniels midland company archer daniels midland company is a producer of ingredients that are made from agricultural commodities including oilseeds wheat corn rice and oats the company operates within four segments agricultural services corn processing oilseeds processing and wild flavors and specialty ingredients the agricultural services division focuses on buying storing cleaning and transporting commodities corn processing involves wet and dry milling of corn while oilseeds processing activities are concerned with origination merchandising crushing and processing of oilseeds the wild flavors and specialty ingredients segment engages in the manufacture sale and distribution of specialty products such as natural flavor ingredients emulsifiers proteins and flavor systems as found by ref 6 corn peanuts and soybeans are all affected by enso events since archer daniels midland utilizes these commodities in the production of their food and beverage ingredients changes in the prices of these commodities are likely to affect the cash flows and eventual stock returns of the archer daniels midland company 2 1 2 the campbell soup company the campbell soup company campbell s is a food and beverage manufacturer in the canned specialties industry the company s business segments are americas simple meals and beverages that produce soups sauces pasta and juices global biscuits and snacks and campbell fresh which includes dips dressings fresh carrots and carrot ingredients enso events affecting the production of the commodities within these products would affect their prices eventually affecting cash flows and the returns on campbell s stock 2 1 3 conagra brands inc conagra brands packages and distributes branded and unbranded food products to various retail outlets conagra operates within the frozen specialties industry but also within secondary industries such as potato chips and similar snacks food preparation prepared flour mixes and doughs and flavoring extracts and syrups some of its products include peanut butter frozen dinners cooking oil hot dogs hot cocoa and many more the inputs used to make these products are susceptible to enso events hence it is worth investigating whether enso affects the stock returns of conagra brands inc 2 1 4 fmc corporation fmc corporation is a chemical company that serves the agricultural consumer and industrial global markets fmc operates two business segments fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium fmc agricultural solutions markets crop protection chemicals including herbicides insecticides and fungicides these chemicals are used to enhance crop yield and quality through the removal of crop damaging elements fmc lithium manufactures lithium for use in energy storage and chemical synthesis application if the demand for say herbicides insecticides and fungicides changes due to an enso event that affects crop yields and prices the stock returns of the fmc corporation may be impacted as well 2 1 5 general mills inc general mills manufactures consumer foods within the cereal breakfast foods industry some of the product categories within their north america retail segment are ready to eat cereal grain fruit and savory snacks yogurt and dough products general mills also operates a convenience stores and foodservice segment and has locations in europe australia asia and latin america which produce products similar to those within the north america retail segment precipitation and or temperature anomalies affecting the output of wheat soybeans peanuts or fruit would affect the supply and price of goods offered by general mills prompting us to investigate the impact on their stock returns 2 1 6 the hershey company the hershey company is primarily focused in the production of chocolate and non chocolate confectionery products such as gum and mint refreshments snacks and pantry items the main raw material used in the production of these goods are cocoa products processed from cocoa beans hershey also uses a substantial amount of sugar peanuts almonds and dairy products throughout their production process the strong emphasis on these few agricultural commodities poses a risk to hershey s cash flows and stock performance through a decline in commodity output or increased prices 2 1 7 hormel foods corporation hormel foods corporation produces and markets a variety of meat products throughout the u s and internationally the refrigerated foods division processes beef pork turkey and chicken products for commercial customers however hormel also produces non meat products including salsas tortillas and peanut butter grains account for the largest cost share of animal feed the grains used for the production of animal feed include corn sorghum barley and oats with corn accounting for over 95 of total feed grain 1 1 https www ers usda gov topics crops corn background while corn is grown in most u s states the majority is grown in the midwest 3 6 and 7 find that enso significantly affects corn yields for states in the u s midwest this implies a subsequent change in grain prices if the enso event causes an increase in yields or increase in prices cash flows to agribusiness firms directly engaged in grains rises leading to an increase in stock returns for companies such as hormel foods corporation 2 1 8 mccormick company mccormick company is involved in the production distribution and sale of condiments seasoning mixes and spices to the food industry approximately half of the consumer sales is derived from mccormick s spices herbs and seasonings the company s segments are industrial and consumer including retailers food manufacturers and foodservice businesses 2 2 https www reuters com finance stocks company profile mkc in addition to their north american locations the company has production marketing and distribution locations in europe china south africa thailand singapore mexico australia and india most of the raw materials used to manufacture its products include rice and wheat capsicums pepper garlic vanilla and dairy products 2 1 9 the mosaic company the mosaic company is a leading producer of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients mosaic s three business segments are phosphates potash and international distribution the phosphate segment produces phosphate based animal feed ingredients while the potash segment produces potash a fertilizer for industrial application as well as animal feed ingredients the international distribution division is involved in the sales blending and warehousing of the phosphate and potash products demand for the mosaic company s products is dependent on agricultural production therefore any change in agricultural output due to enso events could result in a change in the demand for mosaic s products impacting its cash flows and stock returns 2 1 10 the j m smucker company smucker is a manufacturer of peanut butter fruit spreads coffee baking mixes and ingredients and pet food the products sold within the u s retail market are sold through direct sales to retailers as well as online retailers the raw goods used are primary commodities such as coffee grains fruit oils and fats sweeteners and peanuts since smucker s relies heavily on agricultural commodities it is assumed that any change to these products would have a significant impact on the performance of the firm thus precipitation and temperature anomalies resulting from enso may have adverse or beneficial effects on the commodities used by smucker s as inputs which may in turn cause changes in its stock returns depending on price changes of these commodities 2 1 11 sysco corporation sysco operates primarily in the groceries general line industry with four operating segments namely u s foodservice international foodservice sygma a u s distribution subsidiary and other primarily focused on sysco labs and hotel supply operations food items distributed by sysco include fresh meats and seafood a full line of frozen canned and dry foods dairy products produce and beverages the company s non food items include paper products cookware restaurant equipment and cleaning supplies pertaining to sysco s food products sysco relies on agricultural commodities for their produce as well as feed for the animals as mentioned with respect to similar companies above relying on these commodities exposes sysco corporation in general and its stock returns in particular to enso events 2 1 12 tyson foods inc tyson foods focuses primarily on the production of chicken through breeding feed production processing and further processing cobb vantress inc a wholly owned subsidiary serves as a poultry breeding stock supplier for tyson in addition to the chicken segment tyson reports three additional business segments beef pork and prepared foods both the beef and pork divisions process live cattle and pigs and fabricate the carcasses into primal and sub primal meat products the prepared foods division include refrigerated meat products as well as snacks side dishes tortilla products and appetizers similar to hormel foods changes in grain prices that arise due to an enso effect affecting grain output will directly impact cash flows to tyson foods table 1 provides a summary of the food and agricultural companies gics sectors and subsectors and their standard industry classification sic and north american industry classification system naics codes 2 2 data on el niño southern oscillation enso monthly sea surface temperature anomalies ssta for the niño 3 4 region 5 n to 5 s 120 w to 170 w are used as the measure of enso intensity in this paper the data on ssta come from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center fig 2 shows the historical evolution of enso the noaa defines an el niño warm event as average ssta over three consecutive months of 0 5 c 0 9 f or higher while average ssta of three consecutive months of 0 5 c 0 9 f or less represent the cool phase la niña of enso when ssta over three consecutive months are between 0 5 c and 0 5 c they are referred to as neutral enso events enso events are further categorized as very strong ssta over 2 0 strong ssta between 1 5 and 1 9 moderate 1 0 1 4 and weak 0 5 0 9 based on these definitions fig 2 shows most enso occurrences have been neutral and that many el niño and la niña episodes have been weak or moderate with only two episodes of very strong el niño occurrences four periods of strong el niño and only three relatively short periods of strong la niña events while some papers have used the southern oscillation index soi anomalies to capture enso events this paper exclusively uses ssta for several reasons first the official measure of enso used by the noaa the oceanic niño index oni is based on sea surface temperatures in the east central tropical pacific ocean it is perhaps for this reason that ssta are the most widely used enso indicator in academic research see e g refs 6 13 and 18 second the soi is calculated as the difference between the atmospheric pressure at sea level over tahiti and over darwin australia as pointed out by the noaa the fact that the soi is derived from sea level pressure over just two stations implies that shorter term sea level pressure fluctuations not related to enso can affect the soi 3 3 https www climate gov news features blogs enso why are there so many enso indexes instead just one third the two stations over which sea level pressure data are collected to estimate the soi tahiti and darwin are located south of the equator tahiti at 18 s darwin at 12 s enso however is typically focused closer to the equator 2 3 other variables other variables used in the paper include monthly data on the s p 500 index and the u s industrial production index output all collected from the federal reserve economic database fred of the saint louis fed given the large literature on the role of inflation uncertainty for u s stock returns we include the measure of inflation expectations from the survey research center src at the university of michigan the var model also includes the broad currency real trade weighted u s dollar index to control for the link between stock returns and the foreign exchange rate the data on the real trade weighted index are from fred 4 4 the broad currency index includes the euro area canada japan mexico china united kingdom taiwan korea singapore hong kong malaysia brazil switzerland thailand philippines australia indonesia india israel saudi arabia russia sweden argentina venezuela chile and colombia for more information about trade weighted indexes see http www federalreserve gov pubs bulletin 2005 winter05 index pdf all estimated var models also include the monthly premium of the book to market factor hml the monthly premium of the size factor smb and momentum of the stock market umd all collected from the wharton research data services wrds the starting date for most of the data is january 1978 and all series end in december 2018 table 2 contains variable definitions data sources and the starting date for all the variables used in the paper ph variable names definitions and sources 2 4 unit root and stationarity tests as is standard in the time series literature we pretest the variables for unit roots conducting four unit root tests namely the augmented dickey fuller 19 test adf the phillips perron 20 test pp the 21 modified dickey fuller ers test and the 22 test kpss the first three tests test the null hypothesis of an autoregressive unit root while the kpss tests the null of stationarity while the adf and pp tests are probably the most frequently used in time series modeling they tend to have low power against the alternative hypothesis that the data are stationary with a large autoregressive root 23 they also generally tend to over reject the null when the data are characterized by a large negative moving average root 24 the ers test has been shown to outperform the adf and pp tests in terms of both size and power and seems to be the preferred alternative to the adf and pp tests table 3 reports the unit root and stationarity tests for the series in levels and in log first differences for the ssta series the adf ers and pp tests reject the null hypothesis that the series contains a unit root while the kpss finds significant evidence that the series is stationary at the 5 significance level the premium of size factor the book to market factor and the momentum of the stock market are all stationary in levels as well all four tests also provide significant evidence that the s p 500 index output the real trade weighted u s dollar index and the agricultural stock prices are nonstationary in levels but stationary after first differencing the finding that some variables are i 0 in levels whereas others are i 1 rules out the need to test for cointegration 3 empirical methodology we begin the methodology section by first presenting a brief review of some key determinants of u s stock returns in section 3 1 section 3 2 presents the var model and discusses the identification restrictions underlying the model 3 1 a brief review of the determinants of u s stock returns the literature on the determinants of u s stock returns is vast we briefly review this literature to rationalize the choice of the variables we include in our var model in conducting this review we first briefly discuss the literature on the macroeconomic determinants of u s stock returns and then proceed to discussing other determinants 3 1 1 macroeconomic determinants of u s stock returns asset pricing theory postulates that factors that influence individuals consumption decisions and investment opportunities should also impact asset prices 25 26 variables that influence the macroeconomy are certainly examples of such factors hence changes in some macroeconomic variables are likely to have impacts on stock returns the first and perhaps most obvious measure of economic activity is an economy s total output measured by the gross domestic product gdp or industrial production a rise in aggregate output should increase current and expected cash flows to firms which should in turn cause a rise in stock prices and returns hence the var model shown hereinafter contains a measure of u s aggregate output to control for its effect on u s agricultural stock returns another recognized macroeconomic determinant of stock returns is inflation uncertainty 27 points out that uncertainty about the inflation rate raises the required risk premium leading to an increase in the discount rate lowering the present discounted value of expected future firm cash flows which in turn causes a decline in stock prices in addition inflation uncertainty creates uncertainty about future economic activity this uncertainty which has a negative impact on aggregate economic activity also has an adverse impact on stock returns thus in all the var models we control for the impact of inflation uncertainty exchange rate fluctuations have also been discussed as another important determinant of stock returns assuming that exchange rates and prices cannot be costlessly hedged and are volatile an appreciation of the value of the domestic currency relative to the foreign currency negatively affects domestic exporting firms as pointed out by ref 28 the share prices of these firms may then reflect an ex ante premium for exchange risk conversely cash flows and hence stock returns of importing firms rise following an appreciation of the real value of the domestic currency 28 also argue that the cash flows and stock prices of domestic firms that are not engaged in international trade may also be impacted because of the impact of exchange rate movements on their foreign competitors input costs aggregate demand or other factors that affect cash flows and required returns page 542 certainly a multitude of other macroeconomic variables are known to impact stock returns we limit our discussion to these three because they are perhaps the three most recognized determinants of stock market returns in the literature 27 secondly they are the macro variables most likely to impact food and agricultural companies and their profitability in addition var models with many variables often suffer from technical and computational difficulties related to a loss of degrees of freedom while rendering identification restrictions imposed on the var model questionable 3 1 2 other determinants of u s stock returns we also consider the relationship between agricultural stock returns and the fama french carhart model variables see e g refs 29 31 and 32 namely the monthly premium of the size factor smb the monthly premium of the book to market factor hml and momentum of the stock market umd 29 find weak support for the hypothesis that the beta coefficient fully captures the risk return relationship they developed the three factor model and showed consistent with the capital asset pricing model capm that the risk premium depends on the factor market but also on the size of the firm as well as the ratio of the book value of a firm s common stock to its market value 32 extended the fama french three factor model by including a momentum factor for asset pricing of stocks which measures the stock market s ability to sustain a positive or negative change in prices the premium of the size factor smb is defined as the difference between the average return on the three small portfolios and the average return on the three large portfolios 1 3 s m a l l v a l u e s m a l l n e u t r a l s m a l l g r o w t h 1 3 b i g v a l u e b i g n e u t r a l b i g g r o w t h the book to market factor hml is defined as the difference between the average return on the two value portfolios and the average return on the two growth portfolios 1 2 s m a l l v a l u e b i g v a l u e 1 2 s m a l l g r o w t h b i g g r o w t h the momentum factor measures the difference between the average return on the two high prior return portfolios and the average return on the two low prior return portfolios 1 2 s m a l l h i g h b i g h i g h 1 2 s m a l l l o w b i g l o w to save space and because these variables are not the main variables of interest in the current paper but are only included to control for their impacts on u s agricultural stock returns we refer the reader to among others 29 31 and 32 for details of the construction of and rationale for these factors these authors find empirical evidence that these factors have reliable explanatory power for u s stock returns 3 2 the var model the baseline var model relating enso and agricultural stock returns is 1 a 0 x t α i 1 k a i x t i ε t where ε t denotes serially and mutually uncorrelated innovations and k denotes the maximum lag length x is a vector of endogenous variables containing in the order listed our ssta measure of enso intensity gdp growth the measure of inflation uncertainty the real trade weighted dollar index the monthly premium of the book to market factor the monthly premium of the size factor momentum of the stock market and a measure of the percentage change in agricultural stock prices we select the optimal lag length using the akaike information criterion aic with 1 k 12 in equation 1 the delay restrictions imposed are such that the reduced form residuals e t are related to the structural shocks ε t according to e t a 0 1 ε t we assume that enso events do not respond contemporaneously to shocks to the other variables it is reasonable to treat the enso variable as exogenous since shocks to the u s economy are not large enough to impact global weather events such as enso the ordering of the remaining variables is consistent with the related economics literature see e g refs 33 34 that u s output can be treated as largely exogenous in relation to the contemporaneous values of the other economic variables and stock returns the final identifying assumption is such that u s food and agricultural stock returns are assumed to react to the preceding variables within a given month 4 impulse responses and variance decompositions in order to shed light on the need for studying the impacts of enso on the stock returns of food and agricultural companies we first examine the effects of enso on aggregate stock returns and the macroeconomy in section 4 1 in section 4 2 we present the dynamic effects of enso on u s agricultural stock returns throughout the paper we trace out these dynamic impacts with the help of impulse response functions an impulse response function shows the dynamic response of a variable over a specified time horizon following a shock or impulse to the same or another variable at a given instant it is predominantly used in modern empirical macroeconomics for causal inference and to analyze policy effectiveness to take potential heteroscedasticity of the residuals into account the dashed lines in the figures shown hereinafter are the 90 confidence bands constructed using the wild bootstrap as described by ref 35 with 1000 repetitions the solid lines in all the figures represent the cumulative response coefficients the procedure for the wild bootstrap is as follows first an artificial vector of shocks for each draw is constructed by multiplying an independent and identically distributed iid shock from a standard normal distribution with each element of the vector of residuals e t these artificial shocks together with the coefficients of the estimated var model are then used to construct artificial datasets we then re estimate the var models and compute impulse response functions with these artificial data invoking the same recursive assumptions cholesky decomposition described in section 3 2 we repeat this process 1000 times the 5th and the 95th percentiles of the 1000 bootstrapped impulse response functions are then used as the 90 confidence bands 4 1 the effects of enso on the macroeconomy and aggregate stock returns it is useful to first examine the responses of u s macroeconomic variables and aggregate stock returns to enso shocks before proceeding to the responses of the stock returns of the food and agricultural companies as a measure of aggregate stock returns we use the monthly percentage change in the s p 500 index fig 3 presents the impulse responses estimated for a horizon of up to 12 months and their corresponding 90 confidence intervals as expected fig 3 shows that a positive enso shock causes a significant and persistent increase in ssta the key result in fig 3 however is that enso shocks have no statistically significant impact on aggregate stock returns and the macroeconomy 13 using data for the g 7 countries also finds that enso has no significant effects on average g 7 output growth and aggregate prices arguing that this insignificant effect is expected as primary commodities that are likely to be affected by enso account for only a small percentage of aggregate output of the g 7 countries 18 document similar insignificant macroeconomic effects of enso for the u s economy while no studies to the best of our knowledge have estimated the impact of enso on the s p 500 index similar arguments can be made for the insignificance of the response of the s p 500 index these findings however do not necessarily imply that enso has no effect on agricultural stock prices as broad measures such as the s p 500 index and aggregate economic variables might conceal the impacts of enso on u s agricultural stock returns 4 2 the effects of enso on u s agricultural stock returns 4 2 1 impulse response functions fig 4 shows the cumulative impulse response functions of the stock returns of the twelve food and agricultural companies to an enso shock of the twelve returns considered seven experience statistically significant increases in response to an enso shock albeit of different magnitudes and horizons following an unanticipated surprise in enso stock returns of the campbell soup company conagra brands inc general mills inc hormel foods corporation mccormick and company the j m smucker company and sysco corporation rise except for the returns of the j m smucker company which rise on impact following an enso shock the contemporaneous responses of the returns of the other companies are statistically indistinguishable from zero the response of the returns of campbell s turns significantly positive three months after the enso shock and remains significant for the next five months a similar pattern is found with respect to the response of sysco corporation the responses of the returns of conagra brands inc general mills inc hormel foods corporation mccormick company display similar patterns both qualitatively and quantitatively that is after an initial delay the returns of the companies increase following an enso surprise but the increase is shortlived generally becoming statistically indistinguishable from zero three to four months after the enso shock these responses are in fact consistent with expectation consider the response of the returns of hormel foods corporation for example the company is one of the world s largest meat and poultry producers and distributors grains account for the largest cost share of animal feed the grains used for the production of animal feed include corn sorghum barley and oats with corn accounting for over 95 of total feed grain 5 5 https www ers usda gov topics crops corn background while corn is grown in most u s states the majority is grown in the midwest 3 and 4 7 find that enso significantly affects corn yields for states in the u s midwest this implies a subsequent change in grain prices if the enso event causes an increase in yields or increase in prices cash flows to agribusiness firms directly engaged in grains rises leading to an increase in stock returns for companies such as hormel foods corporation a similar argument can in fact be made with respect to the returns of the other six companies whose returns exhibit a statistically significant positive response following a shock to enso fig 4 also shows that the impulse responses of five stock returns however are not statistically different from zero at any forecast horizon for some of these companies this is expected as their products are not directly associated with weather events the fmc corporation and the mosaic company are leading providers of crop nutrients specifically concentrated phosphate potash and nitrogen nutrients to maintain healthy and productive soils enso shocks should have no direct impacts of these nutrients as they are produced from mineral deposits potash and phosphate and from the atmosphere nitrogen while enso might affect these companies indirectly through changes in the demand for their products by companies who use their products as inputs these companies generally enter contractual price agreements hedging long before enso occurrences so that unanticipated enso shocks should have only small effects if any on the stock returns of the mosaic company and fmc corporation on the other hand the finding of statistically insignificant responses of some returns was surprising as some of these firms are directly engaged in crop production whose yields and prices are impacted by enso events for example tyson foods focuses on the production of chicken through breeding feed production and processing in addition to the chicken segment their beef and pork segments process live cattle and pigs into primal and sub primal meat products their prepared foods division includes refrigerated meat products as well as snacks side dishes tortilla products and appetizers similar to hormel foods changes in grain prices due to enso should impact cash flows to tyson foods given the similarity with hormel foods inc it is rather puzzling that its stock returns are insignificant the archer daniels midland company specializes in global foods processing as well as commodity trading the company is primarily engaged in the processing of oil seeds such as soybeans cottonseed sunflower seeds canola peanuts flaxseed and palm kernel national oilseed processors association the archer daniel midland s corn processing segment specializes in corn wet milling and dry milling activities 6 6 http www adm com en us products feed corn co pages default aspx with previous research reporting evidence that the output of these firms are quite vulnerable to enso events the insignificant responses shown in fig 4 are rather surprising 4 2 2 variance decomposition the finding that an enso shock has a positive impact on the stock returns of some u s food and agricultural stock returns does not necessarily mean that enso events are important determinants of these stock returns because the enso shocks might be small to take an extreme example suppose meteorological advances made it possible to perfectly predict all future extreme enso events in this case there will be no shocks at all to enso because it could be predicted perfectly in every time period therefore no matter how severe an enso occurrence is the shock would have no importance for agricultural stock returns therefore it is both the impact and the variance of an enso shock that determine its importance to gauge the relative importance of enso events for u s agricultural stock returns table 4 presents the percent contribution of enso shocks to the overall variability of the stock returns resulting from the variance decomposition of the svar model 1 at all forecast horizons enso shocks have negligible explanatory power for fluctuations in the stock returns of u s food and agricultural companies on impact the effect of the shock is 0 as the time horizon lengthens the quantitative importance of the enso shocks gradually increases nonetheless at no point does a shock to enso explain more than 3 of the movements in any of the stock returns the main conclusion from the variance decompositions in table 4 is that enso shocks explain only a relatively small portion of the unpredictable fluctuations of the stock returns of u s food and agricultural firms with other factors responsible for much of the variability of these returns the finding in table 4 that other shocks rather than enso have negligible explanatory power for fluctuations in the stock returns of u s food and agricultural companies coupled with the insignificant responses of some returns and the shortlived significant responses of other returns in fig 4 is potentially explained by the efficient market hypothesis assuming that u s agricultural markets are efficient then the impacts of enso shocks will be incorporated in the stock returns of food and agricultural companies especially at longer horizons so that if enso shocks have any impacts these impacts occur in the short run and are relatively shortlived for instance suppose enso shocks raise spot prices of food and agricultural commodities over time the market anticipates these higher spot prices and moves the forward curve steeply into forwardation as sea surface temperatures change given that of enso cycles have been occurring more frequently as shown in fig 2 and as documented by among others trenberth and hoar 1996 and qian et al 2011 it is plausible that enso shocks are incorporated in agricultural stock returns explaining the insignificant responses of the stock returns of the archer daniels midland company hershey s and tyson foods inc and the short term shortlived significant responses of the other stock returns in fig 4 4 2 3 historical decomposition while impulse response functions and variance decompositions are usually the main focus in the var literature they mostly show the timing and magnitude of the responses to a one time shock historical decompositions of the effects of a sequence of shocks can provide additional information to help assess the cumulative effect of this sequence of shocks 36 37 this is particularly important in our case because historical enso shocks have not been limited to one time occurrences but rather a vector sequence of shocks often of different magnitudes and frequently alternating between el niño and la niña accordingly fig 5 presents the historical decomposition of the sequence of enso shocks on fluctuations in u s agricultural stock returns solid lines to evaluate the cumulative effect of such shocks dashed lines depict the actual values of the u s agricultural stock return series it is apparent from the figure that historically movements in the stock returns of u s food and agricultural companies have been driven by other shocks rather than enso shocks 4 2 4 how sensitive are the responses to changes in the lag length the impulse responses in fig 4 are based on var models in which the lag lengths were chosen using the aic at least three problems arise when using information criteria to select the lag order for var models first information criteria are known for selecting extremely short lag lengths in fact in no instance does the aic select a lag length greater than three for any of the var models used to construct the impulse response functions shown in 4 second for long enough monthly time series it is generally recommended to use long lags in order to cover seasonality third var models are known to be quite sensitive to the lag order specification hence if the results from var analyses are to be credible their sensitivity to alternative lag lengths must be studied fig 6 shows the impulse response functions of the stock returns to an enso shock in var models including 12 lags of the endogenous variables looking at the figure it is apparent that the underlying findings continue to hold six of the twelve returns exhibit significant increases in response to an enso shock these are the same returns shown to rise following an enso surprise in fig 4 while the response of campbell s is still positive it is now not different from zero in a statistical sense taken together we conclude that the general findings of the paper are robust to lag order specification 7 7 we also experimented with lag lengths of 4 6 8 and 10 generally finding that the results are invariant to the lag order specification 4 2 5 how sensitive are the responses to the ordering of the variables another limitation of var analyses is that impulse response functions can be sensitive to the ordering of the variables in the var model while we follow the convention in the var literature to order the more exogenous variables ahead of the less exogenous ones it is necessary to check the robustness of the results to alternative ordering of the variables this section does that of course with an 8 variable var model it is not possible to verify the robustness of the results to all possible ordering schemes as there are multiple possible ways of ordering the variables consequently we only present results of the reverse ordering that is the impulse response functions are estimated from var models containing in the order listed the agricultural stock return of interest momentum of the stock market the premium of the size factor the premium of the book to market factor the real trade weighted dollar index the measure of inflation uncertainty output growth and the ssta measure of enso intensity we only perform this analysis to examine the stability of the results to alternative ordering of the variables admittedly this ordering is not plausible as it is unlikely for agricultural stock returns to have contemporaneous effects of enso aggregate output and the other aggregate economic and financial variables fig 7 presents the impulse response functions of this specification recall that the ordering of the variables now reflects the assumption that the stock returns of u s food and agricultural companies impact enso immediately but that enso affects stock returns with a delay of a month hence by construction the impulse responses in fig 7 are at zero on impact subsequent responses mirror those shown in fig 4 that is stock returns of the campbell soup company conagra brands inc general mills inc hormel foods corporation mccormick and company the j m smucker company and sysco corporation increase but the positive responses tend to be shortlived the responses of the returns of the five other companies as in fig 4 are not different from zero this analysis gives us some degree of confidence that the results of this paper are not sensitive to the ordering of the variables in the var models 5 conclusion the paper estimates the response of twelve u s agricultural stock returns to enso shocks using a recursively identified var model the delay restrictions imposed for identification of the structural shocks are achieved by applying a cholesky decomposition of the reduced form residual covariance matrix our results indicate that the responses of five of the twelve stock returns are not significantly different from zero while seven of the stock returns rise significantly following an enso shock the rise in the stock returns however are relatively shortlived typically turning indistinguishable from zero three to six months after the enso shock results of variance decompositions show that enso shocks explain only a relatively small portion of the unpredictable fluctuations of u s agricultural stock returns we also find that historically movements in u s agricultural stock returns have been driven by other shocks rather than enso shocks the empirical reliance on a linear var model has some limitations recent empirical papers have found that enso may have asymmetric economic effects see e g ubilava d and holt m 2013 and 38 it is therefore plausible that enso shocks may have nonlinear and or asymmetric effects on agricultural stock returns as well if this is indeed the case then the simple var analysis of this paper may not be sufficient to capture these asymmetries nonlinearities it is possible that it is not just an enso shock that matters for u s agricultural stock returns but the type and magnitude of the enso shock the responses of these returns may depend on whether the enso shock is an el niño la niña or neutral shock thus future research may examine asymmetries and nonlinearities in the impact of enso on agricultural stock returns author statement bebonchu atems methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft writing review

8687,the paper examines the response of twelve u s agricultural stock returns to el niño southern oscillation enso shocks using a recursive var model baseline results indicate that for seven of the stock returns an enso shock has positive and significant effects the effects however are shortlived generally becoming statistically indistinguishable from zero three to six months after the shock variance decomposition analyses show that enso shocks have little explanatory power for fluctuations in u s agricultural stock returns we also provide evidence that historically movements in the stock returns of u s food and agricultural companies have been driven by other shocks rather than enso shocks keywords vector autoregression el niño southern oscillation agriculture stock returns jel classification q41 c32 1 introduction el niño southern oscillation enso is a naturally occurring weather phenomenon that involves fluctuations in winds and ocean surface temperatures in the central and east central equatorial pacific ocean the weather pattern which usually occurs around december can have varying intensities el niño refers to the warm phase of the enso cycle while la niña refers to the cool phase the impacts of el niño and la niña are strongest in the winter immediately following the onset of the event fig 1 shows the typical wintertime effects of el niño and la niña for the u s the northern tier of the 48 contiguous u s states generally experiences above normal temperatures in the fall and winter seasons during el niño episodes while the gulf coast states exhibit below average temperatures an unusually strong and more southerly subtropical jet stream during the el niño phase brings above normal precipitation in southern california the gulf coast and southeastern u s states in hawaii el niño causes drier than normal conditions in the winter and early spring months below average dry season precipitation in guam and above normal precipitation in american samoa in the eastern and central pacific regions of the u s higher sea surface temperatures associated with el niño increase the likelihood of hurricanes in these regions 1 2 the effects of the la niña phase of enso are generally the opposite of those of the el niño phase although the magnitudes spatial dimension and duration of its effects may differ these weather changes tend to have considerable impacts on the world s distribution of water resources and water supply during the start of a typical enso cycle trade winds blow westward warming up surface waters in oceania off the west coast of south america these warmer ocean waters force nutrient rich colder waters further down in the ocean to rise disrupting fisheries anchovies for example which typically flourish in the cold waters off the coasts of peru and ecuador are forced to flee south for colder waters as already mentioned enso can cause drought conditions or an increase in precipitation depending on the enso phase as many countries depend on rainfall and groundwater as sources of freshwater enso can have significant impacts on freshwater resources which in turn may have considerable effects on human health agricultural production and even stock prices extensive research has documented significant relationships between enso occurrences and u s agricultural output while estimates of the impact of enso vary across studies and spatial areas and the impacts differ depending on the enso phase el niño versus la niña there is no longer a debate on whether agricultural yields are affected following an enso occurrence 3 4 and 5 document evidence that deviations in corn yields from long term trend for several midwestern states are associated with enso occurrences in the equatorial pacific ocean 6 show that for several southeastern u s states enso phases significantly affect corn and tobacco yields the volume of soybean and cotton harvested and the values of corn soybean peanut and tobacco 7 provide evidence of lower than expected corn yields during the la niña phase of enso for states in the u s cornbelt but higher than average yields during the el niño phase other papers that report significant associations between enso and u s agricultural output include 8 11 and 12 the finding that enso affects agricultural output has motivated another line of research examining the impact of enso on agricultural commodity prices using a vector autoregressive var model 13 provides evidence that a one standard deviation positive surprise in enso increases real commodity price inflation by 3 5 4 points he also finds that enso accounts for almost 20 of the variation in commodity price inflation and between 10 and 20 of the variability of world consumer price inflation and output growth 14 reports a close link between monthly soybean futures prices and the la niña phase of the enso cycle but no significant responses of corn and wheat futures price movements 15 17 also provide evidence of a link between enso cycles and commodity prices to the extent that enso affects agricultural output and agricultural commodity prices it should affect the stock prices of major food and agricultural companies as well an enso cycle may affect food and agricultural stock prices in at least two possible ways on the one hand an enso cycle that decreases increases agricultural output should reduce increase current and expected cash flows to food and agricultural companies which should in turn cause a decrease increase in their stock prices on the other hand if farmers respond to a fall rise in their output by raising decreasing current and future prices firm cash flows may remain unchanged or even rise fall the overall effect of enso on the stock prices of food and agribusiness firms will depend on whether the fall rise in cash flows to these companies resulting from the decrease increase in output exceeds the increase decrease in cash flows caused by higher lower agricultural commodity prices therefore while it is known that enso affects agricultural output and agricultural commodity prices its impact on food and agricultural stock returns has received little or no attention thereby motivating the need to study the impact of enso on agricultural stock returns the purpose of this paper is to estimate the effect of enso on the stock returns of major u s food and agricultural companies in doing so the paper makes several contributions to the literature on the economic and financial effects of enso first this paper represents the first attempt to estimate and evaluate the effects of enso on the stock returns of u s food and agricultural companies second unlike previous studies that use dummy variable measures to identify periods of enso and non enso events our econometric specification employs a continuous measure of enso intensity based on sea surface temperature anomalies ssta third the dynamic effects of enso on agricultural stock returns are estimated using a recursively identified vector autoregression var model our baseline results indicate that for seven of the twelve stock returns considered an enso shock has a positive and significant effect while the responses of the remaining stock returns are not significantly different from zero forecast error variance decompositions reveal that enso shocks explain only a relatively small proportion of the unpredictable movements in u s agricultural stock returns with other factors responsible for much of the variability of these returns the remainder of the paper is as follows the next section discusses the data and its time series properties section 3 presents the empirical methodology while section 4 reports the baseline results a concluding section is presented in section 5 2 data and time series properties all the data used in this paper are monthly data on most of the stock prices for the food and agricultural companies considered begin in march 1980 although for other variables the data start in january 1978 all series end in december 2018 section 2 1 provides more details on the data on the stock prices of the food and agricultural companies considered section 2 2 describes the data on el niño southern oscillation enso while section 2 3 discusses other variables used in the analysis section 2 4 examines the time series properties of the data as related to stationarity 2 1 data on stock prices of u s food and agricultural companies the dataset contains monthly data on the closing values of the stock prices of twelve u s food and agricultural companies namely the archer daniels midland company the campbell soup company conagra brands inc fmc corporation general mills inc the hershey company hormel foods corporation mccormick company the mosaic company the j m smucker company sysco corporation and tyson foods inc the data on the stock prices of these companies were collected from the center for research in security prices crsp these firms were selected for several reasons first they represent some of the largest publicly traded food and agribusiness firms trading in u s stock exchanges in fact all twelve firms are components of the s p 500 index based on the global industry classification standard gics we narrow down the number of companies to those in the consumer staples and materials sectors from these sectors we further narrow down the number of companies by selecting those in the packaged foods and meats and the fertilizers and agricultural chemicals gics subsectors leaving us with sixteen of the largest u s food and agricultural companies we then consider only companies with long enough data on their stock prices as our empirical methodology requires long time series hence for all companies selected we have monthly stock price data starting in march 1980 except for the mosaic company and the j m smucker company which begin in january 1988 and october 1994 respectively the start dates were dictated by data availability second the output and therefore prices of these companies are most likely to be impacted by enso events than those of other agribusiness companies this implies that their stock prices as well are more likely to be affected by enso events we take a brief look at the companies below 2 1 1 the archer daniels midland company archer daniels midland company is a producer of ingredients that are made from agricultural commodities including oilseeds wheat corn rice and oats the company operates within four segments agricultural services corn processing oilseeds processing and wild flavors and specialty ingredients the agricultural services division focuses on buying storing cleaning and transporting commodities corn processing involves wet and dry milling of corn while oilseeds processing activities are concerned with origination merchandising crushing and processing of oilseeds the wild flavors and specialty ingredients segment engages in the manufacture sale and distribution of specialty products such as natural flavor ingredients emulsifiers proteins and flavor systems as found by ref 6 corn peanuts and soybeans are all affected by enso events since archer daniels midland utilizes these commodities in the production of their food and beverage ingredients changes in the prices of these commodities are likely to affect the cash flows and eventual stock returns of the archer daniels midland company 2 1 2 the campbell soup company the campbell soup company campbell s is a food and beverage manufacturer in the canned specialties industry the company s business segments are americas simple meals and beverages that produce soups sauces pasta and juices global biscuits and snacks and campbell fresh which includes dips dressings fresh carrots and carrot ingredients enso events affecting the production of the commodities within these products would affect their prices eventually affecting cash flows and the returns on campbell s stock 2 1 3 conagra brands inc conagra brands packages and distributes branded and unbranded food products to various retail outlets conagra operates within the frozen specialties industry but also within secondary industries such as potato chips and similar snacks food preparation prepared flour mixes and doughs and flavoring extracts and syrups some of its products include peanut butter frozen dinners cooking oil hot dogs hot cocoa and many more the inputs used to make these products are susceptible to enso events hence it is worth investigating whether enso affects the stock returns of conagra brands inc 2 1 4 fmc corporation fmc corporation is a chemical company that serves the agricultural consumer and industrial global markets fmc operates two business segments fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium fmc agricultural solutions markets crop protection chemicals including herbicides insecticides and fungicides these chemicals are used to enhance crop yield and quality through the removal of crop damaging elements fmc lithium manufactures lithium for use in energy storage and chemical synthesis application if the demand for say herbicides insecticides and fungicides changes due to an enso event that affects crop yields and prices the stock returns of the fmc corporation may be impacted as well 2 1 5 general mills inc general mills manufactures consumer foods within the cereal breakfast foods industry some of the product categories within their north america retail segment are ready to eat cereal grain fruit and savory snacks yogurt and dough products general mills also operates a convenience stores and foodservice segment and has locations in europe australia asia and latin america which produce products similar to those within the north america retail segment precipitation and or temperature anomalies affecting the output of wheat soybeans peanuts or fruit would affect the supply and price of goods offered by general mills prompting us to investigate the impact on their stock returns 2 1 6 the hershey company the hershey company is primarily focused in the production of chocolate and non chocolate confectionery products such as gum and mint refreshments snacks and pantry items the main raw material used in the production of these goods are cocoa products processed from cocoa beans hershey also uses a substantial amount of sugar peanuts almonds and dairy products throughout their production process the strong emphasis on these few agricultural commodities poses a risk to hershey s cash flows and stock performance through a decline in commodity output or increased prices 2 1 7 hormel foods corporation hormel foods corporation produces and markets a variety of meat products throughout the u s and internationally the refrigerated foods division processes beef pork turkey and chicken products for commercial customers however hormel also produces non meat products including salsas tortillas and peanut butter grains account for the largest cost share of animal feed the grains used for the production of animal feed include corn sorghum barley and oats with corn accounting for over 95 of total feed grain 1 1 https www ers usda gov topics crops corn background while corn is grown in most u s states the majority is grown in the midwest 3 6 and 7 find that enso significantly affects corn yields for states in the u s midwest this implies a subsequent change in grain prices if the enso event causes an increase in yields or increase in prices cash flows to agribusiness firms directly engaged in grains rises leading to an increase in stock returns for companies such as hormel foods corporation 2 1 8 mccormick company mccormick company is involved in the production distribution and sale of condiments seasoning mixes and spices to the food industry approximately half of the consumer sales is derived from mccormick s spices herbs and seasonings the company s segments are industrial and consumer including retailers food manufacturers and foodservice businesses 2 2 https www reuters com finance stocks company profile mkc in addition to their north american locations the company has production marketing and distribution locations in europe china south africa thailand singapore mexico australia and india most of the raw materials used to manufacture its products include rice and wheat capsicums pepper garlic vanilla and dairy products 2 1 9 the mosaic company the mosaic company is a leading producer of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients mosaic s three business segments are phosphates potash and international distribution the phosphate segment produces phosphate based animal feed ingredients while the potash segment produces potash a fertilizer for industrial application as well as animal feed ingredients the international distribution division is involved in the sales blending and warehousing of the phosphate and potash products demand for the mosaic company s products is dependent on agricultural production therefore any change in agricultural output due to enso events could result in a change in the demand for mosaic s products impacting its cash flows and stock returns 2 1 10 the j m smucker company smucker is a manufacturer of peanut butter fruit spreads coffee baking mixes and ingredients and pet food the products sold within the u s retail market are sold through direct sales to retailers as well as online retailers the raw goods used are primary commodities such as coffee grains fruit oils and fats sweeteners and peanuts since smucker s relies heavily on agricultural commodities it is assumed that any change to these products would have a significant impact on the performance of the firm thus precipitation and temperature anomalies resulting from enso may have adverse or beneficial effects on the commodities used by smucker s as inputs which may in turn cause changes in its stock returns depending on price changes of these commodities 2 1 11 sysco corporation sysco operates primarily in the groceries general line industry with four operating segments namely u s foodservice international foodservice sygma a u s distribution subsidiary and other primarily focused on sysco labs and hotel supply operations food items distributed by sysco include fresh meats and seafood a full line of frozen canned and dry foods dairy products produce and beverages the company s non food items include paper products cookware restaurant equipment and cleaning supplies pertaining to sysco s food products sysco relies on agricultural commodities for their produce as well as feed for the animals as mentioned with respect to similar companies above relying on these commodities exposes sysco corporation in general and its stock returns in particular to enso events 2 1 12 tyson foods inc tyson foods focuses primarily on the production of chicken through breeding feed production processing and further processing cobb vantress inc a wholly owned subsidiary serves as a poultry breeding stock supplier for tyson in addition to the chicken segment tyson reports three additional business segments beef pork and prepared foods both the beef and pork divisions process live cattle and pigs and fabricate the carcasses into primal and sub primal meat products the prepared foods division include refrigerated meat products as well as snacks side dishes tortilla products and appetizers similar to hormel foods changes in grain prices that arise due to an enso effect affecting grain output will directly impact cash flows to tyson foods table 1 provides a summary of the food and agricultural companies gics sectors and subsectors and their standard industry classification sic and north american industry classification system naics codes 2 2 data on el niño southern oscillation enso monthly sea surface temperature anomalies ssta for the niño 3 4 region 5 n to 5 s 120 w to 170 w are used as the measure of enso intensity in this paper the data on ssta come from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center fig 2 shows the historical evolution of enso the noaa defines an el niño warm event as average ssta over three consecutive months of 0 5 c 0 9 f or higher while average ssta of three consecutive months of 0 5 c 0 9 f or less represent the cool phase la niña of enso when ssta over three consecutive months are between 0 5 c and 0 5 c they are referred to as neutral enso events enso events are further categorized as very strong ssta over 2 0 strong ssta between 1 5 and 1 9 moderate 1 0 1 4 and weak 0 5 0 9 based on these definitions fig 2 shows most enso occurrences have been neutral and that many el niño and la niña episodes have been weak or moderate with only two episodes of very strong el niño occurrences four periods of strong el niño and only three relatively short periods of strong la niña events while some papers have used the southern oscillation index soi anomalies to capture enso events this paper exclusively uses ssta for several reasons first the official measure of enso used by the noaa the oceanic niño index oni is based on sea surface temperatures in the east central tropical pacific ocean it is perhaps for this reason that ssta are the most widely used enso indicator in academic research see e g refs 6 13 and 18 second the soi is calculated as the difference between the atmospheric pressure at sea level over tahiti and over darwin australia as pointed out by the noaa the fact that the soi is derived from sea level pressure over just two stations implies that shorter term sea level pressure fluctuations not related to enso can affect the soi 3 3 https www climate gov news features blogs enso why are there so many enso indexes instead just one third the two stations over which sea level pressure data are collected to estimate the soi tahiti and darwin are located south of the equator tahiti at 18 s darwin at 12 s enso however is typically focused closer to the equator 2 3 other variables other variables used in the paper include monthly data on the s p 500 index and the u s industrial production index output all collected from the federal reserve economic database fred of the saint louis fed given the large literature on the role of inflation uncertainty for u s stock returns we include the measure of inflation expectations from the survey research center src at the university of michigan the var model also includes the broad currency real trade weighted u s dollar index to control for the link

and all series end in december 2018 table 2 contains variable definitions data sources and the starting date for all the variables used in the paper ph variable names definitions and sources 2 4 unit root and stationarity tests as is standard in the time series literature we pretest the variables for unit roots conducting four unit root tests namely the augmented dickey fuller 19 test adf the phillips perron 20 test pp the 21 modified dickey fuller ers test and the 22 test kpss the first three tests test the null hypothesis of an autoregressive unit root while the kpss tests the null of stationarity while the adf and pp tests are probably the most frequently used in time series modeling they tend to have low power against the alternative hypothesis that the data are stationary with a large autoregressive root 23 they also generally tend to over reject the null when the data are characterized by a large negative moving average root 24 the ers test has been shown to outperform the adf and pp tests in terms of both size and power and seems to be the preferred alternative to the adf and pp tests table 3 reports the unit root and stationarity tests for the series in levels and in log first differences for the ssta series the adf ers and pp tests reject the null hypothesis that the series contains a unit root while the kpss finds significant evidence that the series is stationary at the 5 significance level the premium of size factor the book to market factor and the momentum of the stock market are all stationary in levels as well all four tests also provide significant evidence that the s p 500 index output the real trade weighted u s dollar index and the agricultural stock prices are nonstationary in levels but stationary after first differencing the finding that some variables are i 0 in levels whereas others are i 1 rules out the need to test for cointegration 3 empirical methodology we begin the methodology section by first presenting a brief review of some key determinants of u s stock returns in section 3 1 section 3 2 presents the var model and discusses the identification restrictions underlying the model 3 1 a brief review of the determinants of u s stock returns the literature on the determinants of u s stock returns is vast we briefly review this literature to rationalize the choice of the variables we include in our var model in conducting this review we first briefly discuss the literature on the macroeconomic determinants of u s stock returns and then proceed to discussing other determinants 3 1 1 macroeconomic determinants of u s stock returns asset pricing theory postulates that factors that influence individuals consumption decisions and investment opportunities should also impact asset prices 25 26 variables that influence the macroeconomy are certainly examples of such factors hence changes in some macroeconomic variables are likely to have impacts on stock returns the first and perhaps most obvious measure of economic activity is an economy s total output measured by the gross domestic product gdp or industrial production a rise in aggregate output should increase current and expected cash flows to firms which should in turn cause a rise in stock prices and returns hence the var model shown hereinafter contains a measure of u s aggregate output to control for its effect on u s agricultural stock returns another recognized macroeconomic determinant of stock returns is inflation uncertainty 27 points out that uncertainty about the inflation rate raises the required risk premium leading to an increase in the discount rate lowering the present discounted value of expected future firm cash flows which in turn causes a decline in stock prices in addition inflation uncertainty creates uncertainty about future economic activity this uncertainty which has a negative impact on aggregate economic activity also has an adverse impact on stock returns thus in all the var models we control for the impact of inflation uncertainty exchange rate fluctuations have also been discussed as another important determinant of stock returns assuming that exchange rates and prices cannot be costlessly hedged and are volatile an appreciation of the value of the domestic currency relative to the foreign currency negatively affects domestic exporting firms as pointed out by ref 28 the share prices of these firms may then reflect an ex ante premium for exchange risk conversely cash flows and hence stock returns of importing firms rise following an appreciation of the real value of the domestic currency 28 also argue that the cash flows and stock prices of domestic firms that are not engaged in international trade may also be impacted because of the impact of exchange rate movements on their foreign competitors input costs aggregate demand or other factors that affect cash flows and required returns page 542 certainly a multitude of other macroeconomic variables are known to impact stock returns we limit our discussion to these three because they are perhaps the three most recognized determinants of stock market returns in the literature 27 secondly they are the macro variables most likely to impact food and agricultural companies and their profitability in addition var models with many variables often suffer from technical and computational difficulties related to a loss of degrees of freedom while rendering identification restrictions imposed on the var model questionable 3 1 2 other determinants of u s stock returns we also consider the relationship between agricultural stock returns and the fama french carhart model variables see e g refs 29 31 and 32 namely the monthly premium of the size factor smb the monthly premium of the book to market factor hml and momentum of the stock market umd 29 find weak support for the hypothesis that the beta coefficient fully captures the risk return relationship they developed the three factor model and showed consistent with the capital asset pricing model capm that the risk premium depends on the factor market but also on the size of the firm as well as the ratio of the book value of a firm s common stock to its market value 32 extended the fama french three factor model by including a momentum factor for asset pricing of stocks which measures the stock market s ability to sustain a positive or negative change in prices the premium of the size factor smb is defined as the difference between the average return on the three small portfolios and the average return on the three large portfolios 1 3 s m a l l v a l u e s m a l l n e u t r a l s m a l l g r o w t h 1 3 b i g v a l u e b i g n e u t r a l b i g g r o w t h the book to market factor hml is defined as the difference between the average return on the two value portfolios and the average return on the two growth portfolios 1 2 s m a l l v a l u e b i g v a l u e 1 2 s m a l l g r o w t h b i g g r o w t h the momentum factor measures the difference between the average return on the two high prior return portfolios and the average return on the two low prior return portfolios 1 2 s m a l l h i g h b i g h i g h 1 2 s m a l l l o w b i g l o w to save space and because these variables are not the main variables of interest in the current paper but are only included to control for their impacts on u s agricultural stock returns we refer the reader to among others 29 31 and 32 for details of the construction of and rationale for these factors these authors find empirical evidence that these factors have reliable explanatory power for u s stock returns 3 2 the var model the baseline var model relating enso and agricultural stock returns is 1 a 0 x t α i 1 k a i x t i ε t where ε t denotes serially and mutually uncorrelated innovations and k denotes the maximum lag length x is a vector of endogenous variables containing in the order listed our ssta measure of enso intensity gdp growth the measure of inflation uncertainty the real trade weighted dollar index the monthly premium of the book to market factor the monthly premium of the size factor momentum of the stock market and a measure of the percentage change in agricultural stock prices we select the optimal lag length using the akaike information criterion aic with 1 k 12 in equation 1 the delay restrictions imposed are such that the reduced form residuals e t are related to the structural shocks ε t according to e t a 0 1 ε t we assume that enso events do not respond contemporaneously to shocks to the other variables it is reasonable to treat the enso variable as exogenous since shocks to the u s economy are not large enough to impact global weather events such as enso the ordering of the remaining variables is consistent with the related economics literature see e g refs 33 34 that u s output can be treated as largely exogenous in relation to the contemporaneous values of the other economic variables and stock returns the final identifying assumption is such that u s food and agricultural stock returns are assumed to react to the preceding variables within a given month 4 impulse responses and variance decompositions in order to shed light on the need for studying the impacts of enso on the stock returns of food and agricultural companies we first examine the effects of enso on aggregate stock returns and the macroeconomy in section 4 1 in section 4 2 we present the dynamic effects of enso on u s agricultural stock returns throughout the paper we trace out these dynamic impacts with the help of impulse response functions an impulse response function shows the dynamic response of a variable over a specified time horizon following a shock or impulse to the same or another variable at a given instant it is predominantly used in modern empirical macroeconomics for causal inference and to analyze policy effectiveness to take potential heteroscedasticity of the residuals into account the dashed lines in the figures shown hereinafter are the 90 confidence bands constructed using the wild bootstrap as described by ref 35 with 1000 repetitions the solid lines in all the figures represent the cumulative response coefficients the procedure for the wild bootstrap is as follows first an artificial vector of shocks for each draw is constructed by multiplying an independent and identically distributed iid shock from a standard normal distribution with each element of the vector of residuals e t these artificial shocks together with the coefficients of the estimated var model are then used to construct artificial datasets we then re estimate the var models and compute impulse response functions with these artificial data invoking the same recursive assumptions cholesky decomposition described in section 3 2 we repeat this process 1000 times the 5th and the 95th percentiles of the 1000 bootstrapped impulse response functions are then used as the 90 confidence bands 4 1 the effects of enso on the macroeconomy and aggregate stock returns it is useful to first examine the responses of u s macroeconomic variables and aggregate stock returns to enso shocks before proceeding to the responses of the stock returns of the food and agricultural companies as a measure of aggregate stock returns we use the monthly percentage change in the s p 500 index fig 3 presents the impulse responses estimated for a horizon of up to 12 months and their corresponding 90 confidence intervals as expected fig 3 shows that a positive enso shock causes a significant and persistent increase in ssta the key result in fig 3 however is that enso shocks have no statistically significant impact on aggregate stock returns and the macroeconomy 13 using data for the g 7 countries also finds that enso has no significant effects on average g 7 output growth and aggregate prices arguing that this insignificant effect is expected as primary commodities that are likely to be affected by enso account for only a small percentage of aggregate output of the g 7 countries 18 document similar insignificant macroeconomic effects of enso for the u s economy while no studies to the best of our knowledge have estimated the impact of enso on the s p 500 index similar arguments can be made for the insignificance of the response of the s p 500 index these findings however do not necessarily imply that enso has no effect on agricultural stock prices as broad measures such as the s p 500 index and aggregate economic variables might conceal the impacts of enso on u s agricultural stock returns 4 2 the effects of enso on u s agricultural stock returns 4 2 1 impulse response functions fig 4 shows the cumulative impulse response functions of the stock returns of the twelve food and agricultural companies to an enso shock of the twelve returns considered seven experience statistically significant increases in response to an enso shock albeit of different magnitudes and horizons following an unanticipated surprise in enso stock returns of the campbell soup company conagra brands inc general mills inc hormel foods corporation mccormick and company the j m smucker company and sysco corporation rise except for the returns of the j m smucker company which rise on impact following an enso shock the contemporaneous responses of the returns of the other companies are statistically indistinguishable from zero the response of the returns of campbell s turns significantly positive three months after the enso shock and remains significant for the next five months a similar pattern is found with respect to the response of sysco corporation the responses of the returns of conagra brands inc general mills inc hormel foods corporation mccormick company display similar patterns both qualitatively and quantitatively that is after an initial delay the returns of the companies increase following an enso surprise but the increase is shortlived generally becoming statistically indistinguishable from zero three to four months after the enso shock these responses are in fact consistent with expectation consider the response of the returns of hormel foods corporation for example the company is one of the world s largest meat and poultry producers and distributors grains account for the largest cost share of animal feed the grains used for the production of animal feed include corn sorghum barley and oats with corn accounting for over 95 of total feed grain 5 5 https www ers usda gov topics crops corn background while corn is grown in most u s states the majority is grown in the midwest 3 and 4 7 find that enso significantly affects corn yields for states in the u s midwest this implies a subsequent change in grain prices if the enso event causes an increase in yields or increase in prices cash flows to agribusiness firms directly engaged in grains rises leading to an increase in stock returns for companies such as hormel foods corporation a similar argument can in fact be made with respect to the returns of the other six companies whose returns exhibit a statistically significant positive response following a shock to enso fig 4 also shows that the impulse responses of five stock returns however are not statistically different from zero at any forecast horizon for some of these companies this is expected as their products are not directly associated with weather events the fmc corporation and the mosaic company are leading providers of crop nutrients specifically concentrated phosphate potash and nitrogen nutrients to maintain healthy and productive soils enso shocks should have no direct impacts of these nutrients as they are produced from mineral deposits potash and phosphate and from the atmosphere nitrogen while enso might affect these companies indirectly through changes in the demand for their products by companies who use their products as inputs these companies generally enter contractual price agreements hedging long before enso occurrences so that unanticipated enso shocks should have only small effects if any on the stock returns of the mosaic company and fmc corporation on the other hand the finding of statistically insignificant responses of some returns was surprising as some of these firms are directly engaged in crop production whose yields and prices are impacted by enso events for example tyson foods focuses on the production of chicken through breeding feed production and processing in addition to the chicken segment their beef and pork segments process live cattle and pigs into primal and sub primal meat products their prepared foods division includes refrigerated meat products as well as snacks side dishes tortilla products and appetizers similar to hormel foods changes in grain prices due to enso should impact cash flows to tyson foods given the similarity with hormel foods inc it is rather puzzling that its stock returns are insignificant the archer daniels midland company specializes in global foods processing as well as commodity trading the company is primarily engaged in the processing of oil seeds such as soybeans cottonseed sunflower seeds canola peanuts flaxseed and palm kernel national oilseed processors association the archer daniel midland s corn processing segment specializes in corn wet milling and dry milling activities 6 6 http www adm com en us products feed corn co pages default aspx with previous research reporting evidence that the output of these firms are quite vulnerable to enso events the insignificant responses shown in fig 4 are rather surprising 4 2 2 variance decomposition the finding that an enso shock has a positive impact on the stock returns of some u s food and agricultural stock returns does not necessarily mean that enso events are important determinants of these stock returns because the enso shocks might be small to take an extreme example suppose meteorological advances made it possible to perfectly predict all future extreme enso events in this case there will be no shocks at all to enso because it could be predicted perfectly in every time period therefore no matter how severe an enso occurrence is the shock would have no importance for agricultural stock returns therefore it is both the impact and the variance of an enso shock that determine its importance to gauge the relative importance of enso events for u s agricultural stock returns table 4 presents the percent contribution of enso shocks to the overall variability of the stock returns resulting from the variance decomposition of the svar model 1 at all forecast horizons enso shocks have negligible explanatory power for fluctuations in the stock returns of u s food and agricultural companies on impact the effect of the shock is 0 as the time horizon lengthens the quantitative importance of the enso shocks gradually increases nonetheless at no point does a shock to enso explain more than 3 of the movements in any of the stock returns the main conclusion from the variance decompositions in table 4 is that enso shocks explain only a relatively small portion of the unpredictable fluctuations of the stock returns of u s food and agricultural firms with other factors responsible for much of the variability of these returns the finding in table 4 that other shocks rather than enso have negligible explanatory power for fluctuations in the stock returns of u s food and agricultural companies coupled with the insignificant responses of some returns and the shortlived significant responses of other returns in fig 4 is potentially explained by the efficient market hypothesis assuming that u s agricultural markets are efficient then the impacts of enso shocks will be incorporated in the stock returns of food and agricultural companies especially at longer horizons so that if enso shocks have any impacts these impacts occur in the short run and are relatively shortlived for instance suppose enso shocks raise spot prices of food and agricultural commodities over time the market anticipates these higher spot prices and moves the forward curve steeply into forwardation as sea surface temperatures change given that of enso cycles have been occurring more frequently as shown in fig 2 and as documented by among others trenberth and hoar 1996 and qian et al 2011 it is plausible that enso shocks are incorporated in agricultural stock returns explaining the insignificant responses of the stock returns of the archer daniels midland company hershey s and tyson foods inc and the short term shortlived significant responses of the other stock returns in fig 4 4 2 3 historical decomposition while impulse response functions and variance decompositions are usually the main focus in the var literature they mostly show the timing and magnitude of the responses to a one time shock historical decompositions of the effects of a sequence of shocks can provide additional information to help assess the cumulative effect of this sequence of shocks 36 37 this is particularly important in our case because historical enso shocks have not been limited to one time occurrences but rather a vector sequence of shocks often of different magnitudes and frequently alternating between el niño and la niña accordingly fig 5 presents the historical decomposition of the sequence of enso shocks on fluctuations in u s agricultural stock returns solid lines to evaluate the cumulative effect of such shocks dashed lines depict the actual values of the u s agricultural stock return series it is apparent from the figure that historically movements in the stock returns of u s food and agricultural companies have been driven by other shocks rather than enso shocks 4 2 4 how sensitive are the responses to changes in the lag length the impulse responses in fig 4 are based on var models in which the lag lengths were chosen using the aic at least three problems arise when using information criteria to select the lag order for var models first information criteria are known for selecting extremely short lag lengths in fact in no instance does the aic select a lag length greater than three for any of the var models used to construct the impulse response functions shown in 4 second for long enough monthly time series it is generally recommended to use long lags in order to cover seasonality third var models are known to be quite sensitive to the lag order specification hence if the results from var analyses are to be credible their sensitivity to alternative lag lengths must be studied fig 6 shows the impulse response functions of the stock returns to an enso shock in var models including 12 lags of the endogenous variables looking at the figure it is apparent that the underlying findings continue to hold six of the twelve returns exhibit significant increases in response to an enso shock these are the same returns shown to rise following an enso surprise in fig 4 while the response of campbell s is still positive it is now not different from zero in a statistical sense taken together we conclude that the general findings of the paper are robust to lag order specification 7 7 we also experimented with lag lengths of 4 6 8 and 10 generally finding that the results are invariant to the lag order specification 4 2 5 how sensitive are the responses to the ordering of the variables another limitation of var analyses is that impulse response functions can be sensitive to the ordering of the variables in the var model while we follow the convention in the var literature to order the more exogenous variables ahead of the less exogenous ones it is necessary to check the robustness of the results to alternative ordering of the variables this section does that of course with an 8 variable var model it is not possible to verify the robustness of the results to all possible ordering schemes as there are multiple possible ways of ordering the variables consequently we only present results of the reverse ordering that is the impulse response functions are estimated from var models containing in the order listed the agricultural stock return of interest momentum of the stock market the premium of the size factor the premium of the book to market factor the real trade weighted dollar index the measure of inflation uncertainty output growth and the ssta measure of enso intensity we only perform this analysis to examine the stability of the results to alternative ordering of the variables admittedly this ordering is not plausible as it is unlikely for agricultural stock returns to have contemporaneous effects of enso aggregate output and the other aggregate economic and financial variables fig 7 presents the impulse response functions of this specification recall that the ordering of the variables now reflects the assumption that the stock returns of u s food and agricultural companies impact enso immediately but that enso affects stock returns with a delay of a month hence by construction the impulse responses in fig 7 are at zero on impact subsequent responses mirror those shown in fig 4 that is stock returns of the campbell soup company conagra brands inc general mills inc hormel foods corporation mccormick and company the j m smucker company and sysco corporation increase but the positive responses tend to be shortlived the responses of the returns of the five other companies as in fig 4 are not different from zero this analysis gives us some degree of confidence that the results of this paper are not sensitive to the ordering of the variables in the var models 5 conclusion the paper estimates the response of twelve u s agricultural stock returns to enso shocks using a recursively identified var model the delay restrictions imposed for identification of the structural shocks are achieved by applying a cholesky decomposition of the reduced form residual covariance matrix our results indicate that the responses of five of the twelve stock returns are not significantly different from zero while seven of the stock returns rise significantly following an enso shock the rise in the stock returns however are relatively shortlived typically turning indistinguishable from zero three to six months after the enso shock results of variance decompositions show that enso shocks explain only a relatively small portion of the unpredictable fluctuations of u s agricultural stock returns we also find that historically movements in u s agricultural stock returns have been driven by other shocks rather than enso shocks the empirical reliance on a linear var model has some limitations recent empirical papers have found that enso may have asymmetric economic effects see e g ubilava d and holt m 2013 and 38 it is therefore plausible that enso shocks may have nonlinear and or asymmetric effects on agricultural stock returns as well if this is indeed the case then the simple var analysis of this paper may not be sufficient to capture these asymmetries nonlinearities it is possible that it is not just an enso shock that matters for u s agricultural stock returns but the type and magnitude of the enso shock the responses of these returns may depend on whether the enso shock is an el niño la niña or neutral shock thus future research may examine asymmetries and nonlinearities in the impact of enso on agricultural stock returns author statement bebonchu atems methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft writing review

8688,what is the economic value of storing water for future droughts and what are the consequences of this valuation for water management one way to answer this question is to ask what is the valuation which if used would maximize a region s economic use of water this prescriptive valuation can be done by linking classical hydro economic models to global search methods another way to answer this question is to ask what do historical water management operations reveal about water s economic value indeed past reservoir uses reveal the empirical inter temporal valuations of past water managers although they may not have been optimized in a formal sense in mature water resource systems with economic water demands reservoir storage rules evolve via a socio political process to embody societies valuation of water this empirical positive or descriptive valuation is captured by calibrating a hydro economic model such that carry over storage value functions enable simulated storage to match a historical benchmark this paper compares both valuations for california s central valley revealing that carryover storage values derived from historical operations are typically greater than prescribed values this leads to a greater reliance on groundwater use in historical operations than would have been achieved with system wide optimization more generally comparing the two approaches to water valuations can provide insights into managers attitudes as well as the impact of regulatory and institutional constraints they have to deal with and that are not necessarily included in optimization models keywords water storage valuation historical water management descriptive vs prescriptive approaches hydro economic modeling california central valley 1 introduction what can water storage valuation tell us of the difference between optimal and historical water management decisions economic valuation of water across space and time informs water allocation and the design of the physical and regulatory infrastructure that supports it this valuation reflects the hydrological economic institutional and ecological situation of a river basin 1 2 modeling based approaches that derive water values aim to integrate these various aspects within a river basin model such approaches can be descriptive or prescriptive used to examine historical or optimal water management decisions respectively descriptive approaches generally integrate the existing allocation rules and benefits from water allocation into a simulation framework to derive a valuation 3 prescriptive approaches use optimization to find a best system wide allocation strategy according to a benefit maximization criterion and get an economically efficient valuation of water as a by product of optimization 4 6 economic valuation of water according to these two types of approaches has different interpretations water values in descriptive models come from the actual allocation whereas in prescriptive models they correspond to value extracted from optimal use what is more descriptive valuations are generally set to reflect the rules that direct water management rather than reproduce historical operations i e historical outcomes of this rule system this paper contributes a methodology to infer a descriptive valuation directly from historical operations in a way that makes it comparable to a prescriptive valuation it uses a recent modeling framework fit for prescriptive valuation of surface water storage in large scale conjunctive use systems 6 and instead finds the valuation of water storage that calibrates the model against a historical benchmark making it a descriptive valuation approach a higher water value in a given reservoir from one approach to another would reflect a premium placed on conservation of water from that reservoir this enables further investigation of the cause for these discrepancies is it because managers had a myopic behaviour in historical operations or is the prescriptive model missing something previous positive approaches 7 aimed to calibrate users benefit functions in hydro economic models generally focusing on agriculture 8 9 in contrast this framework aims to investigate the water value implications of already derived benefit functions these modeling based approaches are a type of non market valuation techniques such techniques can also be survey based 10 in contrast in market valuation techniques the value of an asset is based on the selling price or the price that consumers are willing to pay for a commodity in the market water markets are common in western us 11 13 australia 14 17 and the uk 18 19 in theory descriptive and prescriptive market valuations are the same as actual water prices converge towards the socially optimal value yet water markets are far from a universal solution 5 and further they often fail to achieve their primary objective of economic efficiency unless an adequate regulatory and institutional framework is designed and implemented to sustain them 20 22 in conjunctive use systems different prices between local and non local water and between surface water and groundwater may lead to overexploitation of groundwater resources even with a functioning market 23 optimization models tend to behave like water markets in the sense that they allocate water to most beneficial uses first therefore comparing prescribed valuation to a historical benchmark has the potential to unveil some of the mechanisms that separate current operations from those that would result from a water market besides system scale and complexity make water valuation more complicated under the phrase curse of dimensionality scale by itself is a major obstacle to most optimization methods e g sdp most recently 24 26 even methods that can circumvent this limitation e g sddp 27 are subject to restricting assumptions in the case of sddp for instance it is necessary for future benefits to be convex which is a problem when studying conjunctive use systems 28 it is noteworthy that the present work builds on an approach 6 that handles system scale as well as non linearity and non convexity that approach was the first to the link an evolutionary algorithm ea to a hydro economic model 2 for this purpose application of eas to aid decision making in economics can be seen in several studies 29 31 the comparison of optimization results to water valuation from a historical benchmark is applied to the california central valley system a system with 30 reservoirs in an agricultural area that also relies on groundwater especially in times of drought 32 36 results are used to compare the two management practices using the concept of risk aversion risk aversion is the behaviour of decision makers when they are exposed to uncertainty this is quantified by risk aversion coefficient 37 38 whose positive negative sign reveals risk taking risk averse attitudes the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 explains the proposed approach section 3 presents the california central valley application results are shown in section 4 followed by discussion and conclusions in section 5 2 methods 2 1 water storage valuations this work looks at the value of water storage for future uses in a context where benefits from different water uses are already known valuation of water storage in reservoir balances current and future uses through the carry over storage value function cosvf the cosvf describes water value as a function of reservoir storage this work focuses on the end of year cosvf that determines the value of water for next years uses it compares carryover storage values obtained from a prescriptive optimization framework to those that enable reservoir operations to most closely fit a historical benchmark therefore there needs to be a common and easily interpretable functional form from which to derive carryover storage values in both cases at each point on the end of year cosvf marginal benefits from an additional unit of storage for future uses are a unit value of water in other words end of year cosvf is the integral of the function known as the demand curve 39 that describes the unit value of water as a function of storage fig 1 this unit value can be interpreted as the marginal price that water users are willing to pay and is therefore noted p in its most general form the end of year cosvf of a single reservoir is a function of that reservoir s storage s and of the parametrisation vector π chosen for the demand curve 1 c o s v f s π s m i n s p s π d s a direct consequence of equation 1 is that a reservoir s cosvf is a growing function of storage with c o s v f s m i n π 0 in its simplest form the demand curve is linear therefore the parameters π are water values at minimal and maximal storage p 1 and p 2 respectively 2 p s π p s p 1 p 2 p 1 p 2 p 1 s s m i n s m a x s m i n this means that the integral of equation 2 the end of year cosvf is quadratic since it is 0 at minimal storage it is entirely defined by π p 1 p 2 when storage in reservoirs is close to dead storage s m i n water is scarce for future uses therefore each unit of stored water is close to its maximal value p 1 conversely when reservoir levels get close to the maximum allowable storage s m a x water is more abundant for future uses leading to lowering the value of an additional unit of water towards its minimum value p 2 see fig 1 in practice this paper will use the linear demand curve of equation 2 and the associated two parameter end of year cosvf to compare prescriptive and descriptive valuations in a river basin comprising multiple reservoirs end of year carry over storage values can be summed across all reservoirs and a total end of year carry over storage value function c o s v f a l l can be written as a function of the vector of system state x usually including storage values at all the reservoirs and the vector π of end of year cosvf parameters π i at each individual reservoirs 3 c o s v f a l l x π i 1 n c o s v f s i π i where n is the number of reservoirs in the system for instance with a linear demand function π i comprises the values of p 1 and p 2 at each reservoir i 2 2 prescriptive water valuation prescriptive water valuation corresponds to the storage valuations that are obtained by maximizing operating benefits from water uses in a water resource system over a given time frame 1 t with discrete time steps of a month or less this is expressed by 4 z e t 1 t f t x t u t q t ν t 1 x t 1 u t 1 where e is the expectation operator and f t represents the net benefits from water usage consumptive uses hydropower generation ecological benefits etc at stage t as introduced for equation 3 vector x t is the state of the system at t typically including storage in the different reservoirs u t is the vector of operational decisions taken at that stage t such as reservoir releases and water allocations to spatially distributed users including farmers industries or domestic uses from cities q t is the vector of inflows finally ν t 1 is a final value function that expresses that reservoirs should not be simply emptied at the end of the optimization horizon because water has value beyond that in short ν t 1 expresses the carry over value of water within the system this optimization problem is subject to a number of constraints such as the water balance equation lower upper bounds on flows and storage levels or hydropower generation capacity to name a few solving the stochastic maximization problem of equation 4 requires mapping decisions u t as a function of system state and expected inflows except for situations where specific assumptions such as convexity hold 40 this maximization problem is plagued by the well known curse of dimensionality whereby the required computational resources increase exponentially making the resolution of large scale problems intractable khadem et al 6 proposed a general approximate solution methodology to the problem of maximizing 4 based on two key remarks the first relates the general optimization problem of equation 4 to prescriptive water valuation in reservoirs across the water resource system of interest indeed defining single year maximization problems involves end of year cosvf as a final boundary condition for year k 1 k spanning t k 1 t k 1 the single year maximization objective can be written as a function of current year inflows q k q t k 1 q t k 1 and end of year cosvf parameter vector π 5 z k q k π t t k 1 t k 1 f t x t u t q t c o s v f a l l x t k 1 π contrary to the stochastic problem of equation 4 each maximization of the single year objective z k is a deterministic optimization problem that can be handled by state of the art solvers e g the 30 reservoir problem in the application is solved in 15 seconds for each year then the second key remark is that maximizing the objective of equation 4 can be approximated by the following objective function see ref 6 for details 6 z π k 1 k max u t z k q k π c o s v f a l l x t k 1 π the problem of maximizing equation 6 and that of equation 4 are subject to the same physically based constraints water balance limits on reservoir storage and hydropower production etc but crucially equation 6 transforms the decision problem of equation 4 intractable for large systems into a problem of finding the end of year cosvf parameters in the system reservoirs evolutionary algorithms are well suited to searching this large parameter space provided they can associate a value to each parameter vector this value is 7 min π f p r e s π min π z π it is interpreted as prescriptive and noted f p r e s because the vector π that solves the maximization problem of equation 6 directly gives the functional form of end of year cosvf at each of a system s reservoirs this enables a prescriptive valuation of end of year water storage 2 3 descriptive water valuation in contrast to the prescriptive valuation a descriptive valuation seeks end of year cosvf parameters that maximize the fit with benchmark time series reflecting the system s states e g storages across the study area the descriptive case seeks to find cosvfs that reflect how water storage has been valued in practice which is not necessarily equal to marginal benefits from future water uses in the prescriptive case for a given vector π we can compute z π as in equation 6 by sequentially solving the single year optimization problem of equation 5 yet instead of being interested in maximizing the value of the economic objective z π itself we are now interested in the vector of system states x π that has been computed to obtain z π recall that those typically include reservoir storage we explore the parameter space to find the parameter vector that minimizes the mean squared errors with the benchmark 8 min π f d e s c π min π 1 n t n 1 n i 1 t x

valuations parameter values that maximize the respective objectives are found by evolutionary computation yet in both cases many reservoirs will be refilled every year if p 2 is above a threshold value p 2 0 then any value of p 2 above this threshold i e in p 2 0 produces the same operations stored water is valuable enough to warrant the reservoir to be full at the end of any water year then the algorithm could return a marginal water value of 5 million per mcm without affecting the system s operations at all to ensure the parameter values found by the algorithm make economic sense a second objective is introduced to limit the value of p 1 and p 2 similar to what was done in ref 6 9 min p f 2 min p 1 n n 1 n p min n p max n 2 this second objective turns the single objective optimization problem into a multi objective optimization problem this type of problem is solved by multi objective evolutionary algorithms moea which are broadly similar to genetic algorithms except for the fact that they can optimize two objectives or more at once as a result contrary to traditional genetic algorithms that return a single solution a moea generally returns a set of solutions such that one cannot improve any objective without degradation in another objective these solutions are called non dominated and are collectively called the pareto front see ref 41 for details on moea in this work the moea is meant to find the set of states such that one cannot find a better solution both in the minimization of the first objective either f p r e s or f d e s c and in the minimization of the second objective f 2 each solution associates to these objectives a vector of parameters that fully define the cosvf for all reservoirs 2 5 post pareto analysis the output of a multi objective optimization problem is the pareto front a set of non dominated best solutions this often contains hundreds of solutions which sometimes complicate the decision making process which solution or group of solutions are preferred this paper answers this using a post pareto stage which prunes the non dominated set of solutions following the concept of knee points 42 in knee points small improvement in either of objectives will cause a large degradation in other objective s 42 this essentially means moving in either direction is less desirable this method is chosen owning to the fact that without any knowledge about users preferences the zone around the knee is most likely to be favourable for decision makers 43 here we measure the level of degradation of objectives by looking at slope or difference between any two adjacent solution points from the pareto trade off the judgement on when a severe deterioration happened is made visually this is where the slope notably changes compared to its next immediate value this process creates a box within which lies pareto non dominated solutions with high optimality quality with respect to all objectives this box is called zone of concentration 2 6 risk aversion coefficient since cosvfs are utility functions a common way of comparing the two management practices that is used to derive descriptive and prescriptive valuation in terms of how cautious they are is to illustrate it through risk aversion coefficient 37 38 this coefficient determines how much satisfaction or utility can be obtained from an experience a commodity or money 44 we use arrow pratt risk aversion coefficient ap also known as absolute risk aversion coefficient which is mathematically described as 10 a p c o s v f x t k 1 c o s v f x t k 1 considering the functional form of the quadratic cosvf used in this study a and b being the quadratic and linear coefficients of cosvf respectively see equation 21 the above equation for each reservoir sr is 11 a

over 2 3 million ha of irrigated farmland 46 more than 250 different crops are grown in the central valley with an estimated value of 17 billion per year 47 about 75 of california s irrigated land is in the central valley which depends heavily on surface water diversions and groundwater pumping 45 nearly 75 of renewable water supply originates in the northern third of the state in the wet winter and early spring while almost 80 of agricultural and urban water use is in the southern two thirds of the state in the dry late spring and summer 48 in the context of california s mediterranean climate perfect within year foresight is consistent with early spring measurements of the depth and water content of the snowpack which enable predicting discharge months ahead with reasonable accuracy and until the end of the water year 49 the central valley often suffers from droughts such as 1918 20 1923 26 1928 35 1947 50 1959 62 1976 77 1987 92 2007 09 and 2012 16 50 the illustrative case of this paper is built upon california value integrated network calvin 51 calvin op a hydro economic model 2 with perfect foresight is the unconstrained run of calvin used to simulate the central valley water system by maximizing the system wide net economic benefit from water allocation calvin op applies economic drivers to allocate water rather than existing system of water rights and contracts 49 yet the perfect hydrological foresight of calvin limits its applicability we use an extended version of calvin op for calibration which corrects the perfect foresight by dividing the planning horizon into year long runs with initial condition of each run being the ending condition of the previous one and an end of year cosvf representing the potential benefit of allocating water for future uses set as the terminal condition of each run another extension to calvin comes from improving the groundwater pumping cost scheme the calvin model represents pumping costs by multiplying the unit pumping cost of 49 42 per mcm m lift 0 20 per af ft lift mcm is a million m 3 by a static estimate of the average pumping head in each aquifer 52 the extended version of calvin includes pumping costs that dynamically vary with head in the aquifer this head dependent pumping cost introduces non convexity into the problem the water system is represented as a network of nodes and arcs 53 where nodes include surface and groundwater reservoirs urban and agricultural demand points junctions etc and arcs links include canals pipes natural streams etc the water network of the central valley comprises 30 surface reservoirs 22 groundwater sub basins 21 agricultural demand sites 30 urban demand sites 220 junction and 4 outflows nodes and over 500 links river channels pipelines canals diversions and recharge and recycling facilities the period of analysis is 72 years 1922 93 and monthly time steps are chosen for the hydro economic model run this accounts for the strong seasonality of water supply and demands a key feature of many irrigated water systems 54 3 2 model formulation this section describes in detail how the generic equation 7 was implemented for this california central valley application for details please see ref 6 f t the net benefit function at date t is composed of the following terms 12 f t x t u t q t u r t x t a g t x t h p t x t n w t x t g w t h t x

where pf is the power factor of hydropower plant hp that relates release to hydropower generation and p is the monthly varying hydropower unit price nw shows the network cost cost incurred due to treatment conveyance and conjunctive uses with c representing such cost per unit of flow in link between nodes i and j gw is the groundwater cost from aquifer gw which is the product of pumping cost pc and discharge rate x pc varies dynamically as the piezometric head h in the aquifer changes the calculation of pc follows storage coefficient formulation 55 where a unit pumping cost unitc is multiplied by the distance that water needs to be lifted to reach ground level for allocation elev is the mean ground elevation above aquifer gw according to the storage coefficient formulation sc is the mean storage coefficient and area is the surface area of an aquifer inf represents the infeasibility costs numerical infeasibilities may appear in the model making the network problem infeasible in order to guarantee feasibility artificial inflows infx are made available to the model at each node these flows are included in model s conservation of mass equations to ensure that such flows are accounted for these artificial flows which are in fact slack surplus variables in a mathematical programming context are not desirable therefore in order to deter the model from introducing infeasibility flows they are penalised by a high cost m coefficient in the objective function in implementing above equations for the case of california central valley few points must be considered 1 a piece wise linear equivalent of equation 14 was used for farms this was due to the slope of the benefit function marginal value of water delivered at or near full demand being zero which caused farmers to opt not pumping as it would be more economic to not pay for groundwater pumping costs while any additional unit of allocated water produces near zero benefit 2 in california the presence of high head facilities where the effect of reservoir storage on turbine head is small allows for a linear relationship between head and hydropower generation 56 57 as explained in section 2 the model is solved sequentially on a year by year basis for all the 72 hydrological years considered using the maximization problem defined by equation 5 in that equation end of year cosvfs are set as boundary conditions at the end of each year long model run to prevent depletion of reservoirs this function represents the potential benefit gained from not releasing for immediate uses and preserving water for future droughts end of year cosvfs are quadratic utility function 21 c o s v f t π x t s r a t s r x t 2 b t s r x t t t k 1 where a sr and b sr are the quadratic and linear coefficient of the cosvf for reservoir sr deduced from the demand curve parameters π using equations 1 and 2 in this case the end of year is the end of the water year that is september 30 in the u s 3 3 historical benchmark in order to produce water marginal values that are descriptive of historical operations storage data from a historical benchmark are required in the central valley this benchmark is calvin bc a base case or constrained run of the calvin model which applies constraints to reproduce historical events 51 it is used because observed storage data is not available for all reservoirs for the entire period of analysis calvin bc is an effort to integrate surface and groundwater hydrology developed for the two models of the central valley s water system i e dwrsim and cvgsm it reconciles inconsistent assumptions in these two separate models as well as agricultural water demand assumptions with water deliveries more details on calvin bc s modeling approach and assumptions can be found in draper et al 51 khadem et al 6 compared observed storage level data of shasta the largest reservoir in the central valley with those of calvin bc s and demonstrated a close match between them as such we refer to calvin bc s results as the historical benchmark hereafter 58 3 4 getting water values borg 59 was used as the multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea because borg s self adaptive features increase its robustness and effectiveness while minimizing the search parametrisation by the user borg has been proved to be a top performing moea in systems comprising nonlinearities 60 and for multi objective reservoir management problems 61 there are 30 surface reservoirs so there are 60 decision variables for the evolutionary algorithm to find end of year carryover storage values are positive and bounded by the maximal value among the urban and agricultural water demand curves i e 5 291 378 per mcm for the case study an initial population size of 100 100 000 maximum number of function evaluations as the stopping criterion and epsilon search resolution value of 100 000 mcm 2 1 000 000 and 8107 per mcm 10 per af for the objective functions f desc f pres and f 2 respectively were used the nonlinear hydro economic model of the california system was coded in generalized algebraic modeling system gams and solved using the minos solver version 5 5 62 minos applies the generalized reduced gradient method which is suitable for nonlinear programming problems with linear constraints 63 the case presented here was solved using 96 intel processors working jointly on a unix based computing cluster results took about 45 000 h of computation time to produce for the descriptive valuations and 42 000 for the prescriptive valuation see ref 6 4 results this section uses the solution analysed in depth in khadem et al 6 as the prescriptive solution for this reason section 4 1 and 4 2 focus respectively on the obtaining of descriptive valuations and on their fit with the historical benchmark then section 4 3 compares the two valuations and section 4 4 investigates what they mean for water management in the central valley 4 1 trade off analysis for the descriptive valuation of storage a five seed random seed rs analysis was performed to obtain the pareto trade off and to ensure robust algorithm convergence towards the same pareto set by definition a pareto front fig 3 consists of non dominated solutions with respect to the two objective functions where any improvement on the value of either objective function comes at the expense of the other this analysis focuses on the zone of concentration zc within the pareto set grey box in fig 3 as outlined in section 2 5 concentration of solution points in this zone suggest that the estimate for historical water marginal values can be sought there the analysis will consider both this ensemble of solutions and a representative solution obtained by simulating the system using for each reservoir the average p m i n and p m a x across all solutions within the zone of concentration 4 2 quality of the fit with the historical benchmark the quality of the fit is evaluated through the classical nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nse 64 at individual reservoirs by comparing benchmark historical storage values with storage from the representative solution table 1 and fig 4 nse is chosen as a goodness of fit criterion because it is coherent with the moea s first objective it determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the observed data variance 65 it has a range of 1 with nse 1 indicating a complete match between the modeled and observed values a value between 0 and 1 shows an acceptable calibration performance and a negative nse means that observed value is a better predictor than the simulated value which indicates unacceptable performance in table 1 nse values ranging from 0 82 to 1 indicate an excellent fit with the historical benchmark which becomes close to perfection for some reservoirs fig 4 to better understand the quality of different solutions across the pareto trade off fig 3 solutions with the best and worst quality those with lowest and highest value of f d e s c respectively are compared to the representative solution average of solutions from zone of concentration in table 1 the quality of fit is also expressed by the fact that average relative deviations from the historical benchmark are relatively low this quality of fit at individual reservoirs holds across the ensemble of solutions within the zone of concentration because operations are robust to different water valuations within this zone supplementary material illustrates this with three of the system s major reservoirs this said it is worth noting that the zone of concentration figures a range of valuations and not a single valuation be it at dead storage fig 5 a or full storage fig 5b this means that this range and not only the representative solution must be used when comparing descriptive and prescriptive storage valuations 4 3 comparison of reservoir storage valuations having verified that the descriptive valuation of water storage led to a good fit between the benchmark historical operations and simulated operations we compare the descriptive and prescriptive storage valuations using both the ensemble of descriptive solutions fig 6 and the representative solution table 2 column 1 of table 2 contains active storage full storage dead storage of surface reservoirs in the last month of the water year i e september note that maximum capacity varies per month due to flood control requirements the second column shows the annual net inflow calculated as annual surface runoff minus any loss e g seepage and evaporation columns 3 and 4 include the descriptive marginal water values for the representative solution values in column 5 are the average of values in columns 3 and 4 which corresponds to the average marginal value of water from the representative solution total water value fig 6 is then the product of that figure and the active storage column 5 of table 2 can be used as an economic proxy for comparing reservoirs valuation and to contrast descriptive valuation against its prescriptive counterpart column 6 compared with the prescriptive valuation the descriptive one is higher for most major reservoirs examples are shasta oroville berryessa new melones don pedro san luis and pine flat and those located in the sierra nevada on the eastern range of the central valley e g oroville new bullards bar folsom new melones lloyd eleanor don pedro mcclure and pine flat note how some reservoirs make both groups these results hold for both fig 6 and table 2 this higher valuation in the descriptive solution means that operations conserve surface water in large reservoir by implicitly valuing it more than in smaller surface reservoirs and groundwater reservoirs alike this has two consequences 1 groundwater resources are first to supply water and 2 when it comes to surface reservoirs smaller reservoirs are prioritised for release end of year cosvf for each reservoir can be derived from values in columns 3 and 4 of table 2 cosvf of four large central valley reservoirs are compared fig 7 to better interpret this result one can look at the average volumetric water value of these four reservoirs at their full storage i e maximum of cosv divided by maximum storage capacity for the descriptive case the average volumetric water values at full storage are 33419 28527 31605 and 34086 mcm for shasta oroville don pedro and pine flat respectively this suggests that attitudes to water conservation in the historical benchmark are similar across these large reservoirs regardless of their situation within the basins for the prescriptive case however the same figures drop to 21672 14439 18727 and 5505 mcm respectively this suggests different water storage values depending on location within the basin reservoirs situated upstream can redirect water for use in larger portions of the basin and this makes them more valuable than reservoir situated downstream more generally the comparison of these valuations confirms that the descriptive case values stored water more than the prescriptive case regardless of location 4 4 consequences for water management in california the system wide consequences of the difference between the two valuations of water storage are clear through comparison of aggregated surface and groundwater storage during 1922 93 fig 8 implicit overvaluation of surface reservoirs with operations based on a descriptive valuation resulted in a comparative overexploitation of aquifers at the level of individual reservoirs columns 1 and 5 of table 2 show that the historical operation favoured smaller reservoirs when it comes to surface reservoir releases this can become problematic when a small reservoir is the sole supplier to a demand site e g new hogan supplying for stockton this overcautious operation has led to 80 increase in the annual average scarcity volume 6 compared with operations derived from an optimal prescriptive valuation and to a 5 increase in the average unit pumping cost across the central valley to better demonstrate how risk averse the two reservoir operations are the absolute risk aversion coefficient for each reservoir is computed and illustrated in table 3 cosvfs derived from equation 1 the obtained marginal water values of table 2 for the descriptive model and khadem et al 6 for the prescriptive model are used to calculate the risk aversion ap table 3 reveals that the prescriptive model is in fact more risk averse in the face of uncertain hydrology this is consistent with the fact that prescriptive operations minimize shortage less intuitively it shows that even though they value surface water storage more operations observed in the historical benchmark are not necessarily less risk averse in fact this higher valuation is linked with excessive water conservation for future uses in a way that sometimes penalises current uses this behaviour could be explained by regulatory constraints that water managers have to deal with but that the model does not account for such as stream temperature requirements that necessitate cold water released from deep reservoirs lakes to favour salmon habitats 5 discussion and conclusion this paper proposes a methodology to derive comparable descriptive and prescriptive valuations of water storage in both approaches values are deduced from a hybrid setup where an ea is linked to a hydro economic model while ea searches for the value of stored water the role of the hydro economic model is to link water allocation decisions with the space and time distribution of the value of stored water for future uses in the prescriptive approach the ea aims at optimizing long term benefits from water use whereas in the descriptive approach the objective is to provide a valuation that calibrates a historical benchmark to avoid unrealistic storage valuations in small reservoirs an auxiliary objective is introduced meaning that both problems are formulated as being multi objective and solved using an moea the resulting modeling approach is generalizable because 1 its applicability is not plagued by the curse of dimensionality linked with system size and 2 it is assumption free e g it does not require non convexity assumptions that do not apply in conjunctive use systems the proposed approach is illustrated through valuation of 30 surface reservoirs in california s central valley water system the descriptive approach is descriptive insofar as it matches a historical benchmark whose outcome storage levels across time and space reflects the regulatory and institutional setting that resulted in the operations that led to this outcome yet the approach itself is not based on simulation but on hybrid optimization in that it uses an intra annual optimization model coupled with an ea the ea calibrates water marginal values to find those that replicate real world observations this is done by first taking water marginal values as ea s decision variables calibration parameters ea randomly assigns values to these parameters and the water resources system is simulated using these values and a hydro economic model note that this optimization based descriptive approach though counter intuitive is necessary to adequately compare descriptive and prescriptive valuations this approach is generalizable and can readily be used when market valuation is absent or inefficient and when non market methods are plagued with non convexity and or curse of dimensionality yet the necessity to assume intra annual foresight means that this approach may be difficult to apply to tropical and temperate areas where runoff is not snow dominated results are also interesting in several respects first they vindicate the choice to represent intra annual operations with a perfect foresight optimization models this indicates that this complex system could be simulated with this simple assumption in particular it shows that regardless of the uncertainty concerning snowpack monthly operations are robust to the consequences of that uncertainty this robustness may break down on a finer e g daily timescale but it is worth noting that most state of the art global hydrological models representing complex multi reservoir systems use a monthly time step 66 and that their results are not yet accurate enough 67 to justify a finer time resolution beyond the comparison of descriptive and prescriptive operations is a two way street on one hand it provides insights into the differences between the historical benchmark and optimized operations by providing comparable valuations of surface water storage in the case of california this translates into showing how surface water valuation leads to using groundwater instead on the other hand interpreting this finding beyond the confines afforded by the models formulation provides insights into possible causes of historical management decisions for instance the quality of the calibration given constant storage valuations constant groundwater pumping costs and constant crop prices shows a remarkable stability of their relative values throughout most of the twentieth century but both groundwater pumping costs and crop retail prices have changed through time the storage valuation could suggest that cheap energy may have favoured mining groundwater a resource for which no strong management institutions exist in california whereas surface water rights ensured a greater conservation of surface water this would link cheap energy prices with unsustainable water management practices a speculative insight that deserves further investigation more generally the difference in surface water valuation from the two approaches reflects the role of institutions providing incentives for surface water conservation and that are traditionally difficult to represent in an optimization model of that size this was evidenced by further analysis involving risk aversion coefficients the exercise revealed that the prescriptive valuation showed a more risk averse approach to managing water resources the overcautious operation observed in the historical benchmark was perhaps due to other constraints not seen in the model finally it is worth elaborating on the fact that different storage valuations could lead to a similar fit of the descriptive model with the historical benchmark it is meant to reproduce the existence of different parametrisations leading to similar goodness of fit is well known in hydrology as equifinality 68 69 equifinality had also been found in water resources systems models but only in the fact of producing very different reservoir operations leading to similar value of an economic objective 70 71 in the descriptive approach proposed here the opposite occurs as similar to hydrological modeling different parametrisations lead to similar operations this finding runs contrary to the idea that there exists a unique water

8688,what is the economic value of storing water for future droughts and what are the consequences of this valuation for water management one way to answer this question is to ask what is the valuation which if used would maximize a region s economic use of water this prescriptive valuation can be done by linking classical hydro economic models to global search methods another way to answer this question is to ask what do historical water management operations reveal about water s economic value indeed past reservoir uses reveal the empirical inter temporal valuations of past water managers although they may not have been optimized in a formal sense in mature water resource systems with economic water demands reservoir storage rules evolve via a socio political process to embody societies valuation of water this empirical positive or descriptive valuation is captured by calibrating a hydro economic model such that carry over storage value functions enable simulated storage to match a historical benchmark this paper compares both valuations for california s central valley revealing that carryover storage values derived from historical operations are typically greater than prescribed values this leads to a greater reliance on groundwater use in historical operations than would have been achieved with system wide optimization more generally comparing the two approaches to water valuations can provide insights into managers attitudes as well as the impact of regulatory and institutional constraints they have to deal with and that are not necessarily included in optimization models keywords water storage valuation historical water management descriptive vs prescriptive approaches hydro economic modeling california central valley 1 introduction what can water storage valuation tell us of the difference between optimal and historical water management decisions economic valuation of water across space and time informs water allocation and the design of the physical and regulatory infrastructure that supports it this valuation reflects the hydrological economic institutional and ecological situation of a river basin 1 2 modeling based approaches that derive water values aim to integrate these various aspects within a river basin model such approaches can be descriptive or prescriptive used to examine historical or optimal water management decisions respectively descriptive approaches generally integrate the existing allocation rules and benefits from water allocation into a simulation framework to derive a valuation 3 prescriptive approaches use optimization to find a best system wide allocation strategy according to a benefit maximization criterion and get an economically efficient valuation of water as a by product of optimization 4 6 economic valuation of water according to these two types of approaches has different interpretations water values in descriptive models come from the actual allocation whereas in prescriptive models they correspond to value extracted from optimal use what is more descriptive valuations are generally set to reflect the rules that direct water management rather than reproduce historical operations i e historical outcomes of this rule system this paper contributes a methodology to infer a descriptive valuation directly from historical operations in a way that makes it comparable to a prescriptive valuation it uses a recent modeling framework fit for prescriptive valuation of surface water storage in large scale conjunctive use systems 6 and instead finds the valuation of water storage that calibrates the model against a historical benchmark making it a descriptive valuation approach a higher water value in a given reservoir from one approach to another would reflect a premium placed on conservation of water from that reservoir this enables further investigation of the cause for these discrepancies is it because managers had a myopic behaviour in historical operations or is the prescriptive model missing something previous positive approaches 7 aimed to calibrate users benefit functions in hydro economic models generally focusing on agriculture 8 9 in contrast this framework aims to investigate the water value implications of already derived benefit functions these modeling based approaches are a type of non market valuation techniques such techniques can also be survey based 10 in contrast in market valuation techniques the value of an asset is based on the selling price or the price that consumers are willing to pay for a commodity in the market water markets are common in western us 11 13 australia 14 17 and the uk 18 19 in theory descriptive and prescriptive market valuations are the same as actual water prices converge towards the socially optimal value yet water markets are far from a universal solution 5 and further they often fail to achieve their primary objective of economic efficiency unless an adequate regulatory and institutional framework is designed and implemented to sustain them 20 22 in conjunctive use systems different prices between local and non local water and between surface water and groundwater may lead to overexploitation of groundwater resources even with a functioning market 23 optimization models tend to behave like water markets in the sense that they allocate water to most beneficial uses first therefore comparing prescribed valuation to a historical benchmark has the potential to unveil some of the mechanisms that separate current operations from those that would result from a water market besides system scale and complexity make water valuation more complicated under the phrase curse of dimensionality scale by itself is a major obstacle to most optimization methods e g sdp most recently 24 26 even methods that can circumvent this limitation e g sddp 27 are subject to restricting assumptions in the case of sddp for instance it is necessary for future benefits to be convex which is a problem when studying conjunctive use systems 28 it is noteworthy that the present work builds on an approach 6 that handles system scale as well as non linearity and non convexity that approach was the first to the link an evolutionary algorithm ea to a hydro economic model 2 for this purpose application of eas to aid decision making in economics can be seen in several studies 29 31 the comparison of optimization results to water valuation from a historical benchmark is applied to the california central valley system a system with 30 reservoirs in an agricultural area that also relies on groundwater especially in times of drought 32 36 results are used to compare the two management practices using the concept of risk aversion risk aversion is the behaviour of decision makers when they are exposed to uncertainty this is quantified by risk aversion coefficient 37 38 whose positive negative sign reveals risk taking risk averse attitudes the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 explains the proposed approach section 3 presents the california central valley application results are shown in section 4 followed by discussion and conclusions in section 5 2 methods 2 1 water storage valuations this work looks at the value of water storage for future uses in a context where benefits from different water uses are already known valuation of water storage in reservoir balances current and future uses through the carry over storage value function cosvf the cosvf describes water value as a function of reservoir storage this work focuses on the end of year cosvf that determines the value of water for next years uses it compares carryover storage values obtained from a prescriptive optimization framework to those that enable reservoir operations to most closely fit a historical benchmark therefore there needs to be a common and easily interpretable functional form from which to derive carryover storage values in both cases at each point on the end of year cosvf marginal benefits from an additional unit of storage for future uses are a unit value of water in other words end of year cosvf is the integral of the function known as the demand curve 39 that describes the unit value of water as a function of storage fig 1 this unit value can be interpreted as the marginal price that water users are willing to pay and is therefore noted p in its most general form the end of year cosvf of a single reservoir is a function of that reservoir s storage s and of the parametrisation vector π chosen for the demand curve 1 c o s v f s π s m i n s p s π d s a direct consequence of equation 1 is that a reservoir s cosvf is a growing function of storage with c o s v f s m i n π 0 in its simplest form the demand curve is linear therefore the parameters π are water values at minimal and maximal storage p 1 and p 2 respectively 2 p s π p s p 1 p 2 p 1 p 2 p 1 s s m i n s m a x s m i n this means that the integral of equation 2 the end of year cosvf is quadratic since it is 0 at minimal storage it is entirely defined by π p 1 p 2 when storage in reservoirs is close to dead storage s m i n water is scarce for future uses therefore each unit of stored water is close to its maximal value p 1 conversely when reservoir levels get close to the maximum allowable storage s m a x water is more abundant for future uses leading to lowering the value of an additional unit of water towards its minimum value p 2 see fig 1 in practice this paper will use the linear demand curve of equation 2 and the associated two parameter end of year cosvf to compare prescriptive and descriptive valuations in a river basin comprising multiple reservoirs end of year carry over storage values can be summed across all reservoirs and a total end of year carry over storage value function c o s v f a l l can be written as a function of the vector of system state x usually including storage values at all the reservoirs and the vector π of end of year cosvf parameters π i at each individual reservoirs 3 c o s v f a l l x π i 1 n c o s v f s i π i where n is the number of reservoirs in the system for instance with a linear demand function π i comprises the values of p 1 and p 2 at each reservoir i 2 2 prescriptive water valuation prescriptive water valuation corresponds to the storage valuations that are obtained by maximizing operating benefits from water uses in a water resource system over a given time frame 1 t with discrete time steps of a month or less this is expressed by 4 z e t 1 t f t x t u t q t ν t 1 x t 1 u t 1 where e is the expectation operator and f t represents the net benefits from water usage consumptive uses hydropower generation ecological benefits etc at stage t as introduced for equation 3 vector x t is the state of the system at t typically including storage in the different reservoirs u t is the vector of operational decisions taken at that stage t such as reservoir releases and water allocations to spatially distributed users including farmers industries or domestic uses from cities q t is the vector of inflows finally ν t 1 is a final value function that expresses that reservoirs should not be simply emptied at the end of the optimization horizon because water has value beyond that in short ν t 1 expresses the carry over value of water within the system this optimization problem is subject to a number of constraints such as the water balance equation lower upper bounds on flows and storage levels or hydropower generation capacity to name a few solving the stochastic maximization problem of equation 4 requires mapping decisions u t as a function of system state and expected inflows except for situations where specific assumptions such as convexity hold 40 this maximization problem is plagued by the well known curse of dimensionality whereby the required computational resources increase exponentially making the resolution of large scale problems intractable khadem et al 6 proposed a general approximate solution methodology to the problem of maximizing 4 based on two key remarks the first relates the general optimization problem of equation 4 to prescriptive water valuation in reservoirs across the water resource system of interest indeed defining single year maximization problems involves end of year cosvf as a final boundary condition for year k 1 k spanning t k 1 t k 1 the single year maximization objective can be written as a function of current year inflows q k q t k 1 q t k 1 and end of year cosvf parameter vector π 5 z k q k π t t k 1 t k 1 f t x t u t q t c o s v f a l l x t k 1 π contrary to the stochastic problem of equation 4 each maximization of the single year objective z k is a deterministic optimization problem that can be handled by state of the art solvers e g the 30 reservoir problem in the application is solved in 15 seconds for each year then the second key remark is that maximizing the objective of equation 4 can be approximated by the following objective function see ref 6 for details 6 z π k 1 k max u t z k q k π c o s v f a l l x t k 1 π the problem of maximizing equation 6 and that of equation 4 are subject to the same physically based constraints water balance limits on reservoir storage and hydropower production etc but crucially equation 6 transforms the decision problem of equation 4 intractable for large systems into a problem of finding the end of year cosvf parameters in the system reservoirs evolutionary algorithms are well suited to searching this large parameter space provided they can associate a value to each parameter vector this value is 7 min π f p r e s π min π z π it is interpreted as prescriptive and noted f p r e s because the vector π that solves the maximization problem of equation 6 directly gives the functional form of end of year cosvf at each of a system s reservoirs this enables a prescriptive valuation of end of year water storage 2 3 descriptive water valuation in contrast to the prescriptive valuation a descriptive valuation seeks end of year cosvf parameters that maximize the fit with benchmark time series reflecting the system s states e g storages across the study area the descriptive case seeks to find cosvfs that reflect how water storage has been valued in practice which is not necessarily equal to marginal benefits from future water uses in the prescriptive case for a given vector π we can compute z π as in equation 6 by sequentially solving the single year optimization problem of equation 5 yet instead of being interested in maximizing the value of the economic objective z π itself we are now interested in the vector of system states x π that has been computed to obtain z π recall that those typically include reservoir storage we explore the parameter space to find the parameter vector that minimizes the mean squared errors with the benchmark 8 min π f d e s c π min π 1 n t n 1 n i 1 t x t i π x t i b e n c h m a r k 2 where n is the number of state variables used for calibration and f d e s c is the descriptive objective function to minimize 2 4 workflow for both water storage valuations parameter values that maximize the respective objectives are found by evolutionary computation yet in both cases many reservoirs will be refilled every year if p 2 is above a threshold value p 2 0 then any value of p 2 above this threshold i e in p 2 0 produces the same operations stored water is valuable enough to warrant the reservoir to be full at the end of any water year then the algorithm could return a marginal water value of 5 million per mcm without affecting the system s operations at all to ensure the parameter values found by the algorithm make economic sense a second objective is introduced to limit the value of p 1 and p 2 similar to what was done in ref 6 9 min p f 2 min p 1 n n 1 n p min n p max n 2 this second objective turns the single objective optimization problem into a multi objective optimization problem this type of problem is solved by multi objective evolutionary algorithms moea which are broadly similar to genetic algorithms except for the fact that they can optimize two objectives or more at once as a result contrary to traditional genetic algorithms that return a single solution a moea generally returns a set of solutions such that one cannot improve any objective without degradation in another objective these solutions are called non dominated and are collectively called the pareto front see ref 41 for details on moea in this work the moea is meant to find the set of states such that one cannot find a better solution both in the minimization of the first objective either f p r e s or f d e s c and in the minimization of the second objective f 2 each solution associates to these objectives a vector of parameters that fully define the cosvf for all reservoirs 2 5 post pareto analysis the output of a multi objective optimization problem is the pareto front a set of non dominated best solutions this often contains hundreds of solutions which sometimes complicate the decision making process which solution or group of solutions are preferred this paper answers this using a post pareto stage which prunes the non dominated set of solutions following the concept of knee points 42 in knee points small improvement in either of objectives will cause a large degradation in other objective s 42 this essentially means moving in either direction is less desirable this method is chosen owning to the fact that without any knowledge about users preferences the zone around the knee is most likely to be favourable for decision makers 43 here we measure the level of degradation of objectives by looking at slope or difference between any two adjacent solution points from the pareto trade off the judgement on when a severe deterioration happened is made visually this is where the slope notably changes compared to its next immediate value this process creates a box within which lies pareto non dominated solutions with high optimality quality with respect to all objectives this box is called zone of concentration 2 6 risk aversion coefficient since cosvfs are utility functions a common way of comparing the two management practices that is used to derive descriptive and prescriptive valuation in terms of how cautious they are is to illustrate it through risk aversion coefficient 37 38 this coefficient determines how much satisfaction or utility can be obtained from an experience a commodity or money 44 we use arrow pratt risk aversion coefficient ap also known as absolute risk aversion coefficient which is mathematically described as 10 a p c o s v f x t k 1 c o s v f x t k 1 considering the functional form of the quadratic cosvf used in this study a and b being the quadratic and linear coefficients of cosvf respectively see equation 21 the above equation for each reservoir sr is 11 a

over 2 3 million ha of irrigated farmland 46 more than 250 different crops are grown in the central valley with an estimated value of 17 billion per year 47 about 75 of california s irrigated land is in the central valley which depends heavily on surface water diversions and groundwater pumping 45 nearly 75 of renewable water supply originates in the northern third of the state in the wet winter and early spring while almost 80 of agricultural and urban water use is in the southern two thirds of the state in the dry late spring and summer 48 in the context of california s mediterranean climate perfect within year foresight is consistent with early spring measurements of the depth and water content of the snowpack which enable predicting discharge months ahead with reasonable accuracy and until the end of the water year 49 the central valley often suffers from droughts such as 1918 20 1923 26 1928 35 1947 50 1959 62 1976 77 1987 92 2007 09 and 2012 16 50 the illustrative case of this paper is built upon california value integrated network calvin 51 calvin op a hydro economic model 2 with perfect foresight is the unconstrained run of calvin used to simulate the central valley water system by maximizing the system wide net economic benefit from water allocation calvin op applies economic drivers to allocate water rather than existing system of water rights and contracts 49 yet the perfect hydrological foresight of calvin limits its applicability we use an extended version of calvin op for calibration which corrects the perfect foresight by dividing the planning horizon into year long runs with initial condition of each run being the ending condition of the previous one and an end of year cosvf representing the potential benefit of allocating water for future uses set as the terminal condition of each run another extension to calvin comes from improving the groundwater pumping cost scheme the calvin model represents pumping costs by multiplying the unit pumping cost of 49 42 per mcm m lift 0 20 per af ft lift mcm is a million m 3 by a static estimate of the average pumping head in each aquifer 52 the extended version of calvin includes pumping costs that dynamically vary with head in the aquifer this head dependent pumping cost introduces non convexity into the problem the water system is represented as a network of nodes and arcs 53 where nodes include surface and groundwater reservoirs urban and agricultural demand points junctions etc and arcs links include canals pipes natural streams etc the water network of the central valley comprises 30 surface reservoirs 22 groundwater sub basins 21 agricultural demand sites 30 urban demand sites 220 junction and 4 outflows nodes and over 500 links river channels pipelines canals diversions and recharge and recycling facilities the period of analysis is 72 years 1922 93 and monthly time steps are chosen for the hydro economic model run this accounts for the strong seasonality of water supply and demands a key feature of many irrigated water systems 54 3 2 model formulation this section describes in detail how the generic equation 7 was implemented for this california central valley application for details please see ref 6 f t the net benefit function at date t is composed of the following terms 12 f t x t u t q t u r t x t a g t x t h p t x t n w t x t g w t h t x

benefit utility function with a ur and b ur being the quadratic and linear coefficients of the function respectively and x t showing the flow to urban node ur similarly ag is the agricultural benefits form allocating water to farms with a ag and b ag being the quadratic and linear coefficients of the utility function respectively hp is the linear economic benefit produced from hydropower generation where pf is the power factor of hydropower plant hp that relates release to hydropower generation and p is the monthly varying hydropower unit price nw shows the network cost cost incurred due to treatment conveyance and conjunctive uses with c representing such cost per unit of flow in link between nodes i and j gw is the groundwater cost from aquifer gw which is the product of pumping cost pc and discharge rate x pc varies dynamically as the piezometric head h in the aquifer changes the calculation of pc follows storage coefficient formulation 55 where a unit pumping cost unitc is multiplied by the distance that water needs to be lifted to reach ground level for allocation elev is the mean ground elevation above aquifer gw according to the storage coefficient formulation sc is the mean storage coefficient and area is the surface area of an aquifer inf represents the infeasibility costs numerical infeasibilities may appear in the model making the network problem infeasible in order to guarantee feasibility artificial inflows infx are made available to the model at each node these flows are included in model s conservation of mass equations to ensure that such flows are accounted for these artificial flows which are in fact slack surplus variables in a mathematical programming context are not desirable therefore in order to deter the model from introducing infeasibility flows they are penalised by a high cost m coefficient in the objective function in implementing above equations for the case of california central valley few points must be considered 1 a piece wise linear equivalent of equation 14 was used for farms this was due to the slope of the benefit function marginal value of water delivered at or near full demand being zero which caused farmers to opt not pumping as it would be more economic to not pay for groundwater pumping costs while any additional unit of allocated water produces near zero benefit 2 in california the presence of high head facilities where the effect of reservoir storage on turbine head is small allows for a linear relationship between head and hydropower generation 56 57 as explained in section 2 the model is solved sequentially on a year by year basis for all the 72 hydrological years considered using the maximization problem defined by equation 5 in that equation end of year cosvfs are set as boundary conditions at the end of each year long model run to prevent depletion of reservoirs this function represents the potential benefit gained from not releasing for immediate uses and preserving water for future droughts end of year cosvfs are quadratic utility function 21 c o s v f t π x t s r a t s r x t 2 b t s r x t t t k 1 where a sr and b sr are the quadratic and linear coefficient of the cosvf for reservoir sr deduced from the demand curve parameters π using equations 1 and 2 in this case the end of year is the end of the water year that is september 30 in the u s 3 3 historical benchmark in order to produce water marginal values that are descriptive of historical operations storage data from a historical benchmark are required in the central valley this benchmark is calvin bc a base case or constrained run of the calvin model which applies constraints to reproduce historical events 51 it is used because observed storage data is not available for all reservoirs for the entire period of analysis calvin bc is an effort to integrate surface and groundwater hydrology developed for the two models of the central valley s water system i e dwrsim and cvgsm it reconciles inconsistent assumptions in these two separate models as well as agricultural water demand assumptions with water deliveries more details on calvin bc s modeling approach and assumptions can be found in draper et al 51 khadem et al 6 compared observed storage level data of shasta the largest reservoir in the central valley with those of calvin bc s and demonstrated a close match between them as such we refer to calvin bc s results as the historical benchmark hereafter 58 3 4 getting water values borg 59 was used as the multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea because borg s self adaptive features increase its robustness and effectiveness while minimizing the search parametrisation by the user borg has been proved to be a top performing moea in systems comprising nonlinearities 60 and for multi objective reservoir management problems 61 there are 30 surface reservoirs so there are 60 decision variables for the evolutionary algorithm to find end of year carryover storage values are positive and bounded by the maximal value among the urban and agricultural water demand curves i e 5 291 378 per mcm for the case study an initial population size of 100 100 000 maximum number of function evaluations as the stopping criterion and epsilon search resolution value of 100 000 mcm 2 1 000 000 and 8107 per mcm 10 per af for the objective functions f desc f pres and f 2 respectively were used the nonlinear hydro economic model of the california system was coded in generalized algebraic modeling system gams and solved using the minos solver version 5 5 62 minos applies the generalized reduced gradient method which is suitable for nonlinear programming problems with linear constraints 63 the case presented here was solved using 96 intel processors working jointly on a unix based computing cluster results took about 45 000 h of computation time to produce for the descriptive valuations and 42 000 for the prescriptive valuation see ref 6 4 results this section uses the solution analysed in depth in khadem et al 6 as the prescriptive solution for this reason section 4 1 and 4 2 focus respectively on the obtaining of descriptive valuations and on their fit with the historical benchmark then section 4 3 compares the two valuations and section 4 4 investigates what they mean for water management in the central valley 4 1 trade off analysis for the descriptive valuation of storage a five seed random seed rs analysis was performed to obtain the pareto trade off and to ensure robust algorithm convergence towards the same pareto set by definition a pareto front fig 3 consists of non dominated solutions with respect to the two objective functions where any improvement on the value of either objective function comes at the expense of the other this analysis focuses on the zone of concentration zc within the pareto set grey box in fig 3 as outlined in section 2 5 concentration of solution points in this zone suggest that the estimate for historical water marginal values can be sought there the analysis will consider both this ensemble of solutions and a representative solution obtained by simulating the system using for each reservoir the average p m i n and p m a x across all solutions within the zone of concentration 4 2 quality of the fit with the historical benchmark the quality of the fit is evaluated through the classical nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nse 64 at individual reservoirs by comparing benchmark historical storage values with storage from the representative solution table 1 and fig 4 nse is chosen as a goodness of fit criterion because it is coherent with the moea s first objective it determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the observed data variance 65 it has a range of 1 with nse 1 indicating a complete match between the modeled and observed values a value between 0 and 1 shows an acceptable calibration performance and a negative nse means that observed value is a better predictor than the simulated value which indicates unacceptable performance in table 1 nse values ranging from 0 82 to 1 indicate an excellent fit with the historical benchmark which becomes close to perfection for some reservoirs fig 4 to better understand the quality of different solutions across the pareto trade off fig 3 solutions with the best and worst quality those with lowest and highest value of f d e s c respectively are compared to the representative solution average of solutions from zone of concentration in table 1 the quality of fit is also expressed by the fact that average relative deviations from the historical benchmark are relatively low this quality of fit at individual reservoirs holds across the ensemble of solutions within the zone of concentration because operations are robust to different water valuations within this zone supplementary material illustrates this with three of the system s major reservoirs this said it is worth noting that the zone of concentration figures a range of valuations and not a single valuation be it at dead storage fig 5 a or full storage fig 5b this means that this range and not only the representative solution must be used when comparing descriptive and prescriptive storage valuations 4 3 comparison of reservoir storage valuations having verified that the descriptive valuation of water storage led to a good fit between the benchmark historical operations and simulated operations we compare the descriptive and prescriptive storage valuations using both the ensemble of descriptive solutions fig 6 and the representative solution table 2 column 1 of table 2 contains active storage full storage dead storage of surface reservoirs in the last month of the water year i e september note that maximum capacity varies per month due to flood control requirements the second column shows the annual net inflow calculated as annual surface runoff minus any loss e g seepage and evaporation columns 3 and 4 include the descriptive marginal water values for the representative solution values in column 5 are the average of values in columns 3 and 4 which corresponds to the average marginal value of water from the representative solution total water value fig 6 is then the product of that figure and the active storage column 5 of table 2 can be used as an economic proxy for comparing reservoirs valuation and to contrast descriptive valuation against its prescriptive counterpart column 6 compared with the prescriptive valuation the descriptive one is higher for most major reservoirs examples are shasta oroville berryessa new melones don pedro san luis and pine flat and those located in the sierra nevada on the eastern range of the central valley e g oroville new bullards bar folsom new melones lloyd eleanor don pedro mcclure and pine flat note how some reservoirs make both groups these results hold for both fig 6 and table 2 this higher valuation in the descriptive solution means that operations conserve surface water in large reservoir by implicitly valuing it more than in smaller surface reservoirs and groundwater reservoirs alike this has two consequences 1 groundwater resources are first to supply water and 2 when it comes to surface reservoirs smaller reservoirs are prioritised for release end of year cosvf for each reservoir can be derived from values in columns 3 and 4 of table 2 cosvf of four large central valley reservoirs are compared fig 7 to better interpret this result one can look at the average volumetric water value of these four reservoirs at their full storage i e maximum of cosv divided by maximum storage capacity for the descriptive case the average volumetric water values at full storage are 33419 28527 31605 and 34086 mcm for shasta oroville don pedro and pine flat respectively this suggests that attitudes to water conservation in the historical benchmark are similar across these large reservoirs regardless of their situation within the basins for the prescriptive case however the same figures drop to 21672 14439 18727 and 5505 mcm respectively this suggests different water storage values depending on location within the basin reservoirs situated upstream can redirect water for use in larger portions of the basin and this makes them more valuable than reservoir situated downstream more generally the comparison of these valuations confirms that the descriptive case values stored water more than the prescriptive case regardless of location 4 4 consequences for water management in california the system wide consequences of the difference between the two valuations of water storage are clear through comparison of aggregated surface and groundwater storage during 1922 93 fig 8 implicit overvaluation of surface reservoirs with operations based on a descriptive valuation resulted in a comparative overexploitation of aquifers at the level of individual reservoirs columns 1 and 5 of table 2 show that the historical operation favoured smaller reservoirs when it comes to surface reservoir releases this can become problematic when a small reservoir is the sole supplier to a demand site e g new hogan supplying for stockton this overcautious operation has led to 80 increase in the annual average scarcity volume 6 compared with operations derived from an optimal prescriptive valuation and to a 5 increase in the average unit pumping cost across the central valley to better demonstrate how risk averse the two reservoir operations are the absolute risk aversion coefficient for each reservoir is computed and illustrated in table 3 cosvfs derived from equation 1 the obtained marginal water values of table 2 for the descriptive model and khadem et al 6 for the prescriptive model are used to calculate the risk aversion ap table 3 reveals that the prescriptive model is in fact more risk averse in the face of uncertain hydrology this is consistent with the fact that prescriptive operations minimize shortage less intuitively it shows that even though they value surface water storage more operations observed in the historical benchmark are not necessarily less risk averse in fact this higher valuation is linked with excessive water conservation for future uses in a way that sometimes penalises current uses this behaviour could be explained by regulatory constraints that water managers have to deal with but that the model does not account for such as stream temperature requirements that necessitate cold water released from deep reservoirs lakes to favour salmon habitats 5 discussion and conclusion this paper proposes a methodology to derive comparable descriptive and prescriptive valuations of water storage in both approaches values are deduced from a hybrid setup where an ea is linked to a hydro economic model while ea searches for the value of stored water the role of the hydro economic model is to link water allocation decisions with the space and time distribution of the value of stored water for future uses in the prescriptive approach the ea aims at optimizing long term benefits from water use whereas in the descriptive approach the objective is to provide a valuation that calibrates a historical benchmark to avoid unrealistic storage valuations in small reservoirs an auxiliary objective is introduced meaning that both problems are formulated as being multi objective and solved using an moea the resulting modeling approach is generalizable because 1 its applicability is not plagued by the curse of dimensionality linked with system size and 2 it is assumption free e g it does not require non convexity assumptions that do not apply in conjunctive use systems the proposed approach is illustrated through valuation of 30 surface reservoirs in california s central valley water system the descriptive approach is descriptive insofar as it matches a historical benchmark whose outcome storage levels across time and space reflects the regulatory and institutional setting that resulted in the operations that led to this outcome yet the approach itself is not based on simulation but on hybrid optimization in that it uses an intra annual optimization model coupled with an ea the ea calibrates water marginal values to find those that replicate real world observations this is done by first taking water marginal values as ea s decision variables calibration parameters ea randomly assigns values to these parameters and the water resources system is simulated using these values and a hydro economic model note that this optimization based descriptive approach though counter intuitive is necessary to adequately compare descriptive and prescriptive valuations this approach is generalizable and can readily be used when market valuation is absent or inefficient and when non market methods are plagued with non convexity and or curse of dimensionality yet the necessity to assume intra annual foresight means that this approach may be difficult to apply to tropical and temperate areas where runoff is not snow dominated results are also interesting in several respects first they vindicate the choice to represent intra annual operations with a perfect foresight optimization models this indicates that this complex system could be simulated with this simple assumption in particular it shows that regardless of the uncertainty concerning snowpack monthly operations are robust to the consequences of that uncertainty this robustness may break down on a finer e g daily timescale but it is worth noting that most state of the art global hydrological models representing complex multi reservoir systems use a monthly time step 66 and that their results are not yet accurate enough 67 to justify a finer time resolution beyond the comparison of descriptive and prescriptive operations is a two way street on one hand it provides insights into the differences between the historical benchmark and optimized operations by providing comparable valuations of surface water storage in the case of california this translates into showing how surface water valuation leads to using groundwater instead on the other hand interpreting this finding beyond the confines afforded by the models formulation provides insights into possible causes of historical management decisions for instance the quality of the calibration given constant storage valuations constant groundwater pumping costs and constant crop prices shows a remarkable stability of their relative values throughout most of the twentieth century but both groundwater pumping costs and crop retail prices have changed through time the storage valuation could suggest that cheap energy may have favoured mining groundwater a resource for which no strong management institutions exist in california whereas surface water rights ensured a greater conservation of surface water this would link cheap energy prices with unsustainable water management practices a speculative insight that deserves further investigation more generally the difference in surface water valuation from the two approaches reflects the role of institutions providing incentives for surface water conservation and that are traditionally difficult to represent in an optimization model of that size this was evidenced by further analysis involving risk aversion coefficients the exercise revealed that the prescriptive valuation showed a more risk averse approach to managing water resources the overcautious operation observed in the historical benchmark was perhaps due to other constraints not seen in the model finally it is worth elaborating on the fact that different storage valuations could lead to a similar fit of the descriptive model with the historical benchmark it is meant to reproduce the existence of different parametrisations leading to similar goodness of fit is well known in hydrology as equifinality 68 69 equifinality had also been found in water resources systems models but only in the fact of producing very different reservoir operations leading to similar value of an economic objective 70 71 in the descriptive approach proposed here the opposite occurs as similar to hydrological modeling different parametrisations lead to similar operations this finding runs contrary to the idea that there exists a unique water

8689,in this article we estimate both the economic value of water and own price and cross price elasticities of water for the chilean manufacturing industry using the production function approach estimating the production function allows us to estimate the marginal productivity of water which corresponds to its economic value our estimations are based on panel data obtained from the national industrial survey for the period 1995 2014 accounting for more than 10 000 industrial plants we use a translog specification for the production function considering water capital labor energy and intermediate material as explanatory variables we find substitution patterns among most inputs except for energy and water which are found to be complements our results suggest that the manufacturing sector is characterized by an elastic water demand with an average economic value of water of 8 071 usd m3 based on our findings there is room to increase water prices in most sectors without affecting the competitiveness of firms knowing the economic value of water and its price elasticity could help policymakers to design water policies that promote more efficient use of this scarce resource keywords economic value of water water price elasticity water productivity industrial water demand 1 introduction despite the crucial importance of water for many human activities its future supply cannot be assured because of a combination of natural conditions and anthropogenic interventions that have degraded water quality and reduced its availability 1 5 according to fao 6 at the global level the most intensive water sector is agriculture 70 followed by industry 19 and municipality 11 however according to official projections because of population growth and economic development it is expected that water use in the industrial sector will increase by as much as 400 by 2050 with emerging and developing countries accounting for the largest share of this increase 7 thus the expected increase in water use and reduction in supply will force policymakers to search for innovative ways to regulate water allocation with the aim of increasing efficiency and sustainability of different water uses 3 based on the abovementioned facts knowing water demand and the related determinants are important for implementing informed water policies accordingly the literature contains many attempts to estimate water demand in both the residential and industrial sectors 8 11 in this study we estimate the economic value of water evw and own price and cross price elasticities of water for the chilean manufacturing industry using a production function approach similar to that of ku and yoo 12 we use a panel data of industrial plants for the period between 1995 and 2014 from the annual industrial national survey enia in its spanish acronym 1 1 note that the enia is an annual census of industrial plants by using the production function approach it is possible to recover productivity for each production factor particularly for water which corresponds to the economic value for this resource knowing the evw may contribute to water management for example in the regulation or promotion of efficient water use by industries and in the welfare analysis of water allocation at a basin scale in which industrial uses compete with forestry agriculture or residential uses the evw can provide information that is useful for policymakers in designing water policies that consider both efficiency in water use and competitiveness of the industrial sector based on environmental goals and the ability of the industry to absorb a change in water cost 1 the marginal productivity provides an estimation of the evw that represents a firm s maximum willingness to pay for water 13 therefore a comparison of this value with the actual water cost faced by firms can inform policymakers as to whether there is room for increasing prices without affecting the competitiveness of the industry 1 estimations of water price elasticities could inform the development of demand side policies based on the use of price incentives to induce a reduction in water consumption however this approach is only worth implementing when the price elasticity of demand is high enough to trigger a significant reduction in water consumption 8 this article includes six sections section 2 offers a literature review followed by the methodology in section 3 the case study and results are then described in sections 4 and 5 finally section 6 presents our conclusions 2 literature review we performed a literature search for empirical studies focused on the industrial sector using google scholar we searched for the subjects industrial water demand shadow price of water marginal value of water water price elasticity economic value of water and similar phrases we first prioritized research articles published in scientific journals then public reports from government institutions and finally unpublished works such as working papers from this search we identified 42 empirical studies assessing both evw 13 studies and water price elasticity 29 studies dating from 1969 to 2019 these studies are highly concentrated in developed countries for instance the usa and canada account for 46 of studies on evw and 58 of studies on water price elasticity on the other hand chinese studies on evw represent 46 of studies investigated but its representation regarding water price elasticity studies is negligible studies on evw are conducted using different approaches production function marginal productivity cost function production frontier or computable general equilibrium cge models table 1 previous studies include the analysis of evw either for a specific sector i e chemical paper or food or in general for an entire industry values for the evw of specific sectors range from 0 122 usd m3 for the chemical industry 14 to 84 7 usd m3 for the food sector 15 whereas studies analyzing a whole industrial sector report values from 0 035 usd m3 16 to 20 39 usd m3 17 water price elasticities are also estimated using either a cost function approach 14 studies a production function approach 3 studies or from the estimation of a water demand 12 studies details are given in table 2 alike the estimation of evw price elasticity studies cover several industrial sectors such as paper and chemicals 31 34 36 38 51 food beverages and textiles 40 41 and hotels and restaurants 1 52 whereas others are focused on the entire manufacturing industry 32 33 37 39 46 estimates for price elasticity range from 4 37 in the high tech sector 49 to 0 024 in hotels 52 among those studies 74 5 report inelastic values for water demand whereas 21 5 report elastic values and the remaining 4 show elasticity equal to 1 unitary price elasticity unfortunately a comparison of these elasticity estimates is difficult because the studies were conducted under different contexts e g tariff structures cost of water access and reuse and recycling of water in conclusion international evidence on evw for industry is limited and focused mostly on the usa or china with only one study from latin america 17 whereas studies on water price elasticity are less restricted but still highly concentrated in developed countries with little evidence from latin america 43 48 51 3 materials and methods the assessment of evw through demand or cost function approaches requires the existence of a water market knowledge of the relevant tariff structure cost data and or marginal prices 10 lack of appropriate data on marginal prices has pushed researchers to use average prices as proxies which is inconsistent with economic theory 39 since from a theoretical perspective companies maximize profits when marginal prices not average prices equal marginal costs 53 furthermore when water comes from one s own sources the information on the associated cost i e pumping cost is not publicly available 46 limiting the application of the cost function approach fortunately even when marginal prices or costs cannot be observed or the tariff structure is unknown the production function marginal productivity approach can still be used to assess the marginal value of water as it does not require price information the marginal productivity approach is based on the fact that marginal cost must be equal to the marginal value of production for a firm to maximize profits furthermore a water demand function can be derived from the first order conditions of the profit maximization problem the marginal productivity function allows an estimation of evw that reflects a firm s maximum willingness to pay for water 13 we use the revenue function to homogenize the multiple outputs produced by firms 53 our econometric model is based on the translog function 54 which has been previously used for the analysis of water issues in i cost function estimations 1 33 38 40 and ii production function estimations 12 17 the revenue function is 1 ln q i t β 0 k 1 k β k ln f i k t k 1 k δ k ln f i k t 2 k 1 k j 1 k j k θ k j ln f i k t ln f i j t μ i t where q i t is the total revenue of plant i in period t f ikt is the k th production factor of plant i in period t β 0 β k δ k and θ k j are parameters to be estimated 2 2 some observations have inputs with zero consumption to avoid having an undefined value ln 0 in the definition of the objective function we transformed the value to 0 001 we also estimate the model with other values including ln 1 0 and 0 0001 and found no quantitative nor qualitative differences in the results the proportion of cases with zero inputs was below 10 in the worst case and negligible in most of them 0 01 since we have panel data we follow baltagi 55 and wooldridge 56 and define the error term as μ i t ε i v i t in which ε i is an unobservable plant specific effect time invariant and v i t are the idiosyncratic disturbances that vary with plants and time 56 deriving equation 1 with respect to f i k t we obtain the product input elasticities σ f k 2 σ f i k ln q i t ln f i k t β k 2 δ k ln f i k t j 1 j k k θ k j ln f i j t additionally using the definition of marginal productivity q i t f i k t we can express equation 2 as 3 σ f i k ln q i t ln f i k t q i t f i k t f i k t q i t ρ f i k f i k t q i t ρ f i k σ f i k q i t f i k t we obtain the inputs marginal productivities denoted by ρ f i k for the specific case of water under perfect market conditions marginal productivity ρ i w should be equal to the evw for a specific firm linearizing equation 3 through natural logarithms deriving with respect to each f i k and assuming price is equal to marginal productivity that is ρ f i k p f i k we obtain the direct γ f i k eqn 4 and crossed γ f i k f i j eqn 5 input price elasticities 4 γ f i k ln f i k t ln p f i k σ f i k 2 δ k σ f i k 2 σ f i k 5 γ f i k f i j ln f i k t ln p f j σ f i j θ k j σ f i k σ f i j given the error structure we can estimate either fixed effects fe or random effects re models by making different assumptions about μ i t 55 the fe model assumes ε i are parameters to be estimated while v i t are independent and identically distributed error terms iid 0 σ v 2 a within transformation obtaining the deviation from individual means z i t z i for any variable z allows us to avoid the estimation of each individual fixed parameter ε i while obtaining the remaining relevant behavioral parameters within estimators 55 alternatively we could estimate an re model that assumes ε i is independent and identically distributed in the population iid 0 σ ε 2 while v i t is iid 0 σ v 2 the re model also assumes that explanatory variables are independent of both ε i and v i t and that ε i are independent of v i t to test this exogeneity hypothesis we use the hausman specification test the null hypothesis was rejected suggesting that the re estimator is inconsistent therefore our results are based on the fe model equations 2 5 were constructed using the estimated parameters whereas the delta method 56 was used to determine their standard errors 4 data the latest data available indicate that the total consumptive water use in chile is 10 9 billion m3 year and non consumptive use is 154 7 billion m3 year 57 the industrial sector accounts for 12 of consumptive water use according to official projections this is expected to rise by 5 relative to 2015 by 2030 because of population growth and economic development thus increasing pressure on water resources 57 58 manufacturing industries are usually located in urban areas particularly in the three main chilean regions of valparaíso v region santiago metropolitan region and concepcion viii region 59 within the manufacturing industry water is used in diverse ways as a refrigerant in transport in cleaning or dilution of intermediate goods and as part of the final product 39 in this article we use the enia survey a census of industrial facilities with more than ten employees conducted annually throughout the country data from enia cover 1995 to 2017 unfortunately for confidentiality reasons it was only possible to obtain a panel for data between 1995 and 2014 60 without region identifiers 3 3 in the official database regional identifiers were eliminated for confidentiality purposes which total 71 908 observations distributed over 20 years we used the isic rev 3 code to link each company with each production sector this includes 10 528 plants with observations for a period of 1 20 years observations were grouped according to isic rev 3 guidelines as follows 151 meats vegetables and fats 152 155 beverages and dairy 153 milling industry and animal feed 154 other foods 17 textiles 18 clothing 19 leather products 20 wood products except furniture 21 paper 22 editing and reproduction 24 chemicals 25 rubber and plastic items 26 non metallic minerals 27 base metals 28 other metals 29 machinery and equipment 31 33 other electric and precision products 34 35 transport and automotive and 36 furniture 4 4 to better capture industries features the isic aggregation manufacture of food products and beverages 15 was disaggregated into four sub categories 151 152 155 153 and 154 in addition some categories were combined such as other electric and precision products 31 33 and transport and automotive 34 35 finally divisions associated with codes 16 23 30 and 37 were removed input variables are as follows water consumption w in cubic meters considering only water intake meaning that we did not include any reused or recirculated water capital k taken as the stock at the end of the period including the fixed assets machinery buildings and vehicles labor l taken as the number of workers energy e in terms of expenditure for various fuels and electricity and intermediate materials m in terms of expenditure which are calculated from the intermediate costs minus water and energy costs used as production factors separately finally revenue q is the dependent variable all monetary variables are measured in thousands of dollars from 2014 5 5 we use a reference exchange rate such that usd 1 clp 570 01 in 2014 source central bank of chile table 3 provides the descriptive statistics of variables used in the model as shown water use is heterogeneous across periods for instance mean water use presents a constant reduction over time from 9048 m3 during the period 1995 1999 to 5169 m3 during the period 2010 2014 while mean production value shows a constant increase from usd 3809 during the period 1995 1999 to usd 5696 during the period 2010 2014 6 6 detailed descriptive statistics for entire panel given in appendix a water consumption at the sector level table 4 shows that 40 of firms account for 51 of water use with meats vegetables and fats isic 151 as the most water intensive sector 15 4 of total water use followed by other foods isic 154 10 3 chemicals isic 24 9 03 non metallic minerals isic 26 8 48 rubber and plastic items isic 25 7 89 and textiles isic 17 6 93 fig 1 shows the evolution of total water consumption at sector level for the six most intensive water use sectors there is a decreasing trend from 1995 to 2010 with a steep descent in all sectors in 2000 a slight cycle of recovery can be observed between 2000 and 2006 until a new generalized consumption decrease in all analyzed sectors in 2007 each water consumption cycle is compatible with the occurrence of two economic crises around 2000 and 2008 respectively despite the decreasing trend in industrial water consumption during the period 1995 2014 official projections considering population growth and economic development 57 58 suggest that by 2030 the industrial water demand will increase 5 relative to 2015 consumption levels 5 results and discussion appendix b shows the regression outcomes we have mixed results in terms of significance squared variables and interactions without water are all significant at the 99 confidence level except for the energy labor e l and capital energy k e interactions while we controlled for years this is not reported in appendix b because it is not relevant to the discussion 7 7 years are statistically significant results are available upon request seventeen interactions of the type water isic sector w isic are significant at the 95 confidence level whereas some interactions of type capital water isic sector k w isic are not significant the f statistic for general significance of parameters is significant at 99 9 whereas the total r2 indicates that the model explains 95 1 of variation of the sample 8 8 the high r2 is driven by size effects this happens in regressions with firm plant variables measured levels and when there is significant heterogeneity in firm plant size on the other hand the ρ coefficient shows the fraction of variance of individual errors is 71 with respect to total perturbations table 5 shows own price and cross price elasticities and productivities for the k l e m and w inputs indicating interactions as expected 1 both the product input elasticities σ f i and marginal productivities ρ f i are positive 2 the own price elasticity γ f i is negative because increases in prices decrease the input used and 3 as expected cross price elasticity γ f i f j signs are equal i e the sign of γ f i f j must be equal to the sign of γ f j f i for i j regarding interactions among inputs most are positive indicating that they are substitutes thus by increasing the price of an input and consequently decreasing its use the amount of the crossed input substitute input increases by contrast we find complementary inputs such as those in the cross price elasticity of energy and water in terms of productivity ρ the mean evw is equal to 8 071 usd m3 with 6 4 usd m3 and 9 6 usd m3 as the lower and upper bounds of the 95 confidence interval table 6 shows the evw and water own price elasticity by economic sector in dollars from 2014 in columns 2 and 3 respectively it also depicts the average water cost by sector in column 4 as shown water own price elasticity is significant for all sectors except for leather products isic 19 and other metals isic 28 considering only statistically significant values water own price elasticity ranges from a minimum in absolute value of 1 125 for wood products except furniture isic 20 to a maximum of 1 501 for machinery and equipment isic 29 the evw ρ w ranges between 5 605 usd m3 for paper isic 21 to 17 881 usd m3 for wood products except furniture isic 20 it is well recognized in the literature that the water cost paid by industries is lower than the evw 61 therefore there is room to develop a price policy aimed at increasing the water price faced by firms without compromising competitiveness according to our results it is possible to develop such a policy in most sectors with the exception of meats vegetables and fats isic 151 beverages and dairy isic 152 155 chemicals isic 24 rubber and plastic items isic 25 and non metallic minerals isic 26 for all the other sectors the evw is greater than the water cost faced by firms our results on water own price elasticity by sector are within the range of elasticity values reported by previous studies 13 42 43 49 51 among those studies that use a marginal productivity approach our overall figure of water own price elasticity 1 234 is consistent with that reported by ku and yoo 12 in korea and the upper bound reported by wang and lall 13 in china but more elastic than the value reported by revollo fernández et al 17 in mexico and goldar 44 in india regarding evw in general our results are in line with previous studies assessing differences between the evw and price paid for it 1 12 13 17 our estimate 8 071 usd m3 is higher than those reported by ku and yoo 12 in korea and by wang and lall 13 in china as well as that reported by angulo et al 1 in spain which are 1 05 usd m3 0 37 usd m3 and 4 9 usd m3 respectively however our estimate is lower than that reported by revollo fernández et al 17 for mexico which is 19 4 usd m3 from a theoretical perspective different evw estimates are comparable through the theory of duality between cost and production compared with the value reported by koopman et al 62 who used a cge model for the netherlands our estimate is twice as high and compared with a programming model developed for chile 63 our estimate is several times higher 8 071 usd m3 vs 0 399 usd m3 6 conclusions our results are useful for designing public policies based on both efficiency in water use and competitiveness of the industrial sector for instance our estimates suggest that the industrial sector in chile could be targeted with a policy that aims to increase water price to promote sustainable use of water as in general its price elasticity is high however such a policy could threaten industry competitiveness in some specific sectors e g meats vegetables and fats and beverages and dairy in which the evw is lower than average water cost this highlights the need to consider sustainability resource goals along with the industry s ability to absorb the change in water cost from an industry perspective the evw can help inform cost benefit analyses regarding implementation of water saving measures reuse or recirculation or a new water infrastructure moreover it advises both public and private parties regarding the range in which water tariffs could be established this modeling framework entails limitations that need to be considered for instance because of aggregation considered at the industry level our results do not account for firm characteristics that are critical for policy purposes firm location conservation status of water source among others because of the lack of available data we could not assess the effect of water saving measures on the evw or the differences across regions in the context of increased water scarcity and considering that water related projects account for the largest share of public budgets the inclusion of the evw within policy assessment tools could provide policymakers with valuable information about the social consequences of water related projects infrastructure or institutional not only for the industrial sector but for all water users

8689,in this article we estimate both the economic value of water and own price and cross price elasticities of water for the chilean manufacturing industry using the production function approach estimating the production function allows us to estimate the marginal productivity of water which corresponds to its economic value our estimations are based on panel data obtained from the national industrial survey for the period 1995 2014 accounting for more than 10 000 industrial plants we use a translog specification for the production function considering water capital labor energy and intermediate material as explanatory variables we find substitution patterns among most inputs except for energy and water which are found to be complements our results suggest that the manufacturing sector is characterized by an elastic water demand with an average economic value of water of 8 071 usd m3 based on our findings there is room to increase water prices in most sectors without affecting the competitiveness of firms knowing the economic value of water and its price elasticity could help policymakers to design water policies that promote more efficient use of this scarce resource keywords economic value of water water price elasticity water productivity industrial water demand 1 introduction despite the crucial importance of water for many human activities its future supply cannot be assured because of a combination of natural conditions and anthropogenic interventions that have degraded water quality and reduced its availability 1 5 according to fao 6 at the global level the most intensive water sector is agriculture 70 followed by industry 19 and municipality 11 however according to official projections because of population growth and economic development it is expected that water use in the industrial sector will increase by as much as 400 by 2050 with emerging and developing countries accounting for the largest share of this increase 7 thus the expected increase in water use and reduction in supply will force policymakers to search for innovative ways to regulate water allocation with the aim of increasing efficiency and sustainability of different water uses 3 based on the abovementioned facts knowing water demand and the related determinants are important for implementing informed water policies accordingly the literature contains many attempts to estimate water demand in both the residential and industrial sectors 8 11 in this study we estimate the economic value of water evw and own price and cross price elasticities of water for the chilean manufacturing industry using a production function approach similar to that of ku and yoo 12 we use a panel data of industrial plants for the period between 1995 and 2014 from the annual industrial national survey enia in its spanish acronym 1 1 note that the enia is an annual census of industrial plants by using the production function approach it is possible to recover productivity for each production factor particularly for water which corresponds to the economic value for this resource knowing the evw may contribute to water management for example in the regulation or promotion of efficient water use by industries and in the welfare analysis of water allocation at a basin scale in which industrial uses compete with forestry agriculture or residential uses the evw can provide information that is useful for policymakers in designing water policies that consider both efficiency in water use and competitiveness of the industrial sector based on environmental goals and the ability of the industry to absorb a change in water cost 1 the marginal productivity provides an estimation of the evw that represents a firm s maximum willingness to pay for water 13 therefore a comparison of this value with the actual water cost faced by firms can inform policymakers as to whether there is room for increasing prices without affecting the competitiveness of the industry 1 estimations of water price elasticities could inform the development of demand side policies based on the use of price incentives to induce a reduction in water consumption however this approach is only worth implementing when the price elasticity of demand is high enough to trigger a significant reduction in water consumption 8 this article includes six sections section 2 offers a literature review followed by the methodology in section 3 the case study and results are then described in sections 4 and 5 finally section 6 presents our conclusions 2 literature review we performed a literature search for empirical studies focused on the industrial sector using google scholar we searched for the subjects industrial water demand shadow price of water marginal value of water water price elasticity economic value of water and similar phrases we first prioritized research articles published in scientific journals then public reports from government institutions and finally unpublished works such as working papers from this search we identified 42 empirical studies assessing both evw 13 studies and water price elasticity 29 studies dating from 1969 to 2019 these studies are highly concentrated in developed countries for instance the usa and canada account for 46 of studies on evw and 58 of studies on water price elasticity on the other hand chinese studies on evw represent 46 of studies investigated but its representation regarding water price elasticity studies is negligible studies on evw are conducted using different approaches production function marginal productivity cost function production frontier or computable general equilibrium cge models table 1 previous studies include the analysis of evw either for a specific sector i e chemical paper or food or in general for an entire industry values for the evw of specific sectors range from 0 122 usd m3 for the chemical industry 14 to 84 7 usd m3 for the food sector 15 whereas studies analyzing a whole industrial sector report values from 0 035 usd m3 16 to 20 39 usd m3 17 water price elasticities are also estimated using either a cost function approach 14 studies a production function approach 3 studies or from the estimation of a water demand 12 studies details are given in table 2 alike the estimation of evw price elasticity studies cover several industrial sectors such as paper and chemicals 31 34 36 38 51 food beverages and textiles 40 41 and hotels and restaurants 1 52 whereas others are focused on the entire manufacturing industry 32 33 37 39 46 estimates for price elasticity range from 4 37 in the high tech sector 49 to 0 024 in hotels 52 among those studies 74 5 report inelastic values for water demand whereas 21 5 report elastic values and the remaining 4 show elasticity equal to 1 unitary price elasticity unfortunately a comparison of these elasticity estimates is difficult because the studies were conducted under different contexts e g tariff structures cost of water access and reuse and recycling of water in conclusion international evidence on evw for industry is limited and focused mostly on the usa or china with only one study from latin america 17 whereas studies on water price elasticity are less restricted but still highly concentrated in developed countries with little evidence from latin america 43 48 51 3 materials and methods the assessment of evw through demand or cost function approaches requires the existence of a water market knowledge of the relevant tariff structure cost data and or marginal prices 10 lack of appropriate data on marginal prices has pushed researchers to use average prices as proxies which is inconsistent with economic theory 39 since from a theoretical perspective companies maximize profits when marginal prices not average prices equal marginal costs 53 furthermore when water comes from one s own sources the information on the associated cost i e pumping cost is not publicly available 46 limiting the application of the cost function approach fortunately even when marginal prices or costs cannot be observed or the tariff structure is unknown the production function marginal productivity approach can still be used to assess the marginal value of water as it does not require price information the marginal productivity approach is based on the fact that marginal cost must be equal to the marginal value of production for a firm to maximize profits furthermore a water demand function can be derived from the first order conditions of the profit maximization problem the marginal productivity function allows an estimation of evw that reflects a firm s maximum willingness to pay for water 13 we use the revenue function to homogenize the multiple outputs produced by firms 53 our econometric model is based on the translog function 54 which has been previously used for the analysis of water issues in i cost function estimations 1 33 38 40 and ii production function estimations 12 17 the revenue function is 1 ln q i t β 0 k 1 k β k ln f i k t k 1 k δ k ln f i k t 2 k 1 k j 1 k j k θ k j ln f i k t ln f i j t μ i t where q i t is the total revenue of plant i in period t f ikt is the k th production factor of plant i in period t β 0 β k δ k and θ k j are parameters to be estimated 2 2 some observations have inputs with zero consumption to avoid having an undefined value ln 0 in the definition of the objective function we transformed the value to 0 001 we also estimate the model with other values including ln 1 0 and 0 0001 and found no quantitative nor qualitative differences in the results the proportion of cases with zero inputs was below 10 in the worst case and negligible in most of them 0 01 since we have panel data we follow baltagi 55 and wooldridge 56 and define the error term as μ i t ε i v i t in which ε i is an unobservable plant specific effect time invariant and v i t are the idiosyncratic disturbances that vary with plants and time 56 deriving equation 1 with respect to f i k t we obtain the product input elasticities σ f k 2 σ f i k ln q i t ln f i k t β k 2 δ k ln f i k t j 1 j k k θ k j ln f i j t additionally using the definition of marginal productivity q i t f i k t we can express equation 2 as 3 σ f i k ln q i t ln f i k t q i t f i k t f i k t q i t ρ f i k f i k t q i t ρ f i k σ f i k q i t f i k t we obtain the inputs marginal productivities denoted by ρ f i k for the specific case of water under perfect market conditions marginal productivity ρ i w should be equal to the evw for a specific firm linearizing equation 3 through natural logarithms deriving with respect to each f i k and assuming price is equal to marginal productivity that is ρ f i k p f i k we obtain the direct γ f i k eqn 4 and crossed γ f i k f i j eqn 5 input price elasticities 4 γ f i k ln f i k t ln p f i k σ f i k 2 δ k σ f i k 2 σ f i k 5 γ f i k f i j ln f i k t ln p f j σ f i j θ k j σ f i k σ f i j given the error structure we can estimate either fixed effects fe or random effects re models by making different assumptions about μ i t 55 the fe model assumes ε i are parameters to be estimated while v i t are independent and identically distributed error terms iid 0 σ v 2 a within transformation obtaining the deviation from individual means z i t z i for any variable z allows us to avoid the estimation of each individual fixed parameter ε i while obtaining the remaining relevant behavioral parameters within estimators 55 alternatively we could estimate an re model that assumes ε i is independent and identically distributed in the population iid 0 σ ε 2 while v i t is iid 0 σ v 2 the re model also assumes that explanatory variables are independent of both ε i and v i t and that ε i are independent of v i t to test this exogeneity hypothesis we use the hausman specification test the null hypothesis was rejected suggesting that the re estimator is inconsistent therefore our results are based on the fe model equations 2 5 were constructed using the estimated parameters whereas the delta method 56 was used to determine their standard errors 4 data the latest data available indicate that the total consumptive water use in chile is 10 9 billion m3 year and non consumptive use is 154 7 billion m3 year 57 the industrial sector accounts for 12 of consumptive water use according to official projections this is expected to rise by 5 relative to 2015 by 2030 because of population growth and economic development thus increasing pressure on water resources 57 58 manufacturing industries are usually located in urban areas particularly in the three main chilean regions of valparaíso v region santiago metropolitan region and concepcion viii region 59 within the manufacturing industry water is used in diverse ways as a refrigerant in transport in cleaning or dilution of intermediate goods and as part of the final product 39 in this article we use the enia survey a census of industrial facilities with more than ten employees conducted annually throughout the country data from enia cover 1995 to 2017 unfortunately for confidentiality reasons it was only possible to obtain a panel for data between 1995 and 2014 60 without region identifiers 3 3 in the official database regional identifiers were eliminated for confidentiality purposes which total 71 908 observations distributed over 20 years we used the isic rev 3 code to link each company with each production sector this includes 10 528 plants with observations for a period of 1 20 years observations were grouped according to isic rev 3 guidelines as follows 151 meats vegetables and fats 152 155 beverages and dairy 153 milling industry and animal feed 154 other foods 17 textiles 18 clothing 19 leather products 20 wood products except furniture 21 paper 22 editing and reproduction 24 chemicals 25 rubber and plastic items 26 non metallic minerals 27 base metals 28 other metals 29 machinery and equipment 31 33 other electric and precision products 34 35 transport and automotive and 36 furniture 4 4 to better capture industries features the isic aggregation manufacture of food products and beverages 15 was disaggregated into four sub categories 151 152 155 153 and 154 in addition some categories were combined such as other electric and precision products 31 33 and transport and automotive 34 35 finally divisions associated with codes 16 23 30 and 37 were removed input variables are as follows water consumption w in cubic meters considering only water intake meaning that we did not include any reused or recirculated water capital k taken as the stock at the end of the period including the fixed assets machinery buildings and vehicles labor l taken as the number of workers energy e in terms of expenditure for various fuels and electricity and intermediate materials m in terms of expenditure which are calculated from the intermediate costs minus water and energy costs used as production factors separately finally revenue q is the dependent variable all monetary variables are measured in thousands of dollars from 2014 5 5 we use a reference exchange rate such that usd 1 clp 570 01 in 2014 source central bank of chile table 3 provides the descriptive statistics of variables used in the model as shown water use is heterogeneous across periods for instance mean water use presents a constant reduction over time from 9048 m3 during the period 1995 1999 to 5169 m3 during the period 2010 2014 while mean production value shows a constant increase from usd 3809 during the period 1995 1999 to usd 5696 during the period 2010 2014 6 6 detailed descriptive statistics for entire panel given in appendix a water consumption at the sector level table 4 shows that 40 of firms account for 51 of water use with meats vegetables and fats isic 151 as the most water intensive sector 15 4 of total water use followed by other foods isic 154 10 3 chemicals isic 24 9 03 non metallic minerals isic 26 8 48 rubber and plastic items isic 25 7 89 and textiles isic 17 6 93 fig 1 shows the evolution of total water consumption at sector level for the six most intensive water use sectors there is a decreasing trend from 1995 to 2010 with a steep descent in all sectors in 2000 a slight cycle of recovery can be observed between 2000 and 2006 until a new generalized consumption decrease in all analyzed sectors in 2007 each water consumption cycle is compatible with the occurrence of two economic crises around 2000 and 2008 respectively despite the decreasing trend in industrial water consumption during the period 1995 2014 official projections considering population growth and economic development 57 58 suggest that by 2030 the industrial water demand will increase 5 relative to 2015 consumption levels 5 results and discussion appendix b shows the regression outcomes we have mixed results in terms of significance squared variables and interactions without water are all significant at the 99 confidence level except for the energy labor e l and capital energy k e interactions while we controlled for years this is not reported in appendix b because it is not relevant to the discussion 7 7 years are statistically significant results are available upon request seventeen interactions of the type water isic sector w isic are significant at the 95 confidence level whereas some interactions of type capital water isic sector k w isic are not significant the f statistic for general significance of parameters is significant at 99 9 whereas the total r2 indicates that the model explains 95 1 of variation of the sample 8 8 the high r2 is driven by size effects this happens in regressions with firm plant variables measured levels and when there is significant heterogeneity in firm plant size on the other hand the ρ coefficient shows the fraction of variance of individual errors is 71 with respect to total perturbations table 5 shows own price and cross price elasticities and productivities for the k l e m and w inputs indicating interactions as expected 1 both the product input elasticities σ f i and marginal productivities ρ f i are positive 2 the own price elasticity γ f i is negative because increases in prices decrease the input used and 3 as expected cross price elasticity γ f i f j signs are equal i e the sign of γ f i f j must be equal to the sign of γ f j f i for i j regarding interactions among inputs most are positive indicating that they are substitutes thus by increasing the price of an input and consequently decreasing its use the amount of the crossed input substitute input increases by contrast we find complementary inputs such as those in the cross price elasticity of energy and water in terms of productivity ρ the mean evw is equal to 8 071 usd m3 with 6 4 usd m3 and 9 6 usd m3 as the lower and upper bounds of the 95 confidence interval table 6 shows the evw and water own price elasticity by economic sector in dollars from 2014 in columns 2 and 3 respectively it also depicts the average water cost by sector in column 4 as shown water own price elasticity is significant for all sectors except for leather products isic 19 and other metals isic 28 considering only statistically significant values water own price elasticity ranges from a minimum in absolute value of 1 125 for wood products except furniture isic 20 to a maximum of 1 501 for machinery and equipment isic 29 the evw ρ w ranges between 5 605 usd m3 for paper isic 21 to 17 881 usd m3 for wood products except furniture isic 20 it is well recognized in the literature that the water cost paid by industries is lower than the evw 61 therefore there is room to develop a price policy aimed at increasing the water price faced by firms without compromising competitiveness according to our results it is possible to develop such a policy in most sectors with the exception of meats vegetables and fats isic 151 beverages and dairy isic 152 155 chemicals isic 24 rubber and plastic items isic 25 and non metallic minerals isic 26 for all the other sectors the evw is greater than the water cost faced by firms our results on water own price elasticity by sector are within the range of elasticity values reported by previous studies 13 42 43 49 51 among those studies that use a marginal productivity approach our overall figure of water own price elasticity 1 234 is consistent with that reported by ku and yoo 12 in korea and the upper bound reported by wang and lall 13 in china but more elastic than the value reported by revollo fernández et al 17 in mexico and goldar 44 in india regarding evw in general our results are in line with previous studies assessing differences between the evw and price paid for it 1 12 13 17 our estimate 8 071 usd m3 is higher than those reported by ku and yoo 12 in korea and by wang and lall 13 in china as well as that reported by angulo et al 1 in spain which are 1 05 usd m3 0 37 usd m3 and 4 9 usd m3 respectively however our estimate is lower than that reported by revollo fernández et al 17 for mexico which is 19 4 usd m3 from a theoretical perspective different evw estimates are comparable through the theory of duality between cost and production compared with the value reported by koopman et al 62 who used a cge model for the netherlands our estimate is twice as high and compared with a programming model developed for chile 63 our estimate is several times higher 8 071 usd m3 vs 0 399 usd m3 6 conclusions our results are useful for designing public policies based on both efficiency in water use and competitiveness of the industrial sector for instance our estimates suggest that the industrial sector in chile could be targeted with a policy that aims to increase water price to promote sustainable use of water as in general its price elasticity is high however such a policy could threaten industry competitiveness in some specific sectors e g meats vegetables and fats and beverages and dairy in which the evw is lower than average water cost this highlights the need to consider sustainability resource goals along with the industry s ability to absorb the change in water cost from an industry perspective the evw can help inform cost benefit analyses regarding implementation of water saving measures reuse or recirculation or a new water infrastructure moreover it advises both public and private parties regarding the range in which water tariffs could be established this modeling framework entails limitations that need to be considered for instance because of aggregation considered at the industry level our results do not account for firm characteristics that are critical for policy purposes firm location conservation status of water source among others because of the lack of available data we could not assess the effect of water saving measures on the evw or the differences across regions in the context of increased water scarcity and considering that water related projects account for the largest share of public budgets the inclusion of the evw within policy assessment tools could provide policymakers with valuable information about the social consequences of water related projects infrastructure or institutional not only for the industrial sector but for all water users
