16705,the degradation of pharmaceuticals by electrochemical oxidation eo in simulated wastewater containing multiple pharmaceuticals was compared between batch and continuous reactors despite the excellent efficiencies achieved in batch experiments the practical large scale applications of eo degrading amine containing pharmaceuticals has not yet been accomplished this paper presents the results of continuous experiments with one of the most promising electrochemical configurations of pt ti electrodes before proceeding to application in the continuous electrooxidation system without chloride direct oxidation on the electrode surface and oxidation by hydroxyl radicals were the main pathways due to their short lifespans the radicals could not be transferred to the bulk solution and the removal of pharmaceuticals followed the order of sulfamethoxazole smx paracetamol par diclofenac dic in the electrochlorination system with chloride oxidation by residual chlorine was the main pathway the removal of pharmaceuticals followed the order of sulfamethoxazole smx diclofenac dic paracetamol par high smx removal was realized because of the high reaction rate of smx with free chlorine among the pharmaceuticals par had the lowest removal because it is a neutral species with a low mass transfer rate without the attraction of electrostatic force these results are consistent with the predictions from our previous batch scale study which showed that the reaction rate of dissociated compounds could be increased by the addition of electrostatic force furthermore multiple coexisting pharmaceuticals such as smx and par or dic may form dimers that can be transferred to complex structures and cause higher toxicity graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals dimer electroindirect oxidation electrochlorination toxicity scavenger 1 introduction large amounts of nonprescription pharmaceuticals such as nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and antibiotics are produced and utilized in many areas several studies have analyzed the occurrence of pharmaceutical products and byproducts in aquatic environments such as surface water groundwater and the effluent from wastewater treatment plants li et al 2020 lin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 patel et al 2019 peng et al 2014 the effects of pharmaceutical wastewater from households hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry on the environment have caused widespread concern due to its uncertainty and complicated contents these wastewater types may have adverse effects on ecosystems and especially on microorganisms and the long degradation time of pharmaceuticals in the environment is a concern li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 guzel et al 2019 patel et al 2019 peng et al 2014 many methods employing physical chemical or biological treatment processes have been developed to treat pharmaceutical containing wastewater liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b burgos castillo et al 2018 liu et al 2015 feng et al 2013 sirés and brillas 2012 yu et al 2011 however the characteristics of pharmaceuticals vary for example some are complex substances with low biodegradability cotillas et al 2019 conventional treatment processes cannot effectively destroy pharmaceutical substances in addition these pollutants may have certain unstable intermediates that can transform into other structures with higher toxicity and must be safely handled to prevent secondary pollution guzel et al 2019 some studies have indicated that in the absence of hypochlorous acid hocl phenolic compounds might unexpectedly form electrophilic ring cleavage products which may pose potential health risks at low concentrations prasse et al 2020 van buren et al 2020 electrochemical processes that eliminate organic materials from wastewater are commonly used in the treatment of various pollutants fernandes et al 2016 feng et al 2013 sirés and brillas 2012 the sustained popularity of the electrochemical process is attributed to its high processing speed and ease of operation and the lack of requirement for chemical addition muddemann et al 2019 anglada et al 2009 oxidation and reduction simultaneously occur when a current passes through the anode and cathode in advanced electrochemical oxidation eo in addition to reduction at the cathode two processes occur at the anode electrodirect oxidation and electroindirect oxidation liu et al 2019a garcia segura et al 2018 electrodirect oxidation occurs via direct electron transfer at the anode which involves direct charge transfer reactions in the anode surface and organics and has been reported to degrade contaminants at a high mineralization level liu et al 2019a fernandes et al 2016 anglada et al 2009 additionally the anode oxidized by the current is considered to generate oxidants in the bulk solution this process is called electroindirect oxidation indirect oxidation is based on the electrogeneration of hydroxyl radicals as intermediates of reactive species if chloride appears in the system active chlorine species generate species such as hclo and ocl after chlorine diffuses away from the anode into the bulk solution this process is called electrochlorination lan et al 2017 scialdone et al 2009 eo is a possible treatment strategy when wastewater properties are complicated previous works have shown that eo can remove amine containing pharmaceuticals through both direct and indirect electrochemical oxidation processes kumar et al 2020 liu et al 2019a martín de vidales et al 2012 boudreau et al 2010 brillas et al 2010 waterston et al 2006 brillas et al 2005 however eo studies have mostly been conducted under stationary operating parameters with simple configurations which cannot reflect the effects of dynamic conditions and characteristics of mass transfer garcía espinoza and mijaylova nacheva 2019 sifuna et al 2016 hussain et al 2015 feng et al 2013 boudreau et al 2010 before proceeding to application it is necessary to clarify the factors influencing removal efficiency and the mechanisms in reactors this research paper is focused on comparing the operations of batch and continuous electrochemical oxidation systems that can simultaneously remove multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals from wastewater moreover we have considered the removal efficiencies of multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals and clarified the interaction mechanism of the flow rate charge loading electrolyte type and concentration between electrodirect oxidation electroindirect oxidation and electrochlorination processes furthermore we also investigated the transformation of multiple amine containing pharmaceutical intermediates pathways and toxicities before and after the treatment processes in the batch and continuous reactors this work represents a systemic and comprehensive study 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals paracetamol par 98 diclofenac dic 98 sulfamethoxazole smx

scavenge radicals and hydrated electrons in aqueous solution during each batch experiment in addition the oh radicals were qualified by a chemical probe method using a solution of terephthalic acid ta which is converted to 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid hta by reaction with an oh radical produced during eo in the different electrolyte systems kanazawa et al 2011 the changes in hta concentration were determined from the emission spectra under fluorescence at 425 nm and the fluorescence intensity corresponding to the time integrated oh radical concentration which was measured by fluorescence

discussion 3 1 effect of electrolyte concentration to clarify the complex mechanisms of the interaction of the primary radical species with multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals during eo fig 2 was constructed which shows the variations in par smx and dic removal with and without different scavenger probes in the batch systems in the batch na2so4 system the removal rates of par smx and dic were 47 8 55 4 and 69 4 respectively tba was adopted as the hydroxyl radical probe to represent the interaction between oh and sulfate radicals that reacted with multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals in direct and indirect electrooxidation systems the variations in par smx and dic removal were 18 5 61 8 and 65 4 respectively meoh was adopted as the hydroxyl and sulfate radical probe and represented electrodirect oxidation and electroindirect oxidation without radical participation the removal efficiencies of par dic and smx were 57 5 75 9 and 63 2 respectively which were not as affected oxalate was adopted as the hydroxyl radical probe and represented the electrodirect oxidation i e oxidation in the absence of hydroxyl radicals and hydrated electrons in aqueous solution the removal rates of par dic and smx were 33 3 35 2 and 54 0 respectively these phenomena indicate that the primary mechanism under the na2so4 system was electrodirect oxidation with the pollutants being directly removed on the electrode surface in the batch nacl system the removal rates of par smx and dic were 63 4 74 7 and 64 4 respectively nb was adopted as the oh probe and represented the electrochlorination system with only active chlorine species as the dominant radicals following the disappearance of oh radicals in the electrochlorination system the par smx and dic removal rates were 78 4 55 9 and 75 3 respectively the removal significantly increased after the active chlorine species participated which confirms that the dominant mechanism depends on electroindirect oxidation this process is called electrochlorination and it occurs in the bulk solution fig 3 provides a closer examination of the participation of oh radicals generated from the different electrolytes during electroindirect oxidation we analyzed hta generation by observing changes in both na2so4 and nacl systems as shown by the fluorescence intensities at 425 nm in fig 3 the emission spectra of hta increased under the time integration in both systems the total amount of oh radicals in the nacl system was higher than that in the na2so4 system figs s1 and s2 show the progressive voltammograms in the presence absence of par dic and smx on pt ti electrodes in different electrolyte solutions the difference suggested that the anodic peaks of multiple pharmaceuticals with nacl were linked to direct oxidation on the anode surface fig s1 figs 4 and 5 show the variations in par smx and dic removal as a function of electrolyte concentration na2so4 and nacl where na2so4 represents the electrodirect and electroindirect oxidation systems with oh radicals and nacl represents the electrochlorination system the final ph in all systems was approximately 7 0 as shown in fig 4 which presents the electroindirect oxidation with oh radical performance of the batch and continuous systems at a charge loading qe of 3 000 c l and a flow rate ql of 50 ml min the par smx and dic removal rates decreased from 67 2 to 13 9 77 2 to 18 5 and 66 0 to 6 9 respectively the elimination trends of par in the continuous system slightly increased with increasing na2so4 concentration which indicates that neutral compounds may depend on direct oxidation on the electrode surface however there was no notable change in smx or dic in the batch electrochlorination system fig 5 under identical operational conditions the par smx and dic removal rates increased with increasing nacl concentration fig 5 reveals that the removal efficiencies of par were 56 3 82 9 and 100 for the 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions respectively the elimination efficiencies of smx were 96 5 93 8 and 100 for the 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions respectively the removal efficiencies of dic were 62 4 67 1 and 100 for the 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions respectively in the batch system low nacl is required to achieve a removal efficiency higher than that in the continuous system however in the continuous system over 0 05 m nacl is required for high removal under identical experimental conditions the removal efficiencies of par were 25 1 34 2 and 39 5 for the 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions respectively the removal efficiencies of smx were 84 3 88 3 and 97 0 for the 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions respectively the removal efficiencies of dic were 10 3 56 1 and 95 0 for the 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions respectively thus the required chlorine concentration in the continuous electrochlorination system exceeded the required concentration of 0 05 m nacl in the batch system this finding may be the result of two mechanisms the much shorter retention time in the continuous system and the increased mass transfer in the batch operation in the batch experiment the retention time was longer than 20 min therefore there was sufficient time for nacl to be oxidized into chlorine however in the continuous system the hydraulic retention time was not sufficient for chlorine generation deborde and von gunten 2008 wang and margerum 1994 furthermore the mass transfer was increased by the more forceful stirring in the batch operation which promoted contact between the chlorine radicals and pharmaceutical molecules thus chlorine radical species were involved before the chlorine generation process cho et al 2014 de moura et al 2014 in contrast under the continuous scenario without the static flow mixer the mass transfer rate limited the reaction between the chlorine radicals and pharmaceutical molecules noël et al 2019 however in both the batch and continuous systems the removal of par was inadequate especially in the electrochlorination system under 0 1 m nacl specifically the removal of par decreased from 100 to 39 5 this finding confirms the second interference mechanism described above par is a neutral species that depends on mass diffusion for transfer to the electrode in contrast smx and dic are anions that can be transferred to the electrode via electrostatic attraction therefore the removal of par in the continuous system was decreased much more than that of smx or dic the same interference mechanism can explain the notable decreases in the removal of all pharmaceuticals in the continuous electroindirect oxidation system without chloride radicals such as hydroxyl groups are the main oxidants they cannot be transferred to the bulk solution due to their extremely high activity therefore the reaction rate of pharmaceuticals strongly depends on the mass transfer rate 3 2 effect of charge loading and energy consumption figs 6 8 present the variations in amine containing pharmaceutical removal and the residual chlorine concentration with qe in the batch and continuous systems charge loading qe was defined according to eq 1 in the batch system to examine the effects of the current on the removal of dic par and smx and the residual chlorine concentration 1 q e n i t v where n is the cell number i is the current a t is the reaction time and v is the volume of the reactor l the amounts of both reactive oxidants released from the anodes and chlorine generated at the cathodes which can remove amine containing pharmaceuticals are proportional to qe for application in the continuous system the equation can be rewritten as follows 2 q e n i q l where ql is the flow rate l min fig 6 presents the variations in amine containing pharmaceutical removal with qe in the batch and continuous electroindirect oxidation na2so4 systems in the batch electroindirect oxidation system the elimination efficiencies of par smx and dic were 74 9 90 9 and 80 0 respectively in the continuous electroindirect oxidation system the removal efficiencies of par and dic decreased to 58 and 47 7 respectively while the elimination efficiency of smx increased to 97 6 thus we infer that the competitive effects depend on the dissociated status of the substances and that degradation follows the order of smx dic par under neutral conditions however with increasing electrode size in the electroindirect oxidation system most of the removal efficiencies of the multiple pharmaceuticals remained lower than those in the batch reactor system likely because of the low mass transfer rate as mentioned above similar tendencies were observed in the electrochlorination system fig 7 the removal efficiencies of par smx and dic in the batch system with 0 01 m nacl were 68 7 96 7 and 86 3 respectively in contrast in the continuous system the elimination efficiencies of par smx and dic decreased to 60 2 95 0 and 52 7 respectively in addition the residual chlorine concentration clearly increased with increasing charge loading fig 8 the removal efficiencies of dic and smx reached approximately 100 in the batch and continuous systems at 3 000 coulomb l and 0 1 m nacl however the residual chlorine concentrations remained at 53 and 139 mg l respectively in the batch system 14 mg l free chlorine remained to achieve more than 95 pharmaceutical removal efficiency smx and dic however in continuous operation more than 57 mg l free chlorine remained the removal of dic significantly decreased possibly due to the involvement of dic in both the electroindirect oxidation and electrochlorination processes inhibition of dic removal was observed in the continuous electrochlorination system because of the presence of free chlorine which has been shown to be consumed the most rapidly by smx followed by dic and par under neutral conditions liu et al 2019b therefore if the chloride concentration was low most of the active chlorine radicals and free chlorine were consumed by smx compared to that in the batch system the residual concentration of free chlorine was higher in the continuous system however the continuous operation system had a lower removal ability than the batch system which might have been caused by the competitive interactions between electrochlorination and hydroxyl radicals according to reactions 3 9 liou and dodd 2021 liu et al 2019a mostafa et al 2018 anglada et al 2009 the oxidation of amine containing pharmaceuticals is initiated by the attack of radicals which may also react with reactive chlorine species liou and dodd 2021 boudreau et al 2010 3 cl pollutants c o 2 4 c l oh cl o h 5 c l cl e 6 cl cl c l 2 7 2 c l

based on the economic feasibility application of the pt ti electrode system in the treatment of wastewater that contained multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals was further considered the operating cost of both the na2so4 and nacl systems are also listed in table s1 the capital cost was calculated according to the required pt ti electrode area approximately 562 for 0 075 m2 and the operating cost was between 0 01 and 0 03 per m3 which indicated that electrochlorination was more suitable as an advanced treatment process table s2 presents the required charge of the electrooxidation treatment in coulombs per milligram for the removal efficiencies of synthetic par dic and smx solutions in the batch na2so4 and nacl systems only studies with similar electrolyte concentrations and transparent information on operational energy consumption were considered notably the electrochlorination system could significantly improve the removals of amine containing pharmaceuticals and greatly reduce energy consumption showing efficient energy conservation advantages 3 3 effect of current density fig 9 shows the removal levels of multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals with current density j in the batch and continuous electroindirect oxidation na2so4 and electrochlorination nacl systems in continuous operation the removal of par dic and smx in the electroindirect oxidation and electrochlorination systems increased with increasing current density however in the batch systems similar removal tendencies were observed only in the batch electrochlorination system in the batch electroindirect oxidation system the average removal rates of par smx and dic from 0 8 to 2 ma cm2 were 47 9 51 7 and 57 5 respectively in the batch electrochlorination system the removal rates of par smx and dic at 2 ma cm2 were 56 3 96 5 and 62 4 respectively in contrast in the continuous electroindirect oxidation system 2 9 and 20 4 of par was removed at 1 1 and 2 2 ma cm2 respectively the removal of smx increased from 18 5 to 42 2 between 1 1 and 2 2 ma cm2 meanwhile the elimination of dic increased from 6 9 to 37 9 additionally in the continuous electrochlorination system the degradation efficiencies of par smx and dic were 25 1 56 6 84 3 91 4 and 10 3 46 4 respectively with degradation efficiency increasing as current density increased from 1 1 to 2 2 ma cm2 3 4 effect of flow rate as shown in fig 10 in continuous operations the changes in flow rate ql in the removal of multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals par smx and dic were significantly higher in the electrochlorination system than in the electroindirect oxidation system comparing the variations in elimination efficiencies of par smx and dic with ql in the electroindirect oxidation and electrochlorination systems under continuous operation we observed analogous trends at a higher flow rate the elapsed time of contact between the contaminants and oxidants hydroxyl radicals and active chlorine species and the electrode surface is shorter which possibly decreases the process efficiency the removal of these three target compounds was acceptable in the ql range of 20 50 ml min notably the residual chlorine concentration decreased with increasing ql this phenomenon likely occurred due to the increase in ql which decreased qe as defined in eq 2 hence too much hydrogen gas was generated during the eo reaction which can increase the resistance and disrupt the continuity of the stream noël et al 2019 these phenomena may limit the mass transfer of pharmaceuticals and electron mediates from the bulk solution to the electrode surface the reynolds numbers re of the batch and continuous systems are calculated as follows eqs 12 and 13 in the batch system 12 re ρ n d 2 μ ρ v d μ in the continuous system 13 re ρ v d μ v d ν q d ν a where q is the volumetric flow rate m3 s d is the hydraulic diameter of the reactor m a is the cross sectional area of the reactor m2 v is the mean velocity of water m s µ is the dynamic viscosity of water pa s water 0 000894 ν is the kinematic viscosity m2 s and ρ is the density of water kg m3 water 997 the re values of the batch reactor and continuous reactor were 125461 and 61 respectively the flow pattern in the batch reactor was turbulent flow in contrast the re of the continuous system was below 2900 which corresponds to laminar flow as mentioned above the higher flow in the continuous system than in the batch system may decrease the removal efficiency according to the results fig s3 without stirring the fluorescence spectra of oh radical generation were significantly decreased in the na2so4 system representing the mass transfer between the flow patterns turbulent laminar flow consistent with the removal efficiencies shown in fig 4 3 5 transformation products and toxicity multiple amine containing pharmaceutical intermediates were identified during eo processes as shown in table 3 uplc q tof ms spectra of the mixture of par smx and dic were compared to identify intermediates from the treatment supplementary information according to the different electrolytes used during the electrooxidation process two majority reactions took place at the anode surface and in the bulk solution the possible degradation pathways of multiple amine containing pharmaceutical intermediates identified based on the identified structures are shown in fig 11 based on their comparison to the single amine containing pharmaceutical intermediates formed and degraded in the batch eo system and conventional chlorination system liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b these byproducts were classified as nonchlorinated and chlorinated intermediates in direct anodic degradation electron transfer from the pt ti anode to the par dic and smx molecules near its surface took place leading to the degradation of these molecules apart from direct electron transfer to pharmaceutical molecules the degradation of these molecules occurs through highly hydroxyl radicals direct oxidation via hydroxylation of par dic and smx led to the dealkylation of these molecules and the formation of s5 m z 161 the attack of radicals on the aromatic compounds from transformation products was caused by sequential oxidation of the ring van buren et al 2020 and subsequent hydroxylation and decarboxylation generated p1 m z 110 d4 m z 249 d7 m z 283 s1 m z 282 and s5 m z 161 s1 m z 282 was formed by the attack of multiple hydroxyl radicals on different smx molecule bonds resulting in its demethylation in other degradation pathways attack of active chlorine species i e cl2 hocl generated via eqs 3 9 liou and dodd 2021 liu et al 2019a anglada et al 2009 on the pharmaceutical molecule resulted in its ring opening and decarboxylation forming s3 m z 156 and s4 m z 108 respectively subsequent hydroxylation led to d1 m z 282 d3 m z 330 and d4 m z 249 furthermore the combined attack of active chlorine species on the aromatic groups of p3 m z 186 and d7 m z 283 was observed chlorination also resulted in the formation of p3 m z 186 d5 m z 251 and d7 m z 283 loss of an amine nh3 group and decarboxylation by active chlorine from the molecule consequently yielded p1 m z 149 p2 m z 149 d4 m z 249 and d7 m z 283 further dimerization led to the reaction intermediates m1 m z 440 and m2 m z 569 dimers of smx and par or dic respectively a fragment of m z 108 the molecular weight of o toluidine c7h9n should be included in the molecular structure of m3 m z 301 a fragment of m z 200 might be 4 4 oxydianiline c12h12n2o a dimer containing structure of polyamides el faham et al 2012 dey et al 2004 m4 m z 248 might be 2 amino 3 hydroxyl 5 chlorobenzophenone c13h10clno2 m5 m z 231 might be 2 amino 5 chlorobenzophenone c13h10clno or diphenylcarbamyl chloride m6 m z 576 might be the result of dimerization of par and hydroquinone with hypochlorous acid m7 m z 282 c14h13cl2no might be a dimer of n acetyl p benzoquinone imine napqi with dic or smx intermediates found in both the electrochlorination and electroindirect oxidation systems a fragment of m z 247 c13h13no2s the molecular weight of n benzylbenzenesulfonamide or 4 methyl n phenylbenzenesulfonamide should be included in the molecular structure of m7 m z 282 a fragment of m z 149 might be napqi c8h7no2 one of the toxic metabolites of par albano et al 1985 m8 m z 434 might be the chlorinated sulfonamide m9 m z 526 was observed in both the electrochlorination and electroindirect oxidation systems and might be the dimer of structurally related sulfonamides and a dic intermediate sulfisoxazole c11h13n3o3s 1 methyl 9h carbazole c13h11n martínez et al 2011 and phenyl group c6h5 the possible main degradation route of par dic and smx by electrooxidation using nonsacrificial anodes such as pt ti and graphite is hydroxylation via physisorbed hydroxyl radicals however in the present work active chlorine species and hydroxyl radicals both play an essential role in the simultaneous elimination of pharmaceuticals liou and dodd 2021 degradation by electrooxidation thus follows different routes depending on the type of electrolyte employed for the purpose thus smx might be formed and coexist with par or dic and its intermediates may become complex dimers liu et al 2019b the variations in toxicity of multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals during electroindirect oxidation and electrochlorination are shown in fig 12 according to their toxicity units tus chang et al 2013 kahru et al 2000 multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals have significant toxicity and changes in toxicity were observed throughout the reaction these findings provide a preliminary assessment of the potential acute toxicity and indicat that further assessment of the transformation products is required before the reaction the tus of multiple pharmaceuticals were 1 2 classifying them as nontoxic or low toxicity substances however after 30 min of electrolysis the tus significantly increased in the batch and continuous systems to 6 and 3 toxic levels respectively after 30 min of electrolysis significantly decreased toxicity was found only for the electrochlorination system for the samples that involved the electroindirect oxidation process high toxicity remained thus a higher concentration of multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals remained in the electroindirect oxidation system than in the electrochlorination system 4 conclusion in this work a continuous bipolar pt ti eo system was developed to treat wastewater contaminated by multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals which could be effectively treated by an electrochlorination system with a higher dose of nacl than that employed in a batch system the removal efficiencies of multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals and residual chlorine concentration with qe were similar between the batch and continuous systems at 50 ml min and 0 05 m nacl compared to a previous reactor using the 5 cell batch configuration the advanced electrochemical continuous system with pt ti electrodes improves the elimination efficiency by more than 10 20 and achieves an 88 3 removal efficiency for smx and a 56 1 removal efficiency for dic however at 0 01 m nacl smaller amounts of dic par and smx were removed in the continuous system than in the batch system which can be attributed to the increased mass transfer by the more forceful stirring in the batch operation which promotes contact between the radicals and pharmaceutical molecules hence chlorine radical species can be involved before the chlorine generation process so the oxidation of amine containing pharmaceuticals is initiated by radical attack which may also react with chloride ions in a continuous operation system in addition the removal of dic substantially decreased possibly because of the involvement of dic in both electroindirect oxidation and electrochlorination processes we infer that the inhibition of dic removal in the continuous electrochlorination system was likely caused by the higher concentration of free chlorine which was most rapidly consumed by smx followed by dic and par under neutral conditions the same interference can explain the considerable decrease in the removal of all pharmaceuticals in the continuous electroindirect oxidation system without chloride radicals such as hydroxyl groups are the main oxidants they cannot be transferred to the bulk solution or pharmaceutical molecules due to their extremely high activity the reaction rate of pharmaceuticals is highly dependent on the mass transfer rate which also depends on the dissociated status of the substances which follows the order smx dic par under neutral conditions importantly smx might be formed and coexist with par or dic in complex dimers pt ti electrodes were adopted with a continuous configuration to determine the optimal operating and design conditions the data show that the improved system should focus on the flow rate electrolyte concentration and increasing charge loading this study demonstrates the systematic investigation of the operability of the eo system in removing multiple

16705,the degradation of pharmaceuticals by electrochemical oxidation eo in simulated wastewater containing multiple pharmaceuticals was compared between batch and continuous reactors despite the excellent efficiencies achieved in batch experiments the practical large scale applications of eo degrading amine containing pharmaceuticals has not yet been accomplished this paper presents the results of continuous experiments with one of the most promising electrochemical configurations of pt ti electrodes before proceeding to application in the continuous electrooxidation system without chloride direct oxidation on the electrode surface and oxidation by hydroxyl radicals were the main pathways due to their short lifespans the radicals could not be transferred to the bulk solution and the removal of pharmaceuticals followed the order of sulfamethoxazole smx paracetamol par diclofenac dic in the electrochlorination system with chloride oxidation by residual chlorine was the main pathway the removal of pharmaceuticals followed the order of sulfamethoxazole smx diclofenac dic paracetamol par high smx removal was realized because of the high reaction rate of smx with free chlorine among the pharmaceuticals par had the lowest removal because it is a neutral species with a low mass transfer rate without the attraction of electrostatic force these results are consistent with the predictions from our previous batch scale study which showed that the reaction rate of dissociated compounds could be increased by the addition of electrostatic force furthermore multiple coexisting pharmaceuticals such as smx and par or dic may form dimers that can be transferred to complex structures and cause higher toxicity graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals dimer electroindirect oxidation electrochlorination toxicity scavenger 1 introduction large amounts of nonprescription pharmaceuticals such as nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and antibiotics are produced and utilized in many areas several studies have analyzed the occurrence of pharmaceutical products and byproducts in aquatic environments such as surface water groundwater and the effluent from wastewater treatment plants li et al 2020 lin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 patel et al 2019 peng et al 2014 the effects of pharmaceutical wastewater from households hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry on the environment have caused widespread concern due to its uncertainty and complicated contents these wastewater types may have adverse effects on ecosystems and especially on microorganisms and the long degradation time of pharmaceuticals in the environment is a concern li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 guzel et al 2019 patel et al 2019 peng et al 2014 many methods employing physical chemical or biological treatment processes have been developed to treat pharmaceutical containing wastewater liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b burgos castillo et al 2018 liu et al 2015 feng et al 2013 sirés and brillas 2012 yu et al 2011 however the characteristics of pharmaceuticals vary for example some are complex substances with low biodegradability cotillas et al 2019 conventional treatment processes cannot effectively destroy pharmaceutical substances in addition these pollutants may have certain unstable intermediates that can transform into other structures with higher toxicity and must be safely handled to prevent secondary pollution guzel et al 2019 some studies have indicated that in the absence of hypochlorous acid hocl phenolic compounds might unexpectedly form electrophilic ring cleavage products which may pose potential health risks at low concentrations prasse et al 2020 van buren et al 2020 electrochemical processes that eliminate organic materials from wastewater are commonly used in the treatment of various pollutants fernandes et al 2016 feng et al 2013 sirés and brillas 2012 the sustained popularity of the electrochemical process is attributed to its high processing speed and ease of operation and the lack of requirement for chemical addition muddemann et al 2019 anglada et al 2009 oxidation and reduction simultaneously occur when a current passes through the anode and cathode in advanced electrochemical oxidation eo in addition to reduction at the cathode two processes occur at the anode electrodirect oxidation and electroindirect oxidation liu et al 2019a garcia segura et al 2018 electrodirect oxidation occurs via direct electron transfer at the anode which involves direct charge transfer reactions in the anode surface and organics and has been reported to degrade contaminants at a high mineralization level liu et al 2019a fernandes et al 2016 anglada et al 2009 additionally the anode oxidized by the current is considered to generate oxidants in the bulk solution this process is called electroindirect oxidation indirect oxidation is based on the electrogeneration of hydroxyl radicals as intermediates of reactive species if chloride appears in the system active chlorine species generate species such as hclo and ocl after chlorine diffuses away from the anode into the bulk solution this process is called electrochlorination lan et al 2017 scialdone et al 2009 eo is a possible treatment strategy when wastewater properties are complicated previous works have shown that eo can remove amine containing pharmaceuticals through both direct and indirect electrochemical oxidation processes kumar et al 2020 liu et al 2019a martín de vidales et al 2012 boudreau et al 2010 brillas et al 2010 waterston et al 2006 brillas et al 2005 however eo studies have mostly been conducted under stationary operating parameters with simple configurations which cannot reflect the effects of dynamic conditions and characteristics of mass transfer garcía espinoza and mijaylova nacheva 2019 sifuna et al 2016 hussain et al 2015 feng et al 2013 boudreau et al 2010 before proceeding to application it is necessary to clarify the factors influencing removal efficiency and the mechanisms in reactors this research paper is focused on comparing the operations of batch and continuous electrochemical oxidation systems that can simultaneously remove multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals from wastewater moreover we have considered the removal efficiencies of multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals and clarified the interaction mechanism of the flow rate charge loading electrolyte type and concentration between electrodirect oxidation electroindirect oxidation and electrochlorination processes furthermore we also investigated the transformation of multiple amine containing pharmaceutical intermediates pathways and toxicities before and after the treatment processes in the batch and continuous reactors this work represents a systemic and comprehensive study 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals paracetamol par 98 diclofenac dic 98 sulfamethoxazole smx

scavenge radicals and hydrated electrons in aqueous solution during each batch experiment in addition the oh radicals were qualified by a chemical probe method using a solution of terephthalic acid ta which is converted to 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid hta by reaction with an oh radical produced during eo in the different electrolyte systems kanazawa et al 2011 the changes in hta concentration were determined from the emission spectra under fluorescence at 425 nm and the fluorescence intensity corresponding to the time integrated oh radical concentration which was measured by fluorescence

discussion 3 1 effect of electrolyte concentration to clarify the complex mechanisms of the interaction of the primary radical species with multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals during eo fig 2 was constructed which shows the variations in par smx and dic removal with and without different scavenger probes in the batch systems in the batch na2so4 system the removal rates of par smx and dic were 47 8 55 4 and 69 4 respectively tba was adopted as the hydroxyl radical probe to represent the interaction between oh and sulfate radicals that reacted with multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals in direct and indirect electrooxidation systems the variations in par smx and dic removal were 18 5 61 8 and 65 4 respectively meoh was adopted as the hydroxyl and sulfate radical probe and represented electrodirect oxidation and electroindirect oxidation without radical participation the removal efficiencies of par dic and smx were 57 5 75 9 and 63 2 respectively which were not as affected oxalate was adopted as the hydroxyl radical probe and represented the electrodirect oxidation i e oxidation in the absence of hydroxyl radicals and hydrated electrons in aqueous solution the removal rates of par dic and smx were 33 3 35 2 and 54 0 respectively these phenomena indicate that the primary mechanism under the na2so4 system was electrodirect oxidation with the pollutants being directly removed on the electrode surface in the batch nacl system the removal rates of par smx and dic were 63 4 74 7 and 64 4 respectively nb was adopted as the oh probe and represented the electrochlorination system with only active chlorine species as the dominant radicals following the disappearance of oh radicals in the electrochlorination system the par smx and dic removal rates were 78 4 55 9 and 75 3 respectively the removal significantly increased after the active chlorine species participated which confirms that the dominant mechanism depends on electroindirect oxidation this process is called electrochlorination and it occurs in the bulk solution fig 3 provides a closer examination of the participation of oh radicals generated from the different electrolytes during electroindirect oxidation we analyzed hta generation by observing changes in both na2so4 and nacl systems as shown by the fluorescence intensities at 425 nm in fig 3 the emission spectra of hta increased under the time integration in both systems the total amount of oh radicals in the nacl system was higher than that in the na2so4 system figs s1 and s2 show the progressive voltammograms in the presence absence of par dic and smx on pt ti electrodes in different electrolyte solutions the difference suggested that the anodic peaks of multiple pharmaceuticals with nacl were linked to direct oxidation on the anode surface fig s1 figs 4 and 5 show the variations in par smx and dic removal as a function of electrolyte concentration na2so4 and nacl where na2so4 represents the electrodirect and electroindirect oxidation systems with oh radicals and nacl represents the electrochlorination system the final ph in all systems was approximately 7 0 as shown in fig 4 which presents the electroindirect oxidation with oh radical performance of the batch and continuous systems at a charge loading qe of 3 000 c l and a flow rate ql of 50 ml min the par smx and dic removal rates decreased from 67 2 to 13 9 77 2 to 18 5 and 66 0 to 6 9 respectively the elimination trends of par in the continuous system slightly increased with increasing na2so4 concentration which indicates that neutral compounds may depend on direct oxidation on the electrode surface however there was no notable change in smx or dic in the batch electrochlorination system fig 5 under identical operational conditions the par smx and dic removal rates increased with increasing nacl concentration fig 5 reveals that the removal efficiencies of par were 56 3 82 9 and 100 for the 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions respectively the elimination efficiencies of smx were 96 5 93 8 and 100 for the 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions respectively the removal efficiencies of dic were 62 4 67 1 and 100 for the 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions respectively in the batch system low nacl is required to achieve a removal efficiency higher than that in the continuous system however in the continuous system over 0 05 m nacl is required for high removal under identical experimental conditions the removal efficiencies of par were 25 1 34 2 and 39 5 for the 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions respectively the removal efficiencies of smx were 84 3 88 3 and 97 0 for the 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions respectively the removal efficiencies of dic were 10 3 56 1 and 95 0 for the 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions respectively thus the required chlorine concentration in the continuous electrochlorination system exceeded the required concentration of 0 05 m nacl in the batch system this finding may be the result of two mechanisms the much shorter retention time in the continuous system and the increased mass transfer in the batch operation in the batch experiment the retention time was longer than 20 min therefore there was sufficient time for nacl to be oxidized into chlorine however in the continuous system the hydraulic retention time was not sufficient for chlorine generation deborde and von gunten 2008 wang and margerum 1994 furthermore the mass transfer was increased by the more forceful stirring in the batch operation which promoted contact between the chlorine radicals and pharmaceutical molecules thus chlorine radical species were involved before the chlorine generation process cho et al 2014 de moura et al 2014 in contrast under the continuous scenario without the static flow mixer the mass transfer rate limited the reaction between the chlorine radicals and pharmaceutical molecules noël et al 2019 however in both the batch and continuous systems the removal of par was inadequate especially in the electrochlorination system under 0 1 m nacl specifically the removal of par decreased from 100 to 39 5 this finding confirms the second interference mechanism described above par is a neutral species that depends on mass diffusion for transfer to the electrode in contrast smx and dic are anions that can be transferred to the electrode via electrostatic attraction therefore the removal of par in the continuous system was decreased much more than that of smx or dic the same interference mechanism can explain the notable decreases in the removal of all pharmaceuticals in the continuous electroindirect oxidation system without chloride radicals such as hydroxyl groups are the main oxidants they cannot be transferred to the bulk solution due to their extremely high activity therefore the reaction rate of pharmaceuticals strongly depends on the mass transfer rate 3 2 effect of charge loading and energy consumption figs 6 8 present the variations in amine containing pharmaceutical removal and the residual chlorine concentration with qe in the batch and continuous systems charge loading qe was defined according to eq 1 in the batch system to examine the effects of the current on the removal of dic par and smx and the residual chlorine concentration 1 q e n i t v where n is the cell number i is the current a t is the reaction time and v is the volume of the reactor l the amounts of both reactive oxidants released from the anodes and chlorine generated at the cathodes which can remove amine containing pharmaceuticals are proportional to qe for application in the continuous system the equation can be rewritten as follows 2 q e n i q l where ql is the flow rate l min fig 6 presents the variations in amine containing pharmaceutical removal with qe in the batch and continuous electroindirect oxidation na2so4 systems in the batch electroindirect oxidation system the elimination efficiencies of par smx and dic were 74 9 90 9 and 80 0 respectively in the continuous electroindirect oxidation system the removal efficiencies of par and dic decreased to 58 and 47 7 respectively while the elimination efficiency of smx increased to 97 6 thus we infer that the competitive effects depend on the dissociated status of the substances and that degradation follows the order of smx dic par under neutral conditions however with increasing electrode size in the electroindirect oxidation system most of the removal efficiencies of the multiple pharmaceuticals remained lower than those in the batch reactor system likely because of the low mass transfer rate as mentioned above similar tendencies were observed in the electrochlorination system fig 7 the removal efficiencies of par smx and dic in the batch system with 0 01 m nacl were 68 7 96 7 and 86 3 respectively in contrast in the continuous system the elimination efficiencies of par smx and dic decreased to 60 2 95 0 and 52 7 respectively in addition the residual chlorine concentration clearly increased with increasing charge loading fig 8 the removal efficiencies of dic and smx reached approximately 100 in the batch and continuous systems at 3 000 coulomb l and 0 1 m nacl however the residual chlorine concentrations remained at 53 and 139 mg l respectively in the batch system 14 mg l free chlorine remained to achieve more than 95 pharmaceutical removal efficiency smx and dic however in continuous operation more than 57 mg l free chlorine remained the removal of dic significantly decreased possibly due to the involvement of dic in both the electroindirect oxidation and electrochlorination processes inhibition of dic removal was observed in the continuous electrochlorination system because of the presence of free chlorine which has been shown to be consumed the most rapidly by smx followed by dic and par under neutral conditions liu et al 2019b therefore if the chloride concentration was low most of the active chlorine radicals and free chlorine were consumed by smx compared to that in the batch system the residual concentration of free chlorine was higher in the continuous system however the continuous operation system had a lower removal ability than the batch system which might have been caused by the competitive interactions between electrochlorination and hydroxyl radicals according to reactions 3 9 liou and dodd 2021 liu et al 2019a mostafa et al 2018 anglada et al 2009 the oxidation of amine containing pharmaceuticals is initiated by the attack of radicals which may also react with reactive chlorine species liou and dodd 2021 boudreau et al 2010 3 cl pollutants c o 2 4 c l oh cl o h 5 c l cl e 6 cl cl c l 2 7 2 c l

based on the economic feasibility application of the pt ti electrode system in the treatment of wastewater that contained multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals was further considered the operating cost of both the na2so4 and nacl systems are also listed in table s1 the capital cost was calculated according to the required pt ti electrode area approximately 562 for 0 075 m2 and the operating cost was between 0 01 and 0 03 per m3 which indicated that electrochlorination was more suitable as an advanced treatment process table s2 presents the required charge of the electrooxidation treatment in coulombs per milligram for the removal efficiencies of synthetic par dic and smx solutions in the batch na2so4 and nacl systems only studies with similar electrolyte concentrations and transparent information on operational energy consumption were considered notably the electrochlorination system could significantly improve the removals of amine containing pharmaceuticals and greatly reduce energy consumption showing efficient energy conservation advantages 3 3 effect of current density fig 9 shows the removal levels of multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals with current density j in the batch and continuous electroindirect oxidation na2so4 and electrochlorination nacl systems in continuous operation the removal of par dic and smx in the electroindirect oxidation and electrochlorination systems increased with increasing current density however in the batch systems similar removal tendencies were observed only in the batch electrochlorination system in the batch electroindirect oxidation system the average removal rates of par smx and dic from 0 8 to 2 ma cm2 were 47 9 51 7 and 57 5 respectively in the batch electrochlorination system the removal rates of par smx and dic at 2 ma cm2 were 56 3 96 5 and 62 4 respectively in contrast in the continuous electroindirect oxidation system 2 9 and 20 4 of par was removed at 1 1 and 2 2 ma cm2 respectively the removal of smx increased from 18 5 to 42 2 between 1 1 and 2 2 ma cm2 meanwhile the elimination of dic increased from 6 9 to 37 9 additionally in the continuous electrochlorination system the degradation efficiencies of par smx and dic were 25 1 56 6 84 3 91 4 and 10 3 46 4 respectively with degradation efficiency increasing as current density increased from 1 1 to 2 2 ma cm2 3 4 effect of flow rate as shown in fig 10 in continuous operations the changes in flow rate ql in the removal of multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals par smx and dic were significantly higher in the electrochlorination system than in the electroindirect oxidation system comparing the variations in elimination efficiencies of par smx and dic with ql in the electroindirect oxidation and electrochlorination systems under continuous operation we observed analogous trends at a higher flow rate the elapsed time of contact between the contaminants and oxidants hydroxyl radicals and active chlorine species and the electrode surface is shorter which possibly decreases the process efficiency the removal of these three target compounds was acceptable in the ql range of 20 50 ml min notably the residual chlorine concentration decreased with increasing ql this phenomenon likely occurred due to the increase in ql which decreased qe as defined in eq 2 hence too much hydrogen gas was generated during the eo reaction which can increase the resistance and disrupt the continuity of the stream noël et al 2019 these phenomena may limit the mass transfer of pharmaceuticals and electron mediates from the bulk solution to the electrode surface the reynolds numbers re of the batch and continuous systems are calculated as follows eqs 12 and 13 in the batch system 12 re ρ n d 2 μ ρ v d μ

continuous reactor were 125461 and 61 respectively the flow pattern in the batch reactor was turbulent flow in contrast the re of the continuous system was below 2900 which corresponds to laminar flow as mentioned above the higher flow in the continuous system than in the batch system may decrease the removal efficiency according to the results fig s3 without stirring the fluorescence spectra of oh radical generation were significantly decreased in the na2so4 system representing the mass transfer between the flow patterns turbulent laminar flow consistent with the removal efficiencies shown in fig 4 3 5 transformation products and toxicity multiple amine containing pharmaceutical intermediates were identified during eo processes as shown in table 3 uplc q tof ms spectra of the mixture of par smx and dic were compared to identify intermediates from the treatment supplementary information according to the different electrolytes used during the electrooxidation process two majority reactions took place at the anode surface and in the bulk solution the possible degradation pathways of multiple amine containing pharmaceutical intermediates identified based on the identified structures are shown in fig 11 based on their comparison to the single amine containing pharmaceutical intermediates formed and degraded in the batch eo system and conventional chlorination system liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b these byproducts were classified as nonchlorinated and chlorinated intermediates in direct anodic degradation electron transfer from the pt ti anode to the par dic and smx molecules near its surface took place leading to the degradation of these molecules apart from direct electron transfer to pharmaceutical molecules the degradation of these molecules occurs through highly hydroxyl radicals direct oxidation via hydroxylation of par dic and smx led to the dealkylation of these molecules and the formation of s5 m z 161 the attack of radicals on the aromatic compounds from transformation products was caused by sequential oxidation of the ring van buren et al 2020 and subsequent hydroxylation and decarboxylation generated p1 m z 110 d4 m z 249 d7 m z 283 s1 m z 282 and s5 m z 161 s1 m z 282 was formed by the attack of multiple hydroxyl radicals on different smx molecule bonds resulting in its demethylation in other degradation pathways attack of active chlorine species i e cl2 hocl generated via eqs 3 9 liou and dodd 2021 liu et al 2019a anglada et al 2009 on the pharmaceutical molecule resulted in its ring opening and decarboxylation forming s3 m z 156 and s4 m z 108 respectively subsequent hydroxylation led to d1 m z 282 d3 m z 330 and d4 m z 249 furthermore the combined attack of active chlorine species on the aromatic groups of p3 m z 186 and d7 m z 283 was observed chlorination also resulted in the formation of p3 m z 186 d5 m z 251 and d7 m z 283 loss of an amine nh3 group and decarboxylation by active chlorine from the molecule consequently yielded p1 m z 149 p2 m z 149 d4 m z 249 and d7 m z 283 further dimerization led to the reaction intermediates m1 m z 440 and m2 m z 569 dimers of smx and par or dic respectively a

methyl n phenylbenzenesulfonamide should be included in the molecular structure of m7 m z 282 a fragment of m z 149 might be napqi c8h7no2 one of the toxic metabolites of par albano et al 1985 m8 m z 434 might be the chlorinated sulfonamide m9 m z 526 was observed in both the electrochlorination and electroindirect oxidation systems and might be the dimer of structurally related sulfonamides and a dic intermediate sulfisoxazole c11h13n3o3s 1 methyl 9h carbazole c13h11n martínez et al 2011 and phenyl group c6h5 the possible main degradation route of par dic and smx by electrooxidation using nonsacrificial anodes such as pt ti and graphite is hydroxylation via physisorbed hydroxyl radicals however in the present work active chlorine species and hydroxyl radicals both play an essential role in the simultaneous elimination of pharmaceuticals liou and dodd 2021 degradation by electrooxidation thus follows different routes depending on the type of electrolyte employed for the purpose thus smx might be formed and coexist with par or dic and its intermediates may become complex dimers liu et al 2019b the variations in toxicity of multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals during electroindirect oxidation and electrochlorination are shown in fig 12 according to their toxicity units tus chang et al 2013 kahru et al 2000 multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals have significant toxicity and changes in toxicity were observed throughout the reaction these findings provide a preliminary assessment of the potential acute toxicity and indicat that further assessment of the transformation products is required before the reaction the tus of multiple pharmaceuticals were 1 2 classifying them as nontoxic or low toxicity substances however after 30 min of electrolysis the tus significantly increased in the batch and continuous systems to 6 and 3 toxic levels respectively after 30 min of electrolysis significantly decreased toxicity was found only for the electrochlorination system for the samples that involved the electroindirect oxidation process high toxicity remained thus a higher concentration of multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals remained in the electroindirect oxidation system than in the electrochlorination system 4 conclusion in this work a continuous bipolar pt ti eo system was developed to treat wastewater contaminated by multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals which could be effectively treated by an electrochlorination system with a higher dose of nacl than that employed in a batch system the removal efficiencies of multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals and residual chlorine concentration with qe were similar between the batch and continuous systems at 50 ml min and 0 05 m nacl compared to a previous reactor using the 5 cell batch configuration the advanced electrochemical continuous system with pt ti electrodes improves the elimination efficiency by more than 10 20 and achieves an 88 3 removal efficiency for smx and a 56 1 removal efficiency for dic however at 0 01 m nacl smaller amounts of dic par and smx were removed in the continuous system than in the batch system which can be attributed to the increased mass transfer by the more forceful stirring in the batch operation which promotes contact between the radicals and pharmaceutical molecules hence chlorine radical species can be involved before the chlorine generation process so the oxidation of amine containing pharmaceuticals is initiated by radical attack which may also react with chloride ions in a continuous operation system in addition the removal of dic substantially decreased possibly because of the involvement of dic in both electroindirect oxidation and electrochlorination processes we infer that the inhibition of dic removal in the continuous electrochlorination system was likely caused by the higher concentration of free chlorine which was most rapidly consumed by smx followed by dic and par under neutral conditions the same interference can explain the considerable decrease in the removal of all pharmaceuticals in the continuous electroindirect oxidation system without chloride radicals such as hydroxyl groups are the main oxidants they cannot be transferred to the bulk solution or pharmaceutical molecules due to their extremely high activity the reaction rate of pharmaceuticals is highly dependent on the mass transfer rate which also depends on the dissociated status of the substances which follows the order smx dic par under neutral conditions importantly smx might be formed and coexist with par or dic in complex dimers pt ti electrodes were adopted with a continuous configuration to determine the optimal operating and design conditions the data show that the improved system should focus on the flow rate electrolyte concentration and increasing charge loading this study demonstrates the systematic investigation of the operability of the eo system in removing multiple amine containing pharmaceuticals from wastewater and its integration with knowledge on reactor hydrodynamics will contribute to this field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16706,flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is a promising electrochemical technique for brackish water desalination however there are challenges in estimating the distribution of resistance and energy consumption inside a fcdi system which hinders the optimization of the rate limiting compartment in this study energy consumption of each fcdi component e g flow electrodes membranes and desalination chamber was firstly described by using in situ potential measurement ispm results of this study showed that the energy consumption ec of the flow electrodes dominated under most conditions while an increase in the carbon black content in the flow electrodes could improve the energy efficiency of the electrode component consideration should be given to the contribution of ion exchange membranes iems and the desalination chamber to the ec based on the above analysis system optimization was carried out by introducing iems with relatively low resistance and or packing the desalination chamber with titanium meshes results showed that the voltage driven desalination capability was increased by 39 3 with the ec reduced by 17 5 compared to the control which overcame the tradeoff between the kinetic and energetic efficiencies overall the present work facilitates our understanding of the potential drops across an fcdi system and provides insight to the optimization of system design and operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow electrode deionization in situ measurement potential energy consumption 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is becoming a competitive technology in brackish water desalination because of the merits of simple pretreatment requirement and operation at a low pressure and a low energy cost if designed and maintained appropriately anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 in the cdi process ions migrate under the electrical force and then are stored in the electrical double layers edls of an electrode oppositely charged subsequent regeneration of the saturated electrodes by either short circuiting or reversing the polarity is required to release the stored ions to a brine stream which however leads to an intermittent operation and relatively low flow efficiency hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2019 alternatively flow electrode cdi termed fcdi as one of the important cdi derivatives can solve this shortcoming under the short circuited closed cycle scc operation fig 1 of an fcdi system continuous regeneration of the flow electrodes can be realized by neutralizing the charged carbon particles in a shared recirculation reservoir the scc fcdi can achieve 1 continuous operation by regenerating the electrodes and separating the brine outside an fcdi cell 2 a higher salt removal as a result of the pseudo infinite electrosorption capacity and 3 a high water recovery at a relatively low energy cost thus fcdi has received extensive attention and growing interest jeon et al 2013 luo et al 2020 ma et al 2019b rommerskirchen et al 2020 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 since the flow electrodes are 1 2 orders of magnitude less conductive compared to the static electrodes with a solid liquid interface being created between the flow electrode and the ion exchange membrane iem this inevitably increases the cell resistance and then influences the desalination performance cho et al 2019 liang et al 2017 ma et al 2020b to date a number of studies have been carried out to reduce the fcdi resistance hatzell et al 2015 and park et al 2016 used modified activated carbon to increase the carbon content of the flow electrode to 30 wt the higher carbon content results in a lower internal resistance and improves the salt removal efficiency conductive additives such as redox mediators carbon black cb and carbon nanotubes cnts can be alternatively considered to facilitate the electron transfer in the flow electrodes ma et al 2016 ma et al 2019a tang et al 2019 thu tran et al 2020 wang et al 2019a furthermore yang et al 2019 placed a titanium mesh next to the iem to shorten the charge transport distance which improved the salt removal rate by 76 at 10 wt carbon content a similar concept was also proposed by linnartz et al 2020 in which study flexible membrane electrode assemblies mea was used to solve the electron percolation issue nevertheless it should be noted that most available studies were limited to the analysis of how the overall desalination performance was affected while the cell impedance has been recorded to evaluate the resistance change as a result of the optimization of the electrode design comprehensive insight into the fundamentals e g resistance distribution and charge transfer rate limiting steps is still scarce in scc operation of fcdi a steady state is achievable at the beginning of the test i e minimal water transfer across the iem with the parameters such as the current and desalination rate being temporally constant he et al 2018 rommerskirchen et al 2020 the energy cost contribution of each component can be calculated by estimating the voltage drop across each component rommerskirchen et al 2018 and wang et al 2020 have pioneered the theoretical studies of the voltage drop of the fcdi components the cell geometries and processes can be well described by a process model that assumes the equal distribution of potential over the whole cell nevertheless quantitative results were missing in support of the theoretical potential balance analysis of the fcdi system rommerskirchen et al 2018 while an equivalent film electrode efe model developed by wang et al 2020 was validated experimentally its applicability under different conditions needs to be further checked for example tang and zhou 2020 filled the desalination chamber with ion exchange resin to strengthen the electroconvection and convection at the iem solution interfaces while the efe model may be expanded to include the new findings in fcdi the urgent need for a facile method to quantify the voltage drop and resistance distribution across the system remains especially in regard to the discrepancies and complexities of fcdi ma et al 2020a rommerskirchen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 yang et al 2016b zhang et al 2019 therefore in this study we presented an in situ potential measurement method ispm to characterize the potential gradient and to fractionate the energy cost contribution of each fcdi component during desalination platinum sheet electrodes were inserted into an fcdi cell and divided the cell into five components fig 1 and fig s1 the voltage drop across each component was monitored by a sensor connected to the two adjacent platinum electrodes based on ispm module potentials of an fcdi cell can be in situ determined when the system was operated under a number of conditions such as different current densities flow rates for electrode recirculation and feed supply and conductive additive content corresponding energy cost of each module was further identified by the potential distribution data finally some improvements to fcdi cell were made according to ispm results we changed iems and filled the desalination chamber with titanium meshes to reduce the iems and middle chamber s voltage which significantly enhanced fcdi s desalination performances 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all reagents used in this study were analytical grade and purchased from aladdin industrial co ltd shanghai china unless otherwise stated the ultrapure platinum sheets 40 mm 6 mm 0 05 mm 99 99 were obtained from qinghe tengfeng metal material co ltd hebei china titanium meshes 100 mesh 112 mm 60 mm 200 µm were purchased from kangwei metal wire mesh products co ltd hebei china activated carbon particle size of 33 μm bet surface area of 948 m2 g 1 was obtained from hongsheng carbon chemical co ltd guangzhou china carbon black cb ec600jd lion corporation japan with particle size of 4 8 μm and bet surface area of 1449 m2 g 1 was used as conductive additives fig s2 the feed brackish water containing 2 g l 1 nacl was prepared using milli q water 18 2 mω the flow electrodes were prepared by suspending 8 9 5 g l 1 activated carbon and 0 5 2 g l 1 cb in a 2 g l 1 nacl solution to ensure the wetting of the carbon materials said flow electrodes were agitated overnight before the tests 2 2 experimental setup and operation the fcdi cell and its assembly process in this experiment are shown in fig 1 and fig s1 respectively the fcdi cell comprises a pair of graphitic current collectors 120 mm 90 mm 5 mm for each a middle chamber a pair of ion exchange membranes and a pair of sealing gasket the middle chamber 1 14 ml consists of four pieces of nylon spacer sheets 100 mesh 112 mm 60 mm 0 20 mm and a gasket 0 5 mm thickness which are sandwiched between an anion exchange membrane aem and cation exchange membrane cem df 120 tianwei membrane technology co ltd shandong china the flow paths 4 0 mm wide and 2 mm deep for each on the current collectors are 6 0 cm long except one 5 6 cm flow path near the platinum sheet which allows the insertion of the platinum sheets without touching the flow path fig s1 the contact area between the flow paths and each membrane i e the effective contact area a is 46 8 cm2 an ispm system was appended by inserting four platinum sheets for potential measurement fig 1 the potential probes 1 and 4 were placed above the flow channels with sealing gaskets 112 mm 60 mm 0 2 mm each added between the iem potential probe and the respective graphitic current collector to prevent the platinum probe from contacting the current collector for the tips of 1 and 4 inserted into the cell one side was faced to the flow electrode and the other side directly contacted with the iem the potential probes 2 and 3 were placed on either side of the desalination chamber fig 1a with the inserted tips contacting with the aem and cem respectively adjacent potential probes were connected to a voltage data acquisition system dam 3158a altai technology development co ltd beijing to increase the system desalting efficiency an iem with relatively lower resistance and or desalination chamber filling methods were employed the relevant parameters of the iems used in this study are shown in table 1 for the filling methods 100 mesh titanium meshes were tested as the packing material the concept of desalination chamber packing is to improve the ohmic conductivity of the desalination chamber by using a conductive spacer especially when the salinity of the feed water is desalinated to an extremely low level the nylon spacer sheets were replaced by the titanium meshes in the desalination chamber the working conditions e g a feed flow rate of 2 ml min 1 and a current density of 21 a m 2 of the control and fcdi cell packed by titanium meshes were the same the control fcdi containing tianwei and tak membranes were termed tianwei and tak respectively the corresponding packing cells were abbreviated as tianwei ti tak ti respectively in this study all experiments were conducted in a single pass mode under various operation conditions the detailed operation conditions are shown in table 2 the effluent s conductivity was measured every 10 s by a conductivity meter seven compact mettler toledo switzerland the flow electrodes 80 g in total were continuously recirculated by a peristaltic pump wt 600ca jieheng peristaltic pump co ltd china a constant current was applied to the fcdi cell by an electrochemical workstation chi 660e ch instrument inc shanghai the potential gradient of each module between a pair of potential probes was collected every 5 s by a computer based voltage data acquisition system 2 3 analytical methods and calculations the cell voltage u and current i were recorded by the electrochemical chi workstation all the parameters were calculated based on the steady state data of the last 10 min of a cycle 30 min the parameters including the voltage drop across the flow electrodes δ v e l e the voltage drop across the iems δ v i e m and the voltage drop across the desalination chamber δ v d e s a are calculated as follows eqs 1 3 1 δ v e l e δ v a n δ v c a t δ v 1 a n δ v 4 c a t 2 δ v i e m δ v a e m δ v c e m δ v 1 2 δ v 3 4 3 δ v d e s a δ v 2 3 where δ v a n δ v 1 a n represents the voltage drop between 1 probe and the anode which is contributed by the resistance of the flow anode in comparison δ v c a t δ v 4 c a t describes the voltage drop across the flow cathode δ viem consists of δ v a e m δ v 1 2 and δ v c e m δ v 3 4 δ v a b represents the voltage drop between two potential probes a b 1 2 3 4 the energy consumption ec of each module of the fcdi cell can be further determined as eq 4 4 ec δ v i a j where δ v i represents the voltage drop measured in eqs 1 3 and j the current density the average salt removal rate asrr μmol cm 2 min 1 and specific energy consumption sec j μmol nacl 1 are estimated according to description of wang and lin 2018 zhang et al 2021b eqs 5 6 5 asrr c 0 c e q a 6 sec u a j c 0 c e q where c0 and ce μmol ml 1 are the influent salt concentration and the steady state effluent salt concentration respectively q is the feed flow rate ml min 1 and u and i are the aforementioned cell voltage v and current a at a fixed feed flow rate and current density the asrr of fcdi is almost constant but the voltage may change as such the voltage driven desalination capability dv mg cm 2 min 1 v 1 was used to compare the fcdi desalination rates when the cell was operated under various conditions eq 8 tang and zhou 2020 7 d v a s r r u electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was used to characterize the fcdi cell s overall resistance the eis tests were conducted under an open circuit potential an amplitude signal of 5 mv with a scan frequency from 105 to 10 2 hz was employed in all eis tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 fcdi performance at different current densities and feed flow rates current density and feed flow rate are two important parameters that affect the fcdi desalting efficiency luo et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 optimization of the current density and feed flow rate was first investigated to keep the effluent conductivity in a range of potable level fig 2 fig 2a graphically shows that the effluent conductivity decreases at a given current density a lower feed flow rate resulted in a more obvious conductivity drop fig 2c moreover the linear relationship between the effluent conductivity and the current density or the feed flow rate fig s3a and b indicated that the effluent conductivity could be regulated by these two parameters both the cell voltage and asrr had a positive linear relationship with the current density fig 2b however the high voltage or current density led to a higher energy cost i e the sec increased with an increasing voltage fig s3 thus it is less energy efficient to apply a high current density to reduce the effluent conductivity to a very dilute level though the increase in the feed flow rates can reduce the voltage fig 2d the effluent conductivity was apt to deteriorate as a result of the lower hydraulic retention time based on these results a feed flow rate of 2 ml min 1 and a current density of 21 a m 2 were selected as the optimal parameters for the following illustration of the ispm method unless elsewhere specified 3 2 ispm monitors the voltage distribution in fcdi the electrical components of an fcdi cell are comprised of the flow electrodes a pair of ion exchange membranes and a desalination chamber since they are connected in a series pattern the voltages drop across each unit relates to their specific resistance and the thickness of the module i e a flow channel 200 µm an iem 200 µm and the desalination chamber 400 500 µm while the details of the stern potential in the micropores biesheuvel et al 2011 and the donnan potential between the micropores and macropores biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 are not elaborated in the ispm method the voltages drops defined in this study eqs 1 3 are quite comparable with those proposed in an efe fcdi model wang et al 2020 that is δ v e l e is the potential drop in the flow electrode chamber δ v i e m viem includes both the potential drop across the iems and the donnan potential drops across the two interfaces of the iems and δ v d e s a is the potential drop across the spacer fig 3 a wang et al 2020 in contrast the equivalent series resistance a fitting parameter enabling the convergence of the model is not required in the ispm because theoretically the sum of the spatial voltages contributed by each module accounts for the overall cell potential fig 3a the voltage drop across each fcdi component as a function of time is summarized in fig 3b following significant changes at the start up stage the voltage drops were largely stable over the experimentation specifically δ v a n and δ v c a t slowly decreased whilst δ v a e m and δ v c e m increased fig 3b the electrode voltage change can be attributed to the migration of salts from the influent to the electrode chamber during deionization with the elevated salt concentrations in the electrode chamber facilitating ongoing ion transport i e a lower resistance and a lower potential drop fang et al 2021 ma et al 2019b tang et al 2020 yang et al 2016a the increase in the iem voltage drop probably related to the concentration gradient and the build up of donnan potential drops across the interfaces biesheuvel et al 2011 chen et al 2016 wang et al 2020 it should be noted that the sum of each voltage drop obtained from the ispm system was almost equal to the overall cell voltage fig 3c indicating the potential loss at the platinum surface was minimal compared to δ v e l e viem and vdesa from the results of the potential balance eq 8 the applicability of the ispm method to investigate the potential distribution across an fcdi cell rommerskirchen et al 2019 rommerskirchen et al 2018 is recognized 8 u δ v e l e δ v i e m δ v d e s a where as aforementioned δ v e l e is a sum of the voltage drops of the electrode chambers and current collectors as well as the stern and donnan potentials in the flow electrodes biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 biesheuvel et al 2011 δ v i e m is contributed by the iems voltage drops thus the ec of the fcdi components can be obtained according to eq 4 and are shown in fig 3d the flow electrode chambers δ v e l e contributed to the largest voltage drop and accounted for around 50 of the electrical consumption for desalination this finding is consistent with the results from the efe fcdi model wang et al 2020 which is ascribed to the relatively low conductivity of the electrolyte of the flow electrode compared to the solid state electrodes in cdi and mcdi dennison et al 2014 liang et al 2017 in comparison with the desalination chamber the iems require more energy for ion migration results of this study show that the ispm method is capable of in situ monitoring the voltage and ec distribution in an fcdi cell with the quantitative analysis of these parameters offering the possibility to optimize the system under various operating conditions 3 3 effects of the operating parameters on the fcdi performance the effects of the operating parameters on the fcdi voltage distribution and ec of each component were studied at different current densities feed flow rates electrode recirculation speeds and cb content the ispm method firstly showed how these parameters affected the ec across an fcdi cell fig 4 a shows that the sec increases from 0 017 to 0 069 j µmol 1 with the current density going up while dv remains unchanged fig s3d these findings are generally expected as the tradeoff between the desalination performance and ec which has been reported in previous papers wang et al 2019b wang and lin 2018 2019b zhang et al 2019 time resolved results of the potential drops and ec across the fcdi by the ispm are summarized in fig s4 and fig s5 potential drop and ec of each fcdi component were in a temporally steady state though slight fluctuation was observed probably due to the non static nature of the flow electrodes fig 4b shows that the ec of all fcdi compartments increases significantly with an increase in the current density especially the ec arising from the flow electrodes dominated the total 50 the ec of the desalination chamber was lifted from 4 to 14 fig 4c the increase in ec of the desalination chamber should be attributed to a lower conductivity of the desalinated water under a higher current table s1 at a fixed flow rate of electrode recirculation q 148 ml min 1 current density j 21 a m 2 and cb content 1 5 wt increasing the feed flow rate resulted in a decrease in sec and an increase in dv fig 4d though the influence of the feed flow rate was not significant fig 4d and e which was also verified by eis test results in fig s14 more information could be offered through quantification by using the ispm method the decreased cell voltage at a high feed flow rate resulted in an sec reduction fig s6 the detailed potential drops and ec distribution data are given in the fig s7 and fig s8 respectively specifically the ec values of the desalination chamber and the iems were more sensitive to the feed flow rate fig 4e for the desalination chamber a higher feed flow rate caused a lower concentration reduction at a fixed current density which unsurprisingly decreased the electrical resistance of the desalination chamber yang et al 2016a the lower ec of the iems at a higher feed flow rate relates to the enhanced convection and electroconvection of the iems in contrast the ec of the flow electrodes was generally stable at various feed flow rates with this contribution becoming more dominant at a higher feed flow rate fig 4f this phenomenon should be ascribed to the incapability of the increased feed flow rate to alleviate the ion transport limitation at the iem electrode interface tang and zhou 2020 in addition another reason for ec change over iems should be attributed to a lower conductivity difference between the desalination chamber and the flow electrode at a higher feed flow rate i e a lower concentration reduction which reduces the ions transfer resistance over iems table s1 the flow rate for electrode recirculation is another important parameter in fcdi desalination because of its influence on the charge percolation hatzell et al 2015 rommerskirchen et al 2019 at a fixed feed flow rate q 2 ml min 1 current density j 21 a m 2 and cb content 1 5 wt the recirculation speed varied from 88 to 240 ml min 1 and this caused a decrease in sec and an increase in dv fig 4g the overall cell voltage and sec showed a similar trend to that changing the feed flow rates fig s9 the decreased cell voltage at a high circulation speed resulted in an sec decline time course results of the potential drop and ec at different recirculation speeds are summarized in the fig s10 and fig s11 respectively increasing the recirculation speed led to an overall ec reduction from 0 073 to 0 052 j µmol 1 fig 4h in addition to the previous finding on the importance of the recirculation speed on the charge transfer and ion diffusion in the flow electrode hatzell et al 2015 results of this study indicated that the improved ion migration also worked on the iem and the desalination chamber because there was minimal change in the ec ratios fig 4i the improvement of the fcdi desalination performance at a high flow electrode recirculation speed was also confirmed by assessing the impedance spectroscopy fig s14 overall decreased ec value in each compartment was observed by using the ispm method nevertheless the extra pumping cost should be taken into consideration when the desalination process was carried out under an extremely high recirculation speed the composition of the flow electrodes is critical to the operation of an fcdi cell while there are a number of studies focused on optimizing the composition e g the species and percentages of the active components and conductive additives to reduce the electrode resistance liang et al 2017 ma et al 2020b park et al 2016 tang et al 2019 quantitative analysis of how these changes may affect the flow electrode properties rather than the system performance is still scarce herein we evaluated the impacts of ac and cb ratios on the desalination performance of the flow electrodes at a fixed mass loading 10 wt at a fixed feed flow rate q 2 ml min 1 current density j 21 a m 2 and flow rate of electrode recirculation 148 ml min 1 the effects of cb contents on sec dv are shown in fig 4j and fig s12 s13 increasing the ratio of cb in the flow electrodes resulted in an sec decrease and a dv increase when the cb content was more than 1 5 the improvement of the fcdi performance became marginal fig 4j the fcdi cell s ec decreased with an increase in the cb content fig 4k moreover the distributions of the fcdi modules were further quantificationally described in fig 4l the ec from the flow electrodes decreased steadily from 0 057 j µmol 1 accounting for 60 to 0 027 j µmol 1 accounting for 39 while the ec changes from the iems and desalination chamber were not significant fig 4k their contributions to the overall consumption became more dominant under higher cb concentrations fig 4l when cb content raised from 1 5 to 2 the overall ec decreased slightly while iem s contribution to ec increased from 36 to 43 with that from the flow electrode decreased from 51 to 39 overall increasing the cb content can reduce the fcdi cell s ec which can be attributed to the high conductivity of the flow electrodes the consumption of iems and the desalination chamber dominated the ec when using a high cb content thus optimization strategies should be taken to improve the energy efficiencies of iems and the desalination chamber especially using flow electrodes of low resistance 3 4 optimizing iems and desalination chamber the performance of a membrane desalination system performance is commonly affected by the membrane properties such as electrical resistance water permeation thickness etc linnartz et al 2020 olsson et al 2018 ran et al 2017 wang and lin 2019a besides little attention has been paid to the ec from the desalination chamber which increased significantly as a function of the current density here iems optimization and desalination chamber packing method were employed the results of fcdi desalination with different iems were shown in table s2 and fig 5 the fcdi cell with tak ti had the lowest sec 0 059 j µmol 1 which saved 17 5 ec compared with the cell with tianwei control besides the dv increased from 1 82 to 2 54 µmol cm 2 min 1 v 1 with 39 3 improvement achieved by iems optimization and use of desalination chamber packing method it is reported that there is a tradeoff between the kinetic and energetic efficiencies shin et al 2021 wang and lin 2018 in an fcdi cell a high desalination rate inevitably requires more energy input fang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a in comparison results of this study demonstrated that iems optimization and use of desalination chamber packing method increased the desalination rate whilst decreasing the ec which is of significance to fcdi cell design this phenomenon should be related to the lower ion transport resistance fig s15 based on the previous studies bian et al 2015 it can be concluded that using iems with lower resistances can alleviate the stagnation of ions around the iem packing the desalination chamber with titanium meshes on one hand could reduce the resistance i e the non conductive area of the desalination chamber on the other hand this improves the electroconvection and convection at the iem solution interfaces tang and zhou 2020 ispm results from fig 5b show that the packing method eliminates the ec from the desalination chamber overall using iems of low resistances and packing desalination chamber can effectively improve the fcdi performance with the ispm method being an effective tool for fcdi cell optimization 4 conclusions with regard to the complex nature of an fcdi system involved in mass charge transfer and capacitive ion storage we have demonstrated in this study that the potential distribution and ec of each component including flow electrodes iems and the desalination chamber can be well described by the ispm method results showed that the cb content in the flow electrodes had the most significant impact on ec when the cb content in the flow electrodes reached 2 the ec from the iems and the desalination chamber became dominant to further improve the energy efficiency of fcdi low resistance iems and the desalination chamber packing method were considered use of tak iems and titanium meshes in the desalination chamber resulted in an improvement in both the desalination rate and energy efficiency in general the proposed ispm method facilitates our understanding of the ec from fcdi components and provides insight to the design and optimization

16706,flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is a promising electrochemical technique for brackish water desalination however there are challenges in estimating the distribution of resistance and energy consumption inside a fcdi system which hinders the optimization of the rate limiting compartment in this study energy consumption of each fcdi component e g flow electrodes membranes and desalination chamber was firstly described by using in situ potential measurement ispm results of this study showed that the energy consumption ec of the flow electrodes dominated under most conditions while an increase in the carbon black content in the flow electrodes could improve the energy efficiency of the electrode component consideration should be given to the contribution of ion exchange membranes iems and the desalination chamber to the ec based on the above analysis system optimization was carried out by introducing iems with relatively low resistance and or packing the desalination chamber with titanium meshes results showed that the voltage driven desalination capability was increased by 39 3 with the ec reduced by 17 5 compared to the control which overcame the tradeoff between the kinetic and energetic efficiencies overall the present work facilitates our understanding of the potential drops across an fcdi system and provides insight to the optimization of system design and operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow electrode deionization in situ measurement potential energy consumption 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is becoming a competitive technology in brackish water desalination because of the merits of simple pretreatment requirement and operation at a low pressure and a low energy cost if designed and maintained appropriately anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 in the cdi process ions migrate under the electrical force and then are stored in the electrical double layers edls of an electrode oppositely charged subsequent regeneration of the saturated electrodes by either short circuiting or reversing the polarity is required to release the stored ions to a brine stream which however leads to an intermittent operation and relatively low flow efficiency hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2019 alternatively flow electrode cdi termed fcdi as one of the important cdi derivatives can solve this shortcoming under the short circuited closed cycle scc operation fig 1 of an fcdi system continuous regeneration of the flow electrodes can be realized by neutralizing the charged carbon particles in a shared recirculation reservoir the scc fcdi can achieve 1 continuous operation by regenerating the electrodes and separating the brine outside an fcdi cell 2 a higher salt removal as a result of the pseudo infinite electrosorption capacity and 3 a high water recovery at a relatively low energy cost thus fcdi has received extensive attention and growing interest jeon et al 2013 luo et al 2020 ma et al 2019b rommerskirchen et al 2020 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 since the flow electrodes are 1 2 orders of magnitude less conductive compared to the static electrodes with a solid liquid interface being created between the flow electrode and the ion exchange membrane iem this inevitably increases the cell resistance and then influences the desalination performance cho et al 2019 liang et al 2017 ma et al 2020b to date a number of studies have been carried out to reduce the fcdi resistance hatzell et al 2015 and park et al 2016 used modified activated carbon to increase the carbon content of the flow electrode to 30 wt the higher carbon content results in a lower internal resistance and improves the salt removal efficiency conductive additives such as redox mediators carbon black cb and carbon nanotubes cnts can be alternatively considered to facilitate the electron transfer in the flow electrodes ma et al 2016 ma et al 2019a tang et al 2019 thu tran et al 2020 wang et al 2019a furthermore yang et al 2019 placed a titanium mesh next to the iem to shorten the charge transport distance which improved the salt removal rate by 76 at 10 wt carbon content a similar concept was also proposed by linnartz et al 2020 in which study flexible membrane electrode assemblies mea was used to solve the electron percolation issue nevertheless it should be noted that most available studies were limited to the analysis of how the overall desalination performance was affected while the cell impedance has been recorded to evaluate the resistance change as a result of the optimization of the electrode design comprehensive insight into the fundamentals e g resistance distribution and charge transfer rate limiting steps is still scarce in scc operation of fcdi a steady state is achievable at the beginning of the test i e minimal water transfer across the iem with the parameters such as the current and desalination rate being temporally constant he et al 2018 rommerskirchen et al 2020 the energy cost contribution of each component can be calculated by estimating the voltage drop across each component rommerskirchen et al 2018 and wang et al 2020 have pioneered the theoretical studies of the voltage drop of the fcdi components the cell geometries and processes can be well described by a process model that assumes the equal distribution of potential over the whole cell nevertheless quantitative results were missing in support of the theoretical potential balance analysis of the fcdi system rommerskirchen et al 2018 while an equivalent film electrode efe model developed by wang et al 2020 was validated experimentally its applicability under different conditions needs to be further checked for example tang and zhou 2020 filled the desalination chamber with ion exchange resin to strengthen the electroconvection and convection at the iem solution interfaces while the efe model may be expanded to include the new findings in fcdi the urgent need for a facile method to quantify the voltage drop and resistance distribution across the system remains especially in regard to the discrepancies and complexities of fcdi ma et al 2020a rommerskirchen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 yang et al 2016b zhang et al 2019 therefore in this study we presented an in situ potential measurement method ispm to characterize the potential gradient and to fractionate the energy cost contribution of each fcdi component during desalination platinum sheet electrodes were inserted into an fcdi cell and divided the cell into five components fig 1 and fig s1 the voltage drop across each component was monitored by a sensor connected to the two adjacent platinum electrodes based on ispm module potentials of an fcdi cell can be in situ determined when the system was operated under a number of conditions such as different current densities flow rates for electrode recirculation and feed supply and conductive additive content corresponding energy cost of each module was further identified by the potential distribution data finally some improvements to fcdi cell were made according to ispm results we changed iems and filled the desalination chamber with titanium meshes to reduce the iems and middle chamber s voltage which significantly enhanced fcdi s desalination performances 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all reagents used in this study were analytical grade and purchased from aladdin industrial co ltd shanghai china unless otherwise stated the ultrapure platinum sheets 40 mm 6 mm 0 05 mm 99 99 were obtained from qinghe tengfeng metal material co ltd hebei china titanium meshes 100 mesh 112 mm 60 mm 200 µm were purchased from kangwei metal wire mesh products co ltd hebei china activated carbon particle size of 33 μm bet surface area of 948 m2 g 1 was obtained from hongsheng carbon chemical co ltd guangzhou china carbon black cb ec600jd lion corporation japan with particle size of 4 8 μm and bet surface area of 1449 m2 g 1 was used as conductive additives fig s2 the feed brackish water containing 2 g l 1 nacl was prepared using milli q water 18 2 mω the flow electrodes were prepared by suspending 8 9 5 g l 1 activated carbon and 0 5 2 g l 1 cb in a 2 g l 1 nacl solution to ensure the wetting of the carbon materials said flow electrodes were agitated overnight before the tests 2 2 experimental setup and operation the fcdi cell and its assembly process in this experiment are shown in fig 1 and fig s1 respectively the fcdi cell comprises a pair of graphitic current collectors 120 mm 90 mm 5 mm for each a middle chamber a pair of ion exchange membranes and a pair of sealing gasket the middle chamber 1 14 ml consists of four pieces of nylon spacer sheets 100 mesh 112 mm 60 mm 0 20 mm and a gasket 0 5 mm thickness which are sandwiched between an anion exchange membrane aem and cation exchange membrane cem df 120 tianwei membrane technology co ltd shandong china the flow paths 4 0 mm wide and 2 mm deep for each on the current collectors are 6 0 cm long except one 5 6 cm flow path near the platinum sheet which allows the insertion of the platinum sheets without touching the flow path fig s1 the contact area between the flow paths and each membrane i e the effective contact area a is 46 8 cm2 an ispm system was appended by inserting four platinum sheets for potential measurement fig 1 the potential probes 1 and 4 were placed above the flow channels with sealing gaskets 112 mm 60 mm 0 2 mm each added between the iem potential probe and the respective graphitic current collector to prevent the platinum probe from contacting the current collector for the tips of 1 and 4 inserted into the cell one side was faced to the flow electrode and the other side directly contacted with the iem the potential probes 2 and 3 were placed on either side of the desalination chamber fig 1a with the inserted tips contacting with the aem and cem respectively adjacent potential probes were connected to a voltage data acquisition system dam 3158a altai technology development co ltd beijing to increase the system desalting efficiency an iem with relatively lower resistance and or desalination chamber filling methods were employed the relevant parameters of the iems used in this study are shown in table 1 for the filling methods 100 mesh titanium meshes were tested as the packing material the concept of desalination chamber packing is to improve the ohmic conductivity of the desalination chamber by using a conductive spacer especially when the salinity of the feed water is desalinated to an extremely low level the nylon spacer sheets were replaced by the titanium meshes in the desalination chamber the working conditions e g a feed flow rate of 2 ml min 1 and a current density of 21 a m 2 of the control and fcdi cell packed by titanium meshes were the same the control fcdi containing tianwei and tak membranes were termed tianwei and tak respectively the corresponding packing cells were abbreviated as tianwei ti tak ti respectively in this study all experiments were conducted in a single pass mode under various operation conditions the detailed operation conditions are shown in table 2 the effluent s conductivity was measured every 10 s by a conductivity meter seven compact mettler toledo switzerland the flow electrodes 80 g in total were continuously recirculated by a peristaltic pump wt 600ca jieheng peristaltic pump co ltd china a constant current was applied to the fcdi cell by an electrochemical workstation chi 660e ch instrument inc shanghai the potential gradient of each module between a pair of potential probes was collected every 5 s by a computer based voltage data acquisition system 2 3 analytical methods and calculations the cell voltage u and current i were recorded by the electrochemical chi workstation all the parameters were calculated based on the steady state data of the last 10 min of a cycle 30 min the parameters including the voltage drop across the flow electrodes δ v e l e the voltage drop across the iems δ v i e m and the voltage drop across the desalination chamber δ v d e s a are calculated as follows eqs 1 3 1 δ v e l e δ v a n δ v c a t δ v 1 a n δ v 4 c a t 2 δ v i e m δ v a e m δ v c e m δ v 1 2 δ v 3 4 3 δ v d e s a δ v 2 3 where δ v a n δ v 1 a n represents the voltage drop between 1 probe and the anode which is contributed by the resistance of the flow anode in comparison δ v c a t δ v 4 c a t describes the voltage drop across the flow cathode δ viem consists of δ v a e m δ v 1 2 and δ v c e m δ v 3 4 δ v a b represents the voltage drop between two potential probes a b 1 2 3 4 the energy consumption ec of each module of the fcdi cell can be further determined as eq 4 4 ec δ v i a j where δ v i represents the voltage drop measured in eqs 1 3 and j the current density the average salt removal rate asrr μmol cm 2 min 1 and specific energy consumption sec j μmol nacl 1 are estimated according to description of wang and lin 2018 zhang et al 2021b eqs 5 6 5 asrr c 0 c e q a 6 sec u a j c 0 c e q where c0 and ce μmol ml 1 are the influent salt concentration and the steady state effluent salt concentration respectively q is the feed flow rate ml min 1 and u and i are the aforementioned cell voltage v and current a at a fixed feed flow rate and current density the asrr of fcdi is almost constant but the voltage may change as such the voltage driven desalination capability dv mg cm 2 min 1 v 1 was used to compare the fcdi desalination rates when the cell was operated under various conditions eq 8 tang and zhou 2020 7 d v a s r r u electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was used to characterize the fcdi cell s overall resistance the eis tests were conducted under an open circuit potential an amplitude signal of 5 mv with a scan frequency from 105 to 10 2 hz was employed in all eis tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 fcdi performance at different current densities and feed flow rates current density and feed flow rate are two important parameters that affect the fcdi desalting efficiency luo et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 optimization of the current density and feed flow rate was first investigated to keep the effluent conductivity in a range of potable level fig 2 fig 2a graphically shows that the effluent conductivity decreases at a given current density a lower feed flow rate resulted in a more obvious conductivity drop fig 2c moreover the linear relationship between the effluent conductivity and the current density or the feed flow rate fig s3a and b indicated that the effluent conductivity could be regulated by these two parameters both the cell voltage and asrr had a positive linear relationship with the current density fig 2b however the high voltage or current density led to a higher energy cost i e the sec increased with an increasing voltage fig s3 thus it is less energy efficient to apply a high current density to reduce the effluent conductivity to a very dilute level though the increase in the feed flow rates can reduce the voltage fig 2d the effluent conductivity was apt to deteriorate as a result of the lower hydraulic retention time based on these results a feed flow rate of 2 ml min 1 and a current density of 21 a m 2 were selected as the optimal parameters for the following illustration of the ispm method unless elsewhere specified 3 2 ispm monitors the voltage distribution in fcdi the electrical components of an fcdi cell are comprised of the flow electrodes a pair of ion exchange membranes and a desalination chamber since they are connected in a series pattern the voltages drop across each unit relates to their specific resistance and the thickness of the module i e a flow channel 200 µm an iem 200 µm and the desalination chamber 400 500 µm while the details of the stern potential in the micropores biesheuvel et al 2011 and the donnan potential between the micropores and macropores biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 are not elaborated in the ispm method the voltages drops defined in this study eqs 1 3 are quite comparable with those proposed in an efe fcdi model wang et al 2020 that is δ v e l e is the potential drop in the flow electrode chamber δ v i e m viem includes both the potential drop across the iems and the donnan potential drops across the two interfaces of the iems and δ v d e s a is the potential drop across the spacer fig 3 a wang et al 2020 in contrast the equivalent series resistance a fitting parameter enabling the convergence of the model is not required in the ispm because theoretically the sum of the spatial voltages contributed by each module accounts for the overall cell potential fig 3a the voltage drop across each fcdi component as a function of time is summarized in fig 3b following significant changes at the start up stage the voltage drops were largely stable over the experimentation specifically δ v a n and δ v c a t slowly decreased whilst δ v a e m and δ v c e m increased fig 3b the electrode voltage change can be attributed to the migration of salts from the influent to the electrode chamber during deionization with the elevated salt concentrations in the electrode chamber facilitating ongoing ion transport i e a lower resistance and a lower potential drop fang et al 2021 ma et al 2019b tang et al 2020 yang et al 2016a the increase in the iem voltage drop probably related to the concentration gradient and the build up of donnan potential drops across the interfaces biesheuvel et al 2011 chen et al 2016 wang et al 2020 it should be noted that the sum of each voltage drop obtained from the ispm system was almost equal to the overall cell voltage fig 3c indicating the potential loss at the platinum surface was minimal compared to δ v e l e viem and vdesa from the results of the potential balance eq 8 the applicability of the ispm method to investigate the potential distribution across an fcdi cell rommerskirchen et al 2019 rommerskirchen et al 2018 is recognized 8 u δ v e l e δ v i e m δ v d e s a where as aforementioned δ v e l e is a sum of the voltage drops of the electrode chambers and current collectors as well as the stern and donnan potentials in the flow electrodes biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 biesheuvel et al 2011 δ v i e m is contributed by the iems voltage drops thus the ec of the fcdi components can be obtained according to eq 4 and are shown in fig 3d the flow electrode chambers δ v e l e contributed to the largest voltage drop and accounted for around 50 of the electrical consumption for desalination this finding is consistent with the results from the efe fcdi model wang et al 2020 which is ascribed to the relatively low conductivity of the electrolyte of the flow electrode compared to the solid state electrodes in cdi and mcdi dennison et al 2014 liang et al 2017 in comparison with the desalination chamber the iems require more energy for ion migration results of this study show that the ispm method is capable of in situ monitoring the voltage and ec distribution in an fcdi cell with the quantitative analysis of these parameters offering the possibility to optimize the system under various operating conditions 3 3 effects of the operating parameters on the fcdi performance the effects of the operating parameters on the fcdi voltage distribution and ec of each component were studied at different current densities feed flow rates electrode recirculation speeds and cb content the ispm method firstly showed how these parameters affected the ec across an fcdi cell fig 4 a shows that the sec increases from 0 017 to 0 069 j µmol 1 with the current density going up while dv remains unchanged fig s3d these findings are generally expected as the tradeoff between the desalination performance and ec which has been reported in previous papers wang et al 2019b wang and lin 2018 2019b zhang et al 2019 time resolved results of the potential drops and ec across the fcdi by the ispm are summarized in fig s4 and fig s5 potential drop and ec of each fcdi component were in a temporally steady state though slight fluctuation was observed probably due to the non static nature of the flow electrodes fig 4b shows that the ec of all fcdi compartments increases significantly with an increase in the current density especially the ec arising from the flow electrodes dominated the total 50 the ec of the desalination chamber was lifted from 4 to 14 fig 4c the increase in ec of the desalination chamber should be attributed to a lower conductivity of the desalinated water under a higher current table s1 at a fixed flow rate of electrode recirculation q 148 ml min 1 current density j 21 a m 2 and cb content 1 5 wt increasing the feed flow rate resulted in a decrease in sec and an increase in dv fig 4d though the influence of the feed flow rate was not significant fig 4d and e which was also verified by eis test results in fig s14 more information could be offered through quantification by using the ispm method the decreased cell voltage at a high feed flow rate resulted in an sec reduction fig s6 the detailed potential drops and ec distribution data are given in the fig s7 and fig s8 respectively specifically the ec values of the desalination chamber and the iems were more sensitive to the feed flow rate fig 4e for the desalination chamber a higher feed flow rate caused a lower concentration reduction at a fixed current density which unsurprisingly decreased the electrical resistance of the desalination chamber yang et al 2016a the lower ec of the iems at a higher feed flow rate relates to the enhanced convection and electroconvection of the iems in contrast the ec of the flow electrodes was generally stable at various feed flow rates with this contribution becoming more dominant at a higher feed flow rate fig 4f this phenomenon should be ascribed to the incapability of the increased feed flow rate to alleviate the ion transport limitation at the iem electrode interface tang and zhou 2020 in addition another reason for ec change over iems should be attributed to a lower conductivity difference between the desalination chamber and the flow electrode at a higher feed flow rate i e a lower concentration reduction which reduces the ions transfer resistance over iems table s1 the flow rate for electrode recirculation is another important parameter in fcdi desalination because of its influence on the charge percolation hatzell et al 2015 rommerskirchen et al 2019 at a fixed feed flow rate q 2 ml min 1 current density j 21 a m 2 and cb content 1 5 wt the recirculation speed varied from 88 to 240 ml min 1 and this caused a decrease in sec and an increase in dv fig 4g the overall cell voltage and sec showed a similar trend to that changing the feed flow rates fig s9 the decreased cell voltage at a high circulation speed resulted in an sec decline time course results of the potential drop and ec at different recirculation speeds are summarized in the fig s10 and fig s11 respectively increasing the recirculation speed led to an overall ec reduction from 0 073 to 0 052 j µmol 1 fig 4h in addition to the previous finding on the importance of the recirculation speed on the charge transfer and ion diffusion in the flow electrode hatzell et al 2015 results of this study indicated that the improved ion migration also worked on the iem and the desalination chamber because there was minimal change in the ec ratios fig 4i the improvement of the fcdi desalination performance at a high flow electrode recirculation speed was also confirmed by assessing the impedance spectroscopy fig s14 overall decreased ec value in each compartment was observed by using the ispm method nevertheless the extra pumping cost should be taken into consideration when the desalination process was carried out under an extremely high recirculation speed the composition of the flow electrodes is critical to the operation of an fcdi cell while there are a number of studies focused on optimizing the composition e g the species and percentages of the active components and conductive additives to reduce the electrode resistance liang et al 2017 ma et al 2020b park et al 2016 tang et al 2019 quantitative analysis of how these changes may affect the flow electrode properties rather than the system performance is still scarce herein we evaluated the impacts of ac and cb ratios on the desalination performance of the flow electrodes at a fixed mass loading 10 wt at a fixed feed flow rate q 2 ml min 1 current density j 21 a m 2 and flow rate of electrode recirculation 148 ml min 1 the effects of cb contents on sec dv are shown in fig 4j and fig s12 s13 increasing the ratio of cb in the flow electrodes resulted in an sec decrease and a dv increase when the cb content was more than 1 5 the improvement of the fcdi performance became marginal fig 4j the fcdi cell s ec decreased with an increase in the cb content fig 4k moreover the distributions of the fcdi modules were further quantificationally described in fig 4l the ec from the flow electrodes decreased steadily from 0 057 j µmol 1 accounting for 60 to 0 027 j µmol 1 accounting for 39 while the ec changes from the iems and desalination chamber were not significant fig 4k their contributions to the overall consumption became more dominant under higher cb concentrations fig 4l when cb content raised from 1 5 to 2 the overall ec decreased slightly while iem s contribution to ec increased from 36 to 43 with that from the flow electrode decreased from 51 to 39 overall increasing the cb content can reduce the fcdi cell s ec which can be attributed to the high conductivity of the flow electrodes the consumption of iems and the desalination chamber dominated the ec when using a high cb content thus optimization strategies should be taken to improve the energy efficiencies of iems and the desalination chamber especially using flow electrodes of low resistance 3 4 optimizing iems and desalination chamber the performance of a membrane desalination system performance is commonly affected by the membrane properties such as electrical resistance water permeation thickness etc linnartz et al 2020 olsson et al 2018 ran et al 2017 wang and lin 2019a besides little attention has been paid to the ec from the desalination chamber which increased significantly as a function of the current density here iems optimization and desalination chamber packing method were employed the results of fcdi desalination with different iems were shown in table s2 and fig 5 the fcdi cell with tak ti had the lowest sec 0 059 j µmol 1 which saved 17 5 ec compared with the cell with tianwei control besides the dv increased from 1 82 to 2 54 µmol cm 2 min 1 v 1 with 39 3 improvement achieved by iems optimization and use of desalination chamber packing method it is reported that there is a tradeoff between the kinetic and energetic efficiencies shin et al 2021 wang and lin 2018 in an fcdi cell a high desalination rate inevitably requires more energy input fang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a in comparison results of this study demonstrated that iems optimization and use of desalination chamber packing method increased the desalination rate whilst decreasing the ec which is of significance to fcdi cell design this phenomenon should be related to the lower ion transport resistance fig s15 based on the previous studies bian et al 2015 it can be concluded that using iems with lower resistances can alleviate the stagnation of ions around the iem packing the desalination chamber with titanium meshes on one hand could reduce the resistance i e the non conductive area of the desalination chamber on the other hand this improves the electroconvection and convection at the iem solution interfaces tang and zhou 2020 ispm results from fig 5b show that the packing method eliminates the ec from the desalination chamber overall using iems of low resistances and packing desalination chamber can effectively improve the fcdi performance with the ispm method being an effective tool for fcdi cell optimization 4 conclusions with regard to the complex nature of an fcdi system involved in mass charge transfer and capacitive ion storage we have demonstrated in this study that the potential distribution and ec of each component including flow electrodes iems and the desalination chamber can be well described by the ispm method results showed that the cb content in the flow electrodes had the most significant impact on ec when the cb content in the flow electrodes reached 2 the ec from the iems and the desalination chamber became dominant to further improve the energy efficiency of fcdi low resistance iems and the desalination chamber packing method were considered use of tak iems and titanium meshes in the desalination chamber resulted in an improvement in both the desalination rate and energy efficiency in general the proposed ispm method facilitates our understanding of the ec from fcdi components and provides insight to the design and optimization

16707,to date eutrophication becomes a great concern of vulnerable aquatic systems dissolved organic phosphorus dop discharged from wastewater treatment plant wwtp holds a large source of phosphorus in receiving water however due to the complexity of dop their variation and fate in wwtp remain unknown at the molecular level and are always overlooked here the variation of dop in a wwtp was uncovered via fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms results show that 95 of dop in the influent could be removed by the secondary biological treatment processes the removed dop species were mainly lipids with the molecular characteristics of low oxygen content low unsaturation and low aromaticity meanwhile during biological treatments some new dop species especially lignin carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules cram that possessed high oxygen content high unsaturation and high aromaticity were produced and released into the secondary effluent in the subsequent tertiary treatment coagulation by aluminum salt tended to remove high molecular weight and high oxygen content dop species in the secondary effluent which was complementary to the biological treatment however the sand filter usually retained microorganisms which would result in the generation of new dop species in this process during the final ultraviolet disinfection process dop was effectively mineralized to phosphate especially the species with high molecular weight and highly unsaturated aromatic dop species e g lignin cram and tannin which had higher uv absorbance the revealed variation of dop in wwtp is beneficial to optimize the treatment processes to enhance the removal of dop graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic phosphorous dop ft icr ms wastewater treatment plant biological treatment tertiary treatment 1 introduction the large amount of phosphorous discharged from wastewater treatment plant wwtp increases the risk of eutrophication to environmental sensitive areas with more and more strict phosphorus discharge limits have been implemented efficient phosphorous removal from wastewater has become one of the most important tasks in wwtp clark et al 2010 during a typical wwtp with advanced nutrients removal processes most of the inorganic phosphorus in wastewater can be removed while dissolved organic phosphorous dop remains and accounts for 26 81 of dissolved total phosphorous dtp in the effluents galvagno et al 2016 liu et al 2011 qin et al 2015 in addition over 70 of the residual dop in wastewater effluent is found to be bioavailable gu et al 2014 qin et al 2015 moreover mineralization of dop into phosphate pi will further broaden the bioavailability of phosphorus pools in vulnerable aquatic systems hence watershed protection plans may therefore have to consider the contribution of dop from wwtp to the phosphorous pools and assess its potential risk a few works have investigated the content and bioavailability of dop in wwtp effluent qin et al 2015 previous studies have revealed the molecular variation of dissolved organic nitrogen don to various operational parameters e g solids retention time and temperature in wastewater treatment which is conducive to optimize these parameters to reduce the effluent don level hu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 however changes in the molecular composition of dop during the wastewater treatment processes have not been clarified clearly yet thus greatly limiting the feasibility of diminishing dop production and reducing dop residues in the effluents through processes optimization however due to the complex composition of dop traditional methods are currently not adequate to characterize dop from a molecular level persulfate digestion followed by molybdenum blue photometric method can only be used to measure the contents of dtp phosphate and dop apha 2005 enzymatic hydrolysis technology can be applied to characterize the extent of bioavailability of dop species but their structure and composition cannot be obtained majed et al 2012 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr provides a description of all phosphorus species but it gives limited molecular composition information and shares a relatively high detection limit compared to other chemical methods worsfold et al 2008 pre methylation of phosphonates and characterized using lc ms ms allows the observation of diverse chemical transformations in authentic water samples wang et al 2019 yet complicated pre treatment processes are needed currently the comprehensive molecular basis of dop remains poorly elucidated fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is a non targeted mass spectrometry with ultrahigh resolution sleighter and hatcher 2007 it does not need to separate ions of different mass to charge ratios m z but can measure the m z and abundance of all ions simultaneously and give detailed information of various complex compositions with high analysis sensitivities and low detection limits marshall et al 1998 hence the non targeted ft icr ms does not require complicated separation and pre treatment processes and can provide novel insights into the detailed chemistry of organic matters based on their accurate molecular formulas which assists to interpret molecular patterns across systems such as chemical and biological processes and makes it possible to reveal the variation of mixed organic formulas in aquatic and terrestrial systems from a molecular level kujawinski et al 2004 li et al 2018 sleighter et al 2010 a few researches focused on revealing sulfur and nitrogen containing molecular formulas of effluent organic matter in wwtp through ft icr ms gonsior et al 2011 mesfioui et al 2012 in which molecular insight and reactivity of these formulas had been elucidated hence it is expected that ft icr ms is powerful to characterize the complex and low level of dop in wwtp however it has not been surveyed systematically yet in this study we attempt to quantitatively and molecularly investigate the variation and fate of dop in wwtp for this purpose samples were collected throughout the wastewater stream to examine how specific treatment processes recast the molecular composition of dop the changes of dop content in biological and tertiary treatment processes were assessed in addition the chemical diversity and structural variation of dop during wwtp treatment processes were elucidated via ft icr ms a comprehensive understanding on how wastewater treatment processes affect dop molecular compositions will favor us to reduce effluent dop as a potential phosphate source that enters the effluent receiving waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection wastewater samples were harvested along with the treatment units of wangtang wwtp in hefei china the treatment processes used in this plant and 7 sampling sites are illustrated in fig s1 supporting information

carbon doc concentration was measured by a total carbon analyzer multi n c 2100 jena germany the uv vis absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan suva254 was calculated as the normalization of absorbance at 254 nm by doc and e2 e3 the ratio of absorbance at 254 nm and 365 nm was also calculated the levels of phosphate and dop were measured following the standard method apha 2005 the samples collected along treatment units were subjected to 3 dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem fluorescence analysis via a fluorescence spectrometer duetta horiba japan a series of emission scans 300 600 nm with 1 nm increments were collected over excitation wavelengths ranging from 250 to 500 nm by 5 nm increments the parallel factor analysis parafac was carried out in matlab r2019a with the domfluor toolbox to determine the fluorescent components among samples hence the maximum fluorescence intensities fmax of each component could be calculated to quantitatively assess the fluorescence differences of various identified components 2 3 sample pretreatment and ft icr ms analysis dop was extracted and condensed by solid phase extraction spe method using agilent bond elute ppl cartridge 500 mg 6 ml kellerman et al 2015 while the blank was prepared with milli q water using the same treatment processes before use ppl cartridge was cleaned with 20 ml hplc grade methanol and balanced with 20 ml acidified milli q water ph 2 to increase the extraction efficiency 100 ml sample was acidified to ph 2 with hcl and then passed through the rinsed ppl cartridge the cartridge was then rinsed with 20 ml acidified milli q water to remove salt after completely dried in a nitrogen atmosphere the samples were eluted with 5 ml methanol into acid washed glass vials and kept in dark at 20 c prior to ft icr ms analysis the dop molecular compositions were analyzed using a 7 t ft icr ms solarix bruker daltonik bremen germany which was operated with an electrospray ionization esi source in negative mode a same detection limit according to relative signal intensity scale was applied to facilitate the maximum comparability among samples riedel and dittmar 2014 the raw data was processed using bruker daltonics data analysis 4 0 and matlab routines fu et al 2020 in which the mass spectra among 100 1000 da were collected internal calibration was performed with a known homologous series of naturally present fatty acids 259 755 m z as calibrants which were in relatively high abundances in dissolved organic matter sleighter et al 2008 after internal recalibration only peaks that were detected in both duplicate samples were further analyzed aiming to reduce false positive data sleighter et al 2008 phungsai et al 2019 absolute abundance was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the peak intensity of effective formulas in both duplicate samples relative abundance was calculated as the ratio of measured intensity of an ion with the most abundant ion whose relative abundance was determined as 100 prior to formula assignments peaks were identified in mass spectra within 200 800 m z which aligns with the mass range of internal calibration s n 5 were considered as potential target molecules while in negative mode m z was converted to nominal masses by the addition of a proton according to the dictionary of natural products dnp mass spectral database molecules with a mass range lower than 1000 da had 6 p atoms maximum and normally p 3 in natural molecules kind and fiehn 2007 kujawinski and behn 2006 hence potential formulas were composed of c1 100h1 250o1 100n0 3s0 2p0 2 and obeyed the nitrogen rule formulas assignments were considered valid if the mass error was 1 ppm by the best fit following by double check with seven golden rules kind and fiehn 2007 because all the detected ions were singly charged for esi negative esi henceforth each ion was denoted by its exact mass instead of its mass to charge ratio m z average mass weight was calculated by the relative abundance weighted average according to the identified formula samples were presented using van krevelen diagrams in which the h c ratio for each formula was plotted versus its o c ratio boundaries of regions corresponding to seven classes of compounds in van krevelen diagrams were established on the basis of stoichiometric ranges classified as follow lipids h c 1 5 2 0 o c 0 0 3 aliphatic proteins h c 1 5 2 2 o c 0 3 0 67 lignin carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules cram h c 0 7 1 5 o c 0 1 0 67 carbohydrates h c 1 5 2 4 o c 0 67 1 2

was calculated as follow dbe 1 ½ 2c h n p phungsai et al 2019 stenson et al 2003 furthermore kendrick mass defect kmd plots on the ch2 scale were applied to differentiate homologous series in dop according to previous reported method hughey et al 2001 qian et al 2001 3 results 3 1 profiles of dissolved organic matter during wastewater treatment the doc concentrations of the samples collected in all treatment units are shown in fig s2a it decreased by around 57 3 from 11 77 mg c l in the influent to 5 03 mg c l in anaerobically treated sample in the anoxic unit the doc further decreased to 4 50 mg c l however during the oxic unit the doc inversely increased to 5 92 mg c l in addition after decline of 1 30 mg c l in secondary clarifier the changes in doc concentration aroused by the subsequent sand filter and uv disinfection were negligible dynamic variation of the spectral characteristics was monitored alongside the treatment processes changes in suva254 e2 e3 could provide an insight into the variation of the composition of dissolved organic matter dom during the treatments fig s2b as a main indicator of dom aromaticity the suva254 value increased from 1 55 l mg c 1 m 1 in the influent to 4 22 l mg c 1 m 1 in the anoxic treatment unit and then it decreased to the lowest value in the oxic tank with 1 50 l mg c 1 m 1 this indicates that humification degree of the organic compositions in wastewater increased from wwtp influent to anoxic tank but decreased sharply in oxic tank during tertiary treatment processes the suva254 stayed steadily around 2 01 l mg c 1 m 1 fig s2b the e2 e3 gradually increased from 3 23 in the influent to 5 05 in the oxic treatment unit fig s2b implying that the average molecular weight of dom in wastewater gradually decreased during the secondary biological treatment process because the e2 e3 value is inversely related to the molecular weight of dom maizel and remucal 2017 in secondary clarifier the e2 e3 further increased to 5 10 fig s2b reflecting the preferential removal of higher molecular weight dom by aluminum salt coagulation however a slight decrease in e2 e3 value to 4 83 was observed in sand filter possibly due to the production of high molecular weight biomolecules by microorganisms retained in sand filter fig s2b in the final uv disinfection e2 e3 value recovered to 5 18 fig s2b reflecting that uv could decompose the dom with higher molecular weight preferentially eem fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parafac divided the complex fluorescence matrices into four fluorescent components as shown in figs s3 and s4 the parafac model with 2 6 components was computed here and 4 components were determined as the best fit based on residual analysis and split half analysis stedmon and bro 2008 the maximum fluorescence intensities of these components were given in fig s4b which were identified as protein and tryptophan like c1 determann et al 1994 determann et al 1996 humic acid like c2 stedmon et al 2003 fulvic acid like c3 tang et al 2020 and humic acid like c4 kellerman et al 2015 in the secondary biological treatment processes the fluorescence intensity of the protein like substance c1 was sharply decreased while those of humic related substances c2 c3 c4 declined mildly fig s4b suggesting that the protein like substances were more bioavailable than the humic related substances previous studies also reported that protein like substances were bioavailable but fulvic like and humic like substances were generally refractory compounds hu et al 2018 during the tertiary treatment processes the fluorescence intensity of the protein like substance c1 fluctuated while the fluorescence intensities of the humic like substances c2 c3 c4 remained relatively stable fig s4b which was consistent with the relative stable aromaticity during tertiary treatment processes 3 2 changes in dop during wastewater treatment 3 2 1 variation of dop contents the changes of phosphorus in various forms during wastewater treatment are presented in fig 1 the phosphate occupied 69 of the dtp in the wastewater influent while dop was about 31 of the dtp in the anaerobic unit nearly 56 of dop and 18 of dtp were removed hereafter dop was further removed in the anoxic and oxic treatment units where about 88 and 95 of dop were removed respectively simultaneously about 89 and 93 of dtp were removed in the anoxic and oxic units comparing to dop the content of doc was inversely increased during oxic treatment process fig s2a indicating that different microbial activities might be involved in the utilization and mineralization of dop and doc colman et al 2005 in the settling tank the contents of dtp and dop decreased to 0 14 and 0 04 mg l fig 1 in the sand filter process dtp further decreased to the lowest value of 0 07 mg l but dop increased slightly to 0 05 mg l possibly because that the microorganisms retained by sand filter produced dop before discharge wastewater was disinfected via uv technology although dtp was not removed in this disinfection process the content of dop decreased significantly from 0 04 mg l to 0 01 mg l fig 1 in contrast to dop the content of doc was decreased by coagulation in sedimentation tank but was stable during uv disinfection fig s2a this suggests that doc might be more difficult to be mineralized by uv disinfection 3 2 2 variation of dop molecular weights according to the identified effective formula from the mass spectra obtained from ft icr ms the molecular weight distributions of dop along the treatment processes are shown in fig 2 the molecular weight of dop changed largely along with the treatment processes dop unevenly clustered near 200 450 da and 500 700 da in the influent and the average molecular weight was 491 da fig 2 after anaerobic treatment dop was almost distributed at 300 600 da and their average molecular weight decreased to 480 da fig 2 suggesting that the large dop molecules were degraded into smaller molecules however in anoxic treatment the dop was mostly distributed around 500 800 da and the average molecular weight increased to 654 da fig 2 indicating that a large amount of high molecular weight dop molecules were produced in this unit in the oxic unit dop was more evenly distributed from 300 da to 800 da and had a lower average molecular weight at 580 da fig 2 which might be attributed to the decomposition of large dop molecules in the settling tank dop was also mainly distributed around 300 800 da and the average molecular weight of dop decreased further to 520 da fig 2 implying that those dop with large molecular weight was preferentially removed here in sand filter dop mainly clustered at 500 800 da and the average mass weight sharply increased to 614 da fig 2 implying that the microbial activities were involved and it resulted in the release of intracellular dop by cell lysis or metabolism nevertheless a more evenly distributed mass ranged from 200 da to 800 da and a relatively low average molecular weight at 521 da could be observed in dop species after uv disinfection fig 2 indicating the effective decomposition of dop with high molecular weight by uv disinfection 3 2 3 variation of dop molecular species in the influent dop species were mainly composed of lipids but also contained some unsaturated hydrocarbons and lignin cram fig 3 a in the anaerobic treatment unit lipids unsaturated hydrocarbons and lignin cram like dop species were largely removed however some new lignin cram like dop species with low o c were generated fig 3b at the anoxic tank the residual lipids and aliphatic proteins from the anaerobic stage were further removed along with the formation of lignin cram with higher o c tannin and other kinds of lipids fig 3c during oxic tank the formed lipids and lignin cram like dop species in the anoxic tank were largely removed while the tannin like dop species were still remained fig 3d reflecting their bio refractory in addition a large amount of new dop species especially several kinds of lignin cram like dop with higher o c emerged in the oxic unit leading to bunches of dop species remaining in biological treatment effluent fig 3d after biological treatment the o c of dop species increased figs 3a d indicating that the biological treatment tended to remove dop with low oxygen content such as lipids and produce dop with high oxygen content such as lignin and tannins in the secondary clarifier most of the dop species were largely removed by coagulation the coagulation by aluminum salt preferentially removed the dop species with higher o c as shown in fig 3e suggesting that dop species with high oxygen content were prone to be removed by coagulation in the sand filter plenty of lignin cram lipids and tannin like dop were regenerated fig 3f which further indicated that the microorganisms retained by sand filter could produce dop finally these regenerated dop species were largely decomposed by uv disinfection especially the dop that possessed higher o c fig 3g suggesting the preferential removal of dop with high oxygen content by uv 3 2 4 variation of dop molecular structure transformation of these dop molecules during the wastewater treatment plant could be extrapolated via kendrick mass defect plot from fticr ms hughey et al 2001 this ch2 scale kmd analysis has been widely used for ft icr ms analysis because dom commonly holds series of alkylated homologs hughey et al 2001 the molecules which share the same kmd value in the same horizontal line are those in a homologous series or with identical core structures the differences among homologs could be explained by changes of the alkyl chain substituents on their structure which represented the difference in dom aliphaticity riedel et al 2012 addition and subtraction of alkyl chains substituents from homologous formula will result in the rise and fall in molecular weights on the same y axis it was clear that many homologous dop species were removed during biological processes fig 4 in influent the dop with different alkyl chain lengths mainly clustered at the two ranges of 280 430 da and 520 660 da while these dop were largely removed during anaerobic treatment figs 4a and 4b after anaerobic treatment the dop with different alkyl chain lengths was mainly distributed in the range of 350 550 da fig 4b during anoxic treatment the dop species with shorter alkyl chain lengths presented in anaerobic effluent were largely removed while the dop species with longer alkyl chain lengths were largely produced fig 4c after oxic treatment dop that contained different alkyl chain lengths was evenly distributed in the range between 300 and 700 da fig 4d indicating that oxic treatment tended to remove longer alkyl chain dop the alkyl chain length could represent the aliphaticity of dop riedel et al 2012 therefore the anoxic treatment tended to remove low aliphatic dop whereas the oxic treatment did the opposite after coagulation the distribution of dop with different alkyl chain lengths was similar to that after oxic treatment fig 4e which suggests that the removal of dop by aluminum coagulation had no selectivity in alkyl chain lengths in sand filter process some new dop species especially dop with longer alkyl chain length were formed fig 4f further demonstrating the microbial activities in this process after uv disinfection process the dop was evenly distributed in the range of 200 700 da fig 4g suggesting the efficiency of uv to the decomposition of long alkyl chain dop double bond equivalent dbe is another important parameter to elucidate the unsaturation and aromaticity of the organic compounds using ft icr ms the dbe value was plotted versus its carbon numbers cns for dop structure analysis fig 5 the dop species in all samples shared dbe ranging from 0 14 and cns from 0 50 formulas with cns over 40 represent large dop molecules and formulas with dbe over 4 may contain one or more benzene rings the decrease in dbe value indicates the addition of double bond or opening of the ring liu et al 2014 dop species with the highest relative abundance in the influent possessed a wide range of dbe from 1 9 fig 5a however dop species with highest relative abundance in anaerobic process shared a dbe value less than 4 fig 5b this indicates that the dop species in the anaerobic process became more saturated due to addition of double bonds e g unsaturated hydrocarbon or opening benzene rings e g lignin cram in the meantime the average cns of dop species decreased in the anaerobic process fig 5b which was consistent with the observed decrease in average molecular weight as discussed above fig 2 in the anoxic process the most abundant dop species still shared dbe no more than 4 but with different cns fig 5c indicating that most of dop species in the anaerobic and anoxic processes were saturated and nonaromatic besides in anoxic process the dop species with cns over 40 were generated corresponding to the raised average molecular weight of dop species fig 2 however in the oxic process the dbes of most abundant dop species were 6 11 fig 5d suggesting the production of dop species with higher unsaturation and aromaticity such as lignin cram aromatic structures and tannins fig 3d overall after biological treatments the average dbe increased suggesting the preferential removal of the dop species with low unsaturation and aromaticity and the production of dop species with high unsaturation and aromaticity the coagulation process effectively decreased the relative abundance of dop species with dbe ranging 6 11 in the secondary effluent reflecting that coagulation was prone to remove dop with high unsaturation and aromaticity furthermore it also decreased the cns of dop species fig 5e yet after sand filtration both dbe and cns of dop species increased owing to the microbial activities in this process especially those species with dbe over 8 and cns over 25 fig 5f after uv disinfection the relative abundance of dop species with high dbe value decreased fig 5g indicating that uv preferentially decomposed unsaturated and aromatic dop besides uv disinfection caused the decrease in average cns of dop species implying the chain scission of dop might occur during uv disinfection 4 discussion 4 1 fate of dop during biological treatment processes in biological treatment processes microorganisms would experience active synthetic metabolism to degrade dop qin et al 2015 during this process dop was mineralized gradually which resulted in dop removal up to 95 after biological treatments fig 1 consequently the biological treatment process played a decisive role in dop removal wwtp should pay more attention to biological treatment processes and optimize relevant parameters to reduce dop discharge the biological treatment processes not only removed the original dop in the influent but also produced dop because of microbial metabolism or cell lysis vadstein et al 2012 the removed dop had the characteristics of low oxygen content low unsaturation and low aromaticity while the produced dop possessed the inverse characteristics figs 3 and 5 which was similar to the removal and formation of dom in biological treatment processes hu et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 this feature was attributed to the reason that the main removed dop were lipids like dop species with low oxygen content low unsaturation and low aromaticity and unsaturated hydrocarbons like dop species with low oxygen content the lipids derived from microorganisms had a high bioavailability and could be able to be utilized quickly by microorganisms kim et al 2006 unsaturated hydrocarbons represented the molecules derived from phytoplankton so they were readily consumed throughout the biological treatment process due to their bioavailability maria martinez perez et al 2017 medeiros et al 2015 on the other hand the produced dop species were predominantly lignin cram like and small amounts of tannin like dop these dop species had high oxygen content high unsaturation and high aromaticity the lignin like dop was possibly originated from those degraded proteins during anaerobic and anoxic processes yekta et al 2012 corresponding to the large decrease in protein like substances during biological treatment processes according to previous studies lignin cram like dom was resistant to microbial utilization therefore they were difficult to be removed during biological treatment and much of them remained in the biological effluent hu et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 however a large amount of lignin cram like dop species presented in the biological effluent did not come from the influent of wwtp but from the microbial release the lignin cram like dop in the influent and the subsequently formed lignin cram like dop in anaerobic and anoxic processes had been largely removed in the oxic process this implies that lignin like dop species were not completely biologically inert which might be related to their molecular structure in the biological treatment processes the lignin cram like dop with lower o c was removed while the lignin cram like dop with higher o c was produced figs 3a d this implies that the lignin cram like dop with low oxygen content might have higher bioavailability compared to that of lignin cram like dop with high oxygen content the relationship between the bioavailability of lignin cram like dop and their molecular structures needs further investigation in the future 4 2 removal mechanisms of dop during tertiary advanced treatment processes in tertiary treatment processes several techniques were utilized here to enhance phosphorus and nutrients removal as well as disinfection to improve the effluent quality coagulation was always used to enhance phosphorus removal the coagulation by aluminum salt was prone to remove those dop species with high molecular weight and high oxygen content figs 2 and 3 this result was consistent with the removal of dom by coagulation using iron or aluminum salts reported by previous studies linkhorst et al 2017 riedel et al 2012 the reason might be that the dop species with high contents of oxygen containing groups such as carboxylic and hydroxyl groups were readily bonded to the hydrolyzing aluminum qian and chen 2013 in addition coagulation also had a preference for unsaturated and aromatic dop species which was due to that dop species with high oxygen content were usually lignin cram and tannin like dop had high unsaturation and aromaticity it s worth noting that the removal feature of dop during coagulation process was complementary with that in biological treatments therefore more influent dop can be transformed to dop with higher oxygen content through enhancing aeration or prolonging hydraulic retention time so that it can be better removed in the subsequent coagulation process in addition the chemically enhanced primary sedimentation ceps by metal salts before biological treatments has been adopted in some wwtp to enhance phosphorus removal lin et al 2017 however due to the low oxygen content of influent dop the ceps process may have low efficiency for influent dop removal in sand filter process the metabolism or cell lysis by microorganisms retained by sand filter contributed to the emergence of new dop species thus the timely clean of sand filter was necessary to avoid dop producing and entering the final effluent the final uv disinfection could effectively decompose dop into phosphate with preferential removal of high molecular weight and highly unsaturated aromatic dop species figs 2 and 5 such as lignin cram and tannin this was because the highly unsaturated lignin cram and tannin like dop species had a much stronger uv absorbance resulting in their preferential mineralization in addition due to the high oxygen content of lignin and tannin the uv disinfection also presented selectivity to dop species with high oxygen content nevertheless it should be worth noting that uv induced dop mineralization might enhance the threat of released phosphorus to the effluent receiving waters in consideration of the higher bioavailability of phosphate zhang et al 2019 in brief the dop removal features during coagulation and uv disinfection processes were similar but in actual operation dop should be removed as much as possible in the previous coagulation process to prevent dop from being mineralized to phosphate during uv disinfection and entering the final effluent 5 conclusions this work revealed the variation of dop in a wwtp from a molecular level via ft icr ms about 95 of dop could be removed by biological treatment processes the biological treatments predominantly consumed the dop species with low oxygen content low unsaturation and low aromaticity such as lipids but produced new dop species with the opposite molecular characteristics mainly lignin cram in tertiary treatment processes coagulation precipitation could preferentially remove dop species with high molecular weight and high oxygen content moreover uv disinfection could mineralize those unsaturated aromatic dop species effectively briefly the transformation mechanisms of dop species during wwtp were elucidated in this study which will give a better understanding of the fate of dop species in various wastewater treatment processes from the molecular level and will be useful to design a more reasonable process to reduce the phosphorus content in the effluent from wwtp declaration of

16707,to date eutrophication becomes a great concern of vulnerable aquatic systems dissolved organic phosphorus dop discharged from wastewater treatment plant wwtp holds a large source of phosphorus in receiving water however due to the complexity of dop their variation and fate in wwtp remain unknown at the molecular level and are always overlooked here the variation of dop in a wwtp was uncovered via fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms results show that 95 of dop in the influent could be removed by the secondary biological treatment processes the removed dop species were mainly lipids with the molecular characteristics of low oxygen content low unsaturation and low aromaticity meanwhile during biological treatments some new dop species especially lignin carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules cram that possessed high oxygen content high unsaturation and high aromaticity were produced and released into the secondary effluent in the subsequent tertiary treatment coagulation by aluminum salt tended to remove high molecular weight and high oxygen content dop species in the secondary effluent which was complementary to the biological treatment however the sand filter usually retained microorganisms which would result in the generation of new dop species in this process during the final ultraviolet disinfection process dop was effectively mineralized to phosphate especially the species with high molecular weight and highly unsaturated aromatic dop species e g lignin cram and tannin which had higher uv absorbance the revealed variation of dop in wwtp is beneficial to optimize the treatment processes to enhance the removal of dop graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic phosphorous dop ft icr ms wastewater treatment plant biological treatment tertiary treatment 1 introduction the large amount of phosphorous discharged from wastewater treatment plant wwtp increases the risk of eutrophication to environmental sensitive areas with more and more strict phosphorus discharge limits have been implemented efficient phosphorous removal from wastewater has become one of the most important tasks in wwtp clark et al 2010 during a typical wwtp with advanced nutrients removal processes most of the inorganic phosphorus in wastewater can be removed while dissolved organic phosphorous dop remains and accounts for 26 81 of dissolved total phosphorous dtp in the effluents galvagno et al 2016 liu et al 2011 qin et al 2015 in addition over 70 of the residual dop in wastewater effluent is found to be bioavailable gu et al 2014 qin et al 2015 moreover mineralization of dop into phosphate pi will further broaden the bioavailability of phosphorus pools in vulnerable aquatic systems hence watershed protection plans may therefore have to consider the contribution of dop from wwtp to the phosphorous pools and assess its potential risk a few works have investigated the content and bioavailability of dop in wwtp effluent qin et al 2015 previous studies have revealed the molecular variation of dissolved organic nitrogen don to various operational parameters e g solids retention time and temperature in wastewater treatment which is conducive to optimize these parameters to reduce the effluent don level hu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 however changes in the molecular composition of dop during the wastewater treatment processes have not been clarified clearly yet thus greatly limiting the feasibility of diminishing dop production and reducing dop residues in the effluents through processes optimization however due to the complex composition of dop traditional methods are currently not adequate to characterize dop from a molecular level persulfate digestion followed by molybdenum blue photometric method can only be used to measure the contents of dtp phosphate and dop apha 2005 enzymatic hydrolysis technology can be applied to characterize the extent of bioavailability of dop species but their structure and composition cannot be obtained majed et al 2012 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr provides a description of all phosphorus species but it gives limited molecular composition information and shares a relatively high detection limit compared to other chemical methods worsfold et al 2008 pre methylation of phosphonates and characterized using lc ms ms allows the observation of diverse chemical transformations in authentic water samples wang et al 2019 yet complicated pre treatment processes are needed currently the comprehensive molecular basis of dop remains poorly elucidated fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is a non targeted mass spectrometry with ultrahigh resolution sleighter and hatcher 2007 it does not need to separate ions of different mass to charge ratios m z but can measure the m z and abundance of all ions simultaneously and give detailed information of various complex compositions with high analysis sensitivities and low detection limits marshall et al 1998 hence the non targeted ft icr ms does not require complicated separation and pre treatment processes and can provide novel insights into the detailed chemistry of organic matters based on their accurate molecular formulas which assists to interpret molecular patterns across systems such as chemical and biological processes and makes it possible to reveal the variation of mixed organic formulas in aquatic and terrestrial systems from a molecular level kujawinski et al 2004 li et al 2018 sleighter et al 2010 a few researches focused on revealing sulfur and nitrogen containing molecular formulas of effluent organic matter in wwtp through ft icr ms gonsior et al 2011 mesfioui et al 2012 in which molecular insight and reactivity of these formulas had been elucidated hence it is expected that ft icr ms is powerful to characterize the complex and low level of dop in wwtp however it has not been surveyed systematically yet in this study we attempt to quantitatively and molecularly investigate the variation and fate of dop in wwtp for this purpose samples were collected throughout the wastewater stream to examine how specific treatment processes recast the molecular composition of dop the changes of dop content in biological and tertiary treatment processes were assessed in addition the chemical diversity and structural variation of dop during wwtp treatment processes were elucidated via ft icr ms a comprehensive understanding on how wastewater treatment processes affect dop molecular compositions will favor us to reduce effluent dop as a potential phosphate source that enters the effluent receiving waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection wastewater samples were harvested along with the treatment units of wangtang wwtp in hefei china the treatment processes used in this plant and 7 sampling sites are illustrated in fig s1 supporting information briefly the solids in raw wastewater were removed in the primary clarifier followed by biological carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal achieved through anaerobic anoxic oxic a a o processes tertiary treatment units consisting of coagulation in settling tank secondary clarifier sand filter and ultraviolet uv disinfection were used to improve the effluent quality aluminum salt was used here as coagulant to enhance phosphorus removal via chemical precipitation in the coagulation precipitation process before sampling no rainfall was observed within three days all glass bottles used here were well pre treated with chromic acid lotion overnight and rinsed with dilute nitric acid and deionized water repeatedly all samples were collected in duplicate samples were sequentially vacuum filtered through 1 6 µm whatman gf a glass fiber and 0 45 µm sinopharm chemical reagent co mixed cellulose ester membranes and then stored in dark at 4 c 2 2 optical analyses of water sample dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured by a total carbon analyzer multi n c 2100 jena germany the uv vis absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan suva254 was calculated as the normalization of absorbance at 254 nm by doc and e2 e3 the ratio of absorbance at 254 nm and 365 nm was also calculated the levels of phosphate and dop were measured following the standard method apha 2005 the samples collected along treatment units were subjected to 3 dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem fluorescence analysis via a fluorescence spectrometer duetta horiba japan a series of emission scans 300 600 nm with 1 nm increments were collected over excitation wavelengths ranging from 250 to 500 nm by 5 nm increments the parallel factor analysis parafac was carried out in matlab r2019a with the domfluor toolbox to determine the fluorescent components among samples hence the maximum fluorescence intensities fmax of each component could be calculated to quantitatively assess the fluorescence differences of various identified components 2 3 sample pretreatment and ft icr ms analysis dop was extracted and condensed by solid phase extraction spe method using agilent bond elute ppl cartridge 500 mg 6 ml kellerman et al 2015 while the blank was prepared with milli q water using the same treatment processes before use ppl cartridge was cleaned with 20 ml hplc grade methanol and balanced with 20 ml acidified milli q water ph 2 to increase the extraction efficiency 100 ml sample was acidified to ph 2 with hcl and then passed through the rinsed ppl cartridge the cartridge was then rinsed with 20 ml acidified milli q water to remove salt after completely dried in a nitrogen atmosphere the samples were eluted with 5 ml methanol into acid washed glass vials and kept in dark at 20 c prior to ft icr ms analysis the dop molecular compositions were analyzed using a 7 t ft icr ms solarix bruker daltonik bremen germany which was operated with an electrospray ionization esi source in negative mode a same detection limit according to relative signal intensity scale was applied to facilitate the maximum comparability among samples riedel and dittmar 2014 the raw data was processed using bruker daltonics data analysis 4 0 and matlab routines fu et al 2020 in which the mass spectra among 100 1000 da were collected internal calibration was performed with a known homologous series of naturally present fatty acids 259 755 m z as calibrants which were in relatively high abundances in dissolved organic matter sleighter et al 2008 after internal recalibration only peaks that were detected in both duplicate samples were further analyzed aiming to reduce false positive data sleighter et al 2008 phungsai et al 2019 absolute abundance was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the peak intensity of effective formulas in both duplicate samples relative abundance was calculated as the ratio of measured intensity of an ion with the most abundant ion whose relative abundance was determined as 100 prior to formula assignments peaks were identified in mass spectra within 200 800 m z which aligns with the mass range of internal calibration s n 5 were considered as potential target molecules while in negative mode m z was converted to nominal masses by the addition of a proton according to the dictionary of natural products dnp mass spectral database molecules with a mass range lower than 1000 da had 6 p atoms maximum and normally p 3 in natural molecules kind and fiehn 2007 kujawinski and behn 2006 hence potential formulas were composed of c1 100h1 250o1 100n0 3s0 2p0 2 and obeyed the nitrogen rule formulas assignments were considered valid if the mass error was 1 ppm by the best fit following by double check with seven golden rules kind and fiehn 2007 because all the detected ions were singly charged for esi negative esi henceforth each ion was denoted by its exact mass instead of its mass to charge ratio m z average mass weight was calculated by the relative abundance weighted average according to the identified formula samples were presented using van krevelen diagrams in which the h c ratio for each

was calculated as follow dbe 1 ½ 2c h n p phungsai et al 2019 stenson et al 2003 furthermore kendrick mass defect kmd plots on the ch2 scale were applied to differentiate homologous series in dop according to previous reported method hughey et al 2001 qian et al 2001 3 results 3 1 profiles of dissolved organic matter during wastewater treatment the doc concentrations of the samples collected in all treatment units are shown in fig s2a it decreased by around 57 3 from 11 77 mg c l in the influent to 5 03 mg c l in anaerobically treated sample in the anoxic unit the doc further decreased to 4 50 mg c l however during the oxic unit the doc inversely increased to 5 92 mg c l in addition after decline of 1 30 mg c l in secondary clarifier the changes in doc concentration aroused by the subsequent sand filter and uv disinfection were negligible dynamic variation of the spectral characteristics was monitored alongside the treatment processes changes in suva254 e2 e3 could provide an insight into the variation of the composition of dissolved organic matter dom during the treatments fig s2b as a main indicator of dom aromaticity the suva254 value increased from 1 55 l mg c 1 m 1 in the influent to 4 22 l mg c 1 m 1 in the anoxic treatment unit and then it decreased to the lowest value in the oxic tank with 1 50 l mg c 1 m 1 this indicates that humification degree of the organic compositions in wastewater increased from wwtp influent to anoxic tank but decreased sharply in oxic tank during tertiary treatment processes the suva254 stayed steadily around 2 01 l mg c 1 m 1 fig s2b the e2 e3 gradually increased from 3 23 in the influent to 5 05 in the oxic treatment unit fig s2b implying that the average molecular weight of dom in wastewater gradually decreased during the secondary biological treatment process because the e2 e3 value is inversely related to the molecular weight of dom maizel and remucal 2017 in secondary clarifier the e2 e3 further increased to 5 10 fig s2b reflecting the preferential removal of higher molecular weight dom by aluminum salt coagulation however a slight decrease in e2 e3 value to 4 83 was observed in sand filter possibly due to the production of high molecular weight biomolecules by microorganisms retained in sand filter fig s2b in the final uv disinfection e2 e3 value recovered to 5 18 fig s2b reflecting that uv could decompose the dom with higher molecular weight preferentially eem fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parafac divided the complex fluorescence matrices into four fluorescent components as shown in figs s3 and s4 the parafac model with 2 6 components was computed here and 4 components were determined as the best fit based on residual analysis and split half analysis stedmon and bro 2008 the maximum fluorescence intensities of these components were given in fig s4b which were identified as protein and tryptophan like c1 determann et al 1994 determann et al 1996 humic acid like c2 stedmon et al 2003 fulvic acid like c3 tang et al 2020 and humic acid like c4 kellerman et al 2015 in the secondary biological treatment processes the fluorescence intensity of the protein like substance c1 was sharply decreased while those of humic related substances c2 c3 c4 declined mildly fig s4b suggesting that the protein like substances were more bioavailable than the humic related substances previous studies also reported that protein like substances were bioavailable but fulvic like and humic like substances were generally refractory compounds hu et al 2018 during the tertiary treatment processes the fluorescence intensity of the protein like substance c1 fluctuated while the fluorescence intensities of the humic like substances c2 c3 c4 remained relatively stable fig s4b which was consistent with the relative stable aromaticity during tertiary treatment processes 3 2 changes in dop during wastewater treatment 3 2 1 variation of dop contents the changes of phosphorus in various forms during wastewater treatment are presented in fig 1 the phosphate occupied 69 of the dtp in the wastewater influent while dop was about 31 of the dtp in the anaerobic unit nearly 56 of dop and 18 of dtp were removed hereafter dop was further removed in the anoxic and oxic treatment units where about 88 and 95 of dop were removed respectively simultaneously about 89 and 93 of dtp were removed in the anoxic and oxic units comparing to dop the content of doc was inversely increased during oxic treatment process fig s2a indicating that different microbial activities might be involved in the utilization and mineralization of dop and doc colman et al 2005 in the settling tank the contents of dtp and dop decreased to 0 14 and 0 04 mg l fig 1 in the sand filter process dtp further decreased to the lowest value of 0 07 mg l but dop increased slightly to 0 05 mg l possibly because that the microorganisms retained by sand filter produced dop before discharge wastewater was disinfected via uv technology although dtp was not removed in this disinfection process the content of dop decreased significantly from 0 04 mg l to 0 01 mg l fig 1 in contrast to dop the content of doc was decreased by coagulation in sedimentation tank but was stable during uv disinfection fig s2a this suggests that doc might be more difficult to be mineralized by uv disinfection 3 2 2 variation of dop molecular weights according to the identified effective formula from the mass spectra obtained from ft icr ms the molecular weight distributions of dop along the treatment processes are shown in fig 2 the molecular weight of dop changed largely along with the treatment processes dop unevenly clustered near 200 450 da and 500 700 da in the influent and the average molecular weight was 491 da fig 2 after anaerobic treatment dop was almost distributed at 300 600 da and their average molecular weight decreased to 480 da fig 2 suggesting that the large dop molecules were degraded into smaller molecules however in anoxic treatment the dop was mostly distributed around 500 800 da and the average molecular weight increased to 654 da fig 2 indicating that a large amount of high molecular weight dop molecules were produced in this unit in the oxic unit dop was more evenly distributed from 300 da to 800 da and had a lower average molecular weight at 580 da fig 2 which might be attributed to the decomposition of large dop molecules in the settling tank dop was also mainly distributed around 300 800 da and the average molecular weight of dop decreased further to 520 da fig 2 implying that those dop with large molecular weight was preferentially removed here in sand filter dop mainly clustered at 500 800 da and the average mass weight sharply increased to 614 da fig 2 implying that the microbial activities were involved and it resulted in the release of intracellular dop by cell lysis or metabolism nevertheless a more evenly distributed mass ranged from 200 da to 800 da and a relatively low average molecular weight at 521 da could be observed in dop species after uv disinfection fig 2 indicating the effective decomposition of dop with high molecular weight by uv disinfection 3 2 3 variation of dop molecular species in the influent dop species were mainly composed of lipids but also contained some unsaturated hydrocarbons and lignin cram fig 3 a in the anaerobic treatment unit lipids unsaturated hydrocarbons and lignin cram like dop species were largely removed however some new lignin cram like dop species with low o c were generated fig 3b at the anoxic tank the residual lipids and aliphatic proteins from the anaerobic stage were further removed along with the formation of lignin cram with higher o c tannin and other kinds of lipids fig 3c during oxic tank the formed lipids and lignin cram like dop species in the anoxic tank were largely removed while the tannin like dop species were still remained fig 3d reflecting their bio refractory in addition a large amount of new dop species especially several kinds of lignin cram like dop with higher o c emerged in the oxic unit leading to bunches of dop species remaining in biological treatment effluent fig 3d after biological treatment the o c of dop species increased figs 3a d indicating that the biological treatment tended to remove dop with low oxygen content such as lipids and produce dop with high oxygen content such as lignin and tannins in the secondary clarifier most of the dop species were largely removed by coagulation the coagulation by aluminum salt preferentially removed the dop species with higher o c as shown in fig 3e suggesting that dop species with high oxygen content were prone to be removed by coagulation in the sand filter plenty of lignin cram lipids and tannin like dop were regenerated fig 3f which further indicated that the microorganisms retained by sand filter could produce dop finally these regenerated dop species were largely decomposed by uv disinfection especially the dop that possessed higher o c fig 3g suggesting the preferential removal of dop with high oxygen content by uv 3 2 4 variation of dop molecular structure transformation of these dop molecules during the wastewater treatment plant could be extrapolated via kendrick mass defect plot from fticr ms hughey et al 2001 this ch2 scale kmd analysis has been widely used for ft icr ms analysis because dom commonly holds series of alkylated homologs hughey et al 2001 the molecules which share the same kmd value in the same horizontal line are those in a homologous series or with identical core structures the differences among homologs could be explained by changes of the alkyl chain substituents on their structure which represented the difference in dom aliphaticity riedel et al 2012 addition and subtraction of alkyl chains substituents from homologous formula will result in the rise and fall in molecular weights on the same y axis it was clear that many homologous dop species were removed during biological processes fig 4 in influent the dop with different alkyl chain lengths mainly clustered at the two ranges of 280 430 da and 520 660 da while these dop were largely removed during anaerobic treatment figs 4a and 4b after anaerobic treatment the dop with different alkyl chain lengths was mainly distributed in the range of 350 550 da fig 4b during anoxic treatment the dop species with shorter alkyl chain lengths presented in anaerobic effluent were largely removed while the dop species with longer alkyl chain lengths were largely produced fig 4c after oxic treatment dop that contained different alkyl chain lengths was evenly distributed in the range between 300 and 700 da fig 4d indicating that oxic treatment tended to remove longer alkyl chain dop the alkyl chain length could represent the aliphaticity of dop riedel et al 2012 therefore the anoxic treatment tended to remove low aliphatic dop whereas the oxic treatment did the opposite after coagulation the distribution of dop with different alkyl chain lengths was similar to that after oxic treatment fig 4e which suggests that the removal of dop by aluminum coagulation had no selectivity in alkyl chain lengths in sand filter process some new dop species especially dop with longer alkyl chain length were formed fig 4f further demonstrating the microbial activities in this process after uv disinfection process the dop was evenly distributed in the range of 200 700 da fig 4g suggesting the efficiency of uv to the decomposition of long alkyl chain dop double bond equivalent dbe is another important parameter to elucidate the unsaturation and aromaticity of the organic compounds using ft icr ms the dbe value was plotted versus its carbon numbers cns for dop structure analysis fig 5 the dop species in all samples shared dbe ranging from 0 14 and cns from 0 50 formulas with cns over 40 represent large dop molecules and formulas with dbe over 4 may contain one or more benzene rings the decrease in dbe value indicates the addition of double bond or opening of the ring liu et al 2014 dop species with the highest relative abundance in the influent possessed a wide range of dbe from 1 9 fig 5a however dop species with highest relative abundance in anaerobic process shared a dbe value less than 4 fig 5b this indicates that the dop species in the anaerobic process became more saturated due to addition of double bonds e g unsaturated hydrocarbon or opening benzene rings e g lignin cram in the meantime the average cns of dop species decreased in the anaerobic process fig 5b which was consistent with the observed decrease in average molecular weight as discussed above fig 2 in the anoxic process the most abundant dop species still shared dbe no more than 4 but with different cns fig 5c indicating that most of dop species in the anaerobic and anoxic processes were saturated and nonaromatic besides in anoxic process the dop species with cns over 40 were generated corresponding to the raised average molecular weight of dop species fig 2 however in the oxic process the dbes of most abundant dop species were 6 11 fig 5d suggesting the production of dop species with higher unsaturation and aromaticity such as lignin cram aromatic structures and tannins fig 3d overall after biological treatments the average dbe increased suggesting the preferential removal of the dop species with low unsaturation and aromaticity and the production of dop species with high unsaturation and aromaticity the coagulation process effectively decreased the relative abundance of dop species with dbe ranging 6 11 in the secondary effluent reflecting that coagulation was prone to remove dop with high unsaturation and aromaticity furthermore it also decreased the cns of dop species fig 5e yet after sand filtration both dbe and cns of dop species increased owing to the microbial activities in this process especially those species with dbe over 8 and cns over 25 fig 5f after uv disinfection the relative abundance of dop species with high dbe value decreased fig 5g indicating that uv preferentially decomposed unsaturated and aromatic dop besides uv disinfection caused the decrease in average cns of dop species implying the chain scission of dop might occur during uv disinfection 4 discussion 4 1 fate of dop during biological treatment processes in biological treatment processes microorganisms would experience active synthetic metabolism to degrade dop qin et al 2015 during this process dop was mineralized gradually which resulted in dop removal up to 95 after biological treatments fig 1 consequently the biological treatment process played a decisive role in dop removal wwtp should pay more attention to biological treatment processes and optimize relevant parameters to reduce dop discharge the biological treatment processes not only removed the original dop in the influent but also produced dop because of microbial metabolism or cell lysis vadstein et al 2012 the removed dop had the characteristics of low oxygen content low unsaturation and low aromaticity while the produced dop possessed the inverse characteristics figs 3 and 5 which was similar to the removal and formation of dom in biological treatment processes hu et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 this feature was attributed to the reason that the main removed dop were lipids like dop species with low oxygen content low unsaturation and low aromaticity and unsaturated hydrocarbons like dop species with low oxygen content the lipids derived from microorganisms had a high bioavailability and could be able to be utilized quickly by microorganisms kim et al 2006 unsaturated hydrocarbons represented the molecules derived from phytoplankton so they were readily consumed throughout the biological treatment process due to their bioavailability maria martinez perez et al 2017 medeiros et al 2015 on the other hand the produced dop species were predominantly lignin cram like and small amounts of tannin like dop these dop species had high oxygen content high unsaturation and high aromaticity the lignin like dop was possibly originated from those degraded proteins during anaerobic and anoxic processes yekta et al 2012 corresponding to the large decrease in protein like substances during biological treatment processes according to previous studies lignin cram like dom was resistant to microbial utilization therefore they were difficult to be removed during biological treatment and much of them remained in the biological effluent hu et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 however a large amount of lignin cram like dop species presented in the biological effluent did not come from the influent of wwtp but from the microbial release the lignin cram like dop in the influent and the subsequently formed lignin cram like dop in anaerobic and anoxic processes had been largely removed in the oxic process this implies that lignin like dop species were not completely biologically inert which might be related to their molecular structure in the biological treatment processes the lignin cram like dop with lower o c was removed while the lignin cram like dop with higher o c was produced figs 3a d this implies that the lignin cram like dop with low oxygen content might have higher bioavailability compared to that of lignin cram like dop with high oxygen content the relationship between the bioavailability of lignin cram like dop and their molecular structures needs further investigation in the future 4 2 removal mechanisms of dop during tertiary advanced treatment processes in tertiary treatment processes several techniques were utilized here to enhance phosphorus and nutrients removal as well as disinfection to improve the effluent quality coagulation was always used to enhance phosphorus removal the coagulation by aluminum salt was prone to remove those dop species with high molecular weight and high oxygen content figs 2 and 3 this result was consistent with the removal of dom by coagulation using iron or aluminum salts reported by previous studies linkhorst et al 2017 riedel et al 2012 the reason might be that the dop species with high contents of oxygen containing groups such as carboxylic and hydroxyl groups were readily bonded to the hydrolyzing aluminum qian and chen 2013 in addition coagulation also had a preference for unsaturated and aromatic dop species which was due to that dop species with high oxygen content were usually lignin cram and tannin like dop had high unsaturation and aromaticity it s worth noting that the removal feature of dop during coagulation process was complementary with that in biological treatments therefore more influent dop can be transformed to dop with higher oxygen content through enhancing aeration or prolonging hydraulic retention time so that it can be better removed in the subsequent coagulation process in addition the chemically enhanced primary sedimentation ceps by metal salts before biological treatments has been adopted in some wwtp to enhance phosphorus removal lin et al 2017 however due to the low oxygen content of influent dop the ceps process may have low efficiency for influent dop removal in sand filter process the metabolism or cell lysis by microorganisms retained by sand filter contributed to the emergence of new dop species thus the timely clean of sand filter was necessary to avoid dop producing and entering the final effluent the final uv disinfection could effectively decompose dop into phosphate with preferential removal of high molecular weight and highly unsaturated aromatic dop species figs 2 and 5 such as lignin cram and tannin this was because the highly unsaturated lignin cram and tannin like dop species had a much stronger uv absorbance resulting in their preferential mineralization in addition due to the high oxygen content of lignin and tannin the uv disinfection also presented selectivity to dop species with high oxygen content nevertheless it should be worth noting that uv induced dop mineralization might enhance the threat of released phosphorus to the effluent receiving waters in consideration of the higher bioavailability of phosphate zhang et al 2019 in brief the dop removal features during coagulation and uv disinfection processes were similar but in actual operation dop should be removed as much as possible in the previous coagulation process to prevent dop from being mineralized to phosphate during uv disinfection and entering the final effluent 5 conclusions this work revealed the variation of dop in a wwtp from a molecular level via ft icr ms about 95 of dop could be removed by biological treatment processes the biological treatments predominantly consumed the dop species with low oxygen content low unsaturation and low aromaticity such as lipids but produced new dop species with the opposite molecular characteristics mainly lignin cram in tertiary treatment processes coagulation precipitation could preferentially remove dop species with high molecular weight and high oxygen content moreover uv disinfection could mineralize those unsaturated aromatic dop species effectively briefly the transformation mechanisms of dop species during wwtp were elucidated in this study which will give a better understanding of the fate of dop species in various wastewater treatment processes from the molecular level and will be useful to design a more reasonable process to reduce the phosphorus content in the effluent from wwtp declaration of

16708,this study was conducted to investigate mechanisms of cross resistance to chlorine and peracetic acid paa disinfectants by antibiotic resistant bacteria our study evaluated chlorine and paa based disinfection kinetics of erythromycin resistant enterococcus faecalis meropenem resistant escherichia fergusonii and susceptible strains of these species using the integrated second order disinfectant decay model and first order chick watson s law it was found that the meropenem resistant escherichia fergusonii strain showed significantly less log inactivation compared to the susceptible e fergusonii strain in response to both chlorine and paa disinfection p value 0 059 3 5 10 6 on the other hand the susceptible enterococcus faecalis strain showed similar log inactivation compared to the erythromycin resistant strain in response to either treatment p value 0 075 0 28 meropenem resistant e fergusonii showed an increase in gene expression of new delhi metallo β lactamase bla ndm 1 gene to chlorine but there was no increase in expression to paa whole genome sequencing wgs was then conducted to elucidate the differences in genes among both resistant and susceptible table e fergusonii strains the average nucleotide identity ani analysis of the draft genomes 97 similarity suggests that meropenem resistant e fergusonii s1 and meropenem susceptible e fergusonii s2 are the same species but different strains both strains have the same genes for oxidative stress pathways oxidative scavenger genes and nearly 40 different antibiotic efflux pump genes the chromosomal and plasmid draft genomes of meropenem resistant and susceptible e fergusonii strains each have 65 and 52 antibiotic resistance genes respectively of these the resistant e fergusonii strain harbored the extended spectrum beta lactamases bla ctx m 15 and bla tem 1 genes located on the chromosome and a bla tem 1 gene on the plasmid the overall findings of this study are significant as they reveal that antibiotic resistant and susceptible strains of e fergusonii exhibit different responses towards chlorine and paa disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic

global human health in the 21st century ahmad and khan 2019 choudhury et al 2012 munita and arias 2016 antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs have evolved to carry antibiotic resistance genes args through mutation selection and clonal expansion especially in environments with strong selective pressure such as hospitals palencia 2018 resistant infections are typically discovered in nosocomial settings ten years after antibiotics have been introduced to the public ventola 2015 today even the most powerful antibiotics have proven ineffectual against multidrug resistant bacteria such as those carrying the new delhi metallo β lactamase bla ndm 1 gene lee et al 2018 linciano et al 2018 although arbs are found naturally in the environment the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans animals and agriculture has resulted in the proliferation of antibiotic resistant pathogens worldwide levy and marshall 2004 czekalski et al 2016 silley et al 2012 these arbs and args are now considered contaminants of emerging concern cecs in aquatic environments sanderson et al 2016 unlike other contaminants arbs and args are conserved in bacterial populations through horizontal gene transfer hgt aminov 2011 therefore arbs and free nucleic args often end up in drinking water sources and treatment facilities through hydrologic cycling where they pose a threat to human health chen et al 2015 segura et al 2009 arbs and args have been shown to survive disinfection processes in wastewater and drinking water treatment yuan et al 2015 huang et al 2011 traditional chlorine disinfection continues to be the most popular choice for tertiary treatment due to its stability efficiency and low cost epa 1999 drinking water treatment facilities dwtfs typically add between 0 5 and 2 mg l of free chlorine to disinfect and combat microbial regrowth in drinking water distribution systems dwds sadiq and rodriguez 2004 cdc 2014 however the concentration of residual chlorine decreases due to various physico chemical factors as the water travels downstream in the distribution network bertelli et al 2018 chlorination also has several drawbacks namely that it reacts with natural organic matter to produce numerous disinfection byproducts dbps that have been shown to have carcinogenic and toxic effects gopal et al 2007 ran and li 2013 peroxyacetic or peracetic acid paa has been proposed as a green alternative to chlorination because it does not produce dbps and provides stronger oxidative effects although it is not as effective as chlorine for residual disinfection in drinking water distribution systems zhang et al 2019 chlorine bleach simply dissociates into hypochlorite ions in water while paa exists in aqueous equilibrium as acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide producing further oxidative effects sharma et al 2016 both disinfectants kill pathogens by oxidizing the cell wall and causing lysis or by diffusing through the cell wall and oxidizing the intracellular material epa chlorine disinfection 1999 epa peracetic acid disinfection 2012 although paa has been used for many years in european wastewater treatment its use has not been implemented in the united states and is a virtually nonexistent practice for drinking water treatment due to limitations in cost and operational knowledge xue et al 2017 the environmental protection agency has not yet established guidelines for paa disinfection in wastewater and drinking water treatment furthermore the efficacy of paa as a disinfectant for the removal of arbs and args in wastewater and drinking water treatment is still under investigation recent studies suggest that both chlorine and paa disinfection in potable water and wastewater treatment can increase the relative abundance of args and arbs in the final effluent liu et al 2018 dicesare et al 2016 bacteria acquire resistance to multiple environmental stressors via three main mechanisms a cross resistance b co resistance and c co selection krige 2009 pal et al 2017 blanco et al 2016 bouki et al 2013 while it is possible that an oxidative resistance gene may be co selected for the same plasmid as args very little is known about the genetic mechanisms of resistance to oxidative stress mara and horen 2003 multidrug efflux pump systems have been strongly implicated in resistance to oxidizing disinfectants inatsu et al 2010 karumathil et al 2014 however results from previous studies show that oxidizing disinfectants increase the gene expression of other classes of args not just efflux pumps karumathil et al 2014 templeton et al 2009 huang et al 2013 in this study we investigated the phenomenon of cross resistance in antibiotic resistant enterococcus faecalis and escherichia fergusonii and two corresponding susceptible strains certain strains of enterococci such as e faecalis and e coli the latter of which is a closely related species to e fergusonii are pathogens that can cause fatal gastrointestinal diseases when ingested via fecally contaminated drinking water byappanahalli et al 2012 riley et al 2011 the e fergusonii strains that cause infections are also known to be highly resistant to multiple antibiotics such as chloramphenicols ampicillin and gentamycin maheux et al 2014 for this study these two species were selected as model waterborne pathogens and they were chosen based on their ability to phenotypically resist completely unrelated classes of antibiotics that do not involve efflux pumps in order to explore other potential mechanisms of cross resistance therefore the overall objective of this study was to compare the disinfection kinetics of antibiotic resistant e faecalis and e fergusonii and their corresponding susceptible strains the objective also included an investigation on a potential mechanism for cross resistance to antibiotics and oxidizing agents we chose two bacteria e g e fergusonii and e faecalis from different phyla with two completely disparate modes of antibiotic resistance that does not include efflux pumps to see if antibiotic resistance genes themselves were responsible for cross resistance or whether other mechanisms of resistance to oxidizing disinfectants are possible it was hypothesized that antibiotic resistant pathogens would show less log inactivation and greater expression of args in response to chlorine and paa disinfection it was also hypothesized that the draft genomes bacterial chromosome and plasmid of meropenem resistant e fergusonii and susceptible e fergusonii strains would show differences in the number and diversity of args additionally resistance mediated by erythromycin resistance methylase and encoded by erm genes erma and ermb and additional active drug efflux gene mefa kataja et a 2000 hence in erythromycin e faecalis the expression of these functional genes was also studied in response to chlorine and paa disinfection likewise e fergusonii harbors the new delhi metallo β lactamase bla ndm 1 gene which offers resistance to the broad spectrum carbapenem group of antibiotics ashcroft et al 2019 hence the expression of this gene was studied in response to chlorine and paa disinfection 2 methods 2 1 isolation and characterization of antibiotic resistant pathogens the antibiotic resistant pathogens used in this study were isolated from agricultural and clinical samples the meropenem resistant e fergusonii was isolated in dr ramesh goel s laboratory at the university of utah in a previous study was phenotypically determined to be an escherichia coli strain using plating methods and genotypically determined to carry bla ndm 1 using pcr tanner et al 2017 the erythromycin resistant e faecalis was isolated by diluting one gram of swine manure sample in 0 85 w v saline solution a minimum inhibitory concentration mic test was performed using 98 mg g erythromycin serially diluted from 1 μg ml to 512 μg ml the diluted manure sample was four quadrant streaked on chromagar orientation chromogenic mueller hinton agar mha containing erythromycin and incubated at 37 c for 24 hours based on distinct colony morphology and color e faecalis colonies were picked from the 512 μg ml erythromycin containing plate and cultured in mueller hinton broth mhb the individual isolates were subjected to a three level subculture screening on mha containing 64 μg ml erythromycin to confirm antibiotic resistance and to negate the possibility of false positive results both the susceptible e faecalis and e fergusonii strains were obtained from a colleague in civil and environmental engineering department at the university of utah and susceptibility was tested by plating the culture on 64 mg l erythromycin and 4 mg l meropenem containing plates subsequently showing no growth in order to estimate an initial bacterial concentration of 108 cfu ml for disinfection growth curves were developed for each strain by measuring the optical density of each bacterial culture at 600nm in a spectrophotometer and the time was recorded when each strain reached mid log phase growth meropenem resistant and susceptible e fergusonii were cultured in mhb while erythromycin resistant and susceptible e faecalis showed optimal growth in tryptic soy broth tsb the isolated bacterial cultures were examined microscopically using an epifluorescence microscope bx 51 olympus japan and 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole fluorescent staining to confirm a pure culture and correct morphology had been obtained before being stored in 25 sterile glycerol detection of respective antibiotic resistance genes e g for e faecalis the erythromycin resistance was tested with erma ermb and mefa genes and for e fergusonii the bla ndm 1 gene was carried out using primer sets and pcr conditions as detailed in li et al 2010 and poirel et al 2011 respectively 2 2 chlorine and paa inactivation of antibiotic resistant pathogens for the chlorine inactivation tests a known volume of sodium hypochlorite 7 85 w v was added to 100 ml of sterilized 0 85 saline solution for a 50 mg l stock solution and diluted to produce concentrations of 2 4 8 and 16 mg l residual free chlorine free chlorine concentrations were confirmed using the hach free chlorine dpd method 10069 hach usa and a hach dr1900 spectrophotometer hach usa for the paa inactivation tests a known volume of paa 35 w v was added to 100 ml of sterilized 0 85 saline solution for a 6 mg l stock solution and diluted to produce concentrations of 0 5 1 2 and 5 mg l residual paa the paa concentrations were confirmed using the hach paa dpd method 10290 hach usa and dr1900 spectrophotometer measurement of paa and h2o2 concentration was adapted from dpd method for chlorine dominguez henao et al 2018 hach usa four complete mix batch reactors assays representing each disinfectant concentration were constructed in 100 ml flasks on stir plates set to 400 rpm and strains were tested individually the experiments were conducted at room temperature 20 c and neutral ph 7 5 by taking a culture sample at mid log growth phase approximately one ml of 108 cfu ml culture was added to each 100 ml assay with a stir bar to produce an approximate final concentration of 106 cfu ml subsequently 1 ml sample was taken at time 0 5 15 25 and 35 minutes a known volume of 0 02 m sodium thiosulfate was added to each sample to quench both residual chlorine and paa eramo et al 2017 the sample was then serially diluted from 106 cfu ml to approximately one cfu ml filtered through a 0 22 μm filter millipore usa and placed on a 47 mm petri dish containing a selective chromogenic agar for e faecalis modified difco mei agar was used and the strain was incubated at 42 c for 24 hours for e fergusonii modified difco mtec agar was used and the strain was first incubated at 37 c for two hours followed by incubation at 42 c for 22 hours colony forming units were counted on the filter paper for each dilution and the original bacterial concentration was calculated for each time and concentration the inactivation experiments were performed as technical triplicates in order to calculate the average and standard deviation of bacterial concentrations over time for each treatment in order to calculate true contact time the instantaneous demand in a time scale of minutes decay and residual concentrations of free chlorine and paa were measured in separate experiments under the exact same conditions mcclellan et al 2000 metcalf and eddy 2014 five and ten ml aliquots of free chlorine and paa respectively were taken at time 0 5 15 25 and 35 minutes they were immediately analyzed spectrophotometrically using hach methods 10069 and 10209 and the average residual concentrations obtained from technical triplicates were used to calculate integrated second order demand and decay model for contact time ct values gyürék and finch 1998 sivaganesan et al 2008 additional complete mix batch reactor assay experiments were preformed to confirm that the instantaneous demand was mainly exerted by each of the culturing media and that the observed residual disinfectant concentrations were the same between resistant and susceptible strains 2 3 disinfection demand and kinetics the number of surviving bacteria at each sampling time point was calculated after accounting for the dilution ratio and the aliquot volume used during each experiment in conditions where disinfectant demand and decay are negligible the disinfectant concentration is assumed to stay constant over the course of the contact time and zero order kinetics may be used to determine ct values however in this study all residual disinfectant experiments for both chlorine and paa exhibited both instantaneous demand and disinfection decay over time therefore a second order model of disinfectant demand and decay was used to determine an integrated estimate of contact time over the course of the experiment the differential form of this second order model is given by eq 1 and the integrated form of eq 1 gives the residual disinfectant concentration at any time in eq 2 in eq 1 c is equal to the initial concentration of disinfectant c is equal to the amount of disinfectant demand at any given time and k 2 is a disinfectant decay constant the units of which are 1 t in eq 2 c t is equal to the residual disinfectant concentration at any given time t c 0 is equal to the initial concentration of disinfectant and r and k2 are disinfectant demand and decay constants respectively the constant r equals 1 c at any given time t the units of which are mg l 1 d c d t k 2 c c c 2 c t c 0 1 r 1 r e k 2 1 r t using the experimental residual concentrations of chlorine and paa at each time point and a house written python script iterations were performed to calculate r and k2 constants for each strain and corresponding culturing media sivaganesan et al 2008 an integrated estimate of true contact time denoted as c t in eq 3 was then calculated as the product of the initial disinfectant concentration and the integrated form of eq 2 as described by eqs 3 4 and 5 sivaganesan et al 2008 3 log n t n 0 k s c t 4 log n t n 0 k s c 0 0 t 1 r 1 r e k 2 1 r x d x 5 log n t n 0 k s c 0 1 r t 1 k 2 in 1 r e k 2 1 r t 1 r the initial disinfectant concentrations that produced a gradual decline in bacterial counts over time were 4 mg l and 8 mg l for chlorine and 1 mg l and 2 mg l for paa figs 1 a d and 2a d minimal deviations from first order kinetics were observed for these treatments which indicate lagging or tailing responses to disinfection therefore a first order model of chick watson s law was used to calculate the kinetic constant for each strain gyürék and finch 1998 since chick watson s law assumes that different manifestations of ct for a certain disinfectant will result in the same magnitude of log inactivation of a particular microorganism the bacterial counts from the aforementioned experiments were combined into one dataset to examine the overall disinfection kinetics of each bacterial strain and disinfectant type it should be noted that this assumption does not often hold in real world conditions even in controlled experiments and that different initial concentrations of disinfectant usually produces dose dependent responses in log inactivation peleg 2021 however these responses are minimized in large datasets as seen in sivaganesan et al 2008 therefore total log inactivation values log nt n0 were calculated by taking the log base 10 of the number of surviving bacteria divided by the initial number of bacteria the log inactivation values were then plotted against their corresponding integrated ct values and the slope of each resulting scatter plot which is equal to the kinetic constant k s was determined graphically using linear regression analysis in rstudio figs 3a d and table 1 2 4 expressions of ermb and bla ndm 1 antibiotic resistance genes inactivation experiments were repeated on the antibiotic resistant bacterial strains exactly as detailed earlier to capture the expression of ermb and bla ndm 1 genes during disinfection for the chlorination response test five 100 ml flasks containing 106 cfu ml of either erythromycin resistant e faecalis or meropenem resistant e fergusonii were treated with 0 mg l and 8 mg l free chlorine each of the five flasks represents a 100 ml aliquot to be filtered at time 0 5 15 25 and 35 minutes respectively for the paa response test similar batch tests were performed using 0 mg l and 2 mg l paa for the same time frame disinfection concentrations were chosen based on previous results which produced a significant difference in disinfection kinetics between the meropenem resistant and susceptible e fergusonii each of the 100 ml batch cultures was placed on 0 22 µm filters millipore usa at its respective time and preserved in rnalater thermo fisher scientific usa for further processing rna was extracted using the purelink rna mini kit invitrogen corporation carlsbad ca after the extraction of rna reverse transcription was conducted to convert approximately 2500 ng rna to cdna in each sample using the superscript vilo cdna synthesis kit life technology ny a quantstudio 3 real time pcr system thermo fisher scientific usa was used to analyze the expression of ermb and bla ndm 1 genes with the δ δct method which was developed by schmittgen and livak 2008 for each sample the abundance of bla ndm 1 and ermb gene transcripts whose primer sequences are specified in the aforementioned sections were first quantified in the machine using standard qpcr measurements but then was normalized by the abundance of16s rrna gene transcripts present the reference or housekeeping gene the results were then expressed as fold change relative to the arg gene transcript number measured at time zero therefore the units of the relative quantity of the δ δct are arg gene copy number at time t divided by the product of the 16s rrna gene copy number at time t and the arg gene copy number at time zero which is unitless a master mix was created for each primer set in which 10 µl ab power sybr green master mix 1 µl of each primer 10 mm 1 µl of 20 ng µl dna template and nuclease free water were added to make a total volume of 20 µl the qpcr process was modified using the veriflex temperature control technology during the annealing process it was followed by 2 min at 50 c 5 min at 94 c then 40 cycles consisting of 60 s at 94 c denaturation 90 s at 57 c for the bla ndm 1 gene 52 c for the ermb gene and 60 c for the 16s rrna gene annealing using verifelx mode 90 s at 72 c elongation and a final cycle consisting 10 min at 72 c 2 5 whole genome sequencing and draft genome analysis whole genome sequencing wgs was performed to examine other genetic pathways potentially responsible for cross resistance exhibited by the meropenem resistant e fergusonii strain each resistant and susceptible strain was cultured overnight in mhb at 37 c from a glycerol stock stored at 80 c the resistant strain was then four quadrant streaked on an mtec plate containing 4 μg ml meropenem while the susceptible strain was streaked onto mtec plates with and without 4 μg ml meropenem to reaffirm susceptibility single colonies were picked and the isolates were subjected to a three level subculture screening on their respective plates a final culture of each was prepared and the biomass pelleted from a 10 ml aliquot the genomic dna gdna was extracted from the biomass pellet according to griffiths et al 2000 total gdna was sent for sequencing to the huntsman cancer institute high throughput genomics center at the university of utah a gdna library was prepared using a nextera dna flex library prep kit illumina inc ca usa and then sequenced on miseq benchtop sequencer illumina inc usa the adapters from the 150 bp paired end raw reads were removed using tagcleaner v 0 16 schmeider et al 2010 the quality filtering of sequence reads for a mean phred quality score greater than 25 was performed using prinseq lite v 0 20 4 schmeider and edwards 2011 resulting in less than 5 loss of total reads the clc genomics workbench qiagen usa was used to perform de novo assembly of each genome using various parameters a word size of 64 and bubble size of 200 was chosen to assemble the final genomes since these parameters resulted the highest n50 score or the median proportion of contigs consisting of the greatest number of base pairs and lowest number of contigs or most complete genomes alhakami et al 2017 contigs less than 1 000 bps were then removed using an in house developed python script the summary of sequenced genomes are shown in table 2 2 6 gene synteny analysis of bacterial chromosomal and plasmids the alignment blocks of the two genomes chromosomes and plasmids were assessed with synteny analysis in brief the quality of the assembled genomes was evaluated using checkm park et al 2015 the draft genomes chromosomes and plasmids assemblies were 99 complete with 0 5 contamination the resulting meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii genomes were determined to be high quality assembled genomes the summary statistics of which are shown in table 3 bowers et al 2017 phylogenetic analysis of the two e fergusonii draft chromosomal genomes was performed using with the recovered 16s rrna gene national center for biotechnology information ncbi nucleotide basic local alignment search tool blastn altschul et al 1990 zhang et al 2000 analysis with 16s ribosomal rna bacteria and archaea was used for finding the microorganism that is phylogenetically closest to the meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii genomes e fergusonii atcc 35469 was assessed to be the closest known microorganism to both e fergusonii strains the reorder draft bacterial chromosome and plasmid genomes of meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii with the lowest locally collinear blocks lcbs was chosen for downstream analysis rissman et al 2009 the relative ordering of the meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii draft genome chromosome and plasmids scaffolds was performed based on the e fergusonii genome using mauve aligner rissman et al 2009 with default parameters genome annotation of the assembled reordered draft bacterial chromosome and plasmid genomes was performed using prokka seemann 2014 easyfig v 2 2 2 was used for synteny analysis and visualization sullivan et al 2011 post gene prediction and annotation a resistance gene identifier rgi analysis within the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card alcock et al 2020 was used to identify gene that could confer antibiotic resistance to the meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii strains a blastn analysis was performed with the draft bacterial chromosome and plasmid genome of meropenem resistant s1 e fergusonii as query and susceptible s2 e fergusonii as subject to evaluate the chromosomal and plasmid genome alignments the blastn results of the draft genome chromosomal and plasmid alignments was visualized the average nucleotide identity ani between the meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii genome chromosomal and plasmid sequences was calculated using orthoaniu algorithm yoon et al 2017 and ani calculator gorris et al 2007 the orthoaniu and ani are 97 42 and 97 56 respectively the ani 97 suggests meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii are bacterial strains for same species gorris et al 2007 2 7 statistical analysis the significance of difference in disinfection kinetics between antibiotic resistant and susceptible strains was assessed by performing an analysis of covariance ancova using r statistical software the significance of gene expression between the control culture and the culture treated with a disinfectant after 35 minutes was assessed by performing a paired two tailed t test using r statistical software considering a small data size in gene expression analysis a non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test was also conducted all of the results were considered significant with a p value less than 0 05 however some uncertainty has recently been raised around the meaningfulness of results after the imposition of a strict cut off p value of 0 05 therefore in this study a p value of less than 0 6 was also considered significant andrade 2019 grabowski 2016 3 results 3 1 chlorine and paa disinfection kinetics and expression of ermb and bla ndm 1 genes it was expected that the growth media would exert chlorine demand hence although breakpoint chlorination experiments were not conducted the initial amount of sodium hypochlorite and paa needed to maintain residual disinfectant concentrations were pre determined using batch experiments integrated second order models of free chlorine and paa demand and decay for each media and species are shown in supplementary figure s1a d the instantaneous demand and disinfectant decay were similar between species and strains and minimally affected the integrated second order model ct values however demand and decay differed by the disinfectant that was used additionally most of the demand was exerted by either the mhb or tsb culture media based on these experiments for initial total chlorine concentrations ranging from 16 mg l to 2 mg l residual total free chlorine concentration ranged from 1 9 0 82 mg l to 0 1 0 05 mg l after 5 minutes of reaction time likewise for initial paa concentrations of 5 mg l to 0 5 mg l instantaneous demand resulted in measured concentrations ranged from 2 0 0 58 mg l to 0 1 0 05 mg l after 5 minutes as indicated from the disinfection data the residual concentrations e g break point chlorination obtained were sufficient to cause bacterial inactivation the observed instantaneous disinfectant demand and disinfectant decay supported the use of a second order model to determine ct values the overall colony counts during chlorine disinfection for both pairs of resistant and susceptible strains of enterococcus faecalis and escherichia fergusonii at different free chlorine concentrations are shown in figs 1a d figs 1a b show chlorine inactivation results for meropenem resistant e fergusonii and susceptible e fergusonii likewise figs 1c d show chlorine inactivation results for erythromycin resistant e faecalis and susceptible e faecalis in cases where initial chlorine concentration was 2 mg l there was little to no reduction in bacteria counts for all strains tested due to low residual free chlorine concentration conversely in cases where initial chlorine concentration was 16 mg l there was an immediate inactivation of bacteria and subsequently no growth after five minutes all strains showed gradual log inactivation over time at 4 mg l and 8 mg l initial free chlorine fig 1 therefore the disinfection kinetics values for resistant and susceptible e faecalis and e fergusonii were calculated by combining the log inactivation and ct values for 4 mg l and 8 mg l initial free chlorine concentrations sivaganesan et al 2008 changes in bacterial concentration in response to chlorine dose over time was calculated using the integrated form of the second order disinfectant demand model and first order chick watson s law and was then statistically analyzed sivaganesan et al 2008 gyürék and finch 1998 the results of the linear regression analysis on the integrated second order ct and log inactivation values for chlorine disinfection kinetics are summarized in table 1 the overall colony counts during paa disinfection for both pairs of resistant and susceptible strains at all paa concentrations are shown in figs 2 a d much like disinfection by chlorine in cases where the initial paa concentration was 0 5 mg l there was only a one log inactivation in bacteria counts for all strains in cases where residual paa concentration was 5 mg l all strains were inactivated within 5 minutes all strains showed gradual log inactivation over time at 1 and 2 mg l initial paa therefore the disinfection kinetics values for erythromycin resistant and susceptible e faecalis and e fergusonii were calculated by combining the log inactivation and ct values for 1 mg l and 2 mg l initial paa concentrations the results of the linear regression for paa disinfection kinetics are shown in table 1 the results of the ancova analysis for chlorine disinfection are shown in figs 3 a and 3b for e faecalis and e fergusonii respectively the erythromycin susceptible e faecalis showed slightly less log inactivation than the resistant strain and the disinfection kinetic constants ks as represented by the slopes of the linear regression were not significantly different p value 0 0750 fig 3a the meropenem resistant e fergusonii exhibited less log inactivation than the susceptible strain p value 0 0590 and there was a significant difference in disinfection kinetics between the resistant and susceptible strains fig 3b the ancova analysis of paa disinfection kinetics for resistant and susceptible e faecalis and e fergusonii are shown in figs 3c and 3d respectively fig 3c shows that erythromycin resistant and susceptible e faecalis did not show a significant difference in log inactivation p value 0 279 while fig 3d shows the meropenem resistant e fergusonii showed much less log inactivation than the susceptible e fergusonii with significantly different disinfection kinetics constants p value 3 5 10 6 overall greater ct values were required to produce the same log inactivation in e faecalis than e fergusonii and the initial concentration and integrated ct values for paa disinfection were lower than required to produce the same log inactivation by chlorine disinfection figs 3a d the expressions of ermb and bla ndm 1 gene encoding new delhi metallo β lactamase in response to chlorine and paa disinfection are shown in figs 4 a d in terms of fold change relative abundance the relative gene expression in e faecalis for ermb between 0 mg l and 8 mg l free chlorine after 35 minutes was low overall and not significant p value 0 414 fig 4a additionally apart from a paired t test a non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test was also run and this enabled similar statistics bla ndm 1 encoding new delhi metallo β lactamase in e fergusonii was expressed at a much higher relative abundance in response to chlorine with nearly 200 gene copies after 35 minutes but not significantly due to the large standard deviation p 0 0790 fig 4b the gene expression for the control ermb strain mixed with 0 mg l paa was significantly higher than the gene expression for ermb with 2 mg l paa after 35 minutes p value 0 0547 fig 4c this trend was also observed but not significant for gene expression of bla ndm 1 in e fergusonii which was expressed slightly higher with 0 mg l paa p value 0 152 fig 4d 3 2 draft genomes chromosomal and plasmid and differences in disinfection resistance due to the difference in disinfection kinetics exhibited by meropenem resistant and susceptible e fergusonii strains as well as the inconclusive results of the gene expression experiments whole genome sequencing wgs was employed to understand the differences in the bacterial chromosomal and plasmid genomes wgs assembly gene prediction and annotation of predicted genes with special focus on genes that could confer antibiotic resistance was performed on both the meropenem resistant and susceptible e fergusonii strains the resulting statistics of the genome sequencing assembly and annotation are summarized in tables 2 and 3 the orthoaniu value was 97 42 and the average aligned length was 3 158 597 bp analysis of each draft chromosomal and plasmid genomes of the meropenem resistant and susceptible e fergusonii strains using prokka revealed a difference in the number of antibiotic resistant genes args between the chromosomes and plasmids of the two strains while maintaining overall similar distribution of arg types 20 genes with 100 similarity and 45 genes 94 similarity were identified for meropenem resistant s1 e fergusonii chromosome fig 5 a a total of 41 genes with 100 similarity and 11 genes 100 but 94 similarity were identified for the susceptible s2 e fergusonii chromosome fig 5a in addition two args were identified on plasmid of the meropenem resistant s1 e fergusonii chromosome with 100 similarity however none were identified for the susceptible s2 e fergusonii plasmid the rgi analysis of the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database resulted in slightly different findings card revealed that the resistant strain contained a total of 74 perfect and strict hits while the susceptible strain contained only 61 total arg hits in total both strains shared 44 efflux pump genes 11 target site alteration genes four antibiotic inactivation genes and two reduced permeability related args fig 5b the susceptible strain possessed only three unique args ef tu mdtm and mphb only one of which is an efflux pump while the resistant strain possessed 15 unique args of these 15 unique args seven of them were related to target site alteration two were related to extended spectrum beta lactamases two were related to antibiotic inactivation and three are related to efflux pump systems fig 5b these results showed that the meropenem resistant e fergusonii carried the bla ndm 1 gene but confirmed the presence of other extended spectrum beta lactamase genes esbls including bla tem 1 and bla ctx m 15 and two additional antibiotic inactivation resistance genes brp mbl and aada2 fig 5b the prokka analysis also showed that the chromosomes and plasmids of meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii both contained oxidative stress response genes soxr and soxs and peroxide scavenger genes kate katg ahpf and ahpc a synteny analysis between both bacterial chromosome genomes is shown in supplementary figure s2 additionally a synteny diagram of plasmid sequence and annotated genes is presented in supplementary figure s3 to acknowledge the limitations of this study first both resistant and susceptible strains of e fergusonii were same species based on average nucleotide frequency comparison 97 but not necessarily isogenic strains nevertheless genome wide comparison did show many similarities in key functional genes but differences in antibiotic resistance genes second whole genome transcriptomics rather than whole genome sequencing may have provided a clearer picture of the functionality of resistance mechanisms involved during oxidative stress 4 discussion 4 1 cross resistance to antibiotics and oxidizing disinfectants in this study the differences in disinfection kinetics were assessed for two antibiotic resistant strains and their susceptible counterparts as well as the gene expression of their relevant args in response to chlorine and paa disinfection although it was hypothesized that both antibiotic resistant strains would show less log inactivation than the susceptible bacteria only the e fergusonii carrying bla ndm 1 showed significant differences in disinfection kinetics to both chlorine and paa treatment although first order chick watson s disinfection kinetics was observed with minimal lagging or tailing when applying the second order disinfectant demand and decay model according to sivagensan et al 2008 there were observed dose dependent responses among the data at different initial concentrations of disinfectant some studies have shown that chick watson s law of first order disinfection kinetics do not produce interchangeable ct values and that the simplicity of the chick watson s law concept has certain limitations due to the irregularity and irreproducibility of stochastic models to measure a volatile chemical like sodium hypochlorite peleg 2021 however for the sake of utility the ct concept continues to be the most universally used mode of capturing log inactivation and standardization of disinfection kinetics across the country surprisingly the expression of the bla ndm 1 gene encoding new delhi metallo β lactamase by e fergusonii increased in response to chlorination as the relative abundance of bla ndm 1 encoding new delhi metallo β lactamase was higher than the control after 35 minutes of exposure to the disinfectant this may indicate that the majority of surviving bacteria are expressing the bla ndm 1 gene encoding new delhi metallo β lactamase relative to the microbial community at time zero and those in the control group it is also possible that chlorine disinfection may upregulate the expression of the bla ndm 1 gene overall however the expression of their respective args by both e faecalis and e fergusonii was higher in the control of paa after 35 minutes as was expected which indicates that the exposure to paa may downregulate the expression of bla ndm 1 gene in e fergusonii previous gene expression studies show that paa may upregulate oxidative stress and membrane transport genes in some strains of mycobacterium but downregulate dna repair and oxidative stress genes in others signifying the complexity of these response systems nde et al 2011 chang et al 2006 wong et al 2018 hou et al 2019 show that chlorine injures unregulated efflux pumps in pseudomonas aeruginosa the expressions of bla ndm 1 at a higher disinfectant dose is intriguing because one would expect most of the bacteria succumb to disinfection as observed for ermb carrying e faecalis in response to chlorine or to thrive in the absence of a disinfectant as observed for the controls some bacteria tend to over express functional genes under external stresses wu et al 2016 park and ely 2009 and this could be the possibility for the tested bacteria in this research other potential reasoning could be that disinfectant injured bacteria tend to offer a greater resistance to antibiotics and hence tend to express more antibiotic resistance gene as demonstrated by hou et al 2019 for pseudomonas aeruginosa these conflicting results indicate that additional mechanisms might be responsible for the observed resistance to oxidative disinfectants exhibited by the meropenem resistant e fergusonii compared to its susceptible counterpart 4 2 mechanism of antibiotic resistance by erythromycin resistant e faecalis the results show that erythromycin resistant e faecalis strain exhibited the same degree of inactivation as its susceptible counterpart in response to both chlorine and paa disinfection erythromycin is part of the macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls group that binds to the 50s ribosomal subunit of the bacterial chromosome waśko et al 2012 it interferes with the binding of aminoacyl trna to the ribosome preventing peptide elongation which prevents protein synthesis necessary for normal function schafhauser et al 2018 the most common erythromycin resistance gene is ermb which modifies the target site of antibiotic binding preventing the inhibition of ribosomal activity it is associated with high levels of resistance to erythromycin sutcliffe et al 1996 previous studies have found that bacteria which inhibit ribosomal binding of antibiotics have shown slightly lower rates of chlorine inactivation although only at concentrations greater than 1 5 mg l free cl2 huang et al 2013 however the authors were not able to explain how binding site inhibition confers chlorine resistance to bacteria oxidation of the cell membrane by chlorine and paa causing lysis would immediately cause cell death whereas diffusion through the cell membrane and oxidation of the intercellular material would also degrade the antibiotic binding site on the 50s ribosome there is a possibility that this previously tested strain possessed multi drug resistance as resistance genes are often co selected by other antibiotics when different resistance genes are associated with the same mobile genetic element galvin et al 2010 the results from this gene expression study of ermb in response to chlorine and paa disinfection also support the fact that ermb is not involved with cross resistance to oxidizing disinfectants other studies using the closely related enterococcus species e faecium support our finding that paa disinfection does not result in an increase in ermb turolla et al 2017 however these findings should be verified in future with more studies 4 3 potential mechanisms of cross resistance by meropenem resistant e fergusonii in contrast to the erythromycin resistant e faecalis strain the results of this study show that the meropenem resistant e fergusonii exhibited less log inactivation in response to both chlorine and paa therefore this strain must possess a mechanism of resistance to oxidizing disinfectants meropenem is a broad spectrum beta lactam that is part of the carbapenem group a class of antibiotics that are considered to be last resort treatments because of their ability to inactivate a large variety of multidrug resistant bacteria walsh 2010 meropenem inhibits cross linking of transpeptides preventing the formation of the cell wall as well as penetrates the cell wall and binds with penicillin binding proteins the most common penicillin resistant mutation baldwin et al 2008 however an emerging and dangerous class of args called carbapenemases have the ability to inhibit and destroy these powerful carbapenem antibiotics jeon et al 2015 specifically the recently discovered bla ndm 1 gene has shown that pathogens continue to evolve new and powerful antibiotic resistance mechanisms to carbapenems across the globe khan et al 2017 the bla ndm 1 gene produces ndm 1 a carbapenemase enzyme that performs extracellular digestion of antibiotics through hydrolysis via two zinc ions within its enzymatic active site sully et al 2016 it is possible that the zinc ions in the active site of ndm 1 have the ability to complex with hypochlorite as seen in heme haloperoxidase enzymes where hypochlorite complexes with the ferrous active site and which protects the cell under oxidative stress raven and dunford 2015 other studies have shown that zinc may also complex with acetic acid under physiological conditions krężel and maret 2016 hacht 2008 therefore it is possible that the action of ndm 1 may reduce the effects of disinfection through complexation since no difference in chlorine demand was found between the resistant and susceptible strains 4 4 draft genome bacterial chromosomal and plasmid analysis elucidates other potential mechanisms of cross resistance heightened gene expression of bla ndm 1 in response to chlorine supports the hypothesis of cross resistance of meropenem resistant e fergusonii via the production of the ndm 1 enzyme however the gene expression of bla ndm 1 in response to paa did not significantly differ from the control although meropenem resistant e fergusonii showed less log inactivation to paa than its susceptible counterpart it was hypothesized that the meropenem resistant e fergusonii strain then must possess another cross resistance mechanism such as peroxide scavenger genes oxidative stress resistance genes a thickened cell wall or multidrug efflux pump systems prasad and grobelak 2020 wong et al 2018 chiang and schellhorn 2012 in order to investigate these other potential mechanisms of cross resistance wgs of the resistant and susceptible e fergusonii strains was performed gene prediction and annotation using prokka revealed that both strains contained peroxide scavenger kate katg ahpf and ahpc genes both strains also contained the oxidative stress response systems soxr and soxs resistance due to a thickened cell wall is most often attributed to gram positive bacteria however studies have shown that some bacteria can also increase the thickness of their cell wall in response to certain chlorine containing antibiotics such as vancomycin de souza monteiro et al 2017 the results of the wgs analysis reveal that neither strain contained any vancomycin resistance genes which might contribute to cross resistance to oxidizing disinfectants however increased cell wall strength has been attributed to bacteria that resist beta lactam antibiotics therefore meropenem resistant e fergusonii may resist oxidative disinfection by a strengthened cell wall multidrug efflux pumps have been strongly implicated in oxidizing disinfectant cross resistance blanco et al 2016 however in this study wgs revealed that both strains contained over 40 efflux pump related args the meropenem resistant e fergusonii only contained 3 additional efflux pump genes and it is unknown which of these efflux pump systems may have been actively expressing during treatment with oxidizing disinfectants it was hypothesized that the genome of the resistant e fergusonii would show a much larger percentage of efflux pumps relative to the susceptible strain however since both contained a large number of efflux pumps it is unknown if the resistant strain was actively expressing those efflux pumps more thoroughly the complex interactions of regulators involved in the expression of efflux pump systems for heavy metal and antibiotic cross resistance has been heavily studied pal et al 2017 less is known about their role in resisting oxidizing disinfectants as oxidation causes indiscriminate damage to efflux pump systems jia et al 2015 transcriptome sequencing may be performed in future research to elucidate the activity of these systems and requires its own special study in this study wgs revealed that the meropenem resistant e fergusonii not only contained bla ndm 1 but also bla ctx m 15 and bla tem 1 both of which also work via the hydrolysis of a broad spectrum of antibiotics through the production of extracellular enzymes with functional active site canton et al 2012 palzkill 2018 the other seven args found within the meropenem resistant e fergusonii were related to target site alteration for specific antibiotics and therefore do not possess the potential for a cross resistance mechanism this study suggests that the production of an esbl related extracellular enzyme may provide cross resistance for meropenem resistant bacteria to both antibiotics and chlorine disinfection although the gene expression of ndm 1 was down regulated by paa these additional esbls and inactivating args may have been responsible for the difference in inactivation by paa the conclusion that there is potential for esbl containing bacteria to resist oxidizing disinfection through inactivation or complexation with a functional arg enzyme is the first of its kind and will require future research 4 5 conclusions this study compared the disinfection kinetics of two commonly found antibiotic resistant pathogens in the environment these bacteria were chosen in order to compare two disparate modes of phenotypic resistance to unrelated classes of antibiotics that do not involve the use of efflux pumps in addition two different disinfectants were examined the universally used sodium hypochlorite also known as bleach chlorine and the more environmentally friendly yet less thoroughly regulated oxidizing agent known as peracetic acid through extensive deductive research including gene expression experiments and whole genome sequencing we demonstrated why only some arbs and args may increase in relative abundance during wastewater and drinking water disinfection proving that not all args provide bacteria with resistance to oxidizing disinfectants such as chlorine and paa this study shows that ndm 1 producing e fergusonii could be potentially more dangerous than previously thought not only exhibiting resistance to the strongest antibiotics but to traditional wastewater and drinking water disinfection as well while ermb carrying e faecalis still poses a threat to human health through contamination and infection previously studied disinfection kinetics of enterococci in response to chlorine and paa disinfection may be applied to both resistant and susceptible strains in the design of disinfection treatment systems turolla et al 2017 however in order to inactivate bla ndm 1 carrying e fergusonii greater ct values for chlorine and paa must be used which increases the risk associated with these antibiotic resistant waterborne pathogens studies on the inactivation of arbs and args in wastewater and drinking water treatment are increasing but the application of these discoveries are minimal in both the united states and abroad although paa has been proposed as a stronger green alternative to chlorination both have been shown to increase

16708,this study was conducted to investigate mechanisms of cross resistance to chlorine and peracetic acid paa disinfectants by antibiotic resistant bacteria our study evaluated chlorine and paa based disinfection kinetics of erythromycin resistant enterococcus faecalis meropenem resistant escherichia fergusonii and susceptible strains of these species using the integrated second order disinfectant decay model and first order chick watson s law it was found that the meropenem resistant escherichia fergusonii strain showed significantly less log inactivation compared to the susceptible e fergusonii strain in response to both chlorine and paa disinfection p value 0 059 3 5 10 6 on the other hand the susceptible enterococcus faecalis strain showed similar log inactivation compared to the erythromycin resistant strain in response to either treatment p value 0 075 0 28 meropenem resistant e fergusonii showed an increase in gene expression of new delhi metallo β lactamase bla ndm 1 gene to chlorine but there was no increase in expression to paa whole genome sequencing wgs was then conducted to elucidate the differences in genes among both resistant and susceptible table e fergusonii strains the average nucleotide identity ani analysis of the draft genomes 97 similarity suggests that meropenem resistant e fergusonii s1 and meropenem susceptible e fergusonii s2 are the same species but different strains both strains have the same genes for oxidative stress pathways oxidative scavenger genes and nearly 40 different antibiotic efflux pump genes the chromosomal and plasmid draft genomes of meropenem resistant and susceptible e fergusonii strains each have 65 and 52 antibiotic resistance genes respectively of these the resistant e fergusonii strain harbored the extended spectrum beta lactamases bla ctx m 15 and bla tem 1 genes located on the chromosome and a bla tem 1 gene on the plasmid the overall findings of this study are significant as they reveal that antibiotic resistant and susceptible strains of e fergusonii exhibit different responses towards chlorine and paa disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance disinfection kinetics expression of genes peracetic acid enterococcus faecalis new delhi metallo β lactamase 1 introduction antibiotic resistance poses one of the most serious threats to global human health in the 21st century ahmad and khan 2019 choudhury et al 2012 munita and arias 2016 antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs have evolved to carry antibiotic resistance genes args through mutation selection and clonal expansion especially in environments with strong selective pressure such as hospitals palencia 2018 resistant infections are typically discovered in nosocomial settings ten years after antibiotics have been introduced to the public ventola 2015 today even the most powerful antibiotics have proven ineffectual against multidrug resistant bacteria such as those carrying the new delhi metallo β lactamase bla ndm 1 gene lee et al 2018 linciano et al 2018 although arbs are found naturally in the environment the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans animals and agriculture has resulted in the proliferation of antibiotic resistant pathogens worldwide levy and marshall 2004 czekalski et al 2016 silley et al 2012 these arbs and args are now considered contaminants of emerging concern cecs in aquatic environments sanderson et al 2016 unlike other contaminants arbs and args are conserved in bacterial populations through horizontal gene transfer hgt aminov 2011 therefore arbs and free nucleic args often end up in drinking water sources and treatment facilities through hydrologic cycling where they pose a threat to human health chen et al 2015 segura et al 2009 arbs and args have been shown to survive disinfection processes in wastewater and drinking water treatment yuan et al 2015 huang et al 2011 traditional chlorine disinfection continues to be the most popular choice for tertiary treatment due to its stability efficiency and low cost epa 1999 drinking water treatment facilities dwtfs typically add between 0 5 and 2 mg l of free chlorine to disinfect and combat microbial regrowth in drinking water distribution systems dwds sadiq and rodriguez 2004 cdc 2014 however the concentration of residual chlorine decreases due to various physico chemical factors as the water travels downstream in the distribution network bertelli et al 2018 chlorination also has several drawbacks namely that it reacts with natural organic matter to produce numerous disinfection byproducts dbps that have been shown to have carcinogenic and toxic effects gopal et al 2007 ran and li 2013 peroxyacetic or peracetic acid paa has been proposed as a green alternative to chlorination because it does not produce dbps and provides stronger oxidative effects although it is not as effective as chlorine for residual disinfection in drinking water distribution systems zhang et al 2019 chlorine bleach simply dissociates into hypochlorite ions in water while paa exists in aqueous equilibrium as acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide producing further oxidative effects sharma et al 2016 both disinfectants kill pathogens by oxidizing the cell wall and causing lysis or by diffusing through the cell wall and oxidizing the intracellular material epa chlorine disinfection 1999 epa peracetic acid disinfection 2012 although paa has been used for many years in european wastewater treatment its use has not been implemented in the united states and is a virtually nonexistent practice for drinking water treatment due to limitations in cost and operational knowledge xue et al 2017 the environmental protection agency has not yet established guidelines for paa disinfection in wastewater and drinking water treatment furthermore the efficacy of paa as a disinfectant for the removal of arbs and args in wastewater and drinking water treatment is still under investigation recent studies suggest that both chlorine and paa disinfection in potable water and wastewater treatment can increase the relative abundance of args and arbs in the final effluent liu et al 2018 dicesare et al 2016 bacteria acquire resistance to multiple environmental stressors via three main mechanisms a cross resistance b co resistance and c co selection krige 2009 pal et al 2017 blanco et al 2016 bouki et al 2013 while it is possible that an oxidative resistance gene may be co selected for the same plasmid as args very little is known about the genetic mechanisms of resistance to oxidative stress mara and horen 2003 multidrug efflux pump systems have been strongly implicated in resistance to oxidizing disinfectants inatsu et al 2010 karumathil et al 2014 however results from previous studies show that oxidizing disinfectants increase the gene expression of other classes of args not just efflux pumps karumathil et al 2014 templeton et al 2009 huang et al 2013 in this study we investigated the phenomenon of cross resistance in antibiotic resistant enterococcus faecalis and escherichia fergusonii and two corresponding susceptible strains certain strains of enterococci such as e faecalis and e coli the latter of which is a closely related species to e fergusonii are pathogens that can cause fatal gastrointestinal diseases when ingested via fecally contaminated drinking water byappanahalli et al 2012 riley et al 2011 the e fergusonii strains that cause infections are also known to be highly resistant to multiple antibiotics such as chloramphenicols ampicillin and gentamycin maheux et al 2014 for this study these two species were selected as model waterborne pathogens and they were chosen based on their ability to phenotypically resist completely unrelated classes of antibiotics that do not involve efflux pumps in order to explore other potential mechanisms of cross resistance therefore the overall objective of this study was to compare the disinfection kinetics of antibiotic resistant e faecalis and e fergusonii and their corresponding susceptible strains the objective also included an investigation on a potential mechanism for cross resistance to antibiotics and oxidizing agents we chose two bacteria e g e fergusonii and e faecalis from different phyla with two completely disparate modes of antibiotic resistance that does not include efflux pumps to see if antibiotic resistance genes themselves were responsible for cross resistance or whether other mechanisms of resistance to oxidizing disinfectants are possible it was hypothesized that antibiotic resistant pathogens would show less log inactivation and greater expression of args in response to chlorine and paa disinfection it was also hypothesized that the draft genomes bacterial chromosome and plasmid of meropenem resistant e fergusonii and susceptible e fergusonii strains would show differences in the number and diversity of args additionally resistance mediated by erythromycin resistance methylase and encoded by erm genes erma and ermb and additional active drug efflux gene mefa kataja et a 2000 hence in erythromycin e faecalis the expression of these functional genes was also studied in response to chlorine and paa disinfection likewise e fergusonii harbors the new delhi metallo β lactamase bla ndm 1 gene which offers resistance to the broad spectrum carbapenem group of antibiotics ashcroft et al 2019 hence the expression of this gene was studied in response to chlorine and paa disinfection 2 methods 2 1 isolation and characterization of antibiotic resistant pathogens the antibiotic resistant pathogens used in this study were isolated from agricultural and clinical samples the meropenem resistant e fergusonii was isolated in dr ramesh goel s laboratory at the university of utah in a previous study was phenotypically determined to be an escherichia coli strain using plating methods and genotypically determined to carry bla ndm 1 using pcr tanner et al 2017 the erythromycin resistant e faecalis was isolated by diluting one gram of swine manure sample in 0 85 w v saline solution a minimum inhibitory concentration mic test was performed using 98 mg g erythromycin serially diluted from 1 μg ml to 512 μg ml the diluted manure sample was four quadrant streaked on chromagar orientation chromogenic mueller hinton agar mha containing erythromycin and incubated at 37 c for 24 hours based on distinct colony morphology and color e faecalis colonies were picked from the 512 μg ml erythromycin containing plate and cultured in mueller hinton broth mhb the individual isolates were subjected to a three level subculture screening on mha containing 64 μg ml erythromycin to confirm antibiotic resistance and to negate the possibility of false positive results both the susceptible e faecalis and e fergusonii strains were obtained from a colleague in civil and environmental engineering department at the university of utah and susceptibility was tested by plating the culture on 64 mg l erythromycin and 4 mg l meropenem containing plates subsequently showing no growth in order to estimate an initial bacterial concentration of 108 cfu ml for disinfection growth curves were developed for each strain by measuring the optical density of each bacterial culture at 600nm in a spectrophotometer and the time was recorded when each strain reached mid log phase growth meropenem resistant and susceptible e fergusonii were cultured in mhb while erythromycin resistant and susceptible e faecalis showed optimal growth in tryptic soy broth tsb the isolated bacterial cultures were examined microscopically using an epifluorescence microscope bx 51 olympus japan and 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole fluorescent staining to confirm a pure culture and correct morphology had been obtained before being stored in 25 sterile glycerol detection of respective antibiotic resistance genes e g for e faecalis the erythromycin resistance was tested with erma ermb and mefa genes and for e fergusonii the bla ndm 1 gene was carried out using primer sets and pcr conditions as detailed in li et al 2010 and poirel et al 2011 respectively 2 2 chlorine and paa inactivation of antibiotic resistant pathogens for the chlorine inactivation tests a known volume of sodium hypochlorite 7 85 w v was added to 100 ml of sterilized 0 85 saline solution for a 50 mg l stock solution and diluted to produce concentrations of 2 4 8 and 16 mg l residual free chlorine free chlorine concentrations were confirmed using the hach free chlorine dpd method 10069 hach usa and a hach dr1900 spectrophotometer hach usa for the paa inactivation tests a known volume of paa 35 w v was added to 100 ml of sterilized 0 85 saline solution for a 6 mg l stock solution and diluted to produce concentrations of 0 5 1 2 and 5 mg l residual paa the paa concentrations were confirmed using the hach paa dpd method 10290 hach usa and dr1900 spectrophotometer measurement of paa and h2o2 concentration was adapted from dpd method for chlorine dominguez henao et al 2018 hach usa four complete mix batch reactors assays representing each disinfectant concentration were constructed in 100 ml flasks on stir plates set to 400 rpm and strains were tested individually the experiments were conducted at room temperature 20 c and neutral ph 7 5 by taking a culture sample at mid log growth phase approximately one ml of 108 cfu ml culture was added to each 100 ml assay with a stir bar to produce an approximate final concentration of 106 cfu ml subsequently 1 ml sample was taken at time 0 5 15 25 and 35 minutes a known volume of 0 02 m sodium thiosulfate was added to each sample to quench both residual chlorine and paa eramo et al 2017 the sample was then serially diluted from 106 cfu ml to approximately one cfu ml filtered through a 0 22 μm filter millipore usa and placed on a 47 mm petri dish containing a selective chromogenic agar for e faecalis modified difco mei agar was used and the strain was incubated at 42 c for 24 hours for e fergusonii modified difco mtec agar was used and the strain was first incubated at 37 c for two hours followed by incubation at 42 c for 22 hours colony forming units were counted on the filter paper for each dilution and the original bacterial concentration was calculated for each time and concentration the inactivation experiments were performed as technical triplicates in order to calculate the average and standard deviation of bacterial concentrations over time for each treatment in order to calculate true contact time the instantaneous demand in a time scale of minutes decay and residual concentrations of free chlorine and paa were measured in separate experiments under the exact same conditions mcclellan et al 2000 metcalf and eddy 2014 five and ten ml aliquots of free chlorine and paa respectively were taken at time 0 5 15 25 and 35 minutes they were immediately analyzed spectrophotometrically using hach methods 10069 and 10209 and the average residual concentrations obtained from technical triplicates were used to calculate integrated second order demand and decay model for contact time ct values gyürék and finch 1998 sivaganesan et al 2008 additional complete mix batch reactor assay experiments were preformed to confirm that the instantaneous demand was mainly exerted by each of the culturing media and that the observed residual disinfectant concentrations were the same between resistant and susceptible strains 2 3 disinfection demand and kinetics the number of surviving bacteria at each sampling time point was calculated after accounting for the dilution ratio and the aliquot volume used during each experiment in conditions where disinfectant demand and decay are negligible the disinfectant concentration is assumed to stay constant over the course of the contact time and zero order kinetics may be used to determine ct values however in this study all residual disinfectant experiments for both chlorine and paa exhibited both instantaneous demand and disinfection decay over time therefore a second order model of disinfectant demand and decay was used to determine an integrated estimate of contact time over the course of the experiment the differential form of this second order model is given by eq 1 and the integrated form of eq 1 gives the residual disinfectant concentration at any time in eq 2 in eq 1 c is equal to the initial concentration of disinfectant c is equal to the amount of disinfectant demand at any given time and k 2 is a disinfectant decay constant the units of which are 1 t in eq 2 c t is equal to the residual disinfectant concentration at any given time t c 0 is equal to the initial concentration of disinfectant and r and k2 are disinfectant demand and decay constants respectively the constant r equals 1 c at any given time t the units of which are mg l 1 d c d t k 2 c c c 2 c t c 0 1 r 1 r e k 2 1 r t using the experimental residual concentrations of chlorine and paa at each time point and a house written python script iterations were performed to calculate r and k2 constants for each strain and corresponding culturing media sivaganesan et al 2008 an integrated estimate of true contact time denoted as c t in eq 3 was then calculated as the product of the initial disinfectant concentration and the integrated form of eq 2 as described by eqs 3 4 and 5 sivaganesan et al 2008 3 log n t n 0 k s c t 4 log n t n 0 k s c 0 0 t 1 r 1 r e k 2 1 r x d x 5 log n t n 0 k s c 0 1 r t 1 k 2 in 1 r e k 2 1 r t 1 r the initial disinfectant concentrations that produced a gradual decline in bacterial counts over time were 4 mg l and 8 mg l for chlorine and 1 mg l and 2 mg l for paa figs 1 a d and 2a d minimal deviations from first order kinetics were observed for these treatments which indicate lagging or tailing responses to disinfection therefore a first order model of chick watson s law was used to calculate the kinetic constant for each strain gyürék and finch 1998 since chick watson s law assumes that different manifestations of ct for a certain disinfectant will result in the same magnitude of log inactivation of a particular microorganism the bacterial counts from the aforementioned experiments were combined into one dataset to examine the overall disinfection kinetics of each bacterial strain and disinfectant type it should be noted that this assumption does not often hold in real world conditions even in controlled experiments and that different initial concentrations of disinfectant usually produces dose dependent responses in log inactivation peleg 2021 however these responses are minimized in large datasets as seen in sivaganesan et al 2008 therefore total log inactivation values log nt n0 were calculated by taking the log base 10 of the number of surviving bacteria divided by the initial number of bacteria the log inactivation values were then plotted against their corresponding integrated ct values and the slope of each resulting scatter plot which is equal to the kinetic constant k s was determined graphically using linear regression analysis in rstudio figs 3a d and table 1 2 4 expressions of ermb and bla ndm 1 antibiotic resistance genes inactivation experiments were repeated on the antibiotic resistant bacterial strains exactly as detailed earlier to capture the expression of ermb and bla ndm 1 genes during disinfection for the chlorination response test five 100 ml flasks containing 106 cfu ml of either erythromycin resistant e faecalis or meropenem resistant e fergusonii were treated with 0 mg l and 8 mg l free chlorine each of the five flasks represents a 100 ml aliquot to be filtered at time 0 5 15 25 and 35 minutes respectively for the paa response test similar batch tests were performed using 0 mg l and 2 mg l paa for the same time frame disinfection concentrations were chosen based on previous results which produced a significant difference in disinfection kinetics between the meropenem resistant and susceptible e fergusonii each of the 100 ml batch cultures was placed on 0 22 µm filters millipore usa at its respective time and preserved in rnalater thermo fisher scientific usa for further processing rna was extracted using the purelink rna mini kit invitrogen corporation carlsbad ca after the extraction of rna reverse transcription was conducted to convert approximately 2500 ng rna to cdna in each sample using the superscript vilo cdna synthesis kit life technology ny a quantstudio 3 real time pcr system thermo fisher scientific usa was used to analyze the expression of ermb and bla ndm 1 genes with the δ δct method which was developed by schmittgen and livak 2008 for each sample the abundance of bla ndm 1 and ermb gene transcripts whose primer sequences are specified in the aforementioned sections were first quantified in the machine using standard qpcr measurements but then was normalized by the abundance of16s rrna gene transcripts present the reference or housekeeping gene the results were then expressed as fold change relative to the arg gene transcript number measured at time zero therefore the units of the relative quantity of the δ δct are arg gene copy number at time t divided by the product of the 16s rrna gene copy number at time t and the arg gene copy number at time zero which is unitless a master mix was created for each primer set in which 10 µl ab power sybr green master mix 1 µl of each primer 10 mm 1 µl of 20 ng µl dna template and nuclease free water were added to make a total volume of 20 µl the qpcr process was modified using the veriflex temperature control technology during the annealing process it was followed by 2 min at 50 c 5 min at 94 c then 40 cycles consisting of 60 s at 94 c denaturation 90 s at 57 c for the bla ndm 1 gene 52 c for the ermb gene and 60 c for the 16s rrna gene annealing using verifelx mode 90 s at 72 c elongation and a final cycle consisting 10 min at 72 c 2 5 whole genome sequencing and draft genome analysis whole genome sequencing wgs was performed to examine other genetic pathways potentially responsible for cross resistance exhibited by the meropenem resistant e fergusonii strain each resistant and susceptible strain was cultured overnight in mhb at 37 c from a glycerol stock stored at 80 c the resistant strain was then four quadrant streaked on an mtec plate containing 4 μg ml meropenem while the susceptible strain was streaked onto mtec plates with and without 4 μg ml meropenem to reaffirm susceptibility single colonies were picked and the isolates were subjected to a three level subculture screening on their respective plates a final culture of each was prepared and the biomass pelleted from a 10 ml aliquot the genomic dna gdna was extracted from the biomass pellet according to griffiths et al 2000 total gdna was sent for sequencing to the huntsman cancer institute high throughput genomics center at the university of utah a gdna library was prepared using a nextera dna flex library prep kit illumina inc ca usa and then sequenced on miseq benchtop sequencer illumina inc usa the adapters from the 150 bp paired end raw reads were removed using tagcleaner v 0 16 schmeider et al 2010 the quality filtering of sequence reads for a mean phred quality score greater than 25 was performed using prinseq lite v 0 20 4 schmeider and edwards 2011 resulting in less than 5 loss of total reads the clc genomics workbench qiagen usa was used to perform de novo assembly of each genome using various parameters a word size of 64 and bubble size of 200 was chosen to assemble the final genomes since these parameters resulted the highest n50 score or the median proportion of contigs consisting of the greatest number of base pairs and lowest number of contigs or most complete genomes alhakami et al 2017 contigs less than 1 000 bps were then removed using an in house developed python script the summary of sequenced genomes are shown in table 2 2 6 gene synteny analysis of bacterial chromosomal and plasmids the alignment blocks of the two genomes chromosomes and plasmids were assessed with synteny analysis in brief the quality of the assembled genomes was evaluated using checkm park et al 2015 the draft genomes chromosomes and plasmids assemblies were 99 complete with 0 5 contamination the resulting meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii genomes were determined to be high quality assembled genomes the summary statistics of which are shown in table 3 bowers et al 2017 phylogenetic analysis of the two e fergusonii draft chromosomal genomes was performed using with the recovered 16s rrna gene national center for biotechnology information ncbi nucleotide basic local alignment search tool blastn altschul et al 1990 zhang et al 2000 analysis with 16s ribosomal rna bacteria and archaea was used for finding the microorganism that is phylogenetically closest to the meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii genomes e fergusonii atcc 35469 was assessed to be the closest known microorganism to both e fergusonii strains the reorder draft bacterial chromosome and plasmid genomes of meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii with the lowest locally collinear blocks lcbs was chosen for downstream analysis rissman et al 2009 the relative ordering of the meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii draft genome chromosome and plasmids scaffolds was performed based on the e fergusonii genome using mauve aligner rissman et al 2009 with default parameters genome annotation of the assembled reordered draft bacterial chromosome and plasmid genomes was performed using prokka seemann 2014 easyfig v 2 2 2 was used for synteny analysis and visualization sullivan et al 2011 post gene prediction and annotation a resistance gene identifier rgi analysis within the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card alcock et al 2020 was used to identify gene that could confer antibiotic resistance to the meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii strains a blastn analysis was performed with the draft bacterial chromosome and plasmid genome of meropenem resistant s1 e fergusonii as query and susceptible s2 e fergusonii as subject to evaluate the chromosomal and plasmid genome alignments the blastn results of the draft genome chromosomal and plasmid alignments was visualized the average nucleotide identity ani between the meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii genome chromosomal and plasmid sequences was calculated using orthoaniu algorithm yoon et al 2017 and ani calculator gorris et al 2007 the orthoaniu and ani are 97 42 and 97 56 respectively the ani 97 suggests meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii are bacterial strains for same species gorris et al 2007 2 7 statistical analysis the significance of difference in disinfection kinetics between antibiotic resistant and susceptible strains was assessed by performing an analysis of covariance ancova using r statistical software the significance of gene expression between the control culture and the culture treated with a disinfectant after 35 minutes was assessed by performing a paired two tailed t test using r statistical software considering a small data size in gene expression analysis a non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test was also conducted all of the results were considered significant with a p value less than 0 05 however some uncertainty has recently been raised around the meaningfulness of results after the imposition of a strict cut off p value of 0 05 therefore in this study a p value of less than 0 6 was also considered significant andrade 2019 grabowski 2016 3 results 3 1 chlorine and paa disinfection kinetics and expression of ermb and bla ndm 1 genes it was expected that the growth media would exert chlorine demand hence although breakpoint chlorination experiments were not conducted the initial amount of sodium hypochlorite and paa needed to maintain residual disinfectant concentrations were pre determined using batch experiments integrated second order models of free chlorine and paa demand and decay for each media and species are shown in supplementary figure s1a d the instantaneous demand and disinfectant decay were similar between species and strains and minimally affected the integrated second order model ct values however demand and decay differed by the disinfectant that was used additionally most of the demand was exerted by either the mhb or tsb culture media based on these experiments for initial total chlorine concentrations ranging from 16 mg l to 2 mg l residual total free chlorine concentration ranged from 1 9 0 82 mg l to 0 1 0 05 mg l after 5 minutes of reaction time likewise for initial paa concentrations of 5 mg l to 0 5 mg l instantaneous demand resulted in measured concentrations ranged from 2 0 0 58 mg l to 0 1 0 05 mg l after 5 minutes as indicated from the disinfection data the residual concentrations e g break point chlorination obtained were sufficient to cause bacterial inactivation the observed instantaneous disinfectant demand and disinfectant decay supported the use of a second order model to determine ct values the overall colony counts during chlorine disinfection for both pairs of resistant and susceptible strains of enterococcus faecalis and escherichia fergusonii at different free chlorine concentrations are shown in figs 1a d figs 1a b show chlorine inactivation results for meropenem resistant e fergusonii and susceptible e fergusonii likewise figs 1c d show chlorine inactivation results for erythromycin resistant e faecalis and susceptible e faecalis in cases where initial chlorine concentration was 2 mg l there was little to no reduction in bacteria counts for all strains tested due to low residual free chlorine concentration conversely in cases where initial chlorine concentration was 16 mg l there was an immediate inactivation of bacteria and subsequently no growth after five minutes all strains showed gradual log inactivation over time at 4 mg l and 8 mg l initial free chlorine fig 1 therefore the disinfection kinetics values for resistant and susceptible e faecalis and e fergusonii were calculated by combining the log inactivation and ct values for 4 mg l and 8 mg l initial free chlorine concentrations sivaganesan et al 2008 changes in bacterial concentration in response to chlorine dose over time was calculated using the integrated form of the second order disinfectant demand model and first order chick watson s law and was then statistically analyzed sivaganesan et al 2008 gyürék and finch 1998 the results of the linear regression analysis on the integrated second order ct and log inactivation values for chlorine disinfection kinetics are summarized in table 1 the overall colony counts during paa disinfection for both pairs of resistant and susceptible strains at all paa concentrations are shown in figs 2 a d much like disinfection by chlorine in cases where the initial paa concentration was 0 5 mg l there was only a one log inactivation in bacteria counts for all strains in cases where residual paa concentration was 5 mg l all strains were inactivated within 5 minutes all strains showed gradual log inactivation over time at 1 and 2 mg l initial paa therefore the disinfection kinetics values for erythromycin resistant and susceptible e faecalis and e fergusonii were calculated by combining the log inactivation and ct values for 1 mg l and 2 mg l initial paa concentrations the results of the linear regression for paa disinfection kinetics are shown in table 1 the results of the ancova analysis for chlorine disinfection are shown in figs 3 a and 3b for e faecalis and e fergusonii respectively the erythromycin susceptible e faecalis showed slightly less log inactivation than the resistant strain and the disinfection kinetic constants ks as represented by the slopes of the linear regression were not significantly different p value 0 0750 fig 3a the meropenem resistant e fergusonii exhibited less log inactivation than the susceptible strain p value 0 0590 and there was a significant difference in disinfection kinetics between the resistant and susceptible strains fig 3b the ancova analysis of paa disinfection kinetics for resistant and susceptible e faecalis and e fergusonii are shown in figs 3c and 3d respectively fig 3c shows that erythromycin resistant and susceptible e faecalis did not show a significant difference in log inactivation p value 0 279 while fig 3d shows the meropenem resistant e fergusonii showed much less log inactivation than the susceptible e fergusonii with significantly different disinfection kinetics constants p value 3 5 10 6 overall greater ct values were required to produce the same log inactivation in e faecalis than e fergusonii and the initial concentration and integrated ct values for paa disinfection were lower than required to produce the same log inactivation by chlorine disinfection figs 3a d the expressions of ermb and bla ndm 1 gene encoding new delhi metallo β lactamase in response to chlorine and paa disinfection are shown in figs 4 a d in terms of fold change relative abundance the relative gene expression in e faecalis for ermb between 0 mg l and 8 mg l free chlorine after 35 minutes was low overall and not significant p value 0 414 fig 4a additionally apart from a paired t test a non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test was also run and this enabled similar statistics bla ndm 1 encoding new delhi metallo β lactamase in e fergusonii was expressed at a much higher relative abundance in response to chlorine with nearly 200 gene copies after 35 minutes but not significantly due to the large standard deviation p 0 0790 fig 4b the gene expression for the control ermb strain mixed with 0 mg l paa was significantly higher than the gene expression for ermb with 2 mg l paa after 35 minutes p value 0 0547 fig 4c this trend was also observed but not significant for gene expression of bla ndm 1 in e fergusonii which was expressed slightly higher with 0 mg l paa p value 0 152 fig 4d 3 2 draft genomes chromosomal and plasmid and differences in disinfection resistance due to the difference in disinfection kinetics exhibited by meropenem resistant and susceptible e fergusonii strains as well as the inconclusive results of the gene expression experiments whole genome sequencing wgs was employed to understand the differences in the bacterial chromosomal and plasmid genomes wgs assembly gene prediction and annotation of predicted genes with special focus on genes that could confer antibiotic resistance was performed on both the meropenem resistant and susceptible e fergusonii strains the resulting statistics of the genome sequencing assembly and annotation are summarized in tables 2 and 3 the orthoaniu value was 97 42 and the average aligned length was 3 158 597 bp analysis of each draft chromosomal and plasmid genomes of the meropenem resistant and susceptible e fergusonii strains using prokka revealed a difference in the number of antibiotic resistant genes args between the chromosomes and plasmids of the two strains while maintaining overall similar distribution of arg types 20 genes with 100 similarity and 45 genes 94 similarity were identified for meropenem resistant s1 e fergusonii chromosome fig 5 a a total of 41 genes with 100 similarity and 11 genes 100 but 94 similarity were identified for the susceptible s2 e fergusonii chromosome fig 5a in addition two args were identified on plasmid of the meropenem resistant s1 e fergusonii chromosome with 100 similarity however none were identified for the susceptible s2 e fergusonii plasmid the rgi analysis of the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database resulted in slightly different findings card revealed that the resistant strain contained a total of 74 perfect and strict hits while the susceptible strain contained only 61 total arg hits in total both strains shared 44 efflux pump genes 11 target site alteration genes four antibiotic inactivation genes and two reduced permeability related args fig 5b the susceptible strain possessed only three unique args ef tu mdtm and mphb only one of which is an efflux pump while the resistant strain possessed 15 unique args of these 15 unique args seven of them were related to target site alteration two were related to extended spectrum beta lactamases two were related to antibiotic inactivation and three are related to efflux pump systems fig 5b these results showed that the meropenem resistant e fergusonii carried the bla ndm 1 gene but confirmed the presence of other extended spectrum beta lactamase genes esbls including bla tem 1 and bla ctx m 15 and two additional antibiotic inactivation resistance genes brp mbl and aada2 fig 5b the prokka analysis also showed that the chromosomes and plasmids of meropenem resistant s1 and susceptible s2 e fergusonii both contained oxidative stress response genes soxr and soxs and peroxide scavenger genes kate katg ahpf and ahpc a synteny analysis between both bacterial chromosome genomes is shown in supplementary figure s2 additionally a synteny diagram of plasmid sequence and annotated genes is presented in supplementary figure s3 to acknowledge the limitations of this study first both resistant and susceptible strains of e fergusonii were same species based on average nucleotide frequency comparison 97 but not necessarily isogenic strains nevertheless genome wide comparison did show many similarities in key functional genes but differences in antibiotic resistance genes second whole genome transcriptomics rather than whole genome sequencing may have provided a clearer picture of the functionality of resistance mechanisms involved during oxidative stress 4 discussion 4 1 cross resistance to antibiotics and oxidizing disinfectants in this study the differences in disinfection kinetics were assessed for two antibiotic resistant strains and their susceptible counterparts as well as the gene expression of their relevant args in response to chlorine and paa disinfection although it was hypothesized that both antibiotic resistant strains would show less log inactivation than the susceptible bacteria only the e fergusonii carrying bla ndm 1 showed significant differences in disinfection kinetics to both chlorine and paa treatment although first order chick watson s disinfection kinetics was observed with minimal lagging or tailing when applying the second order disinfectant demand and decay model according to sivagensan et al 2008 there were observed dose dependent responses among the data at different initial concentrations of disinfectant some studies have shown that chick watson s law of first order disinfection kinetics do not produce interchangeable ct values and that the simplicity of the chick watson s law concept has certain limitations due to the irregularity and irreproducibility of stochastic models to measure a volatile chemical like sodium hypochlorite peleg 2021 however for the sake of utility the ct concept continues to be the most universally used mode of capturing log inactivation and standardization of disinfection kinetics across the country surprisingly the expression of the bla ndm 1 gene encoding new delhi metallo β lactamase by e fergusonii increased in response to chlorination as the relative abundance of bla ndm 1 encoding new delhi metallo β lactamase was higher than the control after 35 minutes of exposure to the disinfectant this may indicate that the majority of surviving bacteria are expressing the bla ndm 1 gene encoding new delhi metallo β lactamase relative to the microbial community at time zero and those in the control group it is also possible that chlorine disinfection may upregulate the expression of the bla ndm 1 gene overall however the expression of their respective args by both e faecalis and e fergusonii was higher in the control of paa after 35 minutes as was expected which indicates that the exposure to paa may downregulate the expression of bla ndm 1 gene in e fergusonii previous gene expression studies show that paa may upregulate oxidative stress and membrane transport genes in some strains of mycobacterium but downregulate dna repair and oxidative stress genes in others signifying the complexity of these response systems nde et al 2011 chang et al 2006 wong et al 2018 hou et al 2019 show that chlorine injures unregulated efflux pumps in pseudomonas aeruginosa the expressions of bla ndm 1 at a higher disinfectant dose is intriguing because one would expect most of the bacteria succumb to disinfection as observed for ermb carrying e faecalis in response to chlorine or to thrive in the absence of a disinfectant as observed for the controls some bacteria tend to over express functional genes under external stresses wu et al 2016 park and ely 2009 and this could be the possibility for the tested bacteria in this research other potential reasoning could be that disinfectant injured bacteria tend to offer a greater resistance to antibiotics and hence tend to express more antibiotic resistance gene as demonstrated by hou et al 2019 for pseudomonas aeruginosa these conflicting results indicate that additional mechanisms might be responsible for the observed resistance to oxidative disinfectants exhibited by the meropenem resistant e fergusonii compared to its susceptible counterpart 4 2 mechanism of antibiotic resistance by erythromycin resistant e faecalis the results show that erythromycin resistant e faecalis strain exhibited the same degree of inactivation as its susceptible counterpart in response to both chlorine and paa disinfection erythromycin is part of the macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls group that binds to the 50s ribosomal subunit of the bacterial chromosome waśko et al 2012 it interferes with the binding of aminoacyl trna to the ribosome preventing peptide elongation which prevents protein synthesis necessary for normal function schafhauser et al 2018 the most common erythromycin resistance gene is ermb which modifies the target site of antibiotic binding preventing the inhibition of ribosomal activity it is associated with high levels of resistance to erythromycin sutcliffe et al 1996 previous studies have found that bacteria which inhibit ribosomal binding of antibiotics have shown slightly lower rates of chlorine inactivation although only at concentrations greater than 1 5 mg l free cl2 huang et al 2013 however the authors were not able to explain how binding site inhibition confers chlorine resistance to bacteria oxidation of the cell membrane by chlorine and paa causing lysis would immediately cause cell death whereas diffusion through the cell membrane and oxidation of the intercellular material would also degrade the antibiotic binding site on the 50s ribosome there is a possibility that this previously tested strain possessed multi drug resistance as resistance genes are often co selected by other antibiotics when different resistance genes are associated with the same mobile genetic element galvin et al 2010 the results from this gene expression study of ermb in response to chlorine and paa disinfection also support the fact that ermb is not involved with cross resistance to oxidizing disinfectants other studies using the closely related enterococcus species e faecium support our finding that paa disinfection does not result in an increase in ermb turolla et al 2017 however these findings should be verified in future with more studies 4 3 potential mechanisms of cross resistance by meropenem resistant e fergusonii in contrast to the erythromycin resistant e faecalis strain the results of this study show that the meropenem resistant e fergusonii exhibited less log inactivation in response to both chlorine and paa therefore this strain must possess a mechanism of resistance to oxidizing disinfectants meropenem is a broad spectrum beta lactam that is part of the carbapenem group a class of antibiotics that are considered to be last resort treatments because of their ability to inactivate a large variety of multidrug resistant bacteria walsh 2010 meropenem inhibits cross linking of transpeptides preventing the formation of the cell wall as well as penetrates the cell wall and binds with penicillin binding proteins the most common penicillin resistant mutation baldwin et al 2008 however an emerging and dangerous class of args called carbapenemases have the ability to inhibit and destroy these powerful carbapenem antibiotics jeon et al 2015 specifically the recently discovered bla ndm 1 gene has shown that pathogens continue to evolve new and powerful antibiotic resistance mechanisms to carbapenems across the globe khan et al 2017 the bla ndm 1 gene produces ndm 1 a carbapenemase enzyme that performs extracellular digestion of antibiotics through hydrolysis via two zinc ions within its enzymatic active site sully et al 2016 it is possible that the zinc ions in the active site of ndm 1 have the ability to complex with hypochlorite as seen in heme haloperoxidase enzymes where hypochlorite complexes with the ferrous active site and which protects the cell under oxidative stress raven and dunford 2015 other studies have shown that zinc may also complex with acetic acid under physiological conditions krężel and maret 2016 hacht 2008 therefore it is possible that the action of ndm 1 may reduce the effects of disinfection through complexation since no difference in chlorine demand was found between the resistant and susceptible strains 4 4 draft genome bacterial chromosomal and plasmid analysis elucidates other potential mechanisms of cross resistance heightened gene expression of bla ndm 1 in response to chlorine supports the hypothesis of cross resistance of meropenem resistant e fergusonii via the production of the ndm 1 enzyme however the gene expression of bla ndm 1 in response to paa did not significantly differ from the control although meropenem resistant e fergusonii showed less log inactivation to paa than its susceptible counterpart it was hypothesized that the meropenem resistant e fergusonii strain then must possess another cross resistance mechanism such as peroxide scavenger genes oxidative stress resistance genes a thickened cell wall or multidrug efflux pump systems prasad and grobelak 2020 wong et al 2018 chiang and schellhorn 2012 in order to investigate these other potential mechanisms of cross resistance wgs of the resistant and susceptible e fergusonii strains was performed gene prediction and annotation using prokka revealed that both strains contained peroxide scavenger kate katg ahpf and ahpc genes both strains also contained the oxidative stress response systems soxr and soxs resistance due to a thickened cell wall is most often attributed to gram positive bacteria however studies have shown that some bacteria can also increase the thickness of their cell wall in response to certain chlorine containing antibiotics such as vancomycin de souza monteiro et al 2017 the results of the wgs analysis reveal that neither strain contained any vancomycin resistance genes which might contribute to cross resistance to oxidizing disinfectants however increased cell wall strength has been attributed to bacteria that resist beta lactam antibiotics therefore meropenem resistant e fergusonii may resist oxidative disinfection by a strengthened cell wall multidrug efflux pumps have been strongly implicated in oxidizing disinfectant cross resistance blanco et al 2016 however in this study wgs revealed that both strains contained over 40 efflux pump related args the meropenem resistant e fergusonii only contained 3 additional efflux pump genes and it is unknown which of these efflux pump systems may have been actively expressing during treatment with oxidizing disinfectants it was hypothesized that the genome of the resistant e fergusonii would show a much larger percentage of efflux pumps relative to the susceptible strain however since both contained a large number of efflux pumps it is unknown if the resistant strain was actively expressing those efflux pumps more thoroughly the complex interactions of regulators involved in the expression of efflux pump systems for heavy metal and antibiotic cross resistance has been heavily studied pal et al 2017 less is known about their role in resisting oxidizing disinfectants as oxidation causes indiscriminate damage to efflux pump systems jia et al 2015 transcriptome sequencing may be performed in future research to elucidate the activity of these systems and requires its own special study in this study wgs revealed that the meropenem resistant e fergusonii not only contained bla ndm 1 but also bla ctx m 15 and bla tem 1 both of which also work via the hydrolysis of a broad spectrum of antibiotics through the production of extracellular enzymes with functional active site canton et al 2012 palzkill 2018 the other seven args found within the meropenem resistant e fergusonii were related to target site alteration for specific antibiotics and therefore do not possess the potential for a cross resistance mechanism this study suggests that the production of an esbl related extracellular enzyme may provide cross resistance for meropenem resistant bacteria to both antibiotics and chlorine disinfection although the gene expression of ndm 1 was down regulated by paa these additional esbls and inactivating args may have been responsible for the difference in inactivation by paa the conclusion that there is potential for esbl containing bacteria to resist oxidizing disinfection through inactivation or complexation with a functional arg enzyme is the first of its kind and will require future research 4 5 conclusions this study compared the disinfection kinetics of two commonly found antibiotic resistant pathogens in the environment these bacteria were chosen in order to compare two disparate modes of phenotypic resistance to unrelated classes of antibiotics that do not involve the use of efflux pumps in addition two different disinfectants were examined the universally used sodium hypochlorite also known as bleach chlorine and the more environmentally friendly yet less thoroughly regulated oxidizing agent known as peracetic acid through extensive deductive research including gene expression experiments and whole genome sequencing we demonstrated why only some arbs and args may increase in relative abundance during wastewater and drinking water disinfection proving that not all args provide bacteria with resistance to oxidizing disinfectants such as chlorine and paa this study shows that ndm 1 producing e fergusonii could be potentially more dangerous than previously thought not only exhibiting resistance to the strongest antibiotics but to traditional wastewater and drinking water disinfection as well while ermb carrying e faecalis still poses a threat to human health through contamination and infection previously studied disinfection kinetics of enterococci in response to chlorine and paa disinfection may be applied to both resistant and susceptible strains in the design of disinfection treatment systems turolla et al 2017 however in order to inactivate bla ndm 1 carrying e fergusonii greater ct values for chlorine and paa must be used which increases the risk associated with these antibiotic resistant waterborne pathogens studies on the inactivation of arbs and args in wastewater and drinking water treatment are increasing but the application of these discoveries are minimal in both the united states and abroad although paa has been proposed as a stronger green alternative to chlorination both have been shown to increase the relative abundance of certain arbs and args in wastewater and drinking water lin et al 2016 jia et al 2015 despite other alternatives chlorination continues to be the most widespread disinfectant used across the world not only in water treatment facilities epa chlorine disinfection 1999 it is paramount that the proper doses of chlorine be given to inactivate pathogens especially those that could potentially be antibiotic resistant this is especially important in low and middle income countries that heavily rely on chlorine disinfection but where unregulated use of antibiotics industrial dumping and contaminated surface waters increase the threat of antibiotic resistant waterborne disease owoseni and okoh 2017 the results of this research will inform dose response control of antibiotic resistant pathogens in water and wastewater treatment facilities as well as illuminate a potential mechanism of cross resistance behind drinking water and wastewater disinfection

16709,in recent years karst water has been polluted by emerging pollutants such as antibiotics in this study the bacterial communities and antibiotic resistance genes args in antibiotics contaminated karst river was studied in summer and winter the concentration of antibiotics in winter karst river is higher than that in summer and there are significant differences in structure of bacterial community and args between karst river water samples aminoglycoside beta lactamase and multidrug are the main types of args and transposons play an important role in the spread of args the horizontal gene transfer hgt of args between bacteria mediated by mobile genetic elements mges would cause the spread of args and bring potential ecological risks in addition we found that the risk of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria arpb in winter was possibly higher than that in summer it was suggested that the discharge of antibiotics water amount and seasonal occurrence time of human intestinal diseases affect the risks caused by antibiotics contaminants this study helps us to understand the transmission mechanism of args and their potential seasonal ecological risks in complex karst water

have been extensively studied berendonk et al 2015 organization 2014 van boeckel et al 2015 the karst system is widely distributed in the world as an important and special type of ecological environment the karst water system is complex and has unique hydrogeological characteristics of high hydraulic conductivity and short residence time which makes the karst water system susceptible to pollution from human activities and the rapid spread of pollutants in a wide range xiang et al 2020 in 2019 it was reported that karst rivers in southwest china have been affected by antibiotic pollution for a long time and there are different degrees of ecological risks huang et al 2019a the water environment is an important source and sink of args the discharge of sewage treatment plants the unreasonable stacking of garbage and the pollutants discharged from aquaculture plants are eventually recycled into the water environment and drive the spread of args lavilla lerma et al 2014 liu

reclaimed water irrigation the tetracycline antibiotics are not only positively correlated with tetracycline resistance genes but also positively correlated with aminoglycosides and sulfonamides resistance genes wang et al 2014 the concentration of antibiotics in the water body is usually very low after migration and dilution but low concentration antibiotics can be used as signal molecules between or within the microbial populations causing the microbial populations in the community to respond adaptively and then promote the args transmission between microorganisms aminov 2009 seasonal

agriculture and wastewater treatment bondarczuk et al 2016 chen and zhang 2013 in the karst water system the water level and flow vary significantly in the dry season and rainy season guo et al 2015 resulting in seasonal differences in the chemical properties of karst groundwater such as electrical conductivity salinity so4 2 and hco3 concentration li et al 2007 the factors affecting the generation and spread of args are complex and the main influencing factors and seasonal response mechanisms in the karst system need to be revealed urgently the karst river generally consists of aboveground and underground parts and several tributaries converge within a short distance which is different from other surface river and underground river the interaction between underground water and aboveground water is strong and seasonal water quantity changes obviously coxon and drew 2000 in addition the pollution sources such as antibiotic of the tributaries sometimes are obviously different and contaminated a karst river for a long time in southwest china huang et al 2019a due to the different dilution and migration rates of water bodies multiple antibiotic types from different sources are likely to have different impacts on the selection pressure of microbial communities and transmission of args in this study we focused on the composition and distribution of args in this typical karst river the spread mechanisms of args and to explore the ecological risks caused by args in winter dry period and summer wet period respectively this will benefit the antibiotics pollution

through ht qpcr analysis 249 and 198 subtypes of a combination of args and mges were detected in summer and winter respectively the args are divided into 3 types according to the resistance mechanism antibiotic deactivate resistance genes 53 in winter and summer efflux pump resistance genes winter 35 summer 39 and cellular protection resistance genes winter 8 summer 7 the args are divided into 8 categories including aminoglycoside beta lactamase chloramphenicol mlsb macrolides lincosamides streptomycin b sulfonamide tetracycline vancomycin and multidrug multi antibiotic resistance genes the proportions in winter and summer are also similar and the top three are aminoglycoside winter 39 summer 39 multidrug winter 29 summer 34 and beta lactamase winter 10 summer 9 fig 1 in summer and winter samples the dominant abundant args are aminoglycoside resistance genes aada 01 aada 02 aada1 aada2 03 multidrug resistance genes qacedelta1 01 qacedelta1 02 and sulfonamide resistance gene sul2 the abundance of all 7 args in summer are higher than in winter but the difference is not significant in previous study the dominant abundant args are blaoxa 21 emra erea mdtk and tet g in surface river jiang et al 2018 sul1 in estuarine lake water yuan et al 2019 mlsb resistance genes in urban river discharge huang et al 2019b which are different from the karst river in this study the types of args generally were correlated with the main types of antibiotic contamination li et al 2012 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 moreover the composition of args is more complex and diverse in water bodies polluted by multiple antibiotics zhang et al 2020b by high through sequencing 521 135 and 507 015 high quality sequences were obtained in summer and winter water samples of karst river respectively the number of sequences in 20 samples ranged from 39 994 to 57 389 the simpson indexes show that the diversity of bacterial community in summer samples is higher than that in winter in summer proteobacteria 50 07 is the most abundant bacterial phyla followed by bacteroidetes 24 40 and cyanobacteria 8 09 in winter the dominant bacteria phyla are bacteroidetes 39 44 proteobacteria 33 57 and cyanobacteria 14 47 at the genus level arcobacter 14 71 accounts for the largest proportion in summer followed by flavobacterium 9 51 and cyanobacteria 5 79 in winter flavobacterium 29 02 accounts for the largest proportion followed by planktothrix 7 17 and cyanobacteria 7 07 fig s2 3 2 characterization of environmental factors in karst water we analyzed 35 subtypes of antibiotics including 16 quinolones 9 sulfonamides 4 tetracyclines 4 macrolides as well as lincomycin and chloramphenicol and we found 27 out of these 35 subtypes of antibiotics in the winter and summer karst water samples there was a difference in the types of antibiotics detected in winter and summer samples with 23 antibiotics were detected in summer and 15 in winter table s2 and 11 antibiotics detected both in summer and winter the concentration of tetracycline oxytetracycline erythromycin roxithromycin lincomycin and norfloxacin were significantly higher in winter samples than in summer table s3 these two antibiotics lincomycin and ofloxacin were found in all samples indicating the prevalence of antibiotics in this area the total concentration of antibiotics is higher in winter than in summer the total concentration of antibiotics ranges from 96 to 1097 ng l mainly are quinolones macrolides and lincomycin table s4 which is related to antibiotic usage caused by seasonal epidemic infections caucci et al 2016 novo et al 2013 the concentration of quinolone is both high in winter and summer the concentration of chloramphenicol tetracycline macrolide and lincomycin in winter karst river were significantly higher than those in summer fig s3 antibiotics are an important factor affecting the distribution and diffusion of args gillings and stokes 2012 zhang et al 2011 different concentration of antibiotics in winter and summer is likely to affect the abundance of args in karst river of this study area the concentration of ca2 hco3 and ta were higher in summer than in winter the concentration of nh4 in winter was significantly higher than that in summer while the concentration of no2 and no3 were significantly higher in summer than in winter fig s4 3 3 spread of args in bacterial community in karst water a total of 10 mges including 8 transposon transposase genes tnpa 01 tnpa 02 tnpa 03 tnpa 04 tnpa 05 tnpa 07 tp614 and is613 integrase gene inti1 and a clinical type of integrase gene cinti1 were detected this indicated the prevalence of mges in antibiotic contaminated karst rivers hgt is the main mechanism for the widespread distribution of args and mges play an important role dobrovol skaya et al 2017 gyles and boerlin 2014 ols was used to examine the correlation between args and mges as shown in fig 2 there is a positive linear correlation between args and mges r2 0 57272 p 0 00011 which suggests the potential impact of mges on the transfer of args in antibiotics contaminated karst river zheng et al 2018 the co occurrence network analysis of args and mges showed the potential spread of args by mges fig s5 all 10 subtypes mges had significant correlation with args and most of args were significantly correlated with the transposon tnpa 01 34 links tnpa 02 43 links tnpa 05 40 links tnpa 07 39 links and is613 22 links fig s6 indicating that these 5 transposons played important roles in the transmission of args in this study area bacteria spread args between environmental bacteria by transferring genetic information through mges pruden et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 previous studies demonstrated that inti1 gene had strong positive correlation with suli gene and teto gene in urban and rural sewage treatment systems and raw sludge chen and zhang 2013 miller et al 2013 in this study cinti 1class1 had significant correlation with multidrug resistance gene qacedelta1 02 aminoglycoside resistance genes aac6 ibaka aaca4 01 and aac6 ibaka aaca4 02 beta lactamase resistance gene blages and chloramphenicol resistance gene icm1a1 02 inti 1clinic had significant correlation with multidrug resistance gene qach 02 therefore in this study area beta lactamase aminoglycoside multidrug tetracycline and mlsb resistance genes are likely to be transmitted by the above transposons tnpa 01 tnpa 02 tnpa 05 tnpa 07 and is613 and integrons cinti 1class1 and inti 1clinic meanwhile the mges in microorganisms can carry multiple types of args and one type of args can also be carried by multiple genetic elements in fig 3 the potential core microorganisms carrying args and spread of args by mges were revealed bacterial community in karst river was divided into 4 modules each of which is a potential co evolutionary ecological function group zhao et al 2007 module 1 included 8 genera of bacteria sulfurospirillum desulfobulbus bacteroides macellibacteroides paludibacter desulfomicrobium arcobacter and vadinbc wastewater sludge group 2 transposon is613 and tnpa 07 and 6 types of args tetracycline beta lactamase chloramphenicol aminoglycoside mlsb and others transposons tnpa 03 tnpa 04 tnpa 05 and tp614 and 7 genera of bacteria aeromonas acinetobacter rheinheimera pseudomonas trichococcus norank f leptotrichiaceae and unclassified f comamonadaceae in module 2 in module 2 the transposons tp614 and tnpa 05 have significant correlation with tetracycline beta lactamase and multidrug resistance genes two types of transposon tnpa 01 and tnpa 02 and two types of integrons inti 1clinic and cinti 1class1 were included in module 3 integrators inti1 were found to have a host relationship with escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae dobrovol skaya et al 2017 both the bacteria and mges in module 3 had significant correlations with args the vancomycin resistance genes in module 4 had significant correlations with 3 genera norank f xanthomonadales incertae sedis norank o sc i 84 and norank f xanthomonadaceae in fig s7 the network analysis between bacteria mges and the resistance gene at subtype s level we also found the significant correlations with each other the mges tp614 tnpa 05 and is613 had significant correlation with a variety of args and microorganisms table s5 the bacteria with positive relationship are likely to be the most important carrier for the transmission of resistance genes vaz moreira et al 2014 there was potential transmission of args in all four modules and different ecological groups and their functions were all affected under the selective pressure of antibiotic contamination 3 4 difference of bacterial community and their potential carrying args in winter and summer karst river pcoa was performed to analyze the differences of the bacterial communities in winter and summer fig 4a the winter samples were closely clustered and separated from the summer samples along pcoa1 with a difference of 28 it shows that the structure of bacterial community in the karst river is different in winter and summer cao et al 2011 su et al 2017 the differences between the bacterial community at the genus level identified in winter and summer were analyzed fig 4b the proportions of flavobacterium planktothrix hgcl clade pseudomonas and fluviicola in the winter samples were significantly higher than those in summer samples while the proportions of arcobacter and novosphingobium in summer samples were significantly higher than that in winter samples flavobacterium and pseudomonas are widely found in soil fresh water and sea water and they are common conditional pathogen bernardet et al 1996 arcobacter has a wide variety of habitats and hosts including humans and animals debruyne et al 2008 wesley and miller 2010 and they are pathogens of human gastrointestinal diseases jiang et al 2010 since arcobacter was highly detected in summer the potential risks of these bacteria posting human health in this area cannot be neglected especially when they are the potential args hosts according to the result of ht qpcr the relative abundance of total resistance genes in summer samples is higher than that in winter samples fig s8 with an average of 0 87 copies 16s rrna copy in summer and 0 44 copies 16s rrna copy in winter this indicates that higher temperatures may promote the spread of args su et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 while seasonal temperature changes have significant correlation with args sun et al 2016 the pcoa analysis based on bray curtis distance between samples also showed that the composition of resistance genes at different sites in winter and summer tends to cluster together and separate from each other except t1 in winter and w1 in summer fig 5a it showed that the composition of args in the winter and summer samples were significantly different the proportions of tetracycline resistance genes in winter samples were significantly higher than that in summer p 0 05 and the proportions of aminoglycoside resistance genes in winter samples were higher than that in summer the proportions of multidrug resistance genes were higher in summer samples than that in winter and the proportions of mges were also higher in summer samples than in winter fig 5b vpa was used to understand the structure of bacterial community antibiotics and other environmental factors on composition of args fig s9 among them antibiotics sulfonamide tetracyclines quinolone environmental factors nh4 no3 ph and temperature and the diversity of bacterial community explained 34 7 21 1 and 4 3 of the difference in args respectively so the discharge of antibiotics the input of arb and seasonal difference of environmental factor in sewage may alter the bacterial community and reshape their resistome this phenomenon has also been found in previous studies frank et al 2007 martinez 2008 nh4 and no3 affected the enrichment or accumulation of quinolone and vancomycin resistance genes by affecting the growth of the dominant flora guo et al 2020 and the same source of no3 from the discharge of sewage treatment plants with arb could be another reason the impact of environmental factors on resistance genes in karst rivers and the correlation between args and environmental factors were analyzed in summer and winter respectively fig 6 in summer ta and hco3 so4 2 and toc are significantly correlated with args and mges temperature and temperature dependent different organic matter load in summer would promote the proliferation of microbial groups carrying resistance genes or improve the growth of non resistant microorganisms biggs et al 2011 however the increased rainfall in summer and the complex connection of karst water systems make the migration of antibiotics fast and the dilution effect is obvious huang et al 2019a which is possibly the main reason why the correlation between antibiotics and args is not significant in winter nearly all the types of args and mges were positively correlated to antibiotics sulfonamides chloramphenicol tetracycline and quinolone it was indicated that the increased use of antibiotics in winter may have a significant impact on antibiotic resistance birosova et al 2014 sun et al 2012 antibiotic consumption impose selective pressures leading to the selection and subsequent spread of args in wastewater caucci et al 2016 novo et al 2013 3 5 risk assessment of resistance genes in karst water system in different seasons in ecological risk assessment the risk assessment of arpb is still rare in this study the abundance of pathogenic bacteria at the species level was different four pathogenic bacteria arcobacter cryaerophilus winter 0 27 summer 7 09 flavobacterium columnare winter 0 09 summer 0 18 planktothrix agardhii winter 7 13 summer 0 12 and euglena chadefaudii winter 0 29 summer 0 were detected in higher percentage both in winter and summer samples and there is a positive linear correlation between args and pathogenic bacteria r 2 0 44333 p 0 03558 which indicates the potential correlation between pathogenic bacteria and args fig s10 in order to further discover the potential carrying relationship between pathogenic bacteria and args the top 50 core microbial species including 4 pathogenic bacteria table s6 eight types of resistance genes and 10 mges were analyzed figs 7 and 8 the pathogenic bacteria not only have a significant correlation with other bacteria in winter and summer but also have significant correlation with args however the pathogenic bacteria and mges showed more significantly positive correlations in winter than in summer there were three typical pathogens a cryaerophilus f columnare and p agardhii in the summer karst river in which a cryaerophilus was significantly correlated with aminoglycoside beta lactamase mlsb multidrug tetracycline and vancomycin resistance genes a cryaerophilus is likely to be the host of args and potential arb and more conclusive evidence need cultivation and verification on bacterial isolates or using genome sequencing technology a cryaerophilus was also significantly correlated with eight bacteria such as zoogloea desulfovibrio pseudomonas and so on fig 7 the pathogen f columnare had significant correlation with seven bacteria such as vogesell perlucida sphingopyxis alaskensis and so on the pathogenic bacteria p agardhii had significant correlation with nordella oligomobilis and other four species the network analysis also showed that the three pathogenic bacteria a cryaerophilus f columnare and p agardhii had significant correlations with subtypes of args and especially a cryaerophilus was significantly correlated with multiple resistance genes fig s11 which indicated ecological risks that cannot be ignored during the transmission of args in the karst river of this study area there were four pathogenic bacteria in winter samples in which only a cryaerophilus had significant correlations with aminoglycoside beta lactamase chloramphenicol mlsb multidrug sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes and also was significantly correlated with acinetobacter harbinensis aeromonas media bacteroides plebeius and other six bacteria fig 8 in addition a cryaerophilus was significantly correlated with 8 mges tnpa 02 tnpa 03 tnpa 04 tnpa 05 tnpa 07 is613 tp614 and cinti 1class1 the pathogenic bacterium p agardhii was significantly correlated with seven kinds of bacteria including virgulinella fragilis cryptomonas curvata and so on the pathogenic bacterium f columnare was significantly correlated with flavobacterium sp hme6144 and other four bacteria the pathogenic bacteria euglena chadefaudii was significantly correlated with trachelomonas scabra the network analysis between bacteria and subtype resistance genes also shows that there are significant correlations between the three pathogenic bacteria and subtype resistance genes a cryaerophilus was significantly correlated with a variety of resistance genes and mges fig s12 which indicated args and mges were likely to coexist in pathogenic bacteria a cryaerophilus was significantly correlated to multiple resistance genes other bacteria and some mges in winter the existence of mges increases the efficiency of the risk of args transmission among pathogens this study showed that a cryaerophilus have a higher risk of args transmission and pathogenic risks in addition the highly detected pathogenic bacteria f columnare and p agardhii could have a symbiotic relationship with other bacteria and thus increase the risk of spread of args among pathogenic bacteria 4 conclusion karst water system is complex and dynamic with strong connectivity which makes it difficult to trace pollution sources and control diffusion hence the study of the seasonal distribution characteristics of antibiotics the transmission mechanism of args and the environmental risks are important there were significant seasonal differences in the composition of antibiotics args and bacterial community in karst rivers however the dominant types of args were the same in winter and summer five transposons and a clinical class of integrons cinti 1class1 played an important role in the spread of args the distribution of args in an ecological group indicated that the evolution of the ecological group were possibly related to the transmission of resistance genes and also affect the functions of the bacterial community and its response to the environment seasonal use of antibiotics environmental factors and bacterial community would affect the spread of args and potentially arb in exhausted and plentiful phases karst river the spread of potentially arb is found to be related to the seasonal occurrence of human diseases evaluating the environmental risks of pollution from multiple perspectives is helpful in managing karst water pollution and

16709,in recent years karst water has been polluted by emerging pollutants such as antibiotics in this study the bacterial communities and antibiotic resistance genes args in antibiotics contaminated karst river was studied in summer and winter the concentration of antibiotics in winter karst river is higher than that in summer and there are significant differences in structure of bacterial community and args between karst river water samples aminoglycoside beta lactamase and multidrug are the main types of args and transposons play an important role in the spread of args the horizontal gene transfer hgt of args between bacteria mediated by mobile genetic elements mges would cause the spread of args and bring potential ecological risks in addition we found that the risk of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria arpb in winter was possibly higher than that in summer it was suggested that the discharge of antibiotics water amount and seasonal occurrence time of human intestinal diseases affect the risks caused by antibiotics contaminants this study helps us to understand the transmission mechanism of args and their potential seasonal ecological risks in complex karst water systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords karst river antibiotic pollution antibiotic resistance genes microbial community environmental risk 1 introduction since the 21st century microorganisms with antibiotic resistance genes args have been continuously discovered orman and brynildsen 2015 pruden et al 2006 args a new class of pollutants pose a serious threat to human health and the environment pruden et al 2006 in past years the diversity distribution and transmission mechanism of args in natural and artificial water bodies such as aquaculture farmland and human bodies have been extensively studied berendonk et al 2015 organization 2014 van boeckel et al 2015 the karst system is widely distributed in the world as an important and special type of ecological environment the karst water system is complex and has unique hydrogeological characteristics of high hydraulic conductivity and short residence time which makes the karst water system susceptible to pollution from human activities and the rapid spread of pollutants in a wide range xiang et al 2020 in 2019 it was reported that karst rivers in southwest china have been affected by antibiotic pollution for a long time and there are different degrees of ecological risks huang et al 2019a the water environment is an important source and sink of args the discharge of sewage treatment plants the unreasonable stacking of garbage and the pollutants discharged from aquaculture plants are eventually recycled into the water environment and drive the spread of args lavilla lerma et al 2014 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 the spread of args change the ecological distribution and community functions of microorganisms in the environment chonova et al 2016 hoa et al 2011 which would affect the nutrient cycle of the karst system and the natural purification process of other pollutants args are transferred and spread between different bacteria and even self amplify and their persistent existence in the environment are more harmful than antibiotics roberts 2012 moreover the args were found to be transmitted between different pathogenic bacteria pazda et al 2019 and antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria arpb are a serious public health problem hvistendahl 2012 multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria are especially dangerous such as commonly occurring bacteria species escherichia coli klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus causing the most frequent hospital and community acquired infections of urinary tract skin and subcutaneous tissue blood or pneumonia luo et al 2014 many studies evaluated the impact of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and args on human health agriculture and food production aquaculture and the impact on the environment on a global scale boucher et al 2016 collignon 2013 gelband et al 2015 wall et al 2016 as a special ecological environment karst regions cover 7 12 of the earth s continental area and their aquifers are a partial source of drinking water supply to almost a quarter of the world s population hartmann et al 2014 the composition of args in karst rivers especially the evaluation of arpb is poorly understood the spread of args mainly depends on the horizontal gene transfer hgt of mobile genetic elements mges e g plasmids integrons and transposons gogarten and townsend 2005 schluter et al 2007 integrons play an important role in the transfer and spread of args class 1 integrons are detected most frequently in various environments the class 1 integrons inti1 has been proposed as a proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 liang et al 2013 environmental factors such as antibiotics xenobiotic organic pollutants heavy metals and other pollutant compounds can affect the hgt of water microbial communities aminov 2011 lv et al 2014 wu et al 2015 the selection and induction of antibiotic resistance to environmental microorganisms is the main reason for the production of args in shanghai huangpu river the fate and transformation of sulfonamide resistance genes are related to the residue of sulfonamide antibiotics in the environment jiang et al 2013 in urban park soils with reclaimed water irrigation the tetracycline antibiotics are not only positively correlated with tetracycline resistance genes but also positively correlated with aminoglycosides and sulfonamides resistance genes wang et al 2014 the concentration of antibiotics in the water body is usually very low after migration and dilution but low concentration antibiotics can be used as signal molecules between or within the microbial populations causing the microbial populations in the community to respond adaptively and then promote the args transmission between microorganisms aminov 2009 seasonal changes have significant effects on the composition of microbial communities and their args including temperature changes su et al 2017 different antibiotic usage caused by seasonal bacterial infection caucci et al 2016 frank et al 2007 martinez 2008 novo et al 2013 seasonal rainfall and domestic water consumption su et al 2017 and human activities including livestock and poultry breeding agriculture and wastewater treatment bondarczuk et al 2016 chen and zhang 2013 in the karst water system the water level and flow vary significantly in the dry season and rainy season guo et al 2015 resulting in seasonal differences in the chemical properties of karst groundwater such as electrical conductivity salinity so4 2 and hco3 concentration li et al 2007 the factors affecting the generation and spread of args are complex and the main influencing factors and seasonal response mechanisms in the karst system need to be revealed urgently the karst river generally consists of aboveground and underground parts and several tributaries converge within a short distance which is different from other surface river and underground river the interaction between underground water and aboveground water is strong and seasonal water quantity changes obviously coxon and drew 2000 in addition the pollution sources such as antibiotic of the tributaries sometimes are obviously different and contaminated a karst river for a long time in southwest china huang et al 2019a due to the different dilution and migration rates of water bodies multiple antibiotic types from different sources are likely to have different impacts on the selection pressure of microbial communities and transmission of args in this study we focused on the composition and distribution of args in this typical karst river the spread mechanisms of args and to explore the ecological risks caused by args in winter dry period and summer wet period respectively this will benefit the antibiotics pollution management and risk assessment of args in karst river 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and sample collection the study area 59 km2 is located in kaiyang guizhou province southwestern china

through ht qpcr analysis 249 and 198 subtypes of a combination of args and mges were detected in summer and winter respectively the args are divided into 3 types according to the resistance mechanism antibiotic deactivate resistance genes 53 in winter and summer efflux pump resistance genes winter 35 summer 39 and cellular protection resistance genes winter 8 summer 7 the args are divided into 8 categories including aminoglycoside beta lactamase chloramphenicol mlsb macrolides lincosamides streptomycin b sulfonamide tetracycline vancomycin and multidrug multi antibiotic resistance genes the proportions in winter and summer are also similar and the top three are aminoglycoside winter 39 summer 39 multidrug winter 29 summer 34 and beta lactamase winter 10 summer 9 fig 1 in summer and winter samples the dominant abundant args are aminoglycoside resistance genes aada 01 aada 02 aada1 aada2 03 multidrug resistance genes qacedelta1 01 qacedelta1 02 and sulfonamide resistance gene sul2 the abundance of all 7 args in summer are higher than in winter but the difference is not significant in previous study the dominant abundant args are blaoxa 21 emra erea mdtk and tet g in surface river jiang et al 2018 sul1 in estuarine lake water yuan et al 2019 mlsb resistance genes in urban river discharge huang et al 2019b which are different from the karst river in this study the types of args generally were correlated with the main types of antibiotic contamination li et al 2012 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 moreover the composition of args is more complex and diverse in water bodies polluted by multiple antibiotics zhang et al 2020b by high through sequencing 521 135 and 507 015 high quality sequences were obtained in summer and winter water samples of karst river respectively the number of sequences in 20 samples ranged from 39 994 to 57 389 the simpson indexes show that the diversity of bacterial community in summer samples is higher than that in winter in summer proteobacteria 50 07 is the most abundant bacterial phyla followed by bacteroidetes 24 40 and cyanobacteria 8 09 in winter the dominant bacteria phyla are bacteroidetes 39 44 proteobacteria 33 57 and cyanobacteria 14 47 at the genus level arcobacter 14 71 accounts for the largest proportion in summer followed by flavobacterium 9 51 and cyanobacteria 5 79 in winter flavobacterium 29 02 accounts for the largest proportion followed by planktothrix 7 17 and cyanobacteria 7 07 fig s2 3 2 characterization of environmental factors in karst water we analyzed 35 subtypes of antibiotics including 16 quinolones 9 sulfonamides 4 tetracyclines 4 macrolides as well as lincomycin and chloramphenicol and we found 27 out of these 35 subtypes of antibiotics in the winter and summer karst water samples there was a difference in the types of antibiotics detected in winter and summer samples with 23 antibiotics were detected in summer and 15 in winter table s2 and 11 antibiotics detected both in summer and winter the concentration of tetracycline oxytetracycline erythromycin roxithromycin lincomycin and norfloxacin were significantly higher in winter samples than in summer table s3 these two antibiotics lincomycin and ofloxacin were found in all samples indicating the prevalence of antibiotics in this area the total concentration of antibiotics is higher in winter than in summer the total concentration of antibiotics ranges from 96 to 1097 ng l mainly are quinolones macrolides and lincomycin table s4 which is related to antibiotic usage caused by seasonal epidemic infections caucci et al 2016 novo et al 2013 the concentration of quinolone is both high in winter and summer the concentration of chloramphenicol tetracycline macrolide and lincomycin in winter karst river were significantly higher than those in summer fig s3 antibiotics are an important factor affecting the distribution and diffusion of args gillings and stokes 2012 zhang et al 2011 different concentration of antibiotics in winter and summer is likely to affect the abundance of args in karst river of this study area the concentration of ca2 hco3 and ta were higher in summer than in winter the concentration of nh4 in winter was significantly higher than that in summer while the concentration of no2 and no3 were significantly higher in summer than in winter fig s4 3 3 spread of args in bacterial community in karst water a total of 10 mges including 8 transposon transposase genes tnpa 01 tnpa 02 tnpa 03 tnpa 04 tnpa 05 tnpa 07 tp614 and is613 integrase gene inti1 and a clinical type of integrase gene cinti1 were detected this indicated the prevalence of mges in antibiotic contaminated karst rivers hgt is the main mechanism for the widespread distribution of args and mges play an important role dobrovol skaya et al 2017 gyles and boerlin 2014 ols was used to examine the correlation between args and mges as shown in fig 2 there is a positive linear correlation between args and mges r2 0 57272 p 0 00011 which suggests the potential impact of mges on the transfer of args in antibiotics contaminated karst river zheng et al 2018 the co occurrence network analysis of args and mges showed the potential spread of args by mges fig s5 all 10 subtypes mges had significant correlation with args and most of args were significantly correlated with the transposon tnpa 01 34 links tnpa 02 43 links tnpa 05 40 links tnpa 07 39 links and is613 22 links fig s6 indicating that these 5 transposons played important roles in the transmission of args in this study area bacteria spread args between environmental bacteria by transferring genetic information through mges pruden et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 previous studies demonstrated that inti1 gene had strong positive correlation with suli gene and teto gene in urban and rural sewage treatment systems and raw sludge chen and zhang 2013 miller et al 2013 in this study cinti 1class1 had significant correlation with multidrug resistance gene qacedelta1 02 aminoglycoside resistance genes aac6 ibaka aaca4 01 and aac6 ibaka aaca4 02 beta lactamase resistance gene blages and chloramphenicol resistance gene icm1a1 02 inti 1clinic had significant correlation with multidrug resistance gene qach 02 therefore in this study area beta lactamase aminoglycoside multidrug tetracycline and mlsb resistance genes are likely to be transmitted by the above transposons tnpa 01 tnpa 02 tnpa 05 tnpa 07 and is613 and integrons cinti 1class1 and inti 1clinic meanwhile the mges in microorganisms can carry multiple types of args and one type of args can also be carried by multiple genetic elements in fig 3 the potential core microorganisms carrying args and spread of args by mges were revealed bacterial community in karst river was divided into 4 modules each of which is a potential co evolutionary ecological function group zhao et al 2007 module 1 included 8 genera of bacteria sulfurospirillum desulfobulbus bacteroides macellibacteroides paludibacter desulfomicrobium arcobacter and vadinbc wastewater sludge group 2 transposon is613 and tnpa 07 and 6 types of args tetracycline beta lactamase chloramphenicol aminoglycoside mlsb and others transposons tnpa 03 tnpa 04 tnpa 05 and tp614 and 7 genera of bacteria aeromonas acinetobacter rheinheimera pseudomonas trichococcus norank f leptotrichiaceae and unclassified f comamonadaceae in module 2 in module 2 the transposons tp614 and tnpa 05 have significant correlation with tetracycline beta lactamase and multidrug resistance genes two types of transposon tnpa 01 and tnpa 02 and two types of integrons inti 1clinic and cinti 1class1 were included in module 3 integrators inti1 were found to have a host relationship with escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae dobrovol skaya et al 2017 both the bacteria and mges in module 3 had significant correlations with args the vancomycin resistance genes in module 4 had significant correlations with 3 genera norank f xanthomonadales incertae sedis norank o sc i 84 and norank f xanthomonadaceae in fig s7 the network analysis between bacteria mges and the resistance gene at subtype s level we also found the significant correlations with each other the mges tp614 tnpa 05 and is613 had significant correlation with a variety of args and microorganisms table s5 the bacteria with positive relationship are likely to be the most important carrier for the transmission of resistance genes vaz moreira et al 2014 there was potential transmission of args in all four modules and different ecological groups and their functions were all affected under the selective pressure of antibiotic contamination 3 4 difference of bacterial community and their potential carrying args in winter and summer karst river pcoa was performed to analyze the differences of the bacterial communities in winter and summer fig 4a the winter samples were closely clustered and separated from the summer samples along pcoa1 with a difference of 28 it shows that the structure of bacterial community in the karst river is different in winter and summer cao et al 2011 su et al 2017 the differences between the bacterial community at the genus level identified in winter and summer were analyzed fig 4b the proportions of flavobacterium planktothrix hgcl clade pseudomonas and fluviicola in the winter samples were significantly higher than those in summer samples while the proportions of arcobacter and novosphingobium in summer samples were significantly higher than that in winter samples flavobacterium and pseudomonas are widely found in soil fresh water and sea water and they are common conditional pathogen bernardet et al 1996 arcobacter has a wide variety of habitats and hosts including humans and animals debruyne et al 2008 wesley and miller 2010 and they are pathogens of human gastrointestinal diseases jiang et al 2010 since arcobacter was highly detected in summer the potential risks of these bacteria posting human health in this area cannot be neglected especially when they are the potential args hosts according to the result of ht qpcr the relative abundance of total resistance genes in summer samples is higher than that in winter samples fig s8 with an average of 0 87 copies 16s rrna copy in summer and 0 44 copies 16s rrna copy in winter this indicates that higher temperatures may promote the spread of args su et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 while seasonal temperature changes have significant correlation with args sun et al 2016 the pcoa analysis based on bray curtis distance between samples also showed that the composition of resistance genes at different sites in winter and summer tends to cluster together and separate from each other except t1 in winter and w1 in summer fig 5a it showed that the composition of args in the winter and summer samples were significantly different the proportions of tetracycline resistance genes in winter samples were significantly higher than that in summer p 0 05 and the proportions of aminoglycoside resistance genes in winter samples were higher than that in summer the proportions of multidrug resistance genes were higher in summer samples than that in winter and the proportions of mges were also higher in summer samples than in winter fig 5b vpa was used to understand the structure of bacterial community antibiotics and other environmental factors on composition of args fig s9 among them antibiotics sulfonamide tetracyclines quinolone environmental factors nh4 no3 ph and temperature and the diversity of bacterial community explained 34 7 21 1 and 4 3 of the difference in args respectively so the discharge of antibiotics the input of arb and seasonal difference of environmental factor in sewage may alter the bacterial community and reshape their resistome this phenomenon has also been found in previous studies frank et al 2007 martinez 2008 nh4 and no3 affected the enrichment or accumulation of quinolone and vancomycin resistance genes by affecting the growth of the dominant flora guo et al 2020 and the same source of no3 from the discharge of sewage treatment plants with arb could be another reason the impact of environmental factors on resistance genes in karst rivers and the correlation between args and environmental factors were analyzed in summer and winter respectively fig 6 in summer ta and hco3 so4 2 and toc are significantly correlated with args and mges temperature and temperature dependent different organic matter load in summer would promote the proliferation of microbial groups carrying resistance genes or improve the growth of non resistant microorganisms biggs et al 2011 however the increased rainfall in summer and the complex connection of karst water systems make the migration of antibiotics fast and the dilution effect is obvious huang et al 2019a which is possibly the main reason why the correlation between antibiotics and args is not significant in winter nearly all the types of args and mges were positively correlated to antibiotics sulfonamides chloramphenicol tetracycline and quinolone it was indicated that the increased use of antibiotics in winter may have a significant impact on antibiotic resistance birosova et al 2014 sun et al 2012 antibiotic consumption impose selective pressures leading to the selection and subsequent spread of args in wastewater caucci et al 2016 novo et al 2013 3 5 risk assessment of resistance genes in karst water system in different seasons in ecological risk assessment the risk assessment of arpb is still rare in this study the abundance of pathogenic bacteria at the species level was different four pathogenic bacteria arcobacter cryaerophilus winter 0 27 summer 7 09 flavobacterium columnare winter 0 09 summer 0 18 planktothrix agardhii winter 7 13 summer 0 12 and euglena chadefaudii winter 0 29 summer 0 were detected in higher percentage both in winter and summer samples and there is a positive linear correlation between args and pathogenic bacteria r 2 0 44333 p 0 03558 which indicates the potential correlation between pathogenic bacteria and args fig s10 in order to further discover the potential carrying relationship between pathogenic bacteria and args the top 50 core microbial species including 4 pathogenic bacteria table s6 eight types of resistance genes and 10 mges were analyzed figs 7 and 8 the pathogenic bacteria not only have a significant correlation with other bacteria in winter and summer but also have significant correlation with args however the pathogenic bacteria and mges showed more significantly positive correlations in winter than in summer there were three typical pathogens a cryaerophilus f columnare and p agardhii in the summer karst river in which a cryaerophilus was significantly correlated with aminoglycoside beta lactamase mlsb multidrug tetracycline and vancomycin resistance genes a cryaerophilus is likely to be the host of args and potential arb and more conclusive evidence need cultivation and verification on bacterial isolates or using genome sequencing technology a cryaerophilus was also significantly correlated with eight bacteria such as zoogloea desulfovibrio pseudomonas and so on fig 7 the pathogen f columnare had significant correlation with seven bacteria such as vogesell perlucida sphingopyxis alaskensis and so on the pathogenic bacteria p agardhii had significant correlation with nordella oligomobilis and other four species the network analysis also showed that the three pathogenic bacteria a cryaerophilus f columnare and p agardhii had significant correlations with subtypes of args and especially a cryaerophilus was significantly correlated with multiple resistance genes fig s11 which indicated ecological risks that cannot be ignored during the transmission of args in the karst river of this study area there were four pathogenic bacteria in winter samples in which only a cryaerophilus had significant correlations with aminoglycoside beta lactamase chloramphenicol mlsb multidrug sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes and also was significantly correlated with acinetobacter harbinensis aeromonas media bacteroides plebeius and other six bacteria fig 8 in addition a cryaerophilus was significantly correlated with 8 mges tnpa 02 tnpa 03 tnpa 04 tnpa 05 tnpa 07 is613 tp614 and cinti 1class1 the pathogenic bacterium p agardhii was significantly correlated with seven kinds of bacteria including virgulinella fragilis cryptomonas curvata and so on the pathogenic bacterium f columnare was significantly correlated with flavobacterium sp hme6144 and other four bacteria the pathogenic bacteria euglena chadefaudii was significantly correlated with trachelomonas scabra the network analysis between bacteria and subtype resistance genes also shows that there are significant correlations between the three pathogenic bacteria and subtype resistance genes a cryaerophilus was significantly correlated with a variety of resistance genes and mges fig s12 which indicated args and mges were likely to coexist in pathogenic bacteria a cryaerophilus was significantly correlated to multiple resistance genes other bacteria and some mges in winter the existence of mges increases the efficiency of the risk of args transmission among pathogens this study showed that a cryaerophilus have a higher risk of args transmission and pathogenic risks in addition the highly detected pathogenic bacteria f columnare and p agardhii could have a symbiotic relationship with other bacteria and thus increase the risk of spread of args among pathogenic bacteria 4 conclusion karst water system is complex and dynamic with strong connectivity which makes it difficult to trace pollution sources and control diffusion hence the study of the seasonal distribution characteristics of antibiotics the transmission mechanism of args and the environmental risks are important there were significant seasonal differences in the composition of antibiotics args and bacterial community in karst rivers however the dominant types of args were the same in winter and summer five transposons and a clinical class of integrons cinti 1class1 played an important role in the spread of args the distribution of args in an ecological group indicated that the evolution of the ecological group were possibly related to the transmission of resistance genes and also affect the functions of the bacterial community and its response to the environment seasonal use of antibiotics environmental factors and bacterial community would affect the spread of args and potentially arb in exhausted and plentiful phases karst river the spread of potentially arb is found to be related to the seasonal occurrence of human diseases evaluating the environmental risks of pollution from multiple perspectives is helpful in managing karst water pollution and assessing the potential public health risks from environmental args to human pathogens declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflicts of interest acknowledgement this research was
