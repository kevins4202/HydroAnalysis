16015,fouling of microfiltration mf membranes during water wastewater treatment is predominantly caused by colloidal particles size 1 µm in the feed water until recently no online technology was available to directly measure the occurrence of colloidal particles in these waters this study evaluated the viability of a novel online light scattering technology nanoparticle tracking analysis to continuously monitor colloidal particles in the membrane feed water a secondary treated wastewater for targeted removal by injecting coagulant at a dosage proportional to the measured concentration of colloidal particles a diurnal variation was observed in the colloidal particle concentration in the feed water with the lowest concentration occurring at approximately 6 am and the highest concentration occurring after mid day the peak colloidal particle concentrations were 4 to 6 times higher than the lowest concentrations measured on the same day bench scale studies were performed to develop a relationship between colloidal particle concentration and the optimum coagulant dosage required for their removal subsequently a pilot scale study was performed using two mf pilot units operated in parallel one receiving targeted coagulant dosing and the other with no coagulant dosing to demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted coagulant dosing in preventing membrane fouling the pilot unit that received targeted coagulant dose experienced only 4 to 20 of the transmembrane pressure increase of the increase experienced by the pilot unit that received no coagulant evaluation of fouling resistance indicated that targeted coagulation improved flux by predominantly lowering the irreversible fouling the filtrate water quality measured by colloidal particle concentration chemical oxygen demand cod and turbidity were very similar for the two pilot units this suggests that although the efficiency of particle and organic materials removal does not change with coagulant addition the particles filtered by the membrane in the control unit contributed to membrane irreversible fouling while in the coagulant treated unit the coagulated colloidal particles were removed away from the membrane into the backwash stream during the frequent backwash air scour procedures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords colloidal particles light scattering online monitoring membrane fouling nanoparticles tracking analysis 1 introduction there is an increased emphasis on indirect and direct potable reuse ipr dpr in recent years to meet water demand ipr and dpr processes often involve advanced treatment of secondary or tertiary effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps microfiltration mf are integral components that serve as a pretreatment for reverse osmosis and subsequent advanced oxidation process for most ipr dpr facilities gerrity et al 2013 however treatment of wastewater effluents results in membrane fouling that give rise to in increased energy demand and costly chemical cleaning further the long term effects of irreversible fouling result in the reduction of membrane performance and membrane lifetime arhin et al 2016 fouling of low pressure membranes is often caused by organic materials colloidal particles microbial and inorganic constituents gupta and chellam 2021 howe and clark 2002 lay et al 2021 shi et al 2014 while the nature and extent of fouling varies with the source water constituents membrane characteristics and other operating parameters colloidal particles in the feed water have been identified to be major contributors of fouling howe and clark 2002 huang et al 2012 lay and chew 2020 lee et al 2004 te poele et al 2004 wu et al 2022 roorda et al 2004 reported that particles of 100 to 200 nm size were primarily responsible for fouling of ultrafiltration membranes of pore size five to twenty fold smaller than these particles roorda et al 2004 cake formation by these colloids was reported as the fouling mechanism in a different study using five different surface water samples colloidal particles 3 to 20 nm were responsible for the majority of the fouling of several low pressure membranes howe and clark 2002 in a study of raw wastewater treatment particles 1 to 8 µm contributed to significantly higher fouling than particles 8 µm however removal of particles in the range of 0 45 to 1 µm colloidal particle range improved the flux rate by approximately 25 huang et al 2017 recent studies using secondary effluents from three wwtps have shown that up to 60 to 80 of the mf membrane fouling was largely due to the deposition of feed water colloidal particles typically 200 nm inside the membrane pores or by blocking of pores through cake formation discussed further in the supplementary information file 1 si 1 rosso and rajagopalan 2013 these results indicate that monitoring and targeted removal of colloidal particles can potentially lower membrane fouling and increase low pressure membrane life pretreatment of the mf feed water via coagulation is an effective method of mitigating the fouling potential of colloidal particles huang et al 2017 however providing proper coagulant dosage is critical coagulant overdosing can lead to scaling of the mf membranes along with the ro membranes downstream in the event of significant coagulant breakthrough under dosing risks suboptimal particle removal without any improvement in the mitigation of membrane fouling huang et al 2012 judd and hillis 2001 kimura and oki 2017 lai et al 2015 a conventional approach of measuring of electrostatic charge to optimize coagulant dose was inconsistent choi and dempsey 2004 wang and wang 2006 yoo 2018 real time measurements of streaming potential or streaming current has been used to control coagulant dosing in the treatment of drinking water by low pressure membranes however these techniques are less effective at the high coagulant doses that may be required for treating secondary tertiary effluent for ipr drp applications ghernaout et al 2015 because of such limitations few ipr dpr facilities have applied coagulation pretreatment to secondary tertiary effluents prior to mf treatment until recently no analytical techniques existed to directly measure colloidal particle size distribution and concentration in the feed water to facilitate appropriate pretreatment with real time control to remove these particles and prevent their deposition on the membrane surface or pores surrogate parameters e g turbidity or organic content have been used to monitor foulant levels in the feed water au et al 2011 ratnaweera and fettig 2015 but have not correlated well with the levels of colloidal particles and hence lead to ineffective fouling control berman 2010 howe and clark 2002 schulz et al 2011 total organic carbon toc and ultraviolet uv light absorption do not distinguish between colloidal and dissolved fractions turbidity measurements are typically not very sensitive for particles smaller than 300 nm hargesheimer and lewis 1995 recent advances in nanotechnology have facilitated development of instruments that can directly measure size distribution and concentration of particles in nano colloidal scale these technologies often use light scattering characteristics and brownian motion of particles to detect and quantify particles in the colloidal size range malvern 2020 wu et al 2022 extending its application to water treatment offers a potential new tool for mitigating membrane fouling by colloidal particles and reducing energy consumption in this study bench and pilot scale demonstrations were performed using this instrument to directly measure colloidal particle concentration and size distribution in the feed water the instrument was integrated into the mf treatment process via supervisory control and data acquisition scada system to function effectively as an on lime monitoring system for this study the instrument was connected through internet that allowed for remote monitoring of the operation the real time information was used to initiate pretreatment with variable dosing of coagulant to target removal of these particles i e automatically increase dosing when particle concentrations are high and decrease dosing when concentrations are low several terminologies with varying definitions of size range and other characteristics have been used in literature to define smaller suspended particles in wastewaters e g colloidal particles sub micron particles nanoscale particles in this article the term colloidal particles is used to define sub micron 1 µm size suspended particles measured using the nta technology while this study did not systematically characterize the composition of the colloidal particles it is likely to include organic materials such as polysaccharides proteins amino sugars as well as some inorganic materials fan et al 2008 jarusutthirak et al 2002 laabs et al 2006 worms et al 2010 the objectives were to demonstrate that 1 the instrument can reliably detect colloidal size particles in the membrane feed water a secondary wastewater effluent 2 the instrument can be integrated into the mf treatment process to function effectively as an online monitoring device 3 the coagulant dosing can be optimized in real time based on the feed water colloidal particle characteristics 4 the targeted dosing can remove the colloidal particles and lower the transmembrane pressure tmp during treatment and 5 the coagulant will not reach a significant level in the mf filtrate to adversely impact the ro process in addition the nature of membrane fouling with and without targeted coagulant addition was studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 study approach a four step approach was used to address the specific objectives of this study first the feed water to the membrane system was monitored over time to understand the diurnal and daily trends in colloidal particle concentration next bench scale phipps and bird jar tests followed by dead end single element mf flux test were performed with feed waters containing different initial concentrations of colloidal particles in order to develop a relationship between colloidal particle concentration and optimum coagulant dosing required to remove colloidal particles subsequently the validity of the calibration curves developed through bench scale tests were verified and adjusted for the pilot test set up finally pilot tests were performed using two parallel mf membrane units one operated with targeted coagulant dosing using the online colloidal particles monitoring system and another without coagulant addition i e control pilot 2 2 online colloidal particle monitoring system the nanosight ns500 developed by malvern

orange county water district ocwd advanced water purification facility awpf in fountain valley ca ocwd receives and treats a blend of activated sludge 75 80 and trickling filter 20 25 effluent from orange county sanitation district oc san plant no 1 samples were collected at 15 min intervals to identify diurnal fluctuation in the concentration of colloidal particles the general water quality is displayed in table 1 see section 2 6 2 4 relationship between colloidal particle concentration and optimum coagulant dosing initially screening tests were performed using various polymers and a polyaluminum chloride pacl coagulant calchem 2060 calchem inc modesto ca 9 7 aluminum was selected due to lower aluminum content and better coagulation for fouling reduction in this study the relationship between the feed water colloidal particle concentration and optimum pacl coagulant dosage to reduce membrane fouling was evaluated by performing jar tests followed by single element dead end microfiltration tests three sets of jar tests phips and bird richmond va were performed each with different initial colloidal particle concentrations in the feed water the coagulant dose was varied from 5 to 20 mg l in six jars each containing 1 l of feed water upon coagulant addition the contents of the jars were rapid mixed at 120 rpm for 1 min slow mixed at 30 rpm for 5 min and allowed to settle for 5 min the supernatant from each sample was collected and filtered through 0 2 µm filters to mimic removal of larger particles by backwashing in full scale unit prior to the single fiber 0 2 µm polypropylene membrane fouling tests the dead end single element mf fouling tests were conducted as described elsewhere safarik and phipps 2009 the drop in flux at constant suction pressure 5 psi was used to ascertain fouling potential for each colloidal particle concentration and coagulant dosage combination the coagulant dosage that yielded the least flux decline after 5 min was identified as the optimum coagulant dosage corresponding to the initial colloidal particle concentration regression analyses were performed using the initial colloidal particle concentration total concentration as well as concentration of particles in different size ranges and the optimum coagulant dosing for the three cases the best fit regression equation developed was used to adjust the coagulant dosing rates in the pilot study 2 5 pilot demonstration two sets of pilot tests test 1 and test 2 were performed each using two parallel direct filtration evoqua 4s10v cs submerged mf pilot units evoqua water technologies pittsburgh pa each pilot was equipped with four submerged polypropylene pp mf membranes the pp mf membranes had a nominal pore size of 0 2 µm one pilot unit received feedwater without coagulant addition control and the other unit received feedwater that was pre coagulated with a targeted amount of calchem 2060 through continuous sample analyses at 15 min intervals pilot units were operated in direct filtration mode at a flux of 20 gal ft per day gfd and a filtrate flow rate of 18 gpm every 22 min the membranes were automatically backwashed and air scoured the tmp for these units were logged automatically using feed and filtrate pressure transducers deltabar pmd235 endress hauser upon reaching a tmp of approximately 8 to 10 psi in the control pilot unit both the pilot units were shut down for chemical clean in place cip cleaning cip was performed according to ocwd s mf cleaning protocol evoqua 2015 each pilot was equipped with pumps feed and filtrate magnetic flow meters feed filtrate and backwash turbidimeters feed and filtrate air compressor and an automated cleaning skid a slip stream of the membrane feed water was analyzed by ns500 nta instrument based on the measured particle concentration and size a process control software signaled the release of the appropriate coagulant dosage to the pilot unit that received targeted coagulant dosing an inline mixer and an approximately 1000 ft x 1 5 in diameter braided tubing provided mixing and a 5 min contact time for the coagulation of colloidal particles fig 1 shows the schematic of the pilot unit configuration 2 6 membrane resistance calculations during the pilot operation membrane fouling was calculated using the following formula r t r i r r r i r p j μ rt is the total

aluminum calcium magnesium fluoride and total organic carbon toc the protein content in the fouled membranes was analyzed by the bio rad protein assay bio rad laboratories hercules ca using bovine serum albumin bsa as a standard total carbohydrate analysis was performed by a phenol sulfuric acid assay dubois et al 1956 using a glucose standard recent studies indicate that protein and carbohydrate analyses using colorimetric reagents yield inconsistent results le and stuckey 2016 mæhre et al 2018 however due to lack of alternate reliable analyses for these parameters these methods were used and the results reported in this study the composition of the fouling layer on the membrane surface and the extent of fouling penetration into the membrane was visualized and quantified by

fiber s cross section membrane samples were fractured after being flash frozen using liquid nitrogen all samples were sputter coated with gold of pd pt 4 nm before analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 feed water characteristics 3 1 1 general water quality parameters relevant water quality characteristics of the feed water during the study are summarized in table 1 the water quality characteristics of the membrane feed water remained largely stable during the study the ph of the feed water varied by 0 2 units and the tds varied by 130 mg l while factors including ph ionic strength membrane material and pore size can affect membrane fouling dersoir et al 2019 tang et al 2011 the water quality of the membrane feed water remained fairly stable during the study 3 1 2 diurnal variations in colloidal particle concentration representative feed water particle counts measured over a 24 h weekday and weekend period are shown in fig 2 throughout the study period the feed water particle concentrations followed a cyclical pattern reaching a peak value after mid day and a minimum value near 6 am the low and high points of colloidal particles concentration in the secondary effluent delivered as the feed water to the ocwd awpf were offset by a few hours from the diurnal flow pattern observed for the raw wastewater at ocsan where the flow peaks between 9 am and 10 am and is lowest between 3 am and 4 am the reasons for the variability in the colloidal particles profile are not currently known this may be due to the travel time of the wastewater flow through the upstream wastewater treatment process at oc san and transport of the secondary effluent to the ocwd water reclamation facility the measured peak colloidal particles concentrations were 4 to 6 fold higher than the lowest concentration observed during the same day this along with diurnal variations in the flow rate may cause the coagulant demand to vary by about an order of magnitude over each day such variations may differ from plant to plant due to source of the colloidal particles as well as differences in unit treatment processes and flow equalization at the treatment facilities 3 2 comparison of colloidal particle concentration and other surrogate foulant parameters fig 3 shows the colloidal particle concentration in grab samples collected at different times of the day over a period of two weeks and corresponding levels of surrogate parameters turbidity uv absorbance and cod that are typically used to measure foulant levels the levels of these surrogate parameters did not correlate well with the variations in the levels of the colloidal particles while the colloidal particle concentration varied by nearly eight fold from approximately 0 5 108 particles ml to 4 108 particles ml the surrogate parameters did not vary significantly and consistently in feed water samples these data indicate that a pretreatment approach using coagulant dosage based on conventional surrogate foulant concentrations may result in under or overdosing of coagulant this observation is consistent with that of schulz et al 2011 who compared colloidal particle counts measured using ns500 with several conventional surrogates including dissolved organic carbon doc ultraviolet light absorption at 254 nm uv254 and suspended solids in secondary effluent at a german wwtp schulz et al 2011 their data show poor correlation for these parameters with colloidal particles further howe and clark 2002 reported that colloidal particles 3 20 nm contributed to 65 of low pressure membrane fouling but they constituted only 10 15 of the doc howe and clark 2002 approximately 85 90 of doc did not by itself caused fouling in another study the cod of the sequentially filtered secondary treated effluent did not vary significantly 28 3 mg l but the colloidal particles concentration varied by seven fold from approximately 170 kcps ml in the unfiltered effluent to approximately 28 kcps ml in the effluent filtered using 10 nm filters rosso and rajagopalan 2013 these data suggested that monitoring organic compounds e g doc or cod levels in the feed water may not be a viable surrogate technique for mf fouling 3 3 bench scale jar and membrane flux tests jar tests were conducted using ocwd mf feed water at low 1 4 108 particles ml medium 3 0 108 particles ml and high 6 0 108 particles ml colloidal particle concentrations representing the observed range fig 2 the size of the colloidal particles measured in the three feed water samples ranged from 40 to 900 nm si 2 however more than 85 of the particles were less than 200 nm smaller than the membrane pore size and 99 of the particles were smaller than 500 nm each of these samples were first coagulated with a range of coagulant dosages 5 to 20 mg l pacl the optimum coagulant dosage was determined for each water quality initial feed water colloidal particle concentration based on the flux rate of the coagulated supernatant observed after 5 min of bench scale single fiber flux testing at constant vacuum pressure 5 psi fig 4 shows the concentration and particle size distribution of the coagulated and settled samples using different coagulant dosages 0 7 5 10 and 15 mg l during the jar tests for the feed water with initial colloidal particle concentration of 3 108 particles ml the sample with no coagulant had the highest concentration of particles concentration of colloidal particles in the settled samples decreased with the addition of coagulant the concentration of colloidal particles at 10 mg l of coagulant was lower than those at 7 5 and 15 mg l subsequent bench scale single element membrane flux tests also showed higher membrane flux at 10 mg l coagulant than no coagulant and 7 5 and 15 mg l of coagulant si 3 these data indicated that optimum coagulant dose for colloidal particles removal for this feed water was approximately 10 mg l similar trends in colloidal particle concentrations and flux rates were observed at coagulant doses for the low and high particle concentration feed water samples while not specifically tested the particles in the coagulated settled samples may contain particles from coagulant itself particles initially detected in the feed water and colloidal as well as dissolved particles i e those below the detection level of nanosight in the feed water that were aggregated to a larger size by the coagulant fig 5 shows the optimum coagulant dose for each colloidal particle concentration tested and the regression equation developed to relate colloidal particles concentration and the coagulant dose the dosing curve fig 5 indicated that there is a positive linear relationship between the feed water particle concentration and the optimum coagulant dosage over the range of particle concentrations tested the optimum coagulant dosage determined from the membrane fouling tests is expressed by the following relationship o p t i m a l p a c l c o a g u l a n t d o s a g e m g l 2 82 10 8 p a r t i c l e s i n f e e d w a t e r m l 2 796 this relationship developed for ocwd mf treatment is likely to vary for other plants when factors affecting aggregation of colloidal particles or membrane fouling e g water quality characteristics membrane chemistry coagulant type vary for example bench scale studies performed using secondary effluent from a different treatment plant using the calchem 2060 coagulant and ferric chloride for fouling reduction of a pvdf membrane nominal pore size 0 1 µm yielded different relationship between colloidal particles concentration and optimum coagulant dose for each case si 4 differences in water quality parameters such as total dissolved solids calcium magnesium and dissolved and colloidal organic content that could affect aggregation characteristics of the colloids could also affect the equation developed similarly differences in membrane characteristics such as pore size surface charge and membrane material that could influence fouling characteristics can affect the optimum coagulant dosage relationship with respect to colloidal particle concentration finally coagulant characteristics such as basicity and al13 species content are known to affect coagulation efficiency hu et al 2006 however for a plant where the wastewater characteristics remain generally stable e g table 1 for ocwd the membrane and coagulant types are identified and concentration of colloidal particles is the major variable the optimum coagulant dose equation once developed for their conditions will be effective 3 4 microfiltration pilot testing 3 4 1 validation of coagulant dose relationship under pilot test conditions initial tests were performed to verify the validity of the coagulant dosing model developed from the bench scale jar studies these tests were performed over a 3 hr window around noon when the colloidal particle concentrations did not vary significantly 5 7 108 particles ml the model was tested by varying the coagulant dose and verifying that the most particles were removed and the highest flux rate was achieved at the optimum coagulant dose estimated by the model the mf pilot units were operated at a constant flow of 18 gpm for the feed water colloidal particle concentration of 5 7 108 particles ml the model estimated optimum coagulant dose was 18 8 mg l coagulant dose during this test varied from 12 3 to 36 8 mg l at each dose coagulant was added for approximately 20 min four times the mixing time and the coagulated feed water was collected at the end of the 1000 ft contactor the flux rate of the coagulated water was then determined using the bench scale dead end single element set up the concentrations of feed water colloidal particles and coagulated samples were measured at each dosing condition fig 6 shows the flux rate of the feed water dosed with different concentrations of the coagulant the optimum coagulant dose indicated by the highest flux rate was approximately 18 4 mg l which is within 2 of the dose determined by the model the settled water particle count was among the lowest at the optimum coagulant dose si 5 which indicated that the model could be used to deliver targeted coagulant dosing for the pilot test 3 4 2 pilot testing to evaluate targeted coagulant dosing the tmp measurements for the pilots operated with and without coagulant dosing were recorded at 1 min intervals tmp measurements for the pilot units during one of the tests is shown in fig 7 similar trends in tmp reduction due to targeted coagulant addition was observed in both pilot tests si 6 the initial tmp for both pilot units during test 1 was approximately 3 8 psi the average tmp of the coagulant dosed pilot on the last day day 65 only increased 5 to 4 psi conversely the average tmp of the control pilot on the last day more than doubled to 8 6 psi indicating that the coagulant was extremely effective in lowering membrane fouling and maintaining low tmp compared control pilot the percent reduction in tmp increase due to coagulant addition in the two tests were 96 and 80 respectively the intrinsic resistance for the membrane under the conditions was found to be 1 08 1012 m 1 fig 8 shows the reversible and irreversible fouling resistance the reversible fouling resistance in the pilots with and without the coagulant remained at 5 1011 m 1 until approximately 40 days after the cip after which a slight increase in the reversible fouling was observed the increase in reversible fouling in the control pilot was higher than the coagulant dosed pilot by approximately 3 5 1011 m 1 the initial irreversible fouling on both the pilots were approximately 1 5 1012 m 1 with a gradual increase over time however the increase was significantly higher in the control pilot compared to the coagulant dosed pilot unit in the coagulant dosed pilot unit the irreversible fouling resistance increased to approximately 1 5 1012 m 1 after approximately 25 days and did not increase significantly until day 55 in the control pilot the irreversible fouling continued to increase throughout the testing period reaching approximately 7 4 1012 m 1 after 55 days compared to the first 35 days the rate of irreversible fouling increased significantly after 35 days of operation of the control unit indicating a different fouling mechanism during this period while the fouling mechanism of the coagulant dosed membrane is not currently known it appears that there are a limited number of sites that can irreversibly bind constituents in the coagulated feed water once these sites are saturated during the first 15 days little if any binding occurred conversely irreversible fouling likely occurred through different mechanisms in the control membrane as indicated by the different slopes of calculated membrane resistance fig 8 eds analyses were performed on the surface and cross sections of the mf fibers table 2 many elements that were present in the cross section of the control fiber i e those that penetrated the membrane matrix fe na cl f and si were not present in the cross section of the coagulant treated pilot this suggested that these elements contributed more to the irreversible fouling of the control membrane the targeted coagulation likely removed these elements in the feed water resulting in a reduction in the irreversible fouling sem images are shown in supplemental information si 7 although cumulatively the magnitude of irreversible fouling is much greater than reversible fouling for both pilot units reversible fouling is much greater than irreversible fouling during each backwash cycle for example the tmp trends over four consecutive backwash cycles on a randomly selected day day 61 during test 1 showed an average reversible fouling of 1 67 psi and 1 02 psi per backwash cycle for the control and coagulant added pilot respectively the average irreversible fouling during the same period were 0 046 psi and 0 008 psi for the control pilot and coagulant treated pilot respectively while several studies have shown reduction in fouling by coagulant addition a consensus on its relative performance on reversible and irreversible fouling is still evolving huang et al 2017 reported that during treatment of influent wastewater reversible fouling on mf membranes was approximately four times higher than that of irreversible fouling and coagulant addition mitigated reversible fouling 97 than irreversible fouling 80 huang et al 2017 kimura and oki 2017 reported surface water treatment by mf membrane without coagulant addition caused more irreversible fouling than reversible fouling kimura and oki 2017 coagulant addition 10 20 mg l lowered fouling by 15 45 but mitigated reversible fouling more than irreversible fouling in another study 10 mg l coagulant addition did not significantly mitigate irreversible fouling of mf membranes kimura and kume 2020 coagulant dosing based on charge neutralization was reported to be less effective in lowering irreversible fouling compared with a lower dosing that resulted in a higher negative charge yoo 2018 however our study showed that the cumulative irreversible fouling on the membranes was significantly higher than the reversible fouling and targeted coagulation helped mitigate irreversible fouling more than reversible fouling fig 8 the differences in the fouling trends observed may be due to differences in the feed water quality membranes coagulants and testing conditions used in these studies further the type of coagulant and targeted coagulant dosing used in this study could also have contributed to the differences observed in this study a long term pilot testing to compare fouling reduction at constant coagulant dosing with that of targeted dosing was not performed however short term tests using constant dosing of 60 and 120 mg l coagulant increased tmp by 13 and 20 respectively in 1 h compared to targeted dosing after 5 h constant addition of 120 mg l increased the tmp to 9 8 psi which is twice the tmp experienced through targeted coagulation after almost 60 days operation in a separate study with different feed water and membrane type long term targeted coagulant addition 5 to 15 mg l decreased the rate of tmp increase by 25 compared to constant coagulant dosing 10 mg l si 8 protein and polysaccharides are among the major components of wastewater that are reported to cause reversible and irreversible fouling of mf membranes lai et al 2015 pramanik et al 2015 fig 9 shows the protein and carbohydrate deposits in the membranes with and without coagulant addition the coagulant treated membrane had 30 55 less protein and 22 50 less carbohydrates overall protein and carbohydrate levels were evenly distributed on the top and middle portion of the control membranes with the bottom of the membrane having 35 more foulants in the coagulant treated membrane protein deposition in the middle of the membrane was 30 lower than the top and 50 lower at the bottom carbohydrate deposition in the middle of the membrane was 35 and 30 lower than the top and bottom respectively 3 4 3 particle count in filtrate samples fig 10 shows the particle size distribution in the membrane feed waters and filtrate samples from the control and coagulant treated pilot units the concentrations are average values of 26 grab samples collected over two months during test 2 both mf pilots received the same feed water and removed nearly identical levels of colloidal particles the filtrates from the coagulant treated and control pilot units contained about 4 5 and 3 of the particles in the feed water i e about 95 5 and 97 removal respectively while targeted coagulant treatment lowered fouling potential of the mf membrane compared with control pilot fig 8 it did not significantly alter the quality i e colloidal particles levels of the filtrate the colloidal particle concentration and size in the filtrate from the control pilot as well as the coagulant treated pilot unit were similar however the tmp in the control pilot increased significantly compared with the coagulant treated pilot these observations indicated that even though the two pilot units removed similar type and concentrations of colloidal particles the fate of the removed particles is different in the control pilot the removed particles were retained in the membrane pores or on the membrane surface resulting in an increase in membrane fouling and increased tmp in the coagulant added pilot unit the removed particles were aggregated to larger flocs by the coagulant and were removed away from the membranes by the automatic mf backwashing air scouring system into the waste stream 3 4 4 residual coagulant aluminum levels in the filtrate the addition of an aluminum based coagulant may pose a risk of aluminum leakage through the mf membrane the groundwater replenishment awpf utilizes reverse osmosis ro downstream of mf the process aluminum in the mf filtrate during full scale treatment could scale the ro membranes and negatively impact the performance hence aluminum levels were measured in grab samples of untreated feed water coagulant treated feed water control filtrate and coagulant treated filtrate during the pilot study the measured aluminum level of the feed water 0 007 mg l prior to coagulant addition was below the 0 008 mg l mdl the addition of the polyaluminum chloride coagulant increased the aluminum concentration in the feed water to approximately 0 45 mg l however the aluminum concentration in the filtrate from both the control and coagulant treated pilot were below the mdl this indicated that that any excess aluminum from the coagulant was mostly rejected by the mf membrane 4 economic consideration a preliminary economic analyses of the proposed technology indicated a substantial cost savings for ocwd rajagopalan et al 2021 however the economics of the proposed technology may vary with site specific conditions including water quality coagulant type and cost electricity cost and membrane type and cost 5 conclusions the study evaluated a novel method to optimize coagulant dosing to reduce mf membrane fouling colloidal particles in the feed water were monitored in real time facilitating their removal through controlled coagulant dosing that varied depending on the particle concentration herein referred to as targeted dosing colloidal particles in the feed water were measured directly and coagulant dosage applied in proportion to the measured concentration to achieve an optimal level to minimize mf membrane fouling the instrument was integrated into the treatment process and functioned effectively as an online monitoring device at optimum coagulant dosing the pre treated water demonstrated the highest membrane flux rate and significantly lower colloidal particles concentration compared to higher or lower coagulant doses the targeted dosing coagulated colloidal particles and reduced the amount of membrane fouling by lowering the tmp increase due to fouling by 80 to 96 evaluation of membrane fouling resistance indicated that targeted coagulant dosing improved the flux rate through mitigation of irreversible fouling the membrane that received targeted coagulation contained less protein and less carbohydrates foulants and fewer elements in the cross section of the membrane finally the study demonstrated that targeted coagulant dosing produced a filtrate with the same water quality as the mf treatment with no coagulant while significantly lowering the fouling potential of the membrane and exhibiting no leakage of the residual aluminum in the mf filtrate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

available to directly measure the occurrence of colloidal particles in these waters this study evaluated the viability of a novel online light scattering technology nanoparticle tracking analysis to continuously monitor colloidal particles in the membrane feed water a secondary treated wastewater for targeted removal by injecting coagulant at a dosage proportional to the measured concentration of colloidal particles a diurnal variation was observed in the colloidal particle concentration in the feed water with the lowest concentration occurring at approximately 6 am and the highest concentration occurring after mid day the peak colloidal particle concentrations were 4 to 6 times higher than the lowest concentrations measured on the same day bench scale studies were performed to develop a relationship between colloidal particle concentration and the optimum coagulant dosage required for their removal subsequently a pilot scale study was performed using two mf pilot units operated in parallel one receiving targeted coagulant dosing and the other with no coagulant dosing to demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted coagulant dosing in preventing membrane fouling the pilot unit that received targeted coagulant dose experienced only 4 to 20 of the transmembrane pressure increase of the increase experienced by the pilot unit that received no coagulant evaluation of fouling resistance indicated that targeted coagulation improved flux by predominantly lowering the irreversible fouling the filtrate water quality measured by colloidal particle concentration chemical oxygen demand cod and turbidity were very similar for the two pilot units this suggests that although the efficiency of particle and organic materials removal does not change with coagulant addition the particles filtered by the membrane in the control unit contributed to membrane irreversible fouling while in the coagulant treated unit the coagulated colloidal particles were removed away from the membrane into the backwash stream during the frequent backwash air scour procedures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords colloidal particles light scattering online monitoring membrane fouling nanoparticles tracking analysis 1 introduction there is an increased emphasis on indirect and direct potable reuse ipr dpr in recent years to meet water demand ipr and dpr processes often involve advanced treatment of secondary or tertiary effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps microfiltration mf are integral components that serve as a pretreatment for reverse osmosis and subsequent advanced oxidation process for most ipr dpr facilities gerrity et al 2013 however treatment of wastewater effluents results in membrane fouling that give rise to in increased energy demand and costly chemical cleaning further the long term effects of irreversible fouling result in the reduction of membrane performance and membrane lifetime arhin et al 2016 fouling of low pressure membranes is often caused by organic materials colloidal particles microbial and inorganic constituents gupta and chellam 2021 howe and clark 2002 lay et al 2021 shi et al 2014 while the nature and extent of fouling varies with the source water constituents membrane characteristics and other operating parameters colloidal particles in the feed water have been identified to be major contributors of fouling howe and clark 2002 huang et al 2012 lay and chew 2020 lee et al 2004 te poele et al 2004 wu et al 2022 roorda et al 2004 reported that particles of 100 to 200 nm size were primarily responsible for fouling of ultrafiltration membranes of pore size five to twenty fold smaller than these particles roorda et al 2004 cake formation by these colloids was reported as the fouling mechanism in a different study using five different surface water samples colloidal particles 3 to 20 nm were responsible for the majority of the fouling of several low pressure membranes howe and clark 2002 in a study of raw wastewater treatment particles 1 to 8 µm contributed to significantly higher fouling than particles 8 µm however removal of particles in the range of 0 45 to 1 µm colloidal particle range improved the flux rate by approximately 25 huang et al 2017 recent studies using secondary effluents from three wwtps have shown that up to 60 to 80 of the mf membrane fouling was largely due to the deposition of feed water colloidal particles typically 200 nm inside the membrane pores or by blocking of pores through cake formation discussed further in the supplementary information file 1 si 1 rosso and rajagopalan 2013 these results indicate that monitoring and targeted removal of colloidal particles can potentially lower membrane fouling and increase low pressure membrane life pretreatment of the mf feed water via coagulation is an effective method of mitigating the fouling potential of colloidal particles huang et al 2017 however providing proper coagulant dosage is critical coagulant overdosing can lead to scaling of the mf membranes along with the ro membranes downstream in the event of significant coagulant breakthrough under dosing risks suboptimal particle removal without any improvement in the mitigation of membrane fouling huang et al 2012 judd and hillis 2001 kimura and oki 2017 lai et al 2015 a conventional approach of measuring of electrostatic charge to optimize coagulant dose was inconsistent choi and dempsey 2004 wang and wang 2006 yoo 2018 real time measurements of streaming potential or streaming current has been used to control coagulant dosing in the treatment of drinking water by low pressure membranes however these techniques are less effective at the high coagulant doses that may be required for treating secondary tertiary effluent for ipr drp applications ghernaout et al 2015 because of such limitations few ipr dpr facilities have applied coagulation pretreatment to secondary tertiary effluents prior to mf treatment until recently no analytical techniques existed to directly measure colloidal particle size distribution and concentration in the feed water to facilitate appropriate pretreatment with real time control to remove these particles and prevent their deposition on the membrane surface or pores surrogate parameters e g turbidity or organic content have been used to monitor foulant levels in the feed water au et al 2011 ratnaweera and fettig 2015 but have not correlated well with the levels of colloidal particles and hence lead to ineffective fouling control berman 2010 howe and clark 2002 schulz et al 2011 total organic carbon toc and ultraviolet uv light absorption do not distinguish between colloidal and dissolved fractions turbidity measurements are typically not very sensitive for particles smaller than 300 nm hargesheimer and lewis 1995 recent advances in nanotechnology have facilitated development of instruments that can directly measure size distribution and concentration of particles in nano colloidal scale these technologies often use light scattering characteristics and brownian motion of particles to detect and quantify particles in the colloidal size range malvern 2020 wu et al 2022 extending its application to water treatment offers a potential new tool for mitigating membrane fouling by colloidal particles and reducing energy consumption in this study bench and pilot scale demonstrations were performed using this instrument to directly measure colloidal particle concentration and size distribution in the feed water the instrument was integrated into the mf treatment process via supervisory control and data acquisition scada system to function effectively as an on lime monitoring system for this study the instrument was connected through internet that allowed for remote monitoring of the operation the real time information was used to initiate pretreatment with variable dosing of coagulant to target removal of these particles

characteristics have been used in literature to define smaller suspended particles in wastewaters e g colloidal particles sub micron particles nanoscale particles in this article the term colloidal particles is used to define sub micron 1 µm size suspended particles measured using the nta technology while this study did not systematically characterize the composition of the colloidal particles it is likely to include organic materials such as polysaccharides proteins amino sugars as well as some inorganic materials fan et al 2008 jarusutthirak et al 2002 laabs et al 2006 worms et al 2010 the objectives were to demonstrate that 1 the instrument can reliably detect colloidal size particles in the membrane feed water a secondary wastewater effluent 2 the instrument can be integrated into the mf treatment process to function effectively as an online monitoring device 3 the coagulant dosing can be optimized in real time based on the feed water colloidal particle characteristics 4 the targeted dosing can remove the colloidal particles and lower the transmembrane pressure tmp during treatment and 5 the coagulant will not reach a significant level in the mf filtrate to adversely impact the ro process in addition the nature of membrane fouling with and without targeted coagulant addition was studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 study approach a four step approach was used to address the specific objectives of this study first the feed water to the membrane system was monitored over time to understand the diurnal and daily trends in colloidal particle concentration next bench scale phipps and bird jar tests followed by dead end single element mf flux test were performed with feed waters containing different initial concentrations of colloidal particles in order to develop a relationship between colloidal particle concentration and optimum coagulant dosing required to remove colloidal particles subsequently the validity of the calibration curves developed through bench scale tests were verified and adjusted for the pilot test set up finally pilot tests were performed using two parallel mf membrane units one operated with targeted coagulant dosing using

orange county water district ocwd advanced water purification facility awpf in fountain valley ca ocwd receives and treats a blend of activated sludge 75 80 and trickling filter 20 25 effluent from orange county sanitation district oc san plant no 1 samples were collected at 15 min intervals to identify diurnal fluctuation in the concentration of colloidal particles the general water quality is displayed in table 1 see section 2 6 2 4 relationship between colloidal particle concentration and optimum coagulant dosing initially screening tests were performed using various polymers and a polyaluminum chloride pacl coagulant calchem 2060 calchem inc modesto ca 9 7 aluminum was selected due to lower aluminum content and better coagulation for fouling reduction in this study the relationship between the feed water colloidal particle concentration and optimum pacl coagulant dosage to reduce membrane fouling was evaluated by performing jar tests followed by single element dead end microfiltration tests three sets of jar tests phips and bird richmond va were performed each with different initial colloidal particle concentrations in the feed water the coagulant dose was varied from 5 to 20 mg l in six jars each containing 1 l of feed water upon coagulant addition the contents of the jars were rapid mixed at 120 rpm for 1 min slow mixed at 30 rpm for 5 min and allowed to settle for 5 min the supernatant from each sample was collected and filtered through 0 2 µm filters to mimic removal of larger particles by backwashing in full scale unit prior to the single fiber 0 2 µm polypropylene membrane fouling tests the dead end single element mf fouling tests were conducted as described elsewhere safarik and phipps 2009 the drop in flux at constant suction pressure 5 psi was used to ascertain fouling potential for each colloidal particle concentration and coagulant dosage combination the coagulant dosage that yielded the least flux decline after 5 min was identified as the optimum coagulant dosage corresponding to the initial colloidal particle concentration regression analyses were performed using the initial colloidal particle concentration total concentration as well as concentration of particles in different size ranges and the optimum coagulant dosing for the three cases the best fit regression equation developed was used to adjust the coagulant dosing rates in the pilot study 2 5 pilot demonstration two sets of pilot tests test 1 and test 2 were performed each using two parallel direct filtration evoqua 4s10v cs submerged mf pilot units evoqua water technologies pittsburgh pa each pilot was equipped with four submerged polypropylene pp mf membranes the pp mf membranes had a nominal pore size of 0 2 µm one pilot unit received feedwater without coagulant addition control and the other unit received feedwater that was pre coagulated with a targeted amount of calchem 2060 through continuous sample analyses at 15 min intervals pilot units were operated in direct filtration mode at a flux of 20 gal ft per day gfd and a filtrate flow rate of 18 gpm every 22 min the membranes were automatically backwashed and air scoured the tmp for these units were logged automatically using feed and filtrate pressure transducers deltabar pmd235 endress hauser upon reaching a tmp of approximately 8 to 10 psi in the control pilot unit both the pilot units were shut down for chemical clean in place cip cleaning cip was performed according to ocwd s mf cleaning protocol evoqua 2015 each pilot was equipped with pumps feed and filtrate magnetic flow meters feed filtrate and backwash turbidimeters feed and filtrate air compressor and an automated cleaning skid a slip stream of the membrane feed water was analyzed by ns500 nta instrument based on the measured particle concentration and size a process control software signaled the release of the appropriate coagulant dosage to the pilot unit that received targeted coagulant dosing an inline mixer and an approximately 1000 ft x 1 5 in diameter braided tubing provided mixing and a 5 min contact time for the coagulation of colloidal particles fig 1 shows the schematic of the pilot unit configuration 2 6 membrane resistance calculations during the pilot operation membrane fouling was calculated using the following formula r t r i r r r i r p j μ rt is the total

carbohydrate analyses using colorimetric reagents yield inconsistent results le and stuckey 2016 mæhre et al 2018 however due to lack of alternate reliable analyses for these parameters these methods were used and the results reported in this study the composition of the fouling layer on the membrane surface and the extent of fouling penetration into the membrane was visualized and quantified by

fiber s cross section membrane samples were fractured after being flash frozen using liquid nitrogen all samples were sputter coated with gold of pd pt 4 nm before analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 feed water characteristics 3 1 1 general water quality parameters relevant water quality characteristics of the feed water during the study are summarized in table 1 the water quality characteristics of the membrane feed water remained largely stable during the study the ph of the feed water varied by 0 2 units and the tds varied by 130 mg l while factors including ph ionic strength membrane material and pore size can affect membrane fouling dersoir et al 2019 tang et al 2011 the water quality of the membrane feed water remained fairly stable during the study 3 1 2 diurnal variations in colloidal particle concentration representative feed water particle counts measured over a 24 h weekday and weekend period are shown in fig 2 throughout the study period the feed water particle concentrations followed a cyclical pattern reaching a peak value after mid day and a minimum value near 6 am the low and high points of colloidal particles concentration in the secondary effluent delivered as the feed water to the ocwd awpf were offset by a few hours from the diurnal flow pattern observed for the raw wastewater at ocsan where the flow peaks between 9 am and 10 am and is lowest between 3 am and 4 am the reasons for the variability in the colloidal particles profile are not currently known this may be due to the travel time of the wastewater flow through the upstream wastewater treatment process at oc san and transport of the secondary effluent to the ocwd water reclamation facility the measured peak colloidal particles concentrations were 4 to 6 fold higher than the lowest concentration observed during the same day this along with diurnal variations in the flow rate may cause the coagulant demand to vary by about an order of magnitude over each day such variations may differ from plant to plant due to source of the colloidal particles as well as differences in unit treatment processes and flow equalization at the treatment facilities 3 2 comparison of colloidal particle concentration and other surrogate foulant parameters fig 3 shows the colloidal particle concentration in grab samples collected at different times of the day over a period of two weeks and corresponding levels of surrogate parameters turbidity uv absorbance and cod that are typically used to measure foulant levels the levels of these surrogate parameters did not correlate well with the variations in the levels of the colloidal particles while the colloidal particle concentration varied by nearly eight fold from approximately 0 5 108 particles ml to 4 108 particles ml the surrogate parameters did not vary significantly and consistently in feed water samples these data indicate that a pretreatment approach using coagulant dosage based on conventional surrogate foulant concentrations may result in under or overdosing of coagulant this observation is consistent with that of schulz et al 2011 who compared colloidal particle counts measured using ns500 with several conventional surrogates including dissolved organic carbon doc ultraviolet light absorption at 254 nm uv254 and suspended solids in secondary effluent at a german wwtp schulz et al 2011 their data show poor correlation for these parameters with colloidal particles further howe and clark 2002 reported that colloidal particles 3 20 nm contributed to 65 of low pressure membrane fouling but they constituted only 10 15 of the doc howe and clark 2002 approximately 85 90 of doc did not by itself caused fouling in another study the cod of the sequentially filtered secondary treated effluent did not vary significantly 28 3 mg l but the colloidal particles concentration varied by seven fold from approximately 170 kcps ml in the unfiltered effluent to approximately 28 kcps ml in the effluent filtered using 10 nm filters rosso and rajagopalan 2013 these data suggested that monitoring organic compounds e g doc or cod levels in the feed water may not be a viable surrogate technique for mf fouling 3 3 bench scale jar and membrane flux tests jar tests were conducted using ocwd mf feed water at low 1 4 108 particles ml medium 3 0 108 particles ml and high 6 0 108 particles ml colloidal particle concentrations representing the observed range fig 2 the size of the colloidal particles measured in the three feed water samples ranged from 40 to 900 nm si 2 however more than 85 of the particles were less than 200 nm smaller than the membrane pore size and 99 of the particles were smaller than 500 nm each of these samples were first coagulated with a range of coagulant dosages 5 to 20 mg l pacl the optimum coagulant dosage was determined for each water quality initial feed water colloidal particle concentration based on the flux rate of the coagulated supernatant observed after 5 min of bench scale single fiber flux testing at constant vacuum pressure 5 psi fig 4 shows the concentration and particle size distribution of the coagulated and settled samples using different coagulant dosages 0 7 5 10 and 15 mg l during the jar tests for the feed water with initial colloidal particle concentration of 3 108 particles ml the sample with no coagulant had the highest concentration of particles concentration of colloidal particles in the settled samples decreased with the addition of coagulant the concentration of colloidal particles at 10 mg l of coagulant was lower than those at 7 5 and 15 mg l subsequent bench scale single element membrane flux tests also showed higher membrane flux at 10 mg l coagulant than no coagulant and 7 5 and 15 mg l of coagulant si 3 these data indicated that optimum coagulant dose for colloidal particles removal for this feed water was approximately 10 mg l similar trends in colloidal particle concentrations and flux rates were observed at coagulant doses for the low and high particle concentration feed water samples while not specifically tested the particles in the coagulated settled samples may contain particles from coagulant itself particles initially detected in the feed water and colloidal as well as dissolved particles i e those below the detection level of nanosight in the feed water that were aggregated to a larger size by the coagulant fig 5 shows the optimum coagulant dose for each colloidal particle concentration tested and the regression equation developed to relate colloidal particles concentration and the coagulant dose the dosing curve fig 5 indicated that there is a positive linear relationship between the feed water particle concentration and the optimum coagulant dosage over the range of particle concentrations tested the optimum coagulant dosage determined from the membrane fouling tests is expressed by the following relationship o p t i m a l p a c l c o a g u l a n t d o s a g e m g l 2 82 10 8 p a r t i c l e s i n f e e d w a t e r m l 2 796 this relationship developed for ocwd mf treatment is likely to vary for other plants when factors affecting aggregation of colloidal particles or membrane fouling e g water quality characteristics membrane chemistry coagulant type vary for example bench scale studies performed using secondary effluent from a different treatment plant using the calchem 2060 coagulant and ferric chloride for fouling reduction of a pvdf membrane nominal pore size 0 1 µm yielded different relationship between colloidal particles concentration and optimum coagulant dose for each case si 4 differences in water quality parameters such as total dissolved solids calcium magnesium and dissolved and colloidal organic content that could affect aggregation characteristics of the colloids could also affect the equation developed similarly differences in membrane characteristics such as pore size surface charge and membrane material that could influence fouling characteristics can affect the optimum coagulant dosage relationship with respect to colloidal particle concentration finally coagulant characteristics such as basicity and al13 species content are known to affect coagulation efficiency hu et al 2006 however for a plant where the wastewater characteristics remain generally stable e g table 1 for ocwd the membrane and coagulant types are identified and concentration of colloidal particles is the major variable the optimum coagulant dose equation once developed for their conditions will be effective 3 4 microfiltration pilot testing 3 4 1 validation of coagulant dose relationship under pilot test conditions initial tests were performed to verify the validity of the coagulant dosing model developed from the bench scale jar studies these tests were performed over a 3 hr window around noon when the colloidal particle concentrations did not vary significantly 5 7 108 particles ml the model was tested by varying the coagulant dose and verifying that the most particles were removed and the highest flux rate was achieved at the optimum coagulant dose estimated by the model the mf pilot units were operated at a constant flow of 18 gpm for the feed water colloidal particle concentration of 5 7 108 particles ml the model estimated optimum coagulant dose was 18 8 mg l coagulant dose during this test varied from 12 3 to 36 8 mg l at each dose coagulant was added for approximately 20 min four times the mixing time and the coagulated feed water was collected at the end of the 1000 ft contactor the flux rate of the coagulated water was then determined using the bench scale dead end single element set up the concentrations of feed water colloidal particles and coagulated samples were measured at each dosing condition fig 6 shows the flux rate of the feed water dosed with different concentrations of the coagulant the optimum coagulant dose indicated by the highest flux rate was approximately 18 4 mg l which is within 2 of the dose determined by the model the settled water particle count was among the lowest at the optimum coagulant dose si 5 which indicated that the model could be used to deliver targeted coagulant dosing for the pilot test 3 4 2 pilot testing to evaluate targeted coagulant dosing the tmp measurements for the pilots operated with and without coagulant dosing were recorded at 1 min intervals tmp measurements for the pilot units during one of the tests is shown in fig 7 similar trends in tmp reduction due to targeted coagulant addition was observed in both pilot tests si 6 the initial tmp for both pilot units during test 1 was approximately 3 8 psi the average tmp of the coagulant dosed pilot on the last day day 65 only increased 5 to 4 psi conversely the average tmp of the control pilot on the last day more than doubled to 8 6 psi indicating that the coagulant was extremely effective in lowering membrane fouling and maintaining low tmp compared control pilot the percent reduction in tmp increase due to coagulant addition in the two tests were 96 and 80 respectively the intrinsic resistance for the membrane under the conditions was found to be 1 08 1012 m 1 fig 8 shows the reversible and irreversible fouling resistance the reversible fouling resistance in the pilots with and without the coagulant remained at 5 1011 m 1 until approximately 40 days after the cip after which a slight increase in the reversible fouling was observed the increase in reversible fouling in the control pilot was higher than the coagulant dosed pilot by approximately 3 5 1011 m 1 the initial irreversible fouling on both the pilots were approximately 1 5 1012 m 1 with a gradual increase over time however the increase was significantly higher in the control pilot compared to the coagulant dosed pilot unit in the coagulant dosed pilot unit the irreversible fouling resistance increased to approximately 1 5 1012 m 1 after approximately 25 days and did not increase significantly until day 55 in the control pilot the irreversible fouling continued to increase throughout the testing period reaching approximately 7 4 1012 m 1 after 55 days compared to the first 35 days the rate of irreversible fouling increased significantly after 35 days of operation of the control unit indicating a different fouling mechanism during this period while the fouling mechanism of the coagulant dosed membrane is not currently known it appears that there are a limited number of sites that can irreversibly bind constituents in the coagulated feed water once these sites are saturated during the first 15 days little if any binding occurred conversely irreversible fouling likely occurred through different mechanisms in the control membrane as indicated by the different slopes of calculated membrane resistance fig 8 eds analyses were performed on the surface and cross sections of the mf fibers table 2 many elements that were present in the cross section of the control fiber i e those that penetrated the membrane matrix fe na cl f and si were not present in the cross section of the coagulant treated pilot this suggested that these elements contributed more to the irreversible fouling of the control membrane the targeted coagulation likely removed these elements in the feed water resulting in a reduction in the irreversible fouling sem images are shown in supplemental information si 7 although cumulatively the magnitude of irreversible fouling is much greater than reversible fouling for both pilot units reversible fouling is much greater than irreversible fouling during each backwash cycle for example the tmp trends over four consecutive backwash cycles on a randomly selected day day 61 during test 1 showed an average reversible fouling of 1 67 psi and 1 02 psi per backwash cycle for the control and coagulant added pilot respectively the average irreversible fouling during the same period were 0 046 psi and 0 008 psi for the control pilot and coagulant treated pilot respectively while several studies have shown reduction in fouling by coagulant addition a consensus on its relative performance on reversible and irreversible fouling is still evolving huang et al 2017 reported that during treatment of influent wastewater reversible fouling on mf membranes was approximately four times higher than that of irreversible fouling and coagulant addition mitigated reversible fouling 97 than irreversible fouling 80 huang et al 2017 kimura and oki 2017 reported surface water treatment by mf membrane without coagulant addition caused more irreversible fouling than reversible fouling kimura and oki 2017 coagulant addition 10 20 mg l lowered fouling by 15 45 but mitigated reversible fouling more than irreversible fouling in another study 10 mg l coagulant addition did not significantly mitigate irreversible fouling of mf membranes kimura and kume 2020 coagulant dosing based on charge neutralization was reported to be less effective in lowering irreversible fouling compared with a lower dosing that resulted in a higher negative charge yoo 2018 however our study showed that the cumulative irreversible fouling on the membranes was significantly higher than the reversible fouling and targeted coagulation helped mitigate irreversible fouling more than reversible fouling fig 8 the differences in the fouling trends observed may be due to differences in the feed water quality membranes coagulants and testing conditions used in these studies further the type of coagulant and targeted coagulant dosing used in this study could also have contributed to the differences observed in this study a long term pilot testing to compare fouling reduction at constant coagulant dosing with that of targeted dosing was not performed however short term tests using constant dosing of 60 and 120 mg l coagulant increased tmp by 13 and 20 respectively in 1 h compared to targeted dosing after 5 h constant addition of 120 mg l increased the tmp to 9 8 psi which is twice the tmp experienced through targeted coagulation after almost 60 days operation in a separate study with different feed water and membrane type long term targeted coagulant addition 5 to 15 mg l decreased the rate of tmp increase by 25 compared to constant coagulant dosing 10 mg l si 8 protein and polysaccharides are among the major components of wastewater that are reported to cause reversible and irreversible fouling of mf membranes lai et al 2015 pramanik et al 2015 fig 9 shows the protein and carbohydrate deposits in the membranes with and without coagulant addition the coagulant treated membrane had 30 55 less protein and 22 50 less carbohydrates overall protein and carbohydrate levels were evenly distributed on the top and middle portion of the control membranes with the bottom of the membrane having 35 more foulants in the coagulant treated membrane protein deposition in the middle of the membrane was 30 lower than the top and 50 lower at the bottom carbohydrate deposition in the middle of the membrane was 35 and 30 lower than the top and bottom respectively 3 4 3 particle count in filtrate samples fig 10 shows the particle size distribution in the membrane feed waters and filtrate samples from the control and coagulant treated pilot units the concentrations are average values of 26 grab samples collected over two months during test 2 both mf pilots received the same feed water and removed nearly identical levels of colloidal particles the filtrates from the coagulant treated and control pilot units contained about 4 5 and 3 of the particles in the feed water i e about 95 5 and 97 removal respectively while targeted coagulant treatment lowered fouling potential of the mf membrane compared with control pilot fig 8 it did not significantly alter the quality i e colloidal particles levels of the filtrate the colloidal particle concentration and size in the filtrate from the control pilot as well as the coagulant treated pilot unit were similar however the tmp in the control pilot increased significantly compared with the coagulant treated pilot these observations indicated that even though the two pilot units removed similar type and concentrations of colloidal particles the fate of the removed particles is different in the control pilot the removed particles were retained in the membrane pores or on the membrane surface resulting in an increase in membrane fouling and increased tmp in the coagulant added pilot unit the removed particles were aggregated to larger flocs by the coagulant and were removed away from the membranes by the automatic mf backwashing air scouring system into the waste stream 3 4 4 residual coagulant aluminum levels in the filtrate the addition of an aluminum based coagulant may pose a risk of aluminum leakage through the mf membrane the groundwater replenishment awpf utilizes reverse osmosis ro downstream of mf the process aluminum in the mf filtrate during full scale treatment could scale the ro membranes and negatively impact the performance hence aluminum levels were measured in grab samples of untreated feed water coagulant treated feed water control filtrate and coagulant treated filtrate during the pilot study the measured aluminum level of the feed water 0 007 mg l prior to coagulant addition was below the 0 008 mg l mdl the addition of the polyaluminum chloride coagulant increased the aluminum concentration in the feed water to approximately 0 45 mg l however the aluminum concentration in the filtrate from both the control and coagulant treated pilot were below the mdl this indicated that that any excess aluminum from the coagulant was mostly rejected by the mf membrane 4 economic consideration a preliminary economic analyses of the proposed technology indicated a substantial cost savings for ocwd rajagopalan et al 2021 however the economics of the proposed technology may vary with site specific conditions including water quality coagulant type and cost electricity cost and membrane type and cost 5 conclusions the study evaluated a novel method to optimize coagulant dosing to reduce mf membrane fouling colloidal particles in the feed water were monitored in real time facilitating their removal through controlled coagulant dosing that varied depending on the particle concentration herein referred to as targeted dosing colloidal particles in the feed water were measured directly and coagulant dosage applied in proportion to the measured concentration to achieve an optimal level to minimize mf membrane fouling the instrument was integrated into the treatment process and functioned effectively as an online monitoring device at optimum coagulant dosing the pre treated water demonstrated the highest membrane flux rate and significantly lower colloidal particles concentration compared to higher or lower coagulant doses the targeted dosing coagulated colloidal particles and reduced the amount of membrane fouling by lowering the tmp increase due to fouling by 80 to 96 evaluation of membrane fouling resistance indicated that targeted coagulant dosing improved the flux rate through mitigation of irreversible fouling the membrane that received targeted coagulation contained less protein and less carbohydrates foulants and fewer elements in the cross section of the membrane finally the study demonstrated that targeted coagulant dosing produced a filtrate with the same water quality as the mf treatment with no coagulant while significantly lowering the fouling potential of the membrane and exhibiting no leakage of the residual aluminum in the mf filtrate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

acceptance is needed in this study we propose a perceptive axiological model pam to understand the reasons for public acceptance or rejection of recycled water this is the first model to jointly consider three conceptual dimensions the diagnosis of the environmental situation the axiological influence and the public perceptions regarding recycled water the sample in this study consisted of 726 randomly selected participants who completed an online questionnaire a key factor considered was the type of water use low or high contact additionally the model s ability to predict acceptance in regions of high and low water stress was tested the model showed good fit and predictive capacity for both low r2 272 and high r2 501 contact uses and partial equivalence between regions threat perception was the most distal variable in the model which together with identity affected the attribution of responsibility these variables along with trust in scientists affected the three direct predictors of acceptance perceived health risks moral obligation and cost benefit analysis perceived health risk was the most important predictor in both types of contact β 642 in high contact β 388 in low contact uses moral obligation had a greater impact in high contact β 170 than in low contact β 099 uses the opposite outcome occurred with respect to costs benefit analysis β 067 in high contact β 219 in low contact uses the pam offers a general framework that identifies the importance of the three dimensions and how they interact with each other which facilitates the development of strategies to increase acceptance on the one hand the pam works as a tool to assess the profile of a specific population and on the other hand it highlights the specific factors which are the best suited for interventions to increase public acceptance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords recycled water public acceptance water scarcity axiological factors risk perception costs benefits perception 1 introduction the global freshwater shortage situation is alarming of the 171 countries for which estimates of the degree of water stress are available 31 show water stress levels between 25 and 70 22 countries have values above 70 and 11 have values of 100 united nations 2018 amongst the different strategies aimed at guaranteeing water supplies the use of recycled water is one of the most promising recycled water is treated wastewater mcomber et al 2021 the un 2017 recognised this strategy for its value both in reducing water consumption and in the recovery of its nutrients despite the success of water recycling efforts in some parts of the world lee and tan 2016 sanchez flores et al 2016 there are sectors of the population that still do not accept the practice in fact public opposition has paralyzed some of water recycling projects brouwer et al 2015 ellis et al 2021 hurlimann and dolnicar 2010 therefore understanding the reasons for the acceptance and rejection of recycled water is a key issue studies in the field have highlighted the importance of several variables ranging from threat perception mankad and tapsuwan 2011 to the perception of risks domènech and saurí 2010 and benefits of recycled water hurlimann et al 2008 as well as public trust in science fielding et al 2015 the information offered by these studies is highly relevant however it should be noted that the variables were analysed individually prior studies have not assessed the interaction between the different variables and the contextual conditions that affect the acceptance of recycled water using an integrated model the objective of this study is to integrate these conditions by verifying a model of acceptance for recycled water that is based on three fundamental premises firstly for the use of recycled water to be considered it is necessary to perceive that a problem of water scarcity exists and that it poses an imminent threat to the planet and to people s wellbeing garcia cuerva et al 2016 gómez román et al 2020 without this understanding there would be no reason to change current water related behaviours secondly if this perception exists it should be translated into the development of pro environmental values and identity these factors would contribute to the acceptance of behaviours linked to environmental commitment de groot and steg 2007 whitmarsh and o neill 2010 thirdly the population may see advantages disadvantages or both relating to the use of recycled water depending on each person s analysis a person s acceptance of recycled water will be greater or lesser baghapour et al 2017 hurlimann 2006 these premises can be grouped into three conceptually distinct dimensions a the diagnosis of the environmental situation b the axiological influence and c the perception of recycled water 1 1 the diagnosis of the environmental situation threat perception and attribution of responsibility people can change their attitudes and behaviours if they feel that there are sufficient reasons to justify a change for example a new water scarcity problem that must be addressed might shift public perceptions about recycled water in this sense cases where the public experience significant water restrictions contribute to a higher degree of acceptance of recycled water dolnicar et al 2011 etale et al 2020 other authors have pointed out that it is the perception of the problem and not necessarily the actual water supply situation that determines levels of public acceptance of recycled water fielding et al 2018 thereby perceiving water scarcity as a real and imminent threat to humanity can serve as a fundamental condition for acceptance gómez román et al 2020 to assess the degree of threat posed by a particular situation at least two aspects must be considered the severity of the event and one s perceived vulnerability to it rogers 1975 1983 when the level of these two variables is high people are more inclined to adopt alternative responses to the situation this insight suggests that one s perception of a threat facilitates acceptance of responses to it we are not aware of any literature that specifically evaluates this phenomenon with respect to the topic of recycled water although the phenomenon has been identified in the adoption of different decentralised systems for wastewater treatment mankad et al 2011 in addition to estimating the threat level that water scarcity poses it is also necessary to consider who people attribute the origin and evolution of this problem to if people perceive and assume that they are responsible to it in some way they may consider the approaches proposed to solve it more favourably nancarrow et al 2008 analyse how personal responsibility affects public perceptions of recycled water concluding that it is not a significant predictor of public intention to use recycled water however in our view this study raises two fundamental problems first the authors evaluate the degree of responsibility to guarantee the water supply that is the authors consider the responsibility for the evolution of the problem but not for its origin second the authors evaluate the responsibility of the individual the community and the authorities jointly not separately we argue that it is more appropriate to evaluate the concept of attribution of responsibility feather 1969 heider 1958 which refers to how each person decides to whom to attribute responsibility for both the creation and maintenance of the problem an individual will express the attribution of responsibility for water shortages in two ways a by indicating that he or she is directly responsible for the water shortage problem as a consequence of his or her action or inaction internal attribution or b by pointing out that the agents causing the problem are others such as companies or governments external attribution 1 2 the axiological influence environmental identity and moral obligation another relevant factor to understand the public s possible responses to recycled water pertains to the values and beliefs that people have towards the environment a person s system of values and beliefs is a fundamental factor to understanding why he or she has certain sustainability preferences and perspectives or behaves in a pro environmental way steg et al 2014 nevertheless its importance as an antecedent of pro environmental behaviour is due to the influence it has on two specific processes firstly values and beliefs make up the central core of one s environmental identity van der werff et al 2013 secondly they facilitate the activation of one s sense of obligation to act according to this set of moral precepts stern 2000 environmental identity has been identified as a consistency predictor for a wide range of pro environmental behaviours such as reducing waste and conserving energy and water in the home whitmarsh and o neill 2010 thereby pro environmental identity should also affect the use of recycled water insofar as it is also a pro environmental behaviour in this study we take a more specific approach to analysing citizens identities in relation to water adapting the notion of environmental identity proposed by clayton 2003 our approach can be defined as the portion of environmental identity that forms our self concept through a sense of connection with water affecting how we perceive and act in the world the belief that water is important to us and that it is part of who we are the effect identity has on people s behaviour is reinforced when their sense of moral obligation is activated in a way that motivates them to act in accordance with their values despite inconveniences and associated costs sabucedo et al 2018 vilas and sabucedo 2012 in this regard moral obligation is a very relevant personal variable when it comes to understanding public social acceptance of recycled water usage to our knowledge this concept has not yet been included in analyses of public rejection or acceptance of recycled water although it has been identified as an important variable in participatory irrigation management yang et al 2021 and environmentally friendly collective actions molder et al 2021 1 3 the perception of recycled water trust in science health risks and costs and benefits many citizens may have developed a pro environmental identity and even a sense of moral obligation to protect the environment however this does not ensure that they will accept any sort of proposed solution to a given environmental problem without question solutions that some people would consider acceptable may be problematic for others a solution s perception and consequent assessment in this case the use of recycled water must be verified in the following two ways a trust in the agent that proposes it and b analysis of its consequences particularly its risks costs and benefits different agents influence citizens perceptions of any aspect of reality and their level of influence essentially depends on the degree to which citizens trust them in the field of recycled water trust is defined as a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behaviour of the authority responsible for the recycled water scheme ross et al 2014 p 62 of course not all agents are equally trusted in the case of the acceptance of recycled water the trust the public place in the scientific community plays a fundamental role fielding et al 2015 leviston et al 2006 price et al 2010 specifically the effect of trust on acceptance seems to be mediated by perception of the risk associated with using recycled water because this water is generated from wastewater it is not surprising that health risk emerges as a major concern of respondents fielding et al 2018 p 14 thereby the greater the trust in those who promote using recycled water the lower the risk perception hurlimann et al 2008 nancarrow et al 2008 ross et al 2014 at the same time a lower risk perception favours both acceptance domènech and saurí 2010 and the intention to use recycled water nancarrow et al 2009 when analysing the consequences of using recycled water risk perception is undoubtedly an essential factor however people will also assess other costs and benefits associated with using recycled water the economic cost of implementing alternative water systems is of great concern mankad et al 2015 although few studies have analysed its specific role in the acceptance process fielding et al 2018 nonetheless a positive relationship has been found between economic benefits and satisfaction hurlimann et al 2008 and the degree of public support friedler et al 2006 matos et al 2014 with respect to environmental benefits they seem to have even greater relevance than economic benefits in influencing public satisfaction with the use of recycled water hurlimann 2008 the variables described in this section have been raised in relation to the general use of recycled water without considering different sorts of use for this type of water however it must be noted that the degree of public acceptance of recycled water differs depending on its end use uses that involve higher degrees of personal contact or ingestion such as drinking fielding et al 2018 or irrigating crops savchenko et al 2019 are less accepted than those uses that involve less contact such as street cleaning fielding et al 2018 1 4 objectives and model proposal previous studies have mainly focused on analysing the influence that certain factors independent of one another have on public acceptance of recycled water usage this study proposes the development of a comprehensive model to assess a the interrelation between the three dimensions of the diagnosis of the environmental situation the axiological influence and public perception of recycled water and b the joint predictive capacity as well as the relative effect of the different psychological variables that make up each of the dimensions of public acceptance of recycled water fig 1 introduces the predictive model that will be analysed the type of recycled water use classified by its degree of personal contact and a region s level of water stress will also be considered to this end the authors sought evidence for the verification of two predictive models one for acceptance of low contact uses lca and the other for acceptance of high contact uses hca the model will also be tested for its predictive adequacy in determining recycled water acceptance both in regions with high and low water stress levels 2 method 2 1 participants and procedure participants were selected by proportional random sampling by sex and age in the two spanish communities with the most extreme values of water stress galicia is the rainiest region in the country and murcia is the driest fig 2 during october 2019 the average rainfall in galicia was 197 l m2 considerably higher than the 29 l m2 of rainfall in murcia citizens who matched the specified profile i e by gender age and place of residence were contacted by email between october 2nd and 23rd 2019 by a company that specialises in market research the company compensated participants financially in exchange for their participation they received a link to an online questionnaire with an estimated duration of 15 min on the first page participants received information about the terms and objectives of the study subsequently they gave their consent for data processing this study was approved by university of santiago de compostela s bioethics committee participants had to be at least 18 years old to complete the survey to guarantee the quality of the responses the following exclusion criteria were established a questionnaires completed in less than 425 s and b inconsistent responses to items formulated in reverse 2 2 measures the design and development of the questionnaire were reviewed by four experts in social psychology and two experts in methodology participants levels of disagreement or agreement with a statement in the questionnaire were measured using two different scale modalities using the likert response format a from 1 to 5 and b from 0 to 10 in addition questions about sociodemographic characteristics were included to guarantee the proportionality of the sample table 1 lists each scale s variables the number of items an item example and internal consistency the items related to the variables of perceived risks and acceptance correspond to different uses of recycled water each of these scales was divided into two categories according to the level of personal contact with recycled water lr and lca for low contact and hr and hca for high contact this division was corroborated by factor analysis of both exploratory and confirmatory types to more accurately observe the participant s degrees of moral obligation this scale was presented to participants twice in succession in the first presentation the participants had to answer a question about what degree of moral obligation they have thinking about recycled water uses that they had previously classified as low risk lmo in the second they answered the same question but were asked to consider the uses that they had previously classified as high risk hmo 2 3 data analysis the analysis of the statistical data began with a description of the sample in addition to balancing the sample by sex and age it was assessed that there were no significant differences between regions with respect to participants education level employment status and monthly income then two analyses were carried out first structural equation models sems to check to what extent pam adequately predicts acceptance for both low contact and high contact uses we adhered to the following reference values as evaluation criteria for model fit hu and bentler 1999 95 for cfi comparative fit index and for tli tucker lewis index 06 for rmsea root mean square error of approximation and 08 for srmr standardized root mean square residual second a multiple group analysis to assess whether the predictive capacity of pam was equivalent between regions with opposite levels of scarcity as evaluation criteria for the unconstrained and constrained analysis of the models we used the chi square difference statistic byrne et al 1989 together with the change in cfi cheung and rensvold 2002 invariance was met when a non significant difference in chi squares and a cfi change of 01 or lower occurred between unconstrained and constrained models these analyses were performed with mplus version 7 4 using the maximum likelihood method as the estimation method 3 results 3 1 socio demographic information the final sample consisted of 726 participants 50 1 males mage 43 90 sd 13 17 range 18 88 of which 359 resided in galicia 48 7 males mage 45 77 sd 13 40 range 18 88 and 367 resided in murcia 51 5 males mage 42 05 sd 12 68 range 18 82 there were no significant differences between locations regarding sex χ² 550 df 1 p 458 educational level χ² 2 584 df 3 p 460 employment statuses χ² 8 883 df 4 p 064 and monthly incomes χ² 9 452 df 9 p 397 significant differences were found with respect to age χ² 11 041 df 2 p 004 although this particularity can be attributed to the use of proportional sampling according to the age distribution in both populations taken together the data indicate that both sub samples show a considerable degree of similarity 3 2 structural models of recycled water acceptance for low and high contact uses the main purpose of this analysis was to check the model s capacity to predict both recycled water acceptance for low contact uses as well as for high contact uses the models for low and high contact showed good fit and predictive capacity the values obtained for the low contact model are as follows χ² 12 n 726 24 776 p 016 cfi 984 tli 965 rmsea 038 90 ci 016 060 srmr 027 r 2 272 p 001 the results relative to the high contact model are the following χ² 12 n 726 20 042 p 066 cfi 991 tli 979 rmsea 030 90 ci 000 053 srmr 024 r 2 501 p 001 although both models showed good fit the predictive ability of the model for low contact uses was lower than the high contact uses model however the data show that the models maintained a similar relationship structure as shown in figs 3 and 4 people who perceived the scarcity situation as being threatening also identified more strongly with aspects related to water in addition the results show that a high score on both variables encouraged people to assume the personal responsibility for the scarcity furthermore the results indicate that people who identified with water and who assumed responsibility for the water scarcity expressed a greater sense of moral obligation to use recycled water and perceived that the benefits of its use outweigh the costs in addition they also show trust in the science which contributes to increasing the benefits of using recycled water and reducing the perception of health risks as hypothesised the results show that moral obligation costs benefits perception and perceived health risk were direct predictors of acceptance of recycled water use although all three contributed significantly to the two models there are important differences between them in the high contact use model the effect of risk perception and moral obligation was greater than in the low contact model in contrast the effect of the cost benefit analysis was more relevant in the low contact use model of the three the variable with the greatest explanatory power on the acceptance of recycled water in both models was health risks perception 3 3 multiple group analysis the pam s equivalence between dry and wet regions the model was tested in galicia and murcia to explore its predictive capacity in regions characterised by extreme water scarcity and abundance table 2 shows that the model adequately predicts acceptance in each of the regions figs 5 and 6 show the estimated relationships between variables once the model was estimated for each region a multiple group analysis was conducted this analysis allowed us to check whether the model is equivalent in both dry and wet regions the multiple group strategy was incremental firstly the unconstrained analysis of the model shows whether the general structure of the model is shared between regions secondly the constrained analysis of the model indicates whether the weight of the relationships is similar between both regions the results for the unconstrained model are satisfactory for low contact uses χ² 24 n 726 38 320 p 032 cfi 983 tli 962 rmsea 041 90 ci 012 064 srmr 033 the values were similar for the high contact model χ² 24 n 726 30 375 p 172 cfi 993 tli 984 rmsea 027 90 ci 000 053 srmr 028 these results indicate that the structure or general form of the model was shared between the two regions this suggests that the proposed model is suitable for predicting acceptance of recycled water in regions with water scarcity and water abundance the analysis of the constrained models indicates that in addition to the structure the weight of the relationships in both regions is partially equivalent both for low contact δχ² 15 n 726 24 233 p 061 cfi diff 01 and high contact uses δχ² 12 n 726 19 571 p 076 cfi diff 009 this means that with few exceptions the weight of established relationships is similar in both regions first in murcia identity had a greater effect on the perception of the cost and benefits of the recycled water use in both the low and high contact models secondly the weight of the trust with respect to the perception of risks and benefits was lower in murcia the region with the greatest water scarcity this difference is especially marked in the low contact model finally with respect to the direct predictors of acceptance the effects of moral obligation and the perception of health risks are greater in the high contact model in both regions in contrast the effect of perceived benefits in the high contact model is lower especially in murcia 4 discussion this study has proposed a perceptive axiological model pam that predicts the level of public acceptance of recycled water is based on three theoretical dimensions the diagnosis of the environmental situation the axiological influence and public perceptions of recycled water the analyses carried out in this study identify the proposed relationship structure for both low and high contact uses which was duplicated in the two regions irrespective of their water stress indexes in this section we first discuss the results for each of the model s dimensions and conclude by commenting on the overall contributions of the model and some of its limitations 4 1 the diagnosis of the environmental situation the basis for the acceptance of recycled water although it is commonly assumed that public perception of severe water scarcity is associated with greater acceptance of recycled water in reality few studies have attempted to demonstrate the existence of this relationship fielding et al 2018 it is true that water recycling systems are often developed in countries that experience frequent droughts brouwer et al 2015 and that recycled water helps considerably in reducing water scarcity un 2017 however that does not mean that those who are aware of and understand the shortage necessarily accept the use of recycled water this research addresses this question by analysing the role that diagnosis of a situation of water scarcity plays in terms of the public s perception of the threat and how they attribute responsibility for it our findings point to diagnosis playing an indirect effect in other words a perception of the threat of water scarcity as being more severe together with an internal attribution of responsibility for water scarcity tends to produce positive perceptions of recycled water and a sense of moral obligation to use it the effect of the diagnosis of the situation on the perception of recycled water was similar in galicia and murcia suggesting that the relationship between these variables occurs independently of a situation of objective scarcity our results support the thesis that the mere perception of water scarcity is enough to foster favourable dispositions towards recycled water without the need for real water constraints fielding et al 2018 4 2 the axiological influence the transversal axis in the process of public acceptance of recycled water once a problem is identified it is common for possible causative agents to be pointed out that tend to be in opposite positions to those interested in solving the situation klandermans 2002 however with respect to environmental problems and the study of water scarcity the locus of responsibility cannot be attributed solely to external agents the results of this study indicate that those who identified strongly with water also assumed that they themselves and the public in general are part of the problem the assumption of responsibility is established therefore as a fundamental value that defines the group obviously this does not mean that one should not point out those who deny or are unaware that a problem exists indeed pro environmental identity is built in opposition to other identities that do not share the same perspective on the environment our study has shown how pro environmental identity specifically with respect to water influences both how they diagnose the situation of water scarcity and how they perceive recycled water identity has an indirect influence on one s perception of risk which is in line with ross et al 2014 result and a direct effect on the cost benefit analysis nevertheless we must consider that the effect of environmental identity on the use of recycled water may not be as crucial as for other more well known pro environmental behaviours the use of recycled water is a novel concept that is not yet pervasive in the public debate in spain for this reason it is possible that the concept of recycled water has not yet undergone the assimilation and accommodation processes breakwell 2014 necessary to become part of the environmental identity if recycled water becomes linked to environmental identity the activation of both processes would increase the effect identity has on acceptance of recycled water use although this will depend on whether the recycled water is positively or negatively associated with pro environmental identity the only experimental study that has addressed this relationship points in this direction when the transmitter of messages favourable to recycled water shared a superordinate identity with the participants the perceived risks were reduced and acceptance increased schultz and fielding 2014 identity also acts as a direct predictor of moral obligation sabucedo et al 2019 in our study we adopted a context specific approach assessing citizens moral obligation to use recycled water the results indicate that a strong sense of moral obligation is associated with greater acceptance particularly for the high contact use model this phenomenon can be explained with reference to two of the elements associated with the definition of moral obligation a sense of fulfilment of the objective regardless of the consequences and a sense of sacrifice sabucedo et al 2018 these aspects illustrate how moral obligation has a greater effect when the moral act comes at a personal cost in the case of recycled water the participants perceived the high contact uses such as drinking or showering to have the highest associated risk or cost consequently the sense of moral obligation will have a greater influence upon the acceptance of those uses 4 3 the perception of recycled water the proximal dimension of acceptance in this work we have argued that two aspects affect the public perception of recycled water a trust in the agent that proposes the use of recycled water and b analysis of its consequences specifically its risks costs and benefits to date trust has been assessed in relation to the managers of recycled water systems specifically relying on them predicts a lower perception of risk hurlimann et al 2008 nacarrow et al 2008 ross et al 2014 for this reason in our study we have specifically evaluated the implication that trust in science since this source is the one that the public find most credible price et al 2010 the results of the model indicate that those who trust science not only perceive there to be fewer risks associated with the use of recycled water but they also perceive the existence of a greater number of benefits perceptions of risks and benefits also follow the opposite trend when predicting the acceptance of recycled water the pam indicates that where the public perceives more benefits associated with recycled water use these favours increased acceptance in contrast people are less accepting of recycled water when they perceive high its use to have a high level of risks amongst the two factors risk perception stands out as the main predictor of acceptance this result that aligns with the results of previous studies domènech and saurí 2010 hurlimann et al 2008 nancarrow et al 2009 both the anticipation of harmful consequences and the presence of uncertainty underlie the relevance of risk yates and stone 1992 these aspects together with the lack of familiarity that certain social groups have with recycled water can spur prejudice and negative representations like those that other technologies evoke such as nuclear energy finucane et al 2000 precisely the activation of these representations and prejudices would explain why we detect a greater influence of risk in high contact uses the representations associated with recycled water would be more negative when the use involves more direct contact with the human body which could lead to more uncertainty and the anticipation of harmful consequences and therefore to higher rates of rejection in contrast the impact perceived benefits have on acceptance is greater with respect to low contact uses when recycled water uses does not involve physical human contact with the water recycled water use tends to evoke more positive representations as a result people generally feel that low contact use poses fewer health risks and will begin to pay greater attention to the positive effects of using recycled water such as the economic or environmental benefits 4 4 the pam s contributions to previous models of recycled water acceptance and limitations the pam is the first structural model that responds to the need to integrate variables that consider the diagnosis of the environmental situation the axiological influence and public perceptions of recycled water by incorporating these dimensions the pam broadens the contribution of other models that focused on aspects specifically related to perceptions of recycled water hurlimann et al 2008 it also factors in the role of identity in the acceptance process ross et al 2014 considering the importance of environmental identity in an individual s perception of both the problem and recycled water itself moreover the pam is the first model to verify its predictive capacity in both high and low water stress regions in addition it delves into existing evidence on the differences between low and high contact uses of recycled water in previous studies the items related to intention satisfaction and acceptance were mostly general hurlimann et al 2008 furthermore previous studies typically included only one contact category nancarrow et al 2009 or presented an approach that combined high and low contact uses ross et al 2014 we are not aware of any studies in which the authors contemplated different models for each level of use the difference between the acceptance of low and high contact use of recycled water is key in fact the model s predictive ability for low contact use is lower than for high contact use this result is not surprising the more extreme the measured behaviour the more relevant are the variables that explain it two conclusions can be drawn in this respect firstly studies that address the reasons linked to the acceptability of recycled water should at a minimum differentiate between the two main types of use low contact and high contact uses secondly in order to promote the acceptance of high contact uses special attention needs to be paid to reducing perception of health risks and promoting the moral obligation to accept these uses in addition to the above it should also be noted that although practically all the relationships between the variables that this study has identified are statistically significant the correlations and predictors are not in all cases as strong as would be desirable this is especially true for moral obligation and cost benefit predictors one possible explanation is the relevance of health risks to these two variables in this context consequently one limitation of this work is that the pam model highlights predictive relationships for recycled water acceptance but not causal ones future experimental studies could therefore take further steps to build upon the developments presented in this study by for example manipulating the degree of health risk and testing its relationship with the other predictor variables and with acceptance another aspect to consider is that although this model was validated in two regions with different levels of water stress and water restrictions are common in murcia the supply of drinking water and its quality is guaranteed for this reason we encourage other researchers to replicate our results in other countries different cultural traditions pertaining to water and its uses as well as the polarisation that currently exists in some societies regarding climate change and science could also affect the structure of the model or the relationship between its component variables 5 conclusions despite the problem of water scarcity in many regions of the world a segment of the public does not accept certain varieties of recycled water use this paper has presented an integrated model the pam that provides new and relevant information about a what indirect and direct variables influence public acceptance of recycled water b what differential weight those variables have on the acceptance of low and high contact uses of recycled water and c what similarities and differences have those variables in predicting acceptance in regions with high and low levels of water scarcity the diagnosis of the environmental situation is the first step to consider in the process of fostering greater acceptance of recycled water use in other words citizens will consider recycled water as a possible solution to water scarcity if they perceive the problem as serious and immediate and if they maintain a sense of responsibility to confront the problem head on both factors are consistent between regions with opposite extremes of abundance and scarcity indicating that it is the perception of scarcity rather than the actual existence of it that truly affects acceptance the model also incorporates an axiological dimension the issue of water scarcity threatens the identity of the individual which leads him or her to develop a sense of moral obligation to accept recycled water as a solution to the problem this axiological influence may be even greater when recycled water appears in public debate therefore in order to establish the use of recycled water in society it is essential that citizens identity structures incorporate in a positive way the concept of recycled water if they are not the mechanisms of identity and moral obligation will be activated in the opposite direction driving attempts to halt the implementation of recycled water systems the pam proposes a third dimension related to perceptions of recycled water the use of recycled water may not pose any danger however the mere perception of negative health consequences is sufficient to lead to public rejection of the concept trust in the scientific community can counteract these negative perceptions and foster the perception of benefits in this sense and in order to ensure that scientific knowledge assists in the development of environmentally sustainable policies it is necessary that science is not instrumentalised politically as this would affect its credibility the pam is suitable for predicting public acceptance of recycled water for both low and high contact uses although the predictive power is greater for high contact uses similarly the absence of large differences between the galicia and murcia regions indicates that the predictive model can be applied to regions with unequal water resources this knowledge facilitates the design of intervention strategies that favour greater public acceptance of recycled water credit authorship contribution statement sergio vila tojo conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original

16016,water scarcity is a major problem that affects a greater number of countries every year a possible solution is using recycled water systems however to implement the use of recycled water public acceptance is needed in this study we propose a perceptive axiological model pam to understand the reasons for public acceptance or rejection of recycled water this is the first model to jointly consider three conceptual dimensions the diagnosis of the environmental situation the axiological influence and the public perceptions regarding recycled water the sample in this study consisted of 726 randomly selected participants who completed an online questionnaire a key factor considered was the type of water use low or high contact additionally the model s ability to predict acceptance in regions of high and low water stress was tested the model showed good fit and predictive capacity for both low r2 272 and high r2 501 contact uses and partial equivalence between regions threat perception was the most distal variable in the model which together with identity affected the attribution of responsibility these variables along with trust in scientists affected the three direct predictors of acceptance perceived health risks moral obligation and cost benefit analysis perceived health risk was the most important predictor in both types of contact β 642 in high contact β 388 in low contact uses moral obligation had a greater impact in high contact β 170 than in low contact β 099 uses the opposite outcome occurred with respect to costs benefit analysis β 067 in high contact β 219 in low contact uses the pam offers a general framework that identifies the importance of the three dimensions and how they interact with each other which facilitates the development of strategies to increase acceptance on the one hand the pam works as a tool to assess the profile of a specific population and on the other hand it highlights the specific factors which are the best suited for interventions to increase public acceptance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords recycled water public acceptance water scarcity axiological factors risk perception costs benefits perception 1 introduction the global freshwater shortage situation is alarming of the 171 countries for which estimates of the degree of water stress are available 31 show water stress levels between 25 and 70 22 countries have values above 70 and 11 have values of 100 united nations 2018 amongst the different strategies aimed at guaranteeing water supplies the use of recycled water is one of the most promising recycled water is treated wastewater mcomber et al 2021 the un 2017 recognised this strategy for its value both in reducing water consumption and in the recovery of its nutrients despite the success of water recycling efforts in some parts of the world lee and tan 2016 sanchez flores et al 2016 there are sectors of the population that still do not accept the practice in fact public opposition has paralyzed some of water recycling projects brouwer et al 2015 ellis et al 2021 hurlimann and dolnicar 2010 therefore understanding the reasons for the acceptance and rejection of recycled water is a key issue studies in the field have highlighted the importance of several variables ranging from threat perception mankad and tapsuwan 2011 to the perception of risks domènech and saurí 2010 and benefits of recycled water hurlimann et al 2008 as well as public trust in science fielding et al 2015 the information offered by these studies is highly relevant however it should be noted that the variables were analysed individually prior studies have not assessed the interaction between the different variables and the contextual conditions that affect the acceptance of recycled water using an integrated model the objective of this study is to integrate these conditions by verifying a model of acceptance for recycled water that is based on three fundamental premises firstly for the use of recycled water to be considered it is necessary to perceive that a problem of water scarcity exists and that it poses an imminent threat to the planet and to people s wellbeing garcia cuerva et al 2016 gómez román et al 2020 without this understanding there would be no reason to change current water related behaviours secondly if this perception exists it should be translated into the development of pro environmental values and identity these factors would contribute to the acceptance of behaviours linked to environmental commitment de groot and steg 2007 whitmarsh and o neill 2010 thirdly the population may see advantages disadvantages or both relating to the use of recycled water depending on each person s analysis a person s acceptance of recycled water will be greater or lesser baghapour et al 2017 hurlimann 2006 these premises can be grouped into three conceptually distinct dimensions a the diagnosis of the environmental situation b the axiological influence and c the perception of recycled water 1 1 the diagnosis of the environmental situation threat perception and attribution of responsibility people can change their attitudes and behaviours if they feel that there are sufficient reasons to justify a change for example a new water scarcity problem that must be addressed might shift public perceptions about recycled water in this sense cases where the public experience significant water restrictions contribute to a higher degree of acceptance of recycled water dolnicar et al 2011 etale et al 2020 other authors have pointed out that it is the perception of the problem and not necessarily the actual water supply situation that determines levels of public acceptance of recycled water fielding et al 2018 thereby perceiving water scarcity as a real and imminent threat to humanity can serve as a fundamental condition for acceptance gómez román et al 2020 to assess the degree of threat posed by a particular situation at least two aspects must be considered the severity of the event and one s perceived vulnerability to it rogers 1975 1983 when the level of these two variables is high people are more inclined to adopt alternative responses to the situation this insight suggests that one s perception of a threat facilitates acceptance of responses to it we are not aware of any literature that specifically evaluates this phenomenon with respect to the topic of recycled water although the phenomenon has been identified in the adoption of different decentralised systems for wastewater treatment mankad et al 2011 in addition to estimating the threat level that water scarcity poses it is also necessary to consider who people attribute the origin and evolution of this problem to if people perceive and assume that they are responsible to it in some way they may consider the approaches proposed to solve it more favourably nancarrow et al 2008 analyse how personal responsibility affects public perceptions of recycled water concluding that it is not a significant predictor of public intention to use recycled water however in our view this study raises two fundamental problems first the authors evaluate the degree of responsibility to guarantee the water supply that is the authors consider the responsibility for the evolution of the problem but not for its origin second the authors evaluate the responsibility of the individual the community and the authorities jointly not separately we argue that it is more appropriate to evaluate the concept of attribution of responsibility feather 1969 heider 1958 which refers to how each person decides to whom to attribute responsibility for both the creation and maintenance of the problem an individual will express the attribution of responsibility for water shortages in two ways a by indicating that he or she is directly responsible for the water shortage problem as a consequence of his or her action or inaction internal attribution or b by pointing out that the agents causing the problem are others such as companies or governments external attribution 1 2 the axiological influence environmental identity and moral obligation another relevant factor to understand the public s possible responses to recycled water pertains to the values and beliefs that people have towards the environment a person s system of values and beliefs is a fundamental factor to understanding why he or she has certain sustainability preferences and perspectives or behaves in a pro environmental way steg et al 2014 nevertheless its importance as an antecedent of pro environmental behaviour is due to the influence it has on two specific processes firstly values and beliefs make up the central core of one s environmental identity van der werff et al 2013 secondly they facilitate the activation of one s sense of obligation to act according to this set of moral precepts stern 2000 environmental identity has been identified as a consistency predictor for a wide range of pro environmental behaviours such as reducing waste and conserving energy and water in the home whitmarsh and o neill 2010 thereby pro environmental identity should also affect the use of recycled water insofar as it is also a pro environmental behaviour in this study we take a more specific approach to analysing citizens identities in relation to water adapting the notion of environmental identity proposed by clayton 2003 our approach can be defined as the portion of environmental identity that forms our self concept through a sense of connection with water affecting how we perceive and act in the world the belief that water is important to us and that it is part of who we are the effect identity has on people s behaviour is reinforced when their sense of moral obligation is activated in a way that motivates them to act in accordance with their values despite inconveniences and associated costs sabucedo et al 2018 vilas and sabucedo 2012 in this regard moral obligation is a very relevant personal variable when it comes to understanding public social acceptance of recycled water usage to our knowledge this concept has not yet been included in analyses of public rejection or acceptance of recycled water although it has been identified as an important variable in participatory irrigation management yang et al 2021 and environmentally friendly collective actions molder et al 2021 1 3 the perception of recycled water trust in science health risks and costs and benefits many citizens may have developed a pro environmental identity and even a sense of moral obligation to protect the environment however this does not ensure that they will accept any sort of proposed solution to a given environmental problem without question solutions that some people would consider acceptable may be problematic for others a solution s perception and consequent assessment in this case the use of recycled water must be verified in the following two ways a trust in the agent that proposes it and b analysis of its consequences particularly its risks costs and benefits different agents influence citizens perceptions of any aspect of reality and their level of influence essentially depends on the degree to which citizens trust them in the field of recycled water trust is defined as a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behaviour of the authority responsible for the recycled water scheme ross et al 2014 p 62 of course not all agents are equally trusted in the case of the acceptance of recycled water the trust the public place in the scientific community plays a fundamental role fielding et al 2015 leviston et al 2006 price et al 2010 specifically the effect of trust on acceptance seems to be mediated by perception of the risk associated with using recycled water because this water is generated from wastewater it is not surprising that health risk emerges as a major concern of respondents fielding et al 2018 p 14 thereby the greater the trust in those who promote using recycled water the lower the risk perception hurlimann et al 2008 nancarrow et al 2008 ross et al 2014 at the same time a lower risk perception favours both acceptance domènech and saurí 2010 and the intention to use recycled water nancarrow et al 2009 when analysing the consequences of using recycled water risk perception is undoubtedly an essential factor however people will also assess other costs and benefits associated with using recycled water the economic cost of implementing alternative water systems is of great concern mankad et al 2015 although few studies have analysed its specific role in the acceptance process fielding et al 2018 nonetheless a positive relationship has been found between economic benefits and satisfaction hurlimann et al 2008 and the degree of public support friedler et al 2006 matos et al 2014 with respect to environmental benefits they seem to have even greater relevance than economic benefits in influencing public satisfaction with the use of recycled water hurlimann 2008 the variables described in this section have been raised in relation to the general use of recycled water without considering different sorts of use for this type of water however it must be noted that the degree of public acceptance of recycled water differs depending on its end use uses that involve higher degrees of personal contact or ingestion such as drinking fielding et al 2018 or irrigating crops savchenko et al 2019 are less accepted than those uses that involve less contact such as street cleaning fielding et al 2018 1 4 objectives and model proposal previous studies have mainly focused on analysing the influence that certain factors independent of one another have on public acceptance of recycled water usage this study proposes the development of a comprehensive model to assess a the interrelation between the three dimensions of the diagnosis of the environmental situation the axiological influence and public perception of recycled water and b the joint predictive capacity as well as the relative effect of the different psychological variables that make up each of the dimensions of public acceptance of recycled water fig 1 introduces the predictive model that will be analysed the type of recycled water use classified by its degree of personal contact and a region s level of water stress will also be considered to this end the authors sought evidence for the verification of two predictive models one for acceptance of low contact uses lca and the other for acceptance of high contact uses hca the model will also be tested for its predictive adequacy in determining recycled water acceptance both in regions with high and low water stress levels 2 method 2 1 participants and procedure participants were selected by proportional random sampling by sex and age in the two spanish communities with the most extreme values of water stress galicia is the rainiest region in the country and murcia is the driest fig 2 during october 2019 the average rainfall in galicia was 197 l m2 considerably higher than the 29 l m2 of rainfall in murcia citizens who matched the specified profile i e by gender age and place of residence were contacted by email between october 2nd and 23rd 2019 by a company that specialises in market research the company compensated participants financially in exchange for their participation they received a link to an online questionnaire with an estimated duration of 15 min on the first page participants received information about the terms and objectives of the study subsequently they gave their consent for data processing this study was approved by university of santiago de compostela s bioethics committee participants had to be at least 18 years old to complete the survey to guarantee the quality of the responses the following exclusion criteria were established a questionnaires completed in less than 425 s and b inconsistent responses to items formulated in reverse 2 2 measures the design and development of the questionnaire were reviewed by four experts in social psychology and two experts in methodology participants levels of disagreement or agreement with a statement in the questionnaire were measured using two different scale modalities using the likert response format a from 1 to 5 and b from 0 to 10 in addition questions about sociodemographic characteristics were included to guarantee the proportionality of the sample table 1 lists each scale s variables the number of items an item example and internal consistency the items related to the variables of perceived risks and acceptance correspond to different uses of recycled water each of these scales was divided into two categories according to the level of personal contact with recycled water lr and lca for low contact and hr and hca for high contact this division was corroborated by factor analysis of both exploratory and confirmatory types to more accurately observe the participant s degrees of moral obligation this scale was presented to participants twice in succession in the first presentation the participants had to answer a question about what degree of moral obligation they have thinking about recycled water uses that they had previously classified as low risk lmo in the second they answered the same question but were asked to consider the uses that they had previously classified as high risk hmo 2 3 data analysis the analysis of the statistical data began with a description of the sample in addition to balancing the sample by sex and age it was assessed that there were no significant differences between regions with respect to participants education level employment status and monthly income then two analyses were carried out first structural equation models sems to check to what extent pam adequately predicts acceptance for both low contact and high contact uses we adhered to the following reference values as evaluation criteria for model fit hu and bentler 1999 95 for cfi comparative fit index and for tli tucker lewis index 06 for rmsea root mean square error of approximation and 08 for srmr standardized root mean square residual second a multiple group analysis to assess whether the predictive capacity of pam was equivalent between regions with opposite levels of scarcity as evaluation criteria for the unconstrained and constrained analysis of the models we used the chi square difference statistic byrne et al 1989 together with the change in cfi cheung and rensvold 2002 invariance was met when a non significant difference in chi squares and a cfi change of 01 or lower occurred between unconstrained and constrained models these analyses were performed with mplus version 7 4 using the maximum likelihood method as the estimation method 3 results 3 1 socio demographic information the final sample consisted of 726 participants 50 1 males mage 43 90 sd 13 17 range 18 88 of which 359 resided in galicia 48 7 males mage 45 77 sd 13 40 range 18 88 and 367 resided in murcia 51 5 males mage 42 05 sd 12 68 range 18 82 there were no significant differences between locations regarding sex χ² 550 df 1 p 458 educational level χ² 2 584 df 3 p 460 employment statuses χ² 8 883 df 4 p 064 and monthly incomes χ² 9 452 df 9 p 397 significant differences were found with respect to age χ² 11 041 df 2 p 004 although this particularity can be attributed to the use of proportional sampling according to the age distribution in both populations taken together the data indicate that both sub samples show a considerable degree of similarity 3 2 structural models of recycled water acceptance for low and high contact uses the main purpose of this analysis was to check the model s capacity to predict both recycled water acceptance for low contact uses as well as for high contact uses the models for low and high contact showed good fit and predictive capacity the values obtained for the low contact model are as follows χ² 12 n 726 24 776 p 016 cfi 984 tli 965 rmsea 038 90 ci 016 060 srmr 027 r 2 272 p 001 the results relative to the high contact model are the following χ² 12 n 726 20 042 p 066 cfi 991 tli 979 rmsea 030 90 ci 000 053 srmr 024 r 2 501 p 001 although both models showed good fit the predictive ability of the model for low contact uses was lower than the high contact uses model however the data show that the models maintained a similar relationship structure as shown in figs 3 and 4 people who perceived the scarcity situation as being threatening also identified more strongly with aspects related to water in addition the results show that a high score on both variables encouraged people to assume the personal responsibility for the scarcity furthermore the results indicate that people who identified with water and who assumed responsibility for the water scarcity expressed a greater sense of moral obligation to use recycled water and perceived that the benefits of its use outweigh the costs in addition they also show trust in the science which contributes to increasing the benefits of using recycled water and reducing the perception of health risks as hypothesised the results show that moral obligation costs benefits perception and perceived health risk were direct predictors of acceptance of recycled water use although all three contributed significantly to the two models there are important differences between them in the high contact use model the effect of risk perception and moral obligation was greater than in the low contact model in contrast the effect of the cost benefit analysis was more relevant in the low contact use model of the three the variable with the greatest explanatory power on the acceptance of recycled water in both models was health risks perception 3 3 multiple group analysis the pam s equivalence between dry and wet regions the model was tested in galicia and murcia to explore its predictive capacity in regions characterised by extreme water scarcity and abundance table 2 shows that the model adequately predicts acceptance in each of the regions figs 5 and 6 show the estimated relationships between variables once the model was estimated for each region a multiple group analysis was conducted this analysis allowed us to check whether the model is equivalent in both dry and wet regions the multiple group strategy was incremental firstly the unconstrained analysis of the model shows whether the general structure of the model is shared between regions secondly the constrained analysis of the model indicates whether the weight of the relationships is similar between both regions the results for the unconstrained model are satisfactory for low contact uses χ² 24 n 726 38 320 p 032 cfi 983 tli 962 rmsea 041 90 ci 012 064 srmr 033 the values were similar for the high contact model χ² 24 n 726 30 375 p 172 cfi 993 tli 984 rmsea 027 90 ci 000 053 srmr 028 these results indicate that the structure or general form of the model was shared between the two regions this suggests that the proposed model is suitable for predicting acceptance of recycled water in regions with water scarcity and water abundance the analysis of the constrained models indicates that in addition to the structure the weight of the relationships in both regions is partially equivalent both for low contact δχ² 15 n 726 24 233 p 061 cfi diff 01 and high contact uses δχ² 12 n 726 19 571 p 076 cfi diff 009 this means that with few exceptions the weight of established relationships is similar in both regions first in murcia identity had a greater effect on the perception of the cost and benefits of the recycled water use in both the low and high contact models secondly the weight of the trust with respect to the perception of risks and benefits was lower in murcia the region with the greatest water scarcity this difference is especially marked in the low contact model finally with respect to the direct predictors of acceptance the effects of moral obligation and the perception of health risks are greater in the high contact model in both regions in contrast the effect of perceived benefits in the high contact model is lower especially in murcia 4 discussion this study has proposed a perceptive axiological model pam that predicts the level of public acceptance of recycled water is based on three theoretical dimensions the diagnosis of the environmental situation the axiological influence and public perceptions of recycled water the analyses carried out in this study identify the proposed relationship structure for both low and high contact uses which was duplicated in the two regions irrespective of their water stress indexes in this section we first discuss the results for each of the model s dimensions and conclude by commenting on the overall contributions of the model and some of its limitations 4 1 the diagnosis of the environmental situation the basis for the acceptance of recycled water although it is commonly assumed that public perception of severe water scarcity is associated with greater acceptance of recycled water in reality few studies have attempted to demonstrate the existence of this relationship fielding et al 2018 it is true that water recycling systems are often developed in countries that experience frequent droughts brouwer et al 2015 and that recycled water helps considerably in reducing water scarcity un 2017 however that does not mean that those who are aware of and understand the shortage necessarily accept the use of recycled water this research addresses this question by analysing the role that diagnosis of a situation of water scarcity plays in terms of the public s perception of the threat and how they attribute responsibility for it our findings point to diagnosis playing an indirect effect in other words a perception of the threat of water scarcity as being more severe together with an internal attribution of responsibility for water scarcity tends to produce positive perceptions of recycled water and a sense of moral obligation to use it the effect of the diagnosis of the situation on the perception of recycled water was similar in galicia and murcia suggesting that the relationship between these variables occurs independently of a situation of objective scarcity our results support the thesis that the mere perception of water scarcity is enough to foster favourable dispositions towards recycled water without the need for real water constraints fielding et al 2018 4 2 the axiological influence the transversal axis in the process of public acceptance of recycled water once a problem is identified it is common for possible causative agents to be pointed out that tend to be in opposite positions to those interested in solving the situation klandermans 2002 however with respect to environmental problems and the study of water scarcity the locus of responsibility cannot be attributed solely to external agents the results of this study indicate that those who identified strongly with water also assumed that they themselves and the public in general are part of the problem the assumption of responsibility is established therefore as a fundamental value that defines the group obviously this does not mean that one should not point out those who deny or are unaware that a problem exists indeed pro environmental identity is built in opposition to other identities that do not share the same perspective on the environment our study has shown how pro environmental identity specifically with respect to water influences both how they diagnose the situation of water scarcity and how they perceive recycled water identity has an indirect influence on one s perception of risk which is in line with ross et al 2014 result and a direct effect on the cost benefit analysis nevertheless we must consider that the effect of environmental identity on the use of recycled water may not be as crucial as for other more well known pro environmental behaviours the use of recycled water is a novel concept that is not yet pervasive in the public debate in spain for this reason it is possible that the concept of recycled water has not yet undergone the assimilation and accommodation processes breakwell 2014 necessary to become part of the environmental identity if recycled water becomes linked to environmental identity the activation of both processes would increase the effect identity has on acceptance of recycled water use although this will depend on whether the recycled water is positively or negatively associated with pro environmental identity the only experimental study that has addressed this relationship points in this direction when the transmitter of messages favourable to recycled water shared a superordinate identity with the participants the perceived risks were reduced and acceptance increased schultz and fielding 2014 identity also acts as a direct predictor of moral obligation sabucedo et al 2019 in our study we adopted a context specific approach assessing citizens moral obligation to use recycled water the results indicate that a strong sense of moral obligation is associated with greater acceptance particularly for the high contact use model this phenomenon can be explained with reference to two of the elements associated with the definition of moral obligation a sense of fulfilment of the objective regardless of the consequences and a sense of sacrifice sabucedo et al 2018 these aspects illustrate how moral obligation has a greater effect when the moral act comes at a personal cost in the case of recycled water the participants perceived the high contact uses such as drinking or showering to have the highest associated risk or cost consequently the sense of moral obligation will have a greater influence upon the acceptance of those uses 4 3 the perception of recycled water the proximal dimension of acceptance in this work we have argued that two aspects affect the public perception of recycled water a trust in the agent that proposes the use of recycled water and b analysis of its consequences specifically its risks costs and benefits to date trust has been assessed in relation to the managers of recycled water systems specifically relying on them predicts a lower perception of risk hurlimann et al 2008 nacarrow et al 2008 ross et al 2014 for this reason in our study we have specifically evaluated the implication that trust in science since this source is the one that the public find most credible price et al 2010 the results of the model indicate that those who trust science not only perceive there to be fewer risks associated with the use of recycled water but they also perceive the existence of a greater number of benefits perceptions of risks and benefits also follow the opposite trend when predicting the acceptance of recycled water the pam indicates that where the public perceives more benefits associated with recycled water use these favours increased acceptance in contrast people are less accepting of recycled water when they perceive high its use to have a high level of risks amongst the two factors risk perception stands out as the main predictor of acceptance this result that aligns with the results of previous studies domènech and saurí 2010 hurlimann et al 2008 nancarrow et al 2009 both the anticipation of harmful consequences and the presence of uncertainty underlie the relevance of risk yates and stone 1992 these aspects together with the lack of familiarity that certain social groups have with recycled water can spur prejudice and negative representations like those that other technologies evoke such as nuclear energy finucane et al 2000 precisely the activation of these representations and prejudices would explain why we detect a greater influence of risk in high contact uses the representations associated with recycled water would be more negative when the use involves more direct contact with the human body which could lead to more uncertainty and the anticipation of harmful consequences and therefore to higher rates of rejection in contrast the impact perceived benefits have on acceptance is greater with respect to low contact uses when recycled water uses does not involve physical human contact with the water recycled water use tends to evoke more positive representations as a result people generally feel that low contact use poses fewer health risks and will begin to pay greater attention to the positive effects of using recycled water such as the economic or environmental benefits 4 4 the pam s contributions to previous models of recycled water acceptance and limitations the pam is the first structural model that responds to the need to integrate variables that consider the diagnosis of the environmental situation the axiological influence and public perceptions of recycled water by incorporating these dimensions the pam broadens the contribution of other models that focused on aspects specifically related to perceptions of recycled water hurlimann et al 2008 it also factors in the role of identity in the acceptance process ross et al 2014 considering the importance of environmental identity in an individual s perception of both the problem and recycled water itself moreover the pam is the first model to verify its predictive capacity in both high and low water stress regions in addition it delves into existing evidence on the differences between low and high contact uses of recycled water in previous studies the items related to intention satisfaction and acceptance were mostly general hurlimann et al 2008 furthermore previous studies typically included only one contact category nancarrow et al 2009 or presented an approach that combined high and low contact uses ross et al 2014 we are not aware of any studies in which the authors contemplated different models for each level of use the difference between the acceptance of low and high contact use of recycled water is key in fact the model s predictive ability for low contact use is lower than for high contact use this result is not surprising the more extreme the measured behaviour the more relevant are the variables that explain it two conclusions can be drawn in this respect firstly studies that address the reasons linked to the acceptability of recycled water should at a minimum differentiate between the two main types of use low contact and high contact uses secondly in order to promote the acceptance of high contact uses special attention needs to be paid to reducing perception of health risks and promoting the moral obligation to accept these uses in addition to the above it should also be noted that although practically all the relationships between the variables that this study has identified are statistically significant the correlations and predictors are not in all cases as strong as would be desirable this is especially true for moral obligation and cost benefit predictors one possible explanation is the relevance of health risks to these two variables in this context consequently one limitation of this work is that the pam model highlights predictive relationships for recycled water acceptance but not causal ones future experimental studies could therefore take further steps to build upon the developments presented in this study by for example manipulating the degree of health risk and testing its relationship with the other predictor variables and with acceptance another aspect to consider is that although this model was validated in two regions with different levels of water stress and water restrictions are common in murcia the supply of drinking water and its quality is guaranteed for this reason we encourage other researchers to replicate our results in other countries different cultural traditions pertaining to water and its uses as well as the polarisation that currently exists in some societies regarding climate change and science could also affect the structure of the model or the relationship between its component variables 5 conclusions despite the problem of water scarcity in many regions of the world a segment of the public does not accept certain varieties of recycled water use this paper has presented an integrated model the pam that provides new and relevant information about a what indirect and direct variables influence public acceptance of recycled water b what differential weight those variables have on the acceptance of low and high contact uses of recycled water and c what similarities and differences have those variables in predicting acceptance in regions with high and low levels of water scarcity the diagnosis of the environmental situation is the first step to consider in the process of fostering greater acceptance of recycled water use in other words citizens will consider recycled water as a possible solution to water scarcity if they perceive the problem as serious and immediate and if they maintain a sense of responsibility to confront the problem head on both factors are consistent between regions with opposite extremes of abundance and scarcity indicating that it is the perception of scarcity rather than the actual existence of it that truly affects acceptance the model also incorporates an axiological dimension the issue of water scarcity threatens the identity of the individual which leads him or her to develop a sense of moral obligation to accept recycled water as a solution to the problem this axiological influence may be even greater when recycled water appears in public debate therefore in order to establish the use of recycled water in society it is essential that citizens identity structures incorporate in a positive way the concept of recycled water if they are not the mechanisms of identity and moral obligation will be activated in the opposite direction driving attempts to halt the implementation of recycled water systems the pam proposes a third dimension related to perceptions of recycled water the use of recycled water may not pose any danger however the mere perception of negative health consequences is sufficient to lead to public rejection of the concept trust in the scientific community can counteract these negative perceptions and foster the perception of benefits in this sense and in order to ensure that scientific knowledge assists in the development of environmentally sustainable policies it is necessary that science is not instrumentalised politically as this would affect its credibility the pam is suitable for predicting public acceptance of recycled water for both low and high contact uses although the predictive power is greater for high contact uses similarly the absence of large differences between the galicia and murcia regions indicates that the predictive model can be applied to regions with unequal water resources this knowledge facilitates the design of intervention strategies that favour greater public acceptance of recycled water credit authorship contribution statement sergio vila tojo conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original

16017,enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr performance and microbial community dynamics during dry and wet weather conditions of a full scale treatment plant was evaluated by converting a section of activated sludge basins using low cost operational modifications into an anoxic anaerobic zone to promote ebpr two trains of the activated sludge system at the des moines iowa metropolitan wastewater reclamation facility were used for the study with one train modified for ebpr and the other remained as nitrification only for comparison in addition to measuring the modification effectiveness for phosphorus removal performance was compared during dry and wet weather conditions over the course of two summer seasons to improve understanding of wet and dry weather dynamics for ebpr dna sequencing and qpcr tests were conducted to develop an understanding of microbial population changes between control and modified basins and wet and dry weather conditions basin hydraulic

sequencing showed a significant increase in relative abundance of phyla chloroflexi nitrospirae and verrucomicrobia in the modified basins but no correlation to ebpr performance qpcr indicated significant increase in relative quantity of accumulibacter but not for actinetobacter like phosphorus accumulating organisms paos which includes the pao tetrasphaera significant abundance of some accumulibacter clades found within the modified basins was contrary to previous literature which focused on small scale and batch studies a higher than expected dominance of clade i and increased relative quantities of clades iib and iic during extended wet weather was observed which may have contributed to rapid recovery of phosphorus removal when dry weather resumed the abundance of paos did not significantly correlate with changes in phosphorous removal performance contrary to reports from previous small scale and batch studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr phosphorus accumulating organism pao microbial community wet weather activated sludge full scale 1 introduction increasingly stringent wastewater treatment plant effluent phosphorus limits have led many utilities to consider a variety of phosphorus removal processes enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr has become a common treatment process in recent years due to relatively low operating costs and improved environmental sustainability compared to chemical phosphorus removal alternatives coats et al 2011 ersu et al 2008 ebpr utilizes cyclic aerobic and anaerobic conditions that encourage growth of bacteria called phosphorus accumulating organisms paos that assimilate excess phosphorus to create polyphosphate energy reserves resulting in a decrease in the phosphorus content of the final effluent discharged to receiving waters many past studies related to ebpr have been based on lab scale and or synthetic wastewater which may not cultivate the appropriate microbial populations including phosphorous accumulating organisms paos responsible for ebpr compared to full scale systems zeng et al 2018 in addition laboratory scale studies cannot replicate the extreme conditions experienced by full scale treatment systems such as high flows under wet weather conditions which have an impact on phosphorus removal and the microbial community the role of the microbial community in ebpr is an area of ongoing research to improve treatment performance there remain questions of full scale ebpr performance compared to small scale or synthetic wastewater and the importance and activity of known paos potential for unknown paos and the activity of the diverse population of microbes present in a full scale system coats et al 2017 much of the current understanding of paos is based on bench scale study of candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis and therefore limited in scope recent studies have begun investigating questions related to ebpr microbial communities and paos in full scale systems varied process configurations and operating factors such as solids retention time have been shown to influence ebpr performance microbial community and kinetics however the sensitivity to the numerous variables present in full scale systems are not well understood onnis hayden et al 2019a and 2019b though the presence and abundance of various pao clades has been reported in recent studies the factors that influence clade dominance and activity is not well characterized particularly at full scale the relationship between pao clades and phosphorus removal mechanisms and performance remains largely unknown and not incorporated into predictive phosphorus removal models akbari et al 2021 several studies have identified a link between wet weather events and decreased activated sludge performance ebpr is particularly sensitive to changes in operating parameters and or wastewater characteristics mcmahan 2006 many treatment facilities experience wet weather peak flow related issues which can upset ebpr by changing wastewater characteristics and or reducing basin retention times wilen et al 2006 poor solids settling or washout in clarifiers during wet weather is often a problem for activated sludge treatment daigger et al 2017 for treatment plants relying on ebpr to meet a stringent effluent phosphorus permit limit wet weather conditions may significantly affect operations regulatory compliance and treatment costs however review of the literature found no studies on changes in ebpr microbial community dynamics during wet weather conditions understanding the changes that occur during wet weather would improve design and operation of ebpr systems the objective of this study was to evaluate ebpr performance and the microbial community dynamics of a full scale treatment plant by converting a section of one of the activated sludge trains using low cost operational modifications into an anoxic anaerobic zone to promote ebpr 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative polymerase change reaction qpcr were used to characterize the microbial community including known paos of the modified ebpr and control nitrification only basins the results from the modified basins were compared to results of the existing basins which served as a control to observe differences the influence of dry and wet weather conditions on ebpr performance and the microbial community were evaluated over two wet weather periods over two years 2 material and methods 2 1 full scale facility and basin modifications for ebpr the des moines metropolitan wastewater reclamation authority wra owns and operates the des moines wastewater reclamation facility wrf with average annual flow rate of about 2 94 m3 s 67 million us gallons per day mgd and peak flows over 8 76 m3 s 200 mgd the des moines wrf has six 24 226 m3 6 4 million us gallons plug flow activated sludge basins each basin has four passes as shown in figure 1 the existing system is operated for complete nitrification with all passes aerated and return activated sludge is returned to pass one diffused air is used for mixing and aeration controlled to each pass by a dissolved oxygen do sensor air flow meter and air control valve the air control valve is modulated to maintain a do set point for each pass the wrf was originally designed as a step feed activated sludge plant due to complications with plant hydraulics the plant has been operating as a plug flow activated sludge plant as indicated above however the aeration system was not upgraded to handle the extra bod load in pass one of the basins under plug flow mode and the air in pass one was undersupplied resulting in low dissolved oxygen and anoxic conditions treatment plant staff have reported that pass one of the aeration basins has insufficient aeration capacity to maintain aerobic conditions as such denitrification was happening under normal operational conditions in pass one of the aeration basins instead of constructing new anaerobic and anoxic zones and associated facilities to implement ebpr low cost operational modifications were developed to support ebpr within the existing basins two basins were completely isolated from the other four basins and modified to establish an ebpr process while the remaining four basins continued to operate with no change in complete nitrification mode for comparison purposes pass one of the modified basins was altered by decreasing and cycling air flow to create an anoxic anaerobic zone to promote selection of paos figure 1 the air to pass one was never completely turned off but kept at a low flow due to concerns about potential water and solids intrusion into the air diffusers and piping which was near the end of its service life and may have small cracks this is one of the challenges to be considered in modifying an existing plant to an ebpr with minimal hardware changes the air flow rate was periodically increased to balance the need for mixing to maintain solids in suspension while minimizing oxygen transfer to promote anaerobic anoxic conditions several combinations of low air flow rates with intermittent cycles of higher air flows were tested to optimize anoxic and anaerobic conditions while providing sufficient mixing and to prevent scum or foam formation on the water surface the target do for passes 1 4 of the control basins was 0 5 0 6 1 0 and 2 0 mg l and 0 0 0 6 1 0 and 2 0 mg l for the modified basins respectively after a period of adjustment air flow to pass one of the modified basins was cycled at approximately 1 9 m3 1 000 m3 min for 55 minutes and 5 minutes at 20 1 m3 1 000 m3 min anoxic anaerobic conditions were monitored using an oxidation reduction potential orp probe the modifications were tested over two wet weather seasons within a two year period for year 1 the treatment plant was monitored over 127 days from march to july and for year 2 over 89 days from may to august 2 2 sample collection laboratory analysis and measurements water quality and operating parameters were monitored to evaluate the performance of the activated sludge system throughout the treatment process the water quality and operating parameters dataset are located in brown et al 2021 water grab and composite samples from the basin influent and effluent locations throughout the basin passes and return waste activated sludge as shown in figure 1 chemical analytical tests of the samples were conducted onsite at the des moines treatment plant laboratory or sent to a third party

and wet weather performance ebpr was successfully established using low cost operational methods while no significant ebpr activity was observed in the control basins secondary influent characteristics bod5 nh3 n no3 n tp op and tss for dry and wet weather conditions were similar to typical literature values metcalf and eddy 2013 data provided in table s1 table 2 summarizes the various operational averages and 95 confidence intervals of activated sludge performance in the control and modified basins for wet and dry weather conditions wet weather conditions for the des moines wrf were defined by the plant as daily influent flow rates above 80 mgd or a total basin and anaerobic anoxic zone hrt of less than approximately 8 4 and 2 1 hours respectively nitrate concentrations in the control basins were found to be similar to that of the modified basins table 2 indicating that denitrification was occurring in pass one of the control basins this was supported by the orp measurements in pass one of the control basins which was close to orp values for anoxic conditions the occurrence of denitrification was due to the under capacity of the aeration system in pass one of the basins which was original designed for a step feed system wet weather activity varied significantly during the two test periods with daily average influent flow rates ranging from 2 02 m3 s 46 mgd to 11 57 m3 s 264 mgd and average of 3 46 m3 s 79 mgd the resulting hrts ranged from 2 6 to 12 7 hours with average of 8 9 hours including return sludge flow in the aeration basins wet weather events during the first year of testing were typical as reflected by plant influent flow rates conditions during the second year of testing were significantly wetter than typical with an extended period of wet weather including one of the highest influent flow rates of record figure 2 shows the daily average activated sludge basin hydraulic retention time hrt and phosphorus removal in the control and modified basins for different days over the study period phosphorus removal was significantly higher in the modified basins with total dry and wet weather combined average of 43 7 5 3 95 confidence and a maximum of 96 compared to 12 6 2 4 and a maximum of 46 in the control basins the wet weather conditions appeared to significantly reduce ebpr activity the total wet and dry weather average hrt of 8 9 hours for the control basins figure 2 was slightly longer than typical design values of 4 to 8 hours for nitrifying activated sludge systems the daily average hrt of the anaerobic anoxic zone portion of the modified basins ranged from 0 6 hours to 3 2 hours with average of 2 2 hours and the aerobic portion of the modified basins ranged from 1 9 to 9 5 hours with average of 6 7 hours these values were similar to or longer than the typical and recommended design values for an anaerobic oxic a o ebpr system of 0 5 1 5 hours for the anaerobic anoxic zone and 1 3 hours for the aerobic zone metcalf and eddy 2013 brown et al 2011 another factor which likely contributed in part to poor phosphorus removal performance during wet weather was the dilution of vfa produced rabinowitz and oldham 1986 vfa concentration in pass one of the modified basins averaged 30 7 2 6 mg l during dry weather but decreased to 11 4 7 3 mg l during wet weather conditions vfa p ratios averaged 9 0 1 9 and 6 1 4 0 mg vfa mg p l during dry and wet conditions within the range of 4 16 mg vfa mg p l reported by curto 2001 to support ebpr waste activated sludge phosphorus content in the modified basins ranged from approximately 0 025 to 0 045 mg tp mg tss with an average of 0 033 mg tp mg tss during typical dry conditions table 2 the phosphorus content was significantly lower in the control basins ranging from about 0 01 to 0 02 mg tp mg tss with an average 0 016 tp mg tss two other studies investigating conversion of aeration systems for existing activated sludge systems to ebpr processes reported similar sludge phosphorus content ranging from 0 028 to 0 036 and 0 020 to 0 043 mg tp mg tss cao et al 2009 qin et al 2014 values above approximately 0 030 mg tp mg tss up to a practical maximum of about 0 070 mg tp mg tss indicate presence of ebpr activity droste 1997 the previously referenced sludge phosphorous content values and measurements from the current work are all in the low to moderate range for ebpr suggesting the modification of conventional activated sludge to ebpr is not as efficient as purpose built ebpr systems the influence of wet weather events appears to have also reduced ebpr performance as indicated by the sludge phosphorus content dropping to about 0 015 mg tp mg tss during prolonged wet weather conditions in year 2 however the operational modifications for this study were not optimized and may still have room for improvement in phosphorus removal when the high cost of a new ebpr facility is considered conversion of existing activated sludge systems may still be desirable when moderate ebpr performance is sufficient orp in pass one of the modified basins generally decreased as the hrt in the anaerobic zone increased and ranged from about 0 to 200 mv and below 100 mv during dry weather conditions table 2 orp between approximately 100 and 225 mv is desirable for ebpr to support fermentation volatile fatty acid production and phosphorus release gerardi 2007 the orp in pass one of the control basins did not significantly change as hrt increased because the air control system automatically added more air to maintain the do set point for an aerobic condition figure 3 shows phosphorus release in pass one of the modified basins was similar to the control basins during wet weather conditions when the pass one hrt was below about 1 5 hours p 0 05 when pass one hrt in the modified basins increased above 1 5 hours phosphorus release was variable but steadily increased with increased hrt the longer hrt provided more time for anaerobic conditions to be established to support phosphorus release from paos previous lab scale work demonstrated optimal anaerobic hrt for ebpr of 2 3 hours brown et al 2011 as expected no significant change in phosphorus release was observed in the control basins 3 2 microbial observations the relative abundance of phyla represented by 16s rrna gene sequences was measured in the waste activated sludge of the control and modified basins figure 4 shows phyla with relative abundance greater than 1 for the control and modified aeration basins the dominant phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were consistent with other activated sludge studies ferrera and sanchez 2016 there was a significant difference in the relative abundance of three of the measured phyla chloroflexi nitrospirae and verrucomicrobia between the control and modified aeration basins chloroflexi are filamentous bacteria typically abundant in wastewater treatment plants there does not appear to be significant difference in their physiology although some data indicates they are involved with polysaccharide and protein degradation nielsen et al 2010 nitrospirae includes microbes important to wastewater treatment such as the genus nitrospira which are the majority of nitrite oxidizing bacteria in many treatment plants nowka et al 2015 cydzik kwiatkowska and zielinska 2016 noted that low do and short solids retention time srt favors growth of nitrospira verrucomicrobia is frequently detected though their function in activated sludge is not well known seviour and nielsen 2010 however these three phyla represented a small fraction of the microbial community up to 10 suggesting that the basin modifications had limited impact on the activated sludge microbial community principal component analysis pca of control vs modified basin samples showed some but not complete differentiation of microbial communities figure s1 similarly the alpha diversity or the richness of the microbial communities showed no change between the modified and control basins regardless of orp levels or phosphorus removal data not shown it should be noted that the use of the greengenes database for alignment resulted in a large number of otus that were unassigned at the genus level though the mapping of species by greengenes reported here is likely to not be affected balvocite and huson 2017 using other databases such as silva or ncbi may have resulted in slightly different comparisons between microbial communities miseq 16s rrna gene sequence data showed relative abundance of pao genera accumulibacter was very low in the control basins 0 0 22 and while the increase in the modified basins 0 0 37 remained lower than most reported values for ebpr 0 8 7 4 average 3 5 zeng et al 2018 contrary to reports from many lab scale studies the present work and the relatively small number of other reported studies of full scale systems reported no significant correlation between abundance of paos and ebpr performance coats et al 2017 figure 5 shows the relative quantity of the two currently known predominant paos found in wastewater treatment facilities accumulibacter and tetrasphaera which is a significant part of the actinobacter like paos apaos category nielsen et al 2019 the relative quantity of accumulibacter significantly increased in the modified basins in year 1 and year 2 compared to the control basins up to 1 of the total bacterial population this relative abundance was comparable to accumulibacter abundances reported from full scale ebpr plants ranging between 1 1 7 9 mao et al 2015 the relative quantity of apaos did not significantly vary in either control or modified basins in year 1 or year 2 and showed no significant correlation with phosphorus removal for either year r2 0 0054 and 0 091 similarly spearman rank correlation analysis between p uptake or release rates and specific bacteria figure s2 showed no known paos among those that correlated strongly with p removal processes p 0 01 extended analysis showed that accumulibacter abundance did indeed positively correlate with both p release and uptake with correlation coefficients of 0 43 and 0 46 respectively p 0 035 and 0 025 respectively the trends in phosphorus removal and paos observed during extended wet weather in year 2 may have been caused by variations in influent wastewater characteristics as material is flushed from the sewers to the treatment plant followed by dilution indeed the overall microbial communities during wet and dry weather were not completely different figure s3 relative abundances of specific bacterial species that were significantly correlated to wet weather figure s4a did not include any known paos the observed decreased influent organics may have decreased microbial and phosphorus removal activity the diluted influent phosphorus may have encouraged paos to adopt a glycogen accumulating metabolism as proposed by muszynski and milobedzka 2015 and acevedo et al 2017 that sustained the bacteria during stressed conditions and may explain the fast recovery in phosphorus removal when dry weather conditions resumed decreased hrt during wet weather also likely played a role in decreased phosphorus release as previously noted figure 6 shows accumulibacter clades in the control and modified basins measured by qpcr the six targeted clades were present in all samples and the ranking of each clade was generally consistent over each year however there were differences in the rankings between control and modified basins and between year 1 and year 2 relative quantity of accumulibacter clades iia and iid increased in the modified basins in year 1 an extended period of wet weather in year 2 coincided with significant increase in clades iib and iic in the modified basins that was not observed in the control basins despite many studies of ebpr processes correlation of accumulibacter clades to nutrient removal performance at full scale facilities is not clear nielsen et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 most research regarding accumulibacter clades have used lab scale reactors synthetic wastewater and pao enriched cultures which have promoted selection of clades ia ic iia and iid flowers et al 2013 he et al 2007 wexler et al 2009 study of full scale treatment systems has shown significant differences in accumulibacter clades compared to lab scale work several studies have shown type ii clades predominate in full scale systems with reduced abundance of type i opposite of many lab scale studies zeng et al 2018 mao et al 2015 in the present work clade i was second from lowest in order of abundance in year 1 but significantly higher in year 2 for both control and modified basins differing from reported literature in fact full scale ebpr plants vary widely in their ppk1 makeup mao et al 2015 zeng et al 2018 pointing to yet unclear relationships between process parameters and clades our relative abundances indeed fall within the reported ranges for all clades several studies have reported clade type i are denitrifying paos capable of nitrate reduction while clade type ii are not able to reduce nitrate acevedo et al 2012 flowers et al 2009 kim et al 2013 however much of the work on denitrifying paos is based on lab scale testing synthetic or partially synthetic wastewater and should be verified with pilot or full scale testing with real wastewater zeng et al 2018 noted studies reporting increased diversity of accumulibacter clades may improve the stability of the treatment process for the present work perhaps the diverse population of accumulibacter clades particularly increased relative quantity of clades iic and iid during extended wet weather conditions in year 2 contributed to the rapid recovery of phosphorus removal when drier conditions resumed the increased relative quantity during wet weather was unexpected as wet weather has typically been associated decreased microbial diversity sato et al 2016 as discussed below 3 3 wet weather influence on microbial community previous studies of wet weather influence on activated sludge reported significant changes in the microbial community typically decreased diversity sato et al 2016 noted two wet weather factors that contribute to changes in microbial communities 1 physical washout of microbes from the system and 2 dilution which decreased substrate concentration influent concentrations during wet weather are often highly variable strickler et al 2003 in the present study during an extended period of wet weather there was no significant change in phyla relative abundance or microbial community structures assessed through pca figure s3 however there were changes in relative quantity of accumulibacter and several accumulibacter clades clades as discussed above furthermore based on partial correlation analysis the relative abundances of non pao bacterial species that significantly correlated with p uptake rates when controlled for wet dry weather also correlated strongly with p release rates figure s4b the relative abundances of these key non pao species were strongly affected p 0 01 by the basin operational conditions figure s5 there may have been community level interactions between these key species and accumulibacter that led to changes in their relative quantities which co occurred with wet weather as understanding of microbial communities present in wastewater treatment systems improves engineers and plant operators would benefit from development of methods to promote particular microbes to benefit treatment performance the conditions within a wastewater treatment process can change quickly due to varied influent wastewater characteristics and flow rate although there is usually little that can be done to change influent characteristics providing supplemental carbon sources can address deficiencies in the influent nielsen et al 2010 developed a conceptual microbial ecosystem model with substrate specificity such as proteins lipids or carbohydrates for different microbes however promoting certain groups of bacteria via carbon addition or other means can cause problems for example methanol is a common supplemental carbon source to promote denitrifiers however these bacteria require acclimation to methanol and abruptly stopping methanol feed such as during an equipment failure can result in treatment upset hallin et al 1996 wef 2005 maintaining a diverse microbial community that can quickly adapt to varied conditions is key to a reliable and resilient treatment process curtis et al 2003 bixio et al 2001 noted that wet weather related dilution of influent wastewater can decrease fermentation activity by up to 50 to counter the decreased fermentation performance configuring the process to have a sidestream fermenter or step feed influent may be beneficial modifying a plug flow basin to utilize step feed where influent is introduced at one or more locations downstream of the initial portion of the basin was originally envisioned as a method to balance aeration demand but has also been shown capable of significantly increasing wet weather treatment capacity up to approximately 60 percent metcalf and eddy 2013 daigger et al 2017 in an ebpr system step feed could be used during wet weather to introduce secondary influent downstream of the anaerobic zone so that only return activated sludge is introduced to the anaerobic zone the retention time in the anaerobic zone would be increased compared to normal operation and wet weather washout of microbes decreased the solids concentration of return activated sludge typically about 10 000 mg l would be approximately 2 4 times higher than mixed liquor and would likely increase anaerobic zone performance decreased orp increased fermentation activity and may select for beneficial microbes preliminary step feed testing at the des moines wrf during dry weather showed improved phosphorus removal due to improved anaerobic zone performance data not shown table 3 shows measured phosphorus uptake and release rates compared with reported values including systems modified for ebpr and systems originally built for ebpr the phosphorus uptake and release rates for existing activated sludge systems modified to ebpr processes were on the low end of the range of reported values particularly for release rates the reduced performance of modified anaerobic zones is likely caused by several factors 1 insufficient volume retention time 2 un optimized configuration and 3 dissolved oxygen introduced by aeration mixing these release rates and other ebpr criteria from full scale and batch tests can be used to determine significant parameters for ebpr prediction model for dry and wet weather conditions when converting an existing system to ebpr the volume of existing basins available to be converted to anaerobic zones may be less than ideal when the volume is too small there is not enough retention time to establish adequate anaerobic conditions for volatile fatty acids vfa production and phosphorus release unfortunately there are few options to mitigate decreased performance from a small anaerobic zone the return activated sludge flow rate could be reduced to decrease nitrate load to the anaerobic zone mixing systems designed to reduce air entrainment and promote anaerobic conditions could also be considered conversion of existing facilities may not permit use of optimized basin configurations for example in the present study the modification of existing pass one created a large combined anoxic and anaerobic zone no walls or baffling were installed to separate the zones and it is likely that the boundary of the anoxic anaerobic zones was variable based on flow rate nitrate load from return activated sludge and other conditions all of which decreased performance of the anaerobic zone and phosphorus release to overcome decreased performance of a single anoxic anaerobic zone increasing the size of the zone or installation of some type of wall to separate each zone could be considered based on budget and performance goals use of existing aeration systems to provide mixing for a modified anaerobic zone such as the present study or as reported by qin et al 2014 introduces dissolved oxygen resulting in decreased anaerobic conditions the air flow rates used for pass one mixing 1 9 continuous and periodic brief cycle of up to 20 1 m3 min 1 000 m3 were considerably lower than recommended values minimum 10 to 15 m3 min 1 000 m3 continuous us epa 1998 however were demonstrated adequate to maintain solids mixing the low mixing energy in pass one raised concerns of solids deposition by treatment plant staff and at the end of the study the basins were drained for inspection solids deposition was observed in pass one however the amount was determined to not be a problem the deposited solids were removed by slowly cycling progressively larger air flow rates through the diffuser system over the course of a day the solids deposited in pass one during the study by cyclic aeration likely improved treatment performance by partially fermenting and releasing volatile fatty acids consumed by paos as part of the phosphorus release process installation of mechanical mixing systems in place of air mixing could be considered however the cost of new equipment may not be justified if the performance of using an existing aeration system for mixing is adequate and the added dissolved oxygen is acceptable for a given application 4 conclusion this study demonstrated successful conversion of a full scale nitrifying activated sludge system to biologically remove phosphorus using low cost operational methods phosphorus removal performance and changes in the microbial community were characterized and compared with a control nitrification only activated sludge basins the following is a summary of results and implications full scale ebpr was established using low cost operational methods in an existing nitrifying activated sludge system ebpr performance and changes in the microbial community in the modified ebpr basins were found to be impacted by wet weather conditions dna sequencing showed significant changes in some microbial community phyla during ebpr but no significant correlation to phosphorus removal abundance of known phosphorus accumulating organisms paos did not significantly correlate with changes in phosphorous removal performance contrary to reports from previous small scale and batch studies abundance of some accumulibacter clades were found contrary some past small scale studies and studies utilizing synthetic wastewater significant change in abundance of some clades was observed during wet weather

16017,enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr performance and microbial community dynamics during dry and wet weather conditions of a full scale treatment plant was evaluated by converting a

retention times varied from 2 6 to 12 7 hours with an average of 8 9 hours ebpr activity was successfully established in the modified basins with average phosphorus content of the return activated sludge 0 032 0 002 compared to 0 016 0 001 mg tp mg tss 95 confidence in the control basins phosphorus removal was significantly decreased by prolonged wet weather conditions particularly in year two of the study however the modified basin maximum removal of 96 and average of 43 7 5 3 remained significantly higher than the maximum of 46 and average 12 6 2 4 removal in the control basins dna sequencing showed a significant increase in relative abundance of phyla chloroflexi nitrospirae and verrucomicrobia in the modified basins but no correlation to ebpr performance qpcr indicated significant increase in relative quantity of accumulibacter but not for actinetobacter like phosphorus accumulating organisms paos which includes the pao tetrasphaera significant abundance of some accumulibacter clades found within the modified basins was contrary to previous literature which focused on small scale and batch studies a higher than expected dominance of clade i and increased relative quantities of clades iib and iic during extended wet weather was observed which may have contributed to rapid recovery of phosphorus removal when dry weather resumed the abundance of paos did not significantly correlate with changes in phosphorous removal performance contrary to reports from previous small scale and batch studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr phosphorus accumulating organism pao microbial community wet weather activated sludge full scale 1 introduction increasingly stringent wastewater treatment plant effluent phosphorus limits have led many utilities to consider a variety of phosphorus removal processes enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr has become a common treatment process in recent years due to relatively low operating costs and improved environmental sustainability compared to chemical phosphorus removal alternatives coats et al 2011 ersu et al 2008 ebpr utilizes cyclic aerobic and anaerobic conditions that encourage growth of bacteria called phosphorus accumulating organisms paos that assimilate excess phosphorus to create polyphosphate energy reserves resulting in a decrease in the phosphorus content of the final effluent discharged to receiving waters many past studies related to ebpr have been based on lab scale and or synthetic wastewater which may not cultivate the appropriate microbial populations including phosphorous accumulating organisms paos responsible for ebpr compared to full scale systems zeng et al 2018 in addition laboratory scale studies cannot replicate the extreme conditions experienced by full scale treatment systems such as high flows under wet weather conditions which have an impact on phosphorus removal and the microbial community the role of the microbial community in ebpr is an area of ongoing research to improve treatment performance there remain questions of full scale ebpr performance compared to small scale or synthetic wastewater and the importance and activity of known paos potential for unknown paos and the activity of the diverse population of microbes present in a full scale system coats et al 2017 much of the current understanding of paos is based on bench scale study of candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis and therefore limited in scope recent studies have begun investigating questions related to ebpr microbial communities and paos in full scale systems varied process configurations and operating factors such as solids retention time have been shown to influence ebpr performance microbial community and kinetics however the sensitivity to the numerous variables present in full scale systems are not well understood onnis hayden et al 2019a and 2019b though the presence and abundance of various pao clades has been reported in recent studies the factors that influence clade dominance and activity is not well characterized particularly at full scale the relationship between pao clades and phosphorus removal mechanisms and performance remains largely unknown and not incorporated into predictive phosphorus removal models akbari et al 2021 several studies have identified a link between wet weather events and decreased activated sludge performance ebpr is particularly sensitive to changes in operating parameters and or wastewater characteristics mcmahan 2006 many treatment facilities experience wet weather peak flow related issues which can upset ebpr by changing wastewater characteristics and or reducing basin retention times wilen et al 2006 poor solids settling or washout in clarifiers during wet weather is often a problem for activated sludge treatment daigger et al 2017 for treatment plants relying on ebpr to meet a stringent effluent phosphorus permit limit wet weather conditions may significantly affect operations regulatory compliance and treatment costs however review of the literature found no studies on changes in ebpr microbial community dynamics during wet weather conditions understanding the changes that occur during wet weather would improve design and operation of ebpr systems the objective of this study was to evaluate ebpr performance and the microbial community dynamics of a full scale treatment plant by converting a section of one of the activated sludge trains using low cost operational modifications into an anoxic anaerobic zone to promote ebpr 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative polymerase change reaction qpcr were used to characterize the microbial community including known paos of the modified ebpr and control nitrification only basins the results from the modified basins were compared to results of the existing basins which served as a control to observe differences the influence of dry and wet weather conditions on ebpr performance and the microbial community were evaluated over two wet weather periods over two years 2 material and methods 2 1 full scale facility and basin modifications for ebpr the des moines metropolitan wastewater reclamation authority wra owns and operates the des moines wastewater reclamation facility wrf with average annual flow rate of about 2 94 m3 s 67 million us gallons per day mgd and peak flows over 8 76 m3 s 200 mgd the des moines wrf has six 24 226 m3 6 4 million us gallons plug flow activated sludge basins each basin has four passes as shown in figure 1 the existing system is operated for complete nitrification with all passes aerated and return activated sludge is returned to pass one diffused air is used for mixing and aeration controlled to each pass by a dissolved oxygen do sensor air flow meter and air control valve the air control valve is modulated to maintain a do set point for each pass the wrf was originally designed as a step feed activated sludge plant due to complications with plant hydraulics the plant has been operating as a plug flow activated sludge plant as indicated above however the aeration system was not upgraded to handle the extra bod load in pass one of the basins under plug flow mode and the air in pass one was undersupplied resulting in low dissolved oxygen and anoxic conditions treatment plant staff have reported that pass one of the aeration basins has insufficient aeration capacity to maintain aerobic conditions as such denitrification was happening under normal operational conditions in pass one of the aeration basins instead of constructing new anaerobic and anoxic zones and associated facilities to implement ebpr low cost operational modifications were developed to support ebpr within the existing basins two basins were completely isolated from the other four basins and modified to establish an ebpr process while the remaining four basins continued to operate with no change in complete nitrification mode for comparison purposes pass one of the modified basins was altered by decreasing and cycling air flow to create an anoxic anaerobic zone to promote selection of paos figure 1 the air to pass one was never completely turned off but kept at a low flow due to concerns about potential water and solids intrusion into the air diffusers and piping which was near the end of its service life and may have small cracks this is one of the challenges to be considered in modifying an existing plant to an ebpr with minimal hardware changes the air flow rate was periodically increased to balance the need for mixing to maintain solids in suspension while minimizing oxygen transfer to promote anaerobic anoxic conditions several combinations of low air flow rates with intermittent cycles of higher air flows were tested to optimize anoxic and anaerobic conditions while providing sufficient mixing and to prevent scum or foam formation on the water surface the target do for passes 1 4 of the control basins was 0 5 0 6 1 0 and 2 0 mg l and 0 0 0 6 1 0 and 2 0 mg l for the modified basins respectively after a period of adjustment air flow to pass one of the modified basins was cycled at approximately 1 9 m3 1 000 m3 min for 55 minutes and 5 minutes at 20 1 m3 1 000 m3 min anoxic anaerobic conditions were monitored using an oxidation reduction potential orp probe the modifications were tested over two wet weather seasons within a two year period for year 1 the treatment plant was monitored over 127 days from march to july and for year 2 over 89 days from may to august 2 2 sample collection laboratory analysis and measurements water quality and operating parameters were monitored to evaluate the performance of the activated sludge system throughout the treatment process the water quality and operating parameters dataset are located in brown et al 2021 water grab and composite samples from the basin influent and effluent locations throughout the basin passes and return waste activated sludge as shown in figure 1 chemical analytical tests of the samples were conducted onsite at the des moines treatment plant laboratory or sent to a third party

and wet weather performance ebpr was successfully established using low cost operational methods while no significant ebpr activity was observed in the control basins secondary influent characteristics bod5 nh3 n no3 n tp op and tss for dry and wet weather conditions were similar to typical literature values metcalf and eddy 2013 data provided in table s1 table 2 summarizes the various operational averages and 95 confidence intervals of activated sludge performance in the control and modified basins for wet and dry weather conditions wet weather conditions for the des moines wrf were defined by the plant as daily influent flow rates above 80 mgd or a total basin and anaerobic anoxic zone hrt of less than approximately 8 4 and 2 1 hours respectively nitrate concentrations in the control basins were found to be similar to that of the modified basins table 2 indicating that denitrification was occurring in pass one of the control basins this was supported by the orp measurements in pass one of the control basins which was close to orp values for anoxic conditions the occurrence of denitrification was due to the under capacity of the aeration system in pass one of the basins which was original designed for a step feed system wet weather activity varied significantly during the two test periods with daily average influent flow rates ranging from 2 02 m3 s 46 mgd to 11 57 m3 s 264 mgd and average of 3 46 m3 s 79 mgd the resulting hrts ranged from 2 6 to 12 7 hours with average of 8 9 hours including return sludge flow in the aeration basins wet weather events during the first year of testing were typical as reflected by plant influent flow rates conditions during the second year of testing were significantly wetter than typical with an extended period of wet weather including one of the highest influent flow rates of record figure 2 shows the daily average activated sludge basin hydraulic retention time hrt and phosphorus removal in the control and modified basins for different days over the study period phosphorus removal was significantly higher in the modified basins with total dry and wet weather combined average of 43 7 5 3 95 confidence and a maximum of 96 compared to 12 6 2 4 and a maximum of 46 in the control basins the wet weather conditions appeared to significantly reduce ebpr activity the total wet and dry weather average hrt of 8 9 hours for the control basins figure 2 was slightly longer than typical design values of 4 to 8 hours for nitrifying activated sludge systems the daily average hrt of the anaerobic anoxic zone portion of the modified basins ranged from 0 6 hours to 3 2 hours with average of 2 2 hours and the aerobic portion of the modified basins ranged from 1 9 to 9 5 hours with average of 6 7 hours these values were similar to or longer than the typical and recommended design values for an anaerobic oxic a o ebpr system of 0 5 1 5 hours for the anaerobic anoxic zone and 1 3 hours for the aerobic zone metcalf and eddy 2013 brown et al 2011 another factor which likely contributed in part to poor phosphorus removal performance during wet weather was the dilution of vfa produced rabinowitz and oldham 1986 vfa concentration in pass one of the modified basins averaged 30 7 2 6 mg l during dry weather but decreased to 11 4 7 3 mg l during wet weather conditions vfa p ratios averaged 9 0 1 9 and 6 1 4 0 mg vfa mg p l during dry and wet conditions within the range of 4 16 mg vfa mg p l reported by curto 2001 to support ebpr waste activated sludge phosphorus content in the modified basins ranged from approximately 0 025 to 0 045 mg tp mg tss with an average of 0 033 mg tp mg tss during typical dry conditions table 2 the phosphorus content was significantly lower in the control basins ranging from about 0 01 to 0 02 mg tp mg tss with an average 0 016 tp mg tss two other studies investigating conversion of aeration systems for existing activated sludge systems to ebpr processes reported similar sludge phosphorus content ranging from 0 028 to 0 036 and 0 020 to 0 043 mg tp mg tss cao et al 2009 qin et al 2014 values above approximately 0 030 mg tp mg tss up to a practical maximum of about 0 070 mg tp mg tss indicate presence of ebpr activity droste 1997 the previously referenced sludge phosphorous content values and measurements from the current work are all in the low to moderate range for ebpr suggesting the modification of conventional activated sludge to ebpr is not as efficient as purpose built ebpr systems the influence of wet weather events appears to have also reduced ebpr performance as indicated by the sludge phosphorus content dropping to about 0 015 mg tp mg tss during prolonged wet weather conditions in year 2 however the operational modifications for this study were not optimized and may still have room for improvement in phosphorus removal when the high cost of a new ebpr facility is considered conversion of existing activated sludge systems may still be desirable when moderate ebpr performance is sufficient orp in pass one of the modified basins generally decreased as the hrt in the anaerobic zone increased and ranged from about 0 to 200 mv and below 100 mv during dry weather conditions table 2 orp between approximately 100 and 225 mv is desirable for ebpr to support fermentation volatile fatty acid production and phosphorus release gerardi 2007 the orp in pass one of the control basins did not significantly change as hrt increased because the air control system automatically added more air to maintain the do set point for an aerobic condition figure 3 shows phosphorus release in pass one of the modified basins was similar to the control basins during wet weather conditions when the pass one hrt was below about 1 5 hours p 0 05 when pass one hrt in the modified basins increased above 1 5 hours phosphorus release was variable but steadily increased with increased hrt the longer hrt provided more time for anaerobic conditions to be established to support phosphorus release from paos previous lab scale work demonstrated optimal anaerobic hrt for ebpr of 2 3 hours brown et al 2011 as expected no significant change in phosphorus release was observed in the control basins 3 2 microbial observations the relative abundance of phyla represented by 16s rrna gene sequences was measured in the waste activated sludge of the control and modified basins figure 4 shows phyla with relative abundance greater than 1 for the control and modified aeration basins the dominant phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were consistent with other activated sludge studies ferrera and sanchez 2016 there was a significant difference in the relative abundance of three of the measured phyla chloroflexi nitrospirae and verrucomicrobia between the control and modified aeration basins chloroflexi are filamentous bacteria typically abundant in wastewater treatment plants there does not appear to be significant difference in their physiology although some data indicates they are involved with polysaccharide and protein degradation nielsen et al 2010 nitrospirae includes microbes important to wastewater treatment such as the genus nitrospira which are the majority of nitrite oxidizing bacteria in many treatment plants nowka et al 2015 cydzik kwiatkowska and zielinska 2016 noted that low do and short solids retention time srt favors growth of nitrospira verrucomicrobia is frequently detected though their function in activated sludge is not well known seviour and nielsen 2010 however these three phyla represented a small fraction of the microbial community up to 10 suggesting that the basin modifications had limited impact on the activated sludge microbial community principal component analysis pca of control vs modified basin samples showed some but not complete differentiation of microbial communities figure s1 similarly the alpha diversity or the richness of the microbial communities showed no change between the modified and control basins regardless of orp levels or phosphorus removal data not shown it should be noted that the use of the greengenes database for alignment resulted in a large number of otus that were unassigned at the genus level though the mapping of species by greengenes reported here is likely to not be affected balvocite and huson 2017 using other databases such as silva or ncbi may have resulted in slightly different comparisons between microbial communities miseq 16s rrna gene sequence data showed relative abundance of pao genera accumulibacter was very low in the control basins 0 0 22 and while the increase in the modified basins 0 0 37 remained lower than most reported values for ebpr 0 8 7 4 average 3 5 zeng et al 2018 contrary to reports from many lab scale studies the present work and the relatively small number of other reported studies of full scale systems reported no significant correlation between abundance of paos and ebpr performance coats et al 2017 figure 5 shows the relative quantity of the two currently known predominant paos found in wastewater treatment facilities accumulibacter and tetrasphaera which is a significant part of the actinobacter like paos apaos category nielsen et al 2019 the relative quantity of accumulibacter significantly increased in the modified basins in year 1 and year 2 compared to the control basins up to 1 of the total bacterial population this relative abundance was comparable to accumulibacter abundances reported from full scale ebpr plants ranging between 1 1 7 9 mao et al 2015 the relative quantity of apaos did not significantly vary in either control or modified basins in year 1 or year 2 and showed no significant correlation with phosphorus removal for either year r2 0 0054 and 0 091 similarly spearman rank correlation analysis between p uptake or release rates and specific bacteria figure s2 showed no known paos among those that correlated strongly with p removal processes p 0 01 extended analysis showed that accumulibacter abundance did indeed positively correlate with both p release and uptake with correlation coefficients of 0 43 and 0 46 respectively p 0 035 and 0 025 respectively the trends in phosphorus removal and paos observed during extended wet weather in year 2 may have been caused by variations in influent wastewater characteristics as material is flushed from the sewers to the treatment plant followed by dilution indeed the overall microbial communities during wet and dry weather were not completely different figure s3 relative abundances of specific bacterial species that were significantly correlated to wet weather figure s4a did not include any known paos the observed decreased influent organics may have decreased microbial and phosphorus removal activity the diluted influent phosphorus may have encouraged paos to adopt a glycogen accumulating metabolism as proposed by muszynski and milobedzka 2015 and acevedo et al 2017 that sustained the bacteria during stressed conditions and may explain the fast recovery in phosphorus removal when dry weather conditions resumed decreased hrt during wet weather also likely played a role in decreased phosphorus release as previously noted figure 6 shows accumulibacter clades in the control and modified basins measured by qpcr the six targeted clades were present in all samples and the ranking of each clade was generally consistent over each year however there were differences in the rankings between control and modified basins and between year 1 and year 2 relative quantity of accumulibacter clades iia and iid increased in the modified basins in year 1 an extended period of wet weather in year 2 coincided with significant increase in clades iib and iic in the modified basins that was not observed in the control basins despite many studies of ebpr processes correlation of accumulibacter clades to nutrient removal performance at full scale facilities is not clear nielsen et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 most research regarding accumulibacter clades have used lab scale reactors synthetic wastewater and pao enriched cultures which have promoted selection of clades ia ic iia and iid flowers et al 2013 he et al 2007 wexler et al 2009 study of full scale treatment systems has shown significant differences in accumulibacter clades compared to lab scale work several studies have shown type ii clades predominate in full scale systems with reduced abundance of type i opposite of many lab scale studies zeng et al 2018 mao et al 2015 in the present work clade i was second from lowest in order of abundance in year 1 but significantly higher in year 2 for both control and modified basins differing from reported literature in fact full scale ebpr plants vary widely in their ppk1 makeup mao et al 2015 zeng et al 2018 pointing to yet unclear relationships between process parameters and clades our relative abundances indeed fall within the reported ranges for all clades several studies have reported clade type i are denitrifying paos capable of nitrate reduction while clade type ii are not able to reduce nitrate acevedo et al 2012 flowers et al 2009 kim et al 2013 however much of the work on denitrifying paos is based on lab scale testing synthetic or partially synthetic wastewater and should be verified with pilot or full scale testing with real wastewater zeng et al 2018 noted studies reporting increased diversity of accumulibacter clades may improve the stability of the treatment process for the present work perhaps the diverse population of accumulibacter clades particularly increased relative quantity of clades iic and iid during extended wet weather conditions in year 2 contributed to the rapid recovery of phosphorus removal when drier conditions resumed the increased relative quantity during wet weather was unexpected as wet weather has typically been associated decreased microbial diversity sato et al 2016 as discussed below 3 3 wet weather influence on microbial community previous studies of wet weather influence on activated sludge reported significant changes in the microbial community typically decreased diversity sato et al 2016 noted two wet weather factors that contribute to changes in microbial communities 1 physical washout of microbes from the system and 2 dilution which decreased substrate concentration influent concentrations during wet weather are often highly variable strickler et al 2003 in the present study during an extended period of wet weather there was no significant change in phyla relative abundance or microbial community structures assessed through pca figure s3 however there were changes in relative quantity of accumulibacter and several accumulibacter clades clades as discussed above furthermore based on partial correlation analysis the relative abundances of non pao bacterial species that significantly correlated with p uptake rates when controlled for wet dry weather also correlated strongly with p release rates figure s4b the relative abundances of these key non pao species were strongly affected p 0 01 by the basin operational conditions figure s5 there may have been community level interactions between these key species and accumulibacter that led to changes in their relative quantities which co occurred with wet weather as understanding of microbial communities present in wastewater treatment systems improves engineers and plant operators would benefit from development of methods to promote particular microbes to benefit treatment performance the conditions within a wastewater treatment process can change quickly due to varied influent wastewater characteristics and flow rate although there is usually little that can be done to change influent characteristics providing supplemental carbon sources can address deficiencies in the influent nielsen et al 2010 developed a conceptual microbial ecosystem model with substrate specificity such as proteins lipids or carbohydrates for different microbes however promoting certain groups of bacteria via carbon addition or other means can cause problems for example methanol is a common supplemental carbon source to promote denitrifiers however these bacteria require acclimation to methanol and abruptly stopping methanol feed such as during an equipment failure can result in treatment upset hallin et al 1996 wef 2005 maintaining a diverse microbial community that can quickly adapt to varied conditions is key to a reliable and resilient treatment process curtis et al 2003 bixio et al 2001 noted that wet weather related dilution of influent wastewater can decrease fermentation activity by up to 50 to counter the decreased fermentation performance configuring the process to have a sidestream fermenter or step feed influent may be beneficial modifying a plug flow basin to utilize step feed where influent is introduced at one or more locations downstream of the initial portion of the basin was originally envisioned as a method to balance aeration demand but has also been shown capable of significantly increasing wet weather treatment capacity up to approximately 60 percent metcalf and eddy 2013 daigger et al 2017 in an ebpr system step feed could be used during wet weather to introduce secondary influent downstream of the anaerobic zone so that only return activated sludge is introduced to the anaerobic zone the retention time in the anaerobic zone would be increased compared to normal operation and wet weather washout of microbes decreased the solids concentration of return activated sludge typically about 10 000 mg l would be approximately 2 4 times higher than mixed liquor and would likely increase anaerobic zone performance decreased orp increased fermentation activity and may select for beneficial microbes preliminary step feed testing at the des moines wrf during dry weather showed improved phosphorus removal due to improved anaerobic zone performance data not shown table 3 shows measured phosphorus uptake and release rates compared with reported values including systems modified for ebpr and systems originally built for ebpr the phosphorus uptake and release rates for existing activated sludge systems modified to ebpr processes were on the low end of the range of reported values particularly for release rates the reduced performance of modified anaerobic zones is likely caused by several factors 1 insufficient volume retention time 2 un optimized configuration and 3 dissolved oxygen introduced by aeration mixing these release rates and other ebpr criteria from full scale and batch tests can be used to determine significant parameters for ebpr prediction model for dry and wet weather conditions when converting an existing system to ebpr the volume of existing basins available to be converted to anaerobic zones may be less than ideal when the volume is too small there is not enough retention time to establish adequate anaerobic conditions for volatile fatty acids vfa production and phosphorus release unfortunately there are few options to mitigate decreased performance from a small anaerobic zone the return activated sludge flow rate could be reduced to decrease nitrate load to the anaerobic zone mixing systems designed to reduce air entrainment and promote anaerobic conditions could also be considered conversion of existing facilities may not permit use of optimized basin configurations for example in the present study the modification of existing pass one created a large combined anoxic and anaerobic zone no walls or baffling were installed to separate the zones and it is likely that the boundary of the anoxic anaerobic zones was variable based on flow rate nitrate load from return activated sludge and other conditions all of which decreased performance of the anaerobic zone and phosphorus release to overcome decreased performance of a single anoxic anaerobic zone increasing the size of the zone or installation of some type of wall to separate each zone could be considered based on budget and performance goals use of existing aeration systems to provide mixing for a modified anaerobic zone such as the present study or as reported by qin et al 2014 introduces dissolved oxygen resulting in decreased anaerobic conditions the air flow rates used for pass one mixing 1 9 continuous and periodic brief cycle of up to 20 1 m3 min 1 000 m3 were considerably lower than recommended values minimum 10 to 15 m3 min 1 000 m3 continuous us epa 1998 however were demonstrated adequate to maintain solids mixing the low mixing energy in pass one raised concerns of solids deposition by treatment plant staff and at the end of the study the basins were drained for inspection solids deposition was observed in pass one however the amount was determined to not be a problem the deposited solids were removed by slowly cycling progressively larger air flow rates through the diffuser system over the course of a day the solids deposited in pass one during the study by cyclic aeration likely improved treatment performance by partially fermenting and releasing volatile fatty acids consumed by paos as part of the phosphorus release process installation of mechanical mixing systems in place of air mixing could be considered however the cost of new equipment may not be justified if the performance of using an existing aeration system for mixing is adequate and the added dissolved oxygen is acceptable for a given application 4 conclusion this study demonstrated successful conversion of a full scale nitrifying activated sludge system to biologically remove phosphorus using low cost operational methods phosphorus removal performance and changes in the microbial community were characterized and compared with a control nitrification only activated sludge basins the following is a summary of results and implications full scale ebpr was established using low cost operational methods in an existing nitrifying activated sludge system ebpr performance and changes in the microbial community in the modified ebpr basins were found to be impacted by wet weather conditions dna sequencing showed significant changes in some microbial community phyla during ebpr but no significant correlation to phosphorus removal abundance of known phosphorus accumulating organisms paos did not significantly correlate with changes in phosphorous removal performance contrary to reports from previous small scale and batch studies abundance of some accumulibacter clades were found contrary some past small scale studies and studies utilizing synthetic wastewater significant change in abundance of some clades was observed during wet weather conditions this full scale study provided realistic data and information which can be used in developing ebpr prediction models for full scale systems during dry and wet weather conditions funding

16018,ferrate fe vi salts like k2feo4 are efficient green oxidants to remediate organic contaminants in water treatment minerals are efficient sorbents of contaminants and also excellent solid heterogeneous catalysts which might affect fe vi remediation processes by targeting the typical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compound pyrene the application of fe vi for oxidation of pyrene immobilized on three minerals i e montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite was studied for the first time pyrene immobilized on the three minerals was efficiently oxidized by fe vi with 87 99 of pyrene 10 μm being degraded at ph 9 0 in the presence of a 50 fold molar excess fe vi different minerals favored different ph optima for pyrene degradation with ph optima from neutral to alkaline following the order of montmorillonite ph 7 0 kaolinite ph 8 0 and goethite ph 9 0 although goethite revealed the highest catalytic activity on pyrene degradation by fe vi the greater noneffective loss of the oxidative species by ready self decay in the goethite system resulted in lower degradation efficiency compared to montmorillonite protonation and lewis acid on montmorillonite and goethite assisted fe vi oxidation of pyrene the intermediate ferrate species fe v fe iv were the dominant oxidative species accountable for pyrene oxidation while the contribution of fe vi species was negligible hydroxyl radical was involved in mineral immobilized pyrene degradation and contributed to 11 5 27 4 of the pyrene degradation in montmorillonite system followed by kaolinite 10 8 21 4 and goethite 5 1 12 2 according to the hydroxyl radical quenching experiments cations abundant in the matrix and dissolved humic acid hampered pyrene degradation finally two different degradation pathways both producing phthalic acid were identified this study demonstrates efficient fe vi oxidation of pyrene immobilized on minerals and contributes to the development of efficient environmentally friendly fe vi based

pathway 1 introduction remediation of organic pollutants is an urgent environmental issue and has attracted a lot of attention due to the widespread organic pollution and the severe environmental health risks in the past few decades megharaj et al 2011 pariatamby and kee 2016 numerous investigations have been performed to explore efficient and cost effective techniques including chemical oxidation and bioremediation for removal of organic pollutants anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 megharaj et al 2011 bajagain et al 2020 liu et al 2020 among them chemical oxidation is a popular method for the rapid and efficient mitigation of organic contaminants and controlling their toxicity anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 bajagain et al 2020 conventional oxidants including permanganate bajagain et al 2020 activated persulfate zhou et al 2019 and fenton or fenton like processes catalyzed by hydrogen peroxide iron compounds anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 thomas et al 2021 have been well investigated and are frequently applied to soil and water remediation however some of these oxidants might cause secondary pollution mno2 so4 2 due to excessive application also if reactions have to be carried under acidic conditions ph 5 for efficient removal of organic pollutants this might lower the water and soil sediment quality zhou et al 2019 new environmentally friendly and efficient oxidants are therefore needed for pollutant remediation ferrate vi is a multi functional oxidant working in many processes such as oxidation adsorption sedimentation coagulation decolorization deodorization and disinfection therefore ferrate vi is considered as a promising green oxidant in water treatment producing nontoxic fe iii species sharma et al 2013 2015 rai et al 2018 wang et al 2020 as a disinfectant ferrate vi can inactivate bacteria viruses biofilms and remove antibiotic resistance genes by membrane destruction dna damage and coagulation yan et al 2020 wu et al 2021 moreover ferrate vi has also been reported to be fairly effective in heavy metal removal by oxidation and mineral incorporation prucek et al 2015 and degradation of numerous electron rich organic pollutants including organosulfur compounds amines phenols pesticides hydrocarbons and pharmaceuticals sharma et al 2013 2015 2016 rai et al 2018 luo et al 2021 the mechanisms of ferrate vi oxidation of organic pollutants are based on the chemical structures of pollutants and the specific reaction types taking place for example the oxidation of β lactam containing antibiotics was most likely attributed to the attack of thioether moieties by ferrate vi which resulted in sulfoxide derivatives sharma et al 2016 compared with other oxidants ferrate vi has a relatively high redox potential of 2 2 v in acidic solutions but decreases to 0 7 v under alkaline conditions sharma 2013 due to a high rate of ferrate vi self decomposition in acidic condition the ferrate vi oxidation of organic contaminants is commonly done under neutral and alkaline conditions sharma et al 2013 2015 although the redox potential can decrease to a relatively low level in alkaline condition the involved more active fe v fe iv species produced from ferrate vi decomposition could enhance the ferrate vi oxidation process the activation of ferrate vi namely the formation of fe v fe iv species at high concentrations at short time scales from ferrate vi decomposition can be achieved by acid addition metal ion activation reducing agents and carbonaceous surfaces sharma et al 2022 introduction of these activating agents thus could improve the oxidation efficiency of pollutants by ferrate vi oxidation process due to the generation of high concentrations of more active fe v fe iv species in a short period under alkaline condition sharma et al 2022 generally ferrate vi as oxidant is mostly used in water treatment only few studies had focused on its application in matrices such as sediment and underground water and soil remediation matrices such as groundwater and sediments are heterogeneous complex mediums containing organic matter minerals metallic oxides and ions which are important factors affecting ferrate vi oxidation of organic pollutants the degradation efficiency might significantly decrease in these complex matrixes compared to that in simple water medium several studies had focused on ferrate vi based remediation of organic contaminants in complex soil matrix and the results showed an improved remediation effect by ferrate vi over some conventional oxidants monfort et al 2019 2020 he et al 2021 for example monfort et al found that ferrate vi oxidant was more efficient than some conventional oxidants such as activated persulfate peroxymonosulfate and hydrogen peroxide in pcbs removal with degradation efficiency of 30 by ferrate vi versus 2 12 by the conventional oxidants monfort et al 2019 combined fe vi peroxymonosulfate oxidation systems could significantly improve the removal efficiency of pcbs and o dichlorobenzene monfort et al 2019 he et al 2021 these findings suggested that ferrate vi oxidation might serve as an efficient green chemical method for water and soil sediment remediation definitely more studies upon fe vi based remediation of organic pollutants should be carried out to extend its application in more complex matrices as persistent organic contaminants consisting of two or more fused aromatic rings polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are widely distributed in the environment exerting endocrine disruption mutagenic and carcinogenic effects alegbeleye et al 2017 due to the low water solubility pah compounds especially the high molecular weight pahs are readily sorbed immobilized on mineral organic solid particles in soil and aquatic environment resulting in high concentration of pahs in sediment soil other than in water quantin et al 2005 ferrarese et al 2008 the sediment soil thus become the sink and source of pah pollutants several studies reported that ferrate vi was efficient for pahs removal in polluted waters antošová et al 2020 haneef et al 2020 johansson et al 2020 however the degradation processes and oxidation mechanisms have not yet been elucidated furthermore the removal of pahs immobilized on in complex matrices such as minerals organic matter in sediments has not yet been investigated clays and oxide minerals are indispensable components of sediments and also excellent adsorbents of organic pollutants when they enter into the aquatic environment awad et al 2019 lin et al 2021 minerals can also function as heterogeneous catalysts mediating fenton like processes taking place over a broad range of ph garrido ramírez et al 2010 tong et al 2020 and have the potential to activate persulfate oxidation zhou et al 2019 as a result minerals are beneficial for removal of organic pollutants by advanced oxidation however whether minerals can mediate pahs degradation by ferrate vi oxidation has not yet been verified therefore this study is designed to explore the role of minerals in pahs degradation by ferrate vi oxidation to carry out the experiments pyrene a four ring compound was selected as a model pah pyrene is one of the most abundant high molecular weight pahs in the environment samanta et al 2002 and has unique photo chemical properties figueira duarte and mullen 2011 making it a relatively highly active pah compound in redox reactions in the environment three typical minerals that widely exist in sediments soils i e montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite were used as solid matrix for pyrene immobilization the objectives of the present study were 1 to determine the degradation efficiency of pyrene immobilized on different minerals by ferrate vi oxidation 2 to reveal the function of oxidative species and the degradation processes 3 to investigate the roles of different minerals as well as ions and types of organic matter on pyrene removal and 4 to elucidate the transformation pathways of pyrene oxidation by ferrate vi our study aims to provide more fundamental information on pahs degradation by ferrate vi on mineral surface and benefit efforts towards the development of ferrate vi based advanced oxidation technology for green pollution remediation in soil and aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the used chemicals and reagents are analytical grade or better and details are provided in text s1 in supplementary materials three typical minerals namely kaolinite montmorillonite and goethite were used considering their wide presence in environment ferrate vi solution was freshly prepared by dissolving k2feo4 powder in borate buffer 20 mm ph 7 0 9 0 the prepared newly fe vi solution was immediately used to utmost exclude the influence of fe vi loss before initiation of the reaction 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 immobilization of pyrene on minerals and characterization the total amount of pahs in polluted sediment could reach several thousand of micrograms per gram sediment and pyrene alone sorbed on fine clay silt particles 50 μm could reach 161 μg g 1 quantin et al 2005 ferrarese et al 2008 to simulate the oxidation of pahs in sediments soil environments where pahs are mainly bound to fine clay silt particles quantin et al 2005 ferrarese et al 2008 the target contaminant pyrene was immobilized on minerals before the oxidation experiment to make 100 μg g 1 mineral immobilized pyrene 10 g of each mineral montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite sieved through 200 mesh sieve was homogeneously mixed with 10 ml pyrene solution 100 mg l 1 dissolved in acetone in a glass beaker after completely evaporating acetone in a fuming cupboard the pyrene contaminated minerals 100 μg g 1 were obtained and stored in brown glass bottles the concentrations of pyrene immobilized on three minerals were detected to be 112 7 109 4 and 101 1 μg g 1 in average for montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite respectively n2 adsorption isotherms at 77 k quantachrome instruments united states was used to estimate specific surface areas and pore volume infrared spectroscopy ir nicolet 5700 thermo fisher scientific united states was conducted to identify changes of surface functional groups after pyrene immobilization on minerals the results are shown in supplementary materials fig s1 the changes of specific surface area and the surface functional groups of minerals inferred by n2 adsorption and ir spectrum indicated the sorption immobilization of pyrene on minerals fig s1 jia et al 2018 2 2 2 degradation experiments the oxidation experiments were conducted in neutral to alkaline conditions ph 7 0 9 0 as many studies carried out in fe vi oxidation experiments shao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 these settings considered the stability of fe vi in alkaline solution and the conditions of contaminated water sediments widely found in alkaline aquatic environments such as the ph within the range of 7 7 8 02 in previous studies quantin et al 2005 ferrarese et al 2008 the oxidation experiments were carried out in 50 ml glass centrifuge tubes the k2feo4 solutions 0 06 1 0 mm were freshly prepared in borate buffer 20 mm adjusted to the desired ph values within 0 1 ph 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 to initiate the reaction 20 ml newly prepared k2feo4 solution was immediately added into the tubes containing 0 4 g pyrene contaminated mineral then the reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature 20 2 c under continuous stirring at 160 r min the solid solution ratio was 1 50 the initial pyrene concentration was equivalent to 10 μm 2 mg l 1 at defined time intervals 0 5 ml reaction mixtures were sampled out and added into excess hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution to stop the reaction and the residual pyrene was measured after solvent extraction h2o2 and fe iii were reported to be involved in fe vi degradation system lee et al 2014 shao et al 2019 therefore to explore their influence on pyrene degradation exogenous h2o2 0 50 μm or fe iii 0 500 μm were applied to the pyrene minerals before initiating the reaction by addition of fe vi solution the ubiquitous cations anions and dissolved organic matter in natural environments may influence the removal of organic pollutants experiments were carried out to examine possible influences of cations nh4 k ca2 cu2 mg2 zn2 and fe3 anions no3 cl co3 2 so4 2 and po4 3 and dissolved humic acid ha on the degradation of mineral immobilized pyrene by fe vi in alkaline condition ph 8 0 the cationic chloride salts anionic sodium salts and humic substances ha were individually added into the reaction mixtures before initiating the oxidation reaction considering the environmental contents of ions and ha the final equivalent concentration of 2 mm for salts and 1 50 mg l 1 for ha were adopted tert butyl alcohol tba and methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso added at various concentrations were used to examine the possible role of formed hydroxyl radical oh and ferrate species fe v fe iv on pyrene degradation on minerals due to their fast quenching reactions with oh and fe v fe iv respectively shao et al 2019 all experiments were done in two or three replicates 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 detection of residual pyrene the residual pyrene on mineral in the mixture 0 5 ml was extracted by mixed solvent acetone dichloromethane v v 1 1 10 ml under sonication for 30 min after filtration through 0 22 μm specific nylon membrane syringe filter the pyrene in extracts was detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent 1260 usa following the method in a previous study wang et al 2022 the details are described in text s2 to guarantee the analytical quality the standard pyrene solution 10 mg l 1 was introduced into the minerals pyrene extraction and detection was done following the same procedure the recoveries were from 93 2 to 98 1 which is satisfactory for analysis requirements 2 3 2 determination of transformation products the transformation products of pyrene were extracted by acetonitrile and identified by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight premier mass spectrometer lc qtof ms ms x500r lc qtof ab sciex usa following the program described in text s2 according to a previous study chu et al 2020 the ab sciex os software version 1 4 was applied to analyze the ms data 2 3 3 determination of fe vi the fe vi concentration in stock solution was directly detected using a uv visible spectrophotometer at 510 nm wavelength ε 1150 m 1 cm 1 lee et al 2014 shao et al 2019 the residual fe vi in reaction mixtures was estimated by the abts method huang et al 2018 abts can react with fe vi fe v and fe iv species via one electron transfer process however fe v and fe iv species are unstable and the half lives are 1 ms resulting in low concentrations of fe v and fe iv species in aqueous solution melton and bielski 1990 rush and bielski 1994 this makes it difficult to determine fe v and fe iv species directly using abts zhang et al 2021a thus abts in this study is reported only for fe vi determination briefly 0 5 ml sample mixtures were added into 1 ml 10 mm abts to quench the reaction and form colored abts after centrifugation the abts in supernatant was determined by colorimetric method at 415 nm with molar absorbance of 34 000 m 1 cm 1 then the fe vi concentration was calculated by dividing the coefficient from abts concentration based on the stoichiometric ratio of abts to fe vi which was approximately 1 90 at ph 7 0 and 8 0 huang et al 2018 and 1 64 at ph 9 0 in 20 mm borate buffer reaction system fig s2 2 3 4 determination of h2o2 and fe ii the accumulated h2o2 in degradation system was quantified by horseradish peroxidase method catalyzing the oxidation of abts by h2o2 lee et al 2014 any produced fe ii was detected by adding 1 0 mm bipyridine bpy into the degradation system before and after the oxidation reaction 2 h after fe vi addition and the red colored fe ii bpy complex was determined by colorimetry at 522 nm ε 8650 m 1 cm 1 shao et al 2019 2 3 5 electron paramagnetic resonance analysis free radicals such as hydroxyl radical from mineral fe vi system were investigated using electron paramagnetic resonance epr dimethylpyridine oxide dmpo was used as the radical spin trapping compound the analysis procedure was as follows each mineral 0 04 g was mixed with 2 ml 1 0 mm fe vi solution in borate buffer ph 8 0 and then dmpo final concentration 100 mm was applied to trap the free radicals epr analysis was conducted by a bruker emx plus spectrometer karlsruhe germany following the procedure described previously wang et al 2021a 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation efficiency of mineral immobilized pyrene efficient degradation of mineral immobilized pyrene by fe vi oxidation was observed after 2 h reaction at ph 7 0 9 0 fig 1 increase of oxidant dosage accelerated pyrene degradation for example when initial fe vi concentration increased from 0 06 mm to 1 0 mm at ph 9 0 fe vi pyrene molar ratio from 6 1 to 100 1 the degradation efficiency of pyrene 10 μm immobilized on three minerals increased from 33 2 to 98 9 for montmorillonite from 29 9 to 92 2 for kaolinite and from 37 7 to 94 5 for goethite respectively montmorillonite system showed higher degradation efficiency than kaolinite and goethite system under the same condition at ph 7 0 and 8 0 the montmorillonite pyrene was almost completely degraded 98 at 0 50 mm fe vi dosage fig 1a increase of solution reaction ph resulted in varied response of pyrene degradation on different minerals fig 1 as the reaction ph increased from 7 0 to 9 0 the degradation efficiency decreased for montmorillonite but increased for goethite system fig 1a c in the case of kaolinite system the best degradation performance with increasing ph was fe vi dosage dependent and alkaline condition was conducive to pyrene degradation fig 1b these results indicated that fe vi oxidation of pyrene immobilized on minerals was affected by oxidant dosage reaction ph and mineral type 3 2 degradation kinetics of mineral immobilized pyrene mineral immobilized pyrene degraded rapidly in the first 10 min with fe vi decomposition especially for goethite fig 2 as reaction period increased the decrease of pyrene and fe vi concentration became slower while the oxidation mostly completed in 1 h as the residual concentration of pyrene remained almost unchanged fig 3 d f it was generally reported that the fe vi oxidation of an organic contaminant followed second order kinetics sharma et al 2016 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 li et al 2021 the calculation of apparent second order rate constants k is as described in eqs 1 and 2 1 d pyrene d t k fe vi pyrene 2 k ln pyrene pyrene 0 0 t fe vi d t where pyrene and fe vi are the concentrations of pyrene and fe vi at time t respectively and the term 0 t fe vi d t is the time dependent fe vi exposure namely the integrated fe vi concentration with time zhu et al 2020 the degradation of pyrene immobilized on minerals at different fe vi dosages and reaction ph did not fit into the second order kinetic model fig 3a f the plots of ln pyrene pyrene 0 against fe vi exposure at varied initial fe vi dosages did not coincide as the reaction time prolonged these plots departed from linearity and the trend was more obvious at higher fe vi 0 and reaction ph fig 3a f especially for reaction in kaolinite and goethite systems one possible explanation is that fe vi is not stable in solution and could self decompose following second order kinetics table 1 lee et al 2014 and the presence of minerals could accelerate fe vi self decomposition eqs 3 and 4 fig s3 3 d fe vi d t k fe vi 2 4 1 f e v i k t 1 f e v i 0 this means that fe vi concentration at time t depends on not only the reaction with pyrene but also the fe vi self decomposition especially in the later reaction period where the fe vi self decay might occupy the major fe vi loss thus if the fe vi decomposes more fe vi exposure is needed to obtain a fixed pyrene degradation which leads to the down deviation of linear relationships between ln pyrene pyrene 0 and fe vi exposure fig 3a f in mineral pyrene degradation systems the loss of fe vi also obeyed second order kinetics at ph 7 0 8 0 figs s4 and s5 considering the two paths of fe vi loss a third order kinetics was employed to model the pyrene degradation with reaction time as described in eqs 5 7 the third order reaction kinetics also can be found in manganese oxide and fenton catalyzed organic pollutant degradation kuan et al 2013 zhou et al 2020 5 d pyrene d t k fe vi 2 pyrene 6 d pyrene fe vi 2 pyrene k d t the integrated form is 7 1 a 2 b 2 2 x 2 b a a a 2 x l n b a 2 x a b x k t where a and b are initial fe vi 0 and pyrene 0 concentration respectively x is the concentration of degraded pyrene pyrene 0 pyrene t at time t the third order degradation kinetics could be considered as combination of a second order kinetics for fe vi decomposition and a first order kinetics for pyrene degradation the coefficients of determination r2 of third order degradation kinetics were almost higher than 0 99 at ph 7 0 8 0 fig 3g l suggesting that the fe vi oxidation of mineral immobilized pyrene apparently follows more the third order kinetics than the second order kinetics at ph 7 0 8 0 fig 3 table 2 however at ph 9 0 none of second and third order kinetics described the reaction accurately luo et al found the self decomposition of fe vi obeys first order kinetics unimolecular decomposition at ph 9 0 which is different from the decay of protonated fe vi species that follow second order kinetics at lower ph luo et al 2020 this might lead to the different degradation kinetics of pyrene at ph 9 0 from those at ph 7 0 8 0 to verify this we determined fe vi oxidation of pyrene in water solution without the presence of minerals at ph 9 0 and found that both pyrene degradation and fe vi decomposition followed pseudo first order kinetics fig 4 c originally pyrene degradation in water solution at ph 9 0 without the presence of minerals also followed second order kinetics while the fe vi concentration is far higher than pyrene concentration 10 folds and the decay of fe vi is slow at ph 9 0 the pyrene degradation rate is faster or comparative to fe vi decomposition which makes the change of fe vi concentration negligible compared to the change of pyrene concentration therefore the degradation of pyrene in water without minerals follows pseudo first order kinetics as well as the fe vi decomposition does however in the presence of minerals pyrene degradation without pre immobilization showed different kinetics from those of pyrene immobilized on minerals for example pyrene degradation followed first order kinetics in the presence of montmorillonite and kaolinite while it followed second order kinetics in the presence of goethite fig 4c d these were different from the trends observed in the degradation of pyrene immobilized on minerals which none of first second or third order kinetics satisfactorily fitted furthermore the pyrene degradation rate without minerals was apparently lower than that in the presence of minerals fig 4c d these results suggested that minerals could act as solid catalysts for efficient fe vi oxidation of pyrene and also alter the degradation kinetics among the three minerals the oxidation rate constant of pyrene on goethite was at least one order of magnitude greater than on montmorillonite and kaolinite for example at ph 8 0 and fe vi dosage of 0 50 mm the apparent reaction rate k 3rd for the goethite system 7 39 mm 2 min 1 was 18 5 and 15 1 fold the values of the montmorillonite 0 40 mm 2 min 1 and kaolinite 0 49 mm 2 min 1 systems table 2 respectively the fast degradation of pyrene on goethite is probably because of the enhancement of fe vi decomposition that produces more oxidative reactive ferrate species fe v and fe iv r1 table 1 however goethite might also accelerate the decay of the oxidative ferrate species fe vi fe v and fe iv other than promote their oxidation capacity resulting in reduction of ferrate exposure in the goethite system and finally leading to lower degradation efficiency compared to the montmorillonite system fig 1a c increase of reaction ph could significantly improve fe vi oxidation efficiency of pyrene in goethite system due to the slower fe vi decomposition under such conditions figs 1c and 2c 3 3 dominant oxidant in the ferrate mineral system for pyrene degradation fe vi decomposition in aqueous solutions generates fe v fe iv fe iii fe ii and h2o2 table 1 lee et al 2014 h2o2 formation with reaction time during the degradation of mineral immobilized pyrene 21 μm at ph 8 0 was detected the results indicated that the h2o2 production 10 7 μm reached the highest within 10 min fig s6 fe vi dosage influenced the h2o2 formation increase of oxidant dosage resulted in increase at first and then decrease in h2o2 production with greatest h2o2 content observed at 0 12 mm initial fe vi dosage fig 5 a the h2o2 yield h2o2 fe vi 0 100 decreased with increasing fe vi dosage and varied among the mineral treatments fig 5a indicating the h2o2 yield closely depended on fe vi dosage and the support mineral lee et al 2014 fe ii was not detected in the minerals system without fe vi addition with fe vi involved in the mineral systems the bipyridine bpy was added before the fe vi addition to trap fe ii formed during the complete reaction period the formation of fe ii 1 90 5 82 μm was confirmed by the appearance of red colored fe ii bpy complex when bpy was added before initiation of the reaction while hardly any fe ii was detected when bpy was added after the oxidation reaction completed figs 5b and s7 this suggested that fe ii is an intermediate produced from fe vi reduction in pyrene oxidation process similar to the formation of h2o2 more fe ii was produced in the montmorillonite system 5 82 μm than in kaolinite 2 67 μm and goethite 1 90 μm systems fig 5b considering the coexistence of h2o2 and fe ii fe iii in the reaction system oh radicals might contribute to the organic contaminant oxidation zhu et al 2020 the epr analysis confirmed the production of oh with an especially high concentration of oh in the montmorillonite system fig 5d unlike in the goethite and kaolinite systems where weak oh signal was observed fig 5d to further confirm the role of oh we performed the quenching experiment with the alcohol scavenger tba the oh oxidizes tba and pyrene with a second order rate constant of 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 5 0 6 1010 m 1 s 1 lindsey and tarr 2000 shao et al 2019 respectively the 0 1 mm tba significantly inhibit pyrene degradation increase of tba concentration to 10 mm the pyrene degradation was not affected greatly compared to the degradation at 0 1 mm tba fig s8c the oxidation of pyrene by oh should be totally inhibited by 10 mm of tba k oh pyrene pyrene k oh tba tba 1 975 at this tba concentration the fe vi decomposition is not significantly affected fig s8a tba addition 10 mm caused 11 5 27 4 10 8 21 4 and 5 1 12 4 reduction in pyrene removal for montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite systems respectively fig 5e indicating that the oh plays a role in fe vi mineral systems for pyrene degradation and the contribution of oh depends on the mineral type the montmorillonite system showed a higher contribution of oh oxidation than the kaolinite and goethite systems which might be attributed to the higher yield of h2o2 and fe ii and corresponding greater oh production with this mineral fig 5a d fe v and fe iv have strong oxidation activities but exist only for short times and are difficult to detect directly lee et al 2014 as the produced fe iv can oxidize micropollutants through a two electron transfer approach accompanied with fe iv reduction to fe ii shao et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the existence of fe iv in pyrene degrading process can be proved by the appearance of fe ii previous studies reported that fe iv react with h2o2 producing negligible fe ii during the fe vi self decomposition process zhu et al 2020 thus the produced fe ii abovementioned indicated fe iv involvement in the fe vi mineral pyrene oxidation processes fig s7 similarly fe ii production and the oxidative role of fe iv were proved in the degradation of contaminants such as methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso carbamazepine and caffeine shao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 the produced fe ii was quickly oxidized by fe vi to form fe v r5 table 1 indicating that fe v is indispensable in pyrene oxidation this could be corroborated by the inhibition of pyrene degradation when bpy was added to prevent fe v species formation in montmorillonite and kaolinite systems fig 5c the strong inhibition of bpy on pyrene degradation in montmorillonite system indicates fe v species was the dominant oxidative species while low inhibition or even enhancement effect of bpy on pyrene degradation in kaolinite and goethite systems suggests fe iv but not fe v was the dominant oxidative species in these two mineral systems sulfoxide pmso is known to be readily oxidized by fe v fe iv but not by fe vi to produce methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 which is different from the oxidation pathway by hydroxyl radical zhu et al 2020 huang et al 2021 pmso can also quench oh at a high rate constant of 3 61 109 m 1s 1 wang et al 2018 the formation of pmso2 and the stoichiometry of δpmso δpmso2 was almost 1 indicating that ferrate species not radicals dominate the reaction in the fe vi mineral systems huang et al 2021 the rate constant of fe vi species with pmso is about 30 m 1 s 1 which is far slower than that of fe v with pmso k 1 52 107 m 1 s 1 ph 7 0 huang et al 2021 and fe iv with pmso k 2 58 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 0 in borate buffer zhu et al 2020 fe v species could contribute up to 99 to ferrate oxidation of pmso in borate buffer huang et al 2021 high concentrations of pmso could consume fe vi though the reaction is relatively slow fig s8b however our results showed that a low concentration of pmso 0 08 mm could almost completely inhibit pyrene degradation in montmorillonite and kaolinite system and less than 10 pyrene degradation was observed in goethite system at ph of 7 0 and 8 0 conditions furthermore the pyrene degradation was very low 12 7 even at a smaller concentration of pmso 0 05 mm since fe vi oxidation of pmso is slow the competition between pmso and pyrene for fe v fe iv species possibly contributes to the inhibitory effect of pmso on pyrene oxidation suggesting fe v fe iv species are the dominant active oxidative species in pyrene degradation by fe vi it is reported that the higher fe vi dosage the greater the contribution of fe v fe iv in micropollutant removal zhu et al 2020 huang et al 2021 to clarify the contribution of fe vi pmso and tba were co added to consume the fe v fe iv species and oh and the oxidation of pyrene thus was attributed to the oxidation by fe vi species in the presence of pmso and tba the results showed that the oxidation of pyrene by fe vi was significantly inhibited in the ph range of 7 0 9 0 and only up to 7 3 of pyrene degraded at ph 8 0 in goethite system with 10 mm tba and 0 05 mm pmso fig 5e indicating that the contribution of fe vi species is negligible compared to fe v fe iv species in pyrene oxidation 3 4 effects of h2o2 and fe iii on degradation of mineral immobilized pyrene h2o2 and fe iii are major stable products in micropollutant oxidation processes by fe vi lee et al 2014 which might affect pyrene oxidation to verify that the effect of freshly prepared h2o2 and fe iii ion on mineral immobilized pyrene degradation by fe vi was examined the removal of pyrene by added fe iii or h2o2 alone was negligible the addition of h2o2 and fe iii caused diverse influences on pyrene degradation by fe vi that depend on the oxidant dosage as well as the support mineral type at ph 8 0 fig 6 for montmorillonite and kaolinite systems the increase of h2o2 dosage 20 μm accelerated pyrene oxidation utmost by 17 however inhibitory effect occurred with higher h2o2 dosage fig 6a in the goethite pyrene system h2o2 application adverse affected pyrene degradation even at a low dosage about 24 reduction in pyrene degradation was observed at exogenous h2o2 dosage of 50 μm exogenous fe iii at a greater dosage than that of h2o2 facilitated pyrene degradation in the montmorillonite and kaolinite systems fig 6b similar to h2o2 fe iii addition did not increase goethite pyrene degradation which was even inhibited at higher fe iii dosage 100 μm the fe vi self decomposition and fe vi oxidation of h2o2 can be catalyzed by fe iii to generate fe iv r1 2 table 1 zhang et al 2021a the formed oxidative fe iv species can be immediately reduced by h2o2 to produce fe ii r3 table 1 which can further be oxidized by fe vi to form fe v r5 table 1 thus the facilitated formation of intermediate oxidative ferrate species fe iv and fe v may explain the enhancing effects of both h2o2 and fe iii on pyrene oxidation by fe vi shao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 however higher h2o2 and fe iii concentrations could lead to competition between h2o2 and pyrene for ferrate species fe vi fe iv and fe v r2 r3 r7 table 1 as a consequence inhibit pyrene oxidation especially for goethite pyrene degradation fig 6 3 5 effect of ions and dissolved organic matter on degradation of mineral immobilized pyrene the ubiquitous cations anions and dissolved organic matter in natural environments are key factors affecting the redox conditions and cannot be ignored in redox reactions thus the influence of ions and dissolved organic matter were investigated different concentrations of nacl 1 100 mm did not significantly alter pyrene degradation fig s9a indicating that the cl and na ions and the ionic strength 1 100 mm had little effect on fe vi oxidation of pyrene two mm of each test cation except for k had adverse effects on mineral immobilized pyrene degradation that depend on cation and mineral types fig 7 ca2 and mg2 had no effect on montmorillonite and kaolinite pyrene degradation but inhibited goethite pyrene degradation cu2 showed the highest inhibition on goethite pyrene degradation and the removal efficiency decreased from 44 8 to 9 7 fig 7a former studies showed enhancing effect of cations on fe vi oxidation of micropollutants due to the formation of highly reactive oxidative ferrate species fe iv fe v zhao et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a zheng et al 2021 the enhanced oxidation was found to be dose dependent with cation fe vi ratios up to 2 0 zhang et al 2021a however the ratio of cation fe vi 2 mm 0 06 mm in this study was markedly high which could increase fe vi decomposition fig s10 feng et al 2016 leading to decreased efficiency of fe vi oxidation of pyrene the presence of minerals might increase metal cation sensitivity and magnify the inhibition effects especially for goethite for the fast fe vi decomposition fig 7a as for anions pyrene degradation on minerals was not significantly affected in most cases especially for the kaolinite system fig 7b no3 and co3 2 addition facilitated montmorillonite and goethite pyrene degradation respectively while cl and po4 3 inhibited goethite pyrene degradation the presence of minerals might cause different response of micropollutants degradation to anions for example co3 2 was found to inhibit 4 tert butylphenol and diclofenac degradation by fe vi zhao et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 but accelerated goethite pyrene degradation humic acid ha caused a decreased in pyrene degradation efficiency in the three mineral systems and the inhibition increased with increasing ha concentration fig 7c when the initial ha concentration was increased to 50 mg l 1 the pyrene degradation was almost totally inhibited in goethite system fig 7c degradation of some micropollutants such as diclofenac bisphenols pmso caffeine and chlorpyrifos by fe vi oxidation was also found to be inhibited by ha due to consumption of fe vi fig s10 zhao et al 2018 liu et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 however some studies demonstrated an accelerated degradation effect of ha by fe vi oxidation as shown for 4 tert butylphenol sulfonamides bromophenols and carbamazepine sun et al 2019a pan et al 2020 tian et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 this effect was explained by cross coupling and electron shuttle reactions zheng et al 2021 ha is abundant in phenolic moieties which are readily oxidized by fe vi to produce benzoquinone like compounds or phenoxy radicals and subsequently cross couple with pollutant molecules thereby enhancing their transformation bialk et al 2005 zheng et al 2021 furthermore the various functional groups of ha or carbonaceous materials may also function as electron mediators to facilitate fe v fe iv formation and improve the removal efficiency of micropollutants pan et al 2020 tian et al 2020 pyrene is a substance of low water solubility and becomes readily immobilized on minerals due to the limited bioavailability cross coupling reactions with ha unlikely occur furthermore oxygen atom transfer reaction mechanism not radical mechanism was mainly involved in the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons by fe vi oxidation sharma 2013 3 6 oxidation products and reaction pathways intermediates of pyrene degradation were identified by lc tof ms ms and the total ion chromatogram fig s11 a total of 10 possible intermediate products were tentatively identified p1 p10 including 4 5 dihydroxy pyrene p1 m z 233 1 1 biphenyl 2 2 diformaldehyde 6 6 dicarboxylic acid p2 m z 297 2 2 6 6 biphenyltetracarboxylic acid p3 m z 329 1 2 3 benzenetricarboxylic acid p4 m z 209 3 4 dihydrophenanthrene 4 carboxylic p5 m z 223 3 4 dihydroxy 3 4 dihydrophenanthrene 4 carboxylic p6 m z 255 2 hydroxy 2h benzo h chromene 2 carboxylate p7 m z 242 3 1 hydroxy 2 naphthalenyl 2 propenal p8 m z 197 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid p9 m z 187 and phthalic acid p10 m z 165 table s1 fig s12 accordingly two possible pathways of fe vi oxidation of pyrene were proposed fig 8 both pathways initiated by ferrate attacking the electron rich pyrene through an oxygen transfer process to form the hydroxylation product p1 the typical hydroxylation reaction was frequently detected in the fe vi degradation of some micropollutants such as phenol compounds chlorpyrifos and sulfachloropyridazine liu et al 2019 li et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 for pathway i the product p1 is further hydroxylated by electrophilic ferrate attack to form r1 hypothetical product and followed by ring cleavage and oxidation reactions to form p2 and p3 with continued ferrate attack p3 was oxidized through hydroxylation ring cleavage chain bond cleavage and carboxylation to produce p4 finally phthalic acid p10 was formed by decarboxylation of p4 another pathway starts with aromatic ring opening of p1 and subsequently oxidation and decarboxylation to produce p5 the p6 was formed by transferring two o atoms to c3 and c4 sites of aromatic ring of p5 after a series of steps of hydroxylation decarboxylation and carboxylation the p7 is formed this product is also found in phenanthrene biodegradation pathway ban et al 2016 then the p8 is formed after decarboxylation of p7 the olefinic double bond of p8 is found active for fe vi oxidation islam et al 2018 and the cleavage of olefinic double bonds results in the formation of p9 after further o atoms transfer ring cleavage and carboxylation phthalic acid is also formed through pathway ii in short four main reaction processes including hydroxylation reaction o atom transfer aromatic ring opening decarboxylation and chain breaking reactions are involved in the fe vi oxidation of pyrene the abovementioned two degradation pathways were also observed in other studies focused on the abiotic and microbial degradation of pyrene gupta and gupta 2015 sun et al 2019b supporting our findings on the diverse degradation mechanisms of pyrene by ferrate oxidation 3 7 possible mechanisms of minerals as catalysts on pyrene oxidation by fe vi different minerals resulted in different enhancement of pyrene degradation by fe vi goethite catalyzed the fastest decomposition of fe vi but montmorillonite yielded the most efficient pyrene degradation figs 1 3 similar with most metal oxo species fe vi shows enhanced oxidizing power upon protonation ho and lau 2000 kim et al 2015 thus activation of ferrate species upon protonation does explain the strong catalytic activity under acidic conditions ho and lau 2000 kim et al 2015 montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite have zero point of charge at ph 2 5 ph 3 6 and ph 8 3 respectively cai et al 2006 this means montmorillonite and kaolinite are deprotonated under our experimental conditions ph 7 0 9 0 while goethite is protonated at ph 7 0 8 0 thus the extent of protonation might be one of the reasons that goethite catalyzes a faster pyrene degradation by fe vi than montmorillonite and kaolinite like protons transition metal ions may act as lewis acids that can bind to ferrate and activate its oxidation capacity corma and garcía 2002 mechanistically an oxygen of the ferrate ion coordinates to the metal ion to form a metal ferrate adduct similar to ferrate proton adduct eq 8 8 fe o 4 2 m n o 3 fe o m n 2 the metal ion causes withdrawal of electron density from the oxygen ligand increasing the oxidation efficiency of the oxo iron species which is one of the reasons that some transition metal ions enhance the degradation of micropollutants by ferrate zhao et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a this could be confirmed by our results that lower concentrations of additional fe3 facilitated pyrene degradation in montmorillonite and kaolinite systems fig 6b the reactivity and stability of metal ferrate adducts would ultimately determine the degradation rate and efficiency high concentration of metal ions could induce quick fe vi decomposition fig s10a when fe vi decomposition is stronger than the oxidation reaction with pyrene it will result in lower oxidation capacity of pyrene due to the quick loss of ferrate species through decomposition this also can be confirmed by the inhibition of pyrene oxidation in the presence of higher concentrations of metal ions e g 2 mm cu2 fe3 and zn2 attributed to the instability of excessive metal ferrate adducts corma and garcía 2002 montmorillonite as a 2 1 type dioctahedral smectite is a typical solid lewis acid that contains exchangeable metal ions in its interlayer which are considered responsible for the oxidation of adsorbed pah compounds corma and garcía 2002 the presence of lewis acid sites on montmorillonite are proved by the ftir spectra of pyridine adsorption peaks fig s13a when fe vi ions bind to lewis acid sites on montmorillonite lewis acid fe vi adducts with enhanced electrophilicity are formed fig 9 a these adducts withdraw electron density from pyrene or its intermediates to form highly reactive and short lived organic radical cations corma and garcía 2002 the resulting organic radical cations subsequently react with oxygen produced by breakdown of the oxo ferrate species forming finally oxygenated products concomitantly with fe iii formation from fe vi reduction montmorillonite associated ferrate has been demonstrated for the efficient oxidation of alcohols thiophenol benzylamine and aniline corma and garcía 2002 to verify that a lewis base orthophosphate po4 3 20 mm was added to screening lewis acid sites on montmorillonite before initiating the reaction at ph 7 0 the results showed that 13 9 and 7 3 reduction in pyrene degradation in montmorillonite and kaolinite system fig s9b respectively the higher reduction in pyrene degradation in montmorillonite might be attributed to the sequestration of lewis acid sites different from montmorillonite kaolinite is considered as a relatively mild lewis base due to its abundant hydroxyl edge surface functional groups puls and bohn 1988 thus lewis acid ferrate adducts of kaolinite will not be formed as a result the degradation efficiency and degradation rate of pyrene adsorbed on kaolinite was lower than that of montmorillonite and goethite figs 1 3 however kaolinite with large surface area and active hydroxyl groups is still superior in pyrene degradation compared to the treatment without minerals fig 4a goethite has surface functional groups including fe o fe oh and fe o fe liu et al 2014 the fe atoms as lewis acids share an electron pair with the surface hydroxyl groups making goethite an excellent catalyst ghose et al 2010 liu et al 2014 the oxidation of goethite pyrene by fe vi follows the mars and van krevelen mechanism that provides a catalytic center corma and garcía 2002 an inorganic oxide molecular cluster of a lewis acid site fe3 atom in goethite a lewis base site surface hydroxyl group and a metal redox center feo4 2 during the catalytic process fig 9c three primary steps are included in the oxidation process i substrate activation on a metallic cation ii oxygen insertion and iii a redox process and the transfer of electrons at the metallic site in the first step the aromatic substrate is activated by cation π interaction with the lewis acidic fe atom on the ferrate surface the aromatic substrate then undergoes hydrogen abstraction oxygen insertion and carbon bond cleavage compared to montmorillonite goethite has more metal exposure sites due to more oxygen vacancies ni et al 2021 rendering goethite more active for oxidation reactions however goethite might also accelerate the decomposition of the oxidative ferrate adduct species fe vi fe v fe iv other than promote the oxidation of pyrene due to protonation at ph 8 3 cai et al 2006 the fe vi decay in the presence of goethite 28 6 mm 1 min 1 was far faster than in the presence of montmorillonite k 1 13 mm 1 min 1 and kaolinite k 1 02 mm 1 min 1 fig s3d at ph 7 0 too rapid decomposition of ferrate species fe vi fe v fe iv in goethite system can lead to the competition between the ferrate self decomposition and the reaction with pyrene when the self decomposition 28 6 mm 1 min 1 is stronger than the reaction with pyrene 2 65 mm 1 min 1 at ph 7 0 table 2 the resulted non effective loss of ferrate species will decrease the oxidation capacity of pyrene 4 conclusion our study demonstrated efficient fe vi oxidation of pyrene immobilized on minerals at ph 7 0 9 0 different minerals favored different ph optima from neutral to alkaline conditions following the order of montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite for pyrene degradation protonation and mineral surface functional groups play important roles in the fe vi oxidation of pyrene the fast decomposition of ferrate species catalyzed by goethite is unfavorable for pyrene degradation fe vi oxidation of pyrene was mostly ascribed to its oxidative intermediates fe v fe iv species high contents of cations and dissolved humic acid as they may occurred in the environment had adverse effects on pyrene degradation this study provides valuable

16018,ferrate fe vi salts like k2feo4 are efficient green oxidants to remediate organic contaminants in water treatment minerals are efficient sorbents of contaminants and also excellent solid heterogeneous catalysts which might affect fe vi remediation processes by targeting the typical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compound pyrene the application of fe vi for oxidation of pyrene immobilized on three minerals i e montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite was studied for the first time pyrene immobilized on the three minerals was efficiently oxidized by fe vi with 87 99 of pyrene 10 μm being degraded at ph 9 0 in the presence of a 50 fold molar excess fe vi different minerals favored different ph optima for pyrene degradation with ph optima from neutral to alkaline following the order of montmorillonite ph 7 0 kaolinite ph 8 0 and goethite ph 9 0 although goethite revealed the highest catalytic activity on pyrene degradation by fe vi the greater noneffective loss of the oxidative species by ready self decay in the goethite system resulted in lower degradation efficiency compared to montmorillonite protonation and lewis acid on montmorillonite and goethite assisted fe vi oxidation of pyrene the intermediate ferrate species fe v fe iv were the dominant oxidative species accountable for pyrene oxidation while the contribution of fe vi species was negligible hydroxyl radical was involved in mineral immobilized pyrene degradation and contributed to 11 5 27 4 of the pyrene degradation in montmorillonite system followed by kaolinite 10 8 21 4 and goethite 5 1 12 2 according to the hydroxyl radical quenching experiments cations abundant in the matrix and dissolved humic acid hampered pyrene degradation finally two different degradation pathways both producing phthalic acid were identified this study demonstrates efficient fe vi oxidation of pyrene immobilized on minerals and contributes to the development of efficient environmentally friendly fe vi based remediation techniques graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon advanced oxidation reaction kinetics intermediate iron species hydroxyl radical degradation pathway 1 introduction remediation of organic pollutants is an urgent environmental issue and has attracted a lot of attention due to the widespread organic pollution and the severe environmental health risks in the past few decades megharaj et al 2011 pariatamby and kee 2016 numerous investigations have been performed to explore efficient and cost effective techniques including chemical oxidation and bioremediation for removal of organic pollutants anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 megharaj et al 2011 bajagain et al 2020 liu et al 2020 among them chemical oxidation is a popular method for the rapid and efficient mitigation of organic contaminants and controlling their toxicity anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 bajagain et al 2020 conventional oxidants including permanganate bajagain et al 2020 activated persulfate zhou et al 2019 and fenton or fenton like processes catalyzed by hydrogen peroxide iron compounds anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 thomas et al 2021 have been well investigated and are frequently applied to soil and water remediation however some of these oxidants might cause secondary pollution mno2 so4 2 due to excessive application also if reactions have to be carried under acidic conditions ph 5 for efficient removal of organic pollutants this might lower the water and soil sediment quality zhou et al 2019 new environmentally friendly and efficient oxidants are therefore needed for pollutant remediation ferrate vi is a multi functional oxidant working in many processes such as oxidation adsorption sedimentation coagulation decolorization deodorization and disinfection therefore ferrate vi is considered as a promising green oxidant in water treatment producing nontoxic fe iii species sharma et al 2013 2015 rai et al 2018 wang et al 2020 as a disinfectant ferrate vi can inactivate bacteria viruses biofilms and remove antibiotic resistance genes by membrane destruction dna damage and coagulation yan et al 2020 wu et al 2021 moreover ferrate vi has also been reported to be fairly effective in heavy metal removal by oxidation and mineral incorporation prucek et al 2015 and degradation of numerous electron rich organic pollutants including organosulfur compounds amines phenols pesticides hydrocarbons and pharmaceuticals sharma et al 2013 2015 2016 rai et al 2018 luo et al 2021 the mechanisms of ferrate vi oxidation of organic pollutants are based on the chemical structures of pollutants and the specific reaction types taking place for example the oxidation of β lactam containing antibiotics was most likely attributed to the attack of thioether moieties by ferrate vi which resulted in sulfoxide derivatives sharma et al 2016 compared with other oxidants ferrate vi has a relatively high redox potential of 2 2 v in acidic solutions but decreases to 0 7 v under alkaline conditions sharma 2013 due to a high rate of ferrate vi self decomposition in acidic condition the ferrate vi oxidation of organic contaminants is commonly done under neutral and alkaline conditions sharma et al 2013 2015 although the redox potential can decrease to a relatively low level in alkaline condition the involved more active fe v fe iv species produced from ferrate vi decomposition could enhance the ferrate vi oxidation process the activation of ferrate vi namely the formation of fe v fe iv species at high concentrations at short time scales from ferrate vi decomposition can be achieved by acid addition metal ion activation reducing agents and carbonaceous surfaces sharma et al 2022 introduction of these activating agents thus could improve the oxidation efficiency of pollutants by ferrate vi oxidation process due to the generation of high concentrations of more active fe v fe iv species in a short period under alkaline condition sharma et al 2022 generally ferrate vi as oxidant is mostly used in water treatment only few studies had focused on its application in matrices such as sediment and underground water and soil remediation matrices such as groundwater and sediments are heterogeneous complex mediums containing organic matter minerals metallic oxides and ions which are important factors affecting ferrate vi oxidation of organic pollutants the degradation efficiency might significantly decrease in these complex matrixes compared to that in simple water medium several studies had focused on ferrate vi based remediation of organic contaminants in complex soil matrix and the results showed an improved remediation effect by ferrate vi over some conventional oxidants monfort et al 2019 2020 he et al 2021 for example monfort et al found that ferrate vi oxidant was more efficient than some conventional oxidants such as activated persulfate peroxymonosulfate and hydrogen peroxide in pcbs removal with degradation efficiency of 30 by ferrate vi versus 2 12 by the conventional oxidants monfort et al 2019 combined fe vi peroxymonosulfate oxidation systems could significantly improve the removal efficiency of pcbs and o dichlorobenzene monfort et al 2019 he et al 2021 these findings suggested that ferrate vi oxidation might serve as an efficient green chemical method for water and soil sediment remediation definitely more studies upon fe vi based remediation of organic pollutants should be carried out to extend its application in more complex matrices as persistent organic contaminants consisting of two or more fused aromatic rings polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are widely distributed in the environment exerting endocrine disruption mutagenic and carcinogenic effects alegbeleye et al 2017 due to the low water solubility pah compounds especially the high molecular weight pahs are readily sorbed immobilized on mineral organic solid particles in soil and aquatic environment resulting in high concentration of pahs in sediment soil other than in water quantin et al 2005 ferrarese et al 2008 the sediment soil thus become the sink and source of pah pollutants several studies reported that ferrate vi was efficient for pahs removal in polluted waters antošová et al 2020 haneef et al 2020 johansson et al 2020 however the degradation processes and oxidation mechanisms have not yet been elucidated furthermore the removal of pahs immobilized on in complex matrices such as minerals organic matter in sediments has not yet been investigated clays and oxide minerals are indispensable components of sediments and also excellent adsorbents of organic pollutants when they enter into the aquatic environment awad et al 2019 lin et al 2021 minerals can also function as heterogeneous catalysts mediating fenton like processes taking place over a broad range of ph garrido ramírez et al 2010 tong et al 2020 and have the potential to activate persulfate oxidation zhou et al 2019 as a result minerals are beneficial for removal of organic pollutants by advanced oxidation however whether minerals can mediate pahs degradation by ferrate vi oxidation has not yet been verified therefore this study is designed to explore the role of minerals in pahs degradation by ferrate vi oxidation to carry out the experiments pyrene a four ring compound was selected as a model pah pyrene is one of the most abundant high molecular weight pahs in the environment samanta et al 2002 and has unique photo chemical properties figueira duarte and mullen 2011 making it a relatively highly active pah compound in redox reactions in the environment three typical minerals that widely exist in sediments soils i e montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite were used as solid matrix for pyrene immobilization the objectives of the present study were 1 to determine the degradation efficiency of pyrene immobilized on different minerals by ferrate vi oxidation 2 to reveal the function of oxidative species and the degradation processes 3 to investigate the roles of different minerals as well as ions and types of organic matter on pyrene removal and 4 to elucidate the transformation pathways of pyrene oxidation by ferrate vi our study aims to provide more fundamental information on pahs degradation by ferrate vi on mineral surface and benefit efforts towards the development of ferrate vi based advanced oxidation technology for green pollution remediation in soil and aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the used chemicals and reagents are analytical grade or better and details are provided in text s1 in supplementary materials three typical minerals namely kaolinite montmorillonite and goethite were used considering their wide presence in environment ferrate vi solution was freshly prepared by dissolving k2feo4 powder in borate buffer 20 mm ph 7 0 9 0 the prepared newly fe vi solution was immediately used to utmost exclude the influence of fe vi loss before initiation of the reaction 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 immobilization of pyrene on minerals and characterization the total amount of pahs in polluted sediment could reach several thousand of micrograms per gram sediment and pyrene alone sorbed on fine clay silt particles 50 μm could reach 161 μg g 1 quantin et al 2005 ferrarese et al 2008 to simulate the oxidation of pahs in sediments soil environments where pahs are mainly bound to fine clay silt particles quantin et al 2005 ferrarese et al 2008 the target contaminant pyrene was immobilized on minerals before the oxidation experiment to make 100 μg g 1 mineral immobilized pyrene 10 g of each mineral montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite sieved through 200 mesh sieve was homogeneously mixed with 10 ml pyrene solution 100 mg l 1 dissolved in acetone in a glass beaker after completely evaporating acetone in a fuming cupboard the pyrene contaminated minerals 100 μg g 1 were obtained and stored in brown glass bottles the concentrations of pyrene immobilized on three minerals were detected to be 112 7 109 4 and 101 1 μg g 1 in average for montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite respectively n2 adsorption isotherms at 77 k quantachrome instruments united states was used to estimate specific surface areas and pore volume infrared spectroscopy ir nicolet 5700 thermo fisher scientific united states was conducted to identify changes of surface functional groups after pyrene immobilization on minerals the results are shown in supplementary materials fig s1 the changes of specific surface area and the surface functional groups of minerals inferred by n2 adsorption and ir spectrum indicated the sorption immobilization of pyrene on minerals fig s1 jia et al 2018 2 2 2 degradation experiments the oxidation experiments were conducted in neutral to alkaline conditions ph 7 0 9 0 as many studies carried out in fe vi oxidation experiments shao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 these settings considered the stability of fe vi in alkaline solution and the conditions of contaminated water sediments widely found in alkaline aquatic environments such as the ph within the range of 7 7 8 02 in previous studies quantin et al 2005 ferrarese et al 2008 the oxidation experiments were carried out in 50 ml glass centrifuge tubes the k2feo4 solutions 0 06 1 0 mm were freshly prepared in borate buffer 20 mm adjusted to the desired ph values within 0 1 ph 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 to initiate the reaction 20 ml newly prepared k2feo4 solution was immediately added into the tubes containing 0 4 g pyrene contaminated mineral then the reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature 20 2 c under continuous stirring at 160 r min the solid solution ratio was 1 50 the initial pyrene concentration was equivalent to 10 μm 2 mg l 1 at defined time intervals 0 5 ml reaction mixtures were sampled out and added into excess hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution to stop the reaction and the residual pyrene was measured after solvent extraction h2o2 and fe iii were reported to be involved in fe vi degradation system lee et al 2014 shao et al 2019 therefore to explore their influence on pyrene degradation exogenous h2o2 0 50 μm or fe iii 0 500 μm were applied to the pyrene minerals before initiating the reaction by addition of fe vi solution the ubiquitous cations anions and dissolved organic matter in natural environments may influence the removal of organic pollutants experiments were carried out to examine possible influences of cations nh4 k ca2 cu2 mg2 zn2 and fe3 anions no3 cl co3 2 so4 2 and po4 3 and dissolved humic acid ha on the degradation of mineral immobilized pyrene by fe vi in alkaline condition ph 8 0 the cationic chloride salts anionic sodium salts and humic substances ha were individually added into the reaction mixtures before initiating the oxidation reaction considering the environmental contents of ions and ha the final equivalent concentration of 2 mm for salts and 1 50 mg l 1 for ha were adopted tert butyl alcohol tba and methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso added at various concentrations were used to examine the possible role of formed hydroxyl radical oh and ferrate species fe v fe iv on pyrene degradation on minerals due to their fast quenching reactions with oh and fe v fe iv respectively shao et al 2019 all experiments were done in two or three replicates 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 detection of residual pyrene the residual pyrene on mineral in the mixture 0 5 ml was extracted by mixed solvent acetone dichloromethane v v 1 1 10 ml under sonication for 30 min after filtration through 0 22 μm specific nylon membrane syringe filter the pyrene in extracts was detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent 1260 usa following the method in a previous study wang et al 2022 the details are described in text s2 to guarantee the analytical quality the standard pyrene solution 10 mg l 1 was introduced into the minerals pyrene extraction and detection was done following the same procedure the recoveries were from 93 2 to 98 1 which is satisfactory for analysis requirements 2 3 2 determination of transformation products the transformation products of pyrene were extracted by acetonitrile and identified by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight premier mass spectrometer lc qtof ms ms x500r lc qtof ab sciex usa following the program described in text s2 according to a previous study chu et al 2020 the ab sciex os software version 1 4 was applied to analyze the ms data 2 3 3 determination of fe vi the fe vi concentration in stock solution was directly detected using a uv visible spectrophotometer at 510 nm wavelength ε 1150 m 1 cm 1 lee et al 2014 shao et al 2019 the residual fe vi in reaction mixtures was estimated by the abts method huang et al 2018 abts can react with fe vi fe v and fe iv species via one electron transfer process however fe v and fe iv species are unstable and the half lives are 1 ms resulting in low concentrations of fe v and fe iv species in aqueous solution melton and bielski 1990 rush and bielski 1994 this makes it difficult to determine fe v and fe iv species directly using abts zhang et al 2021a thus abts in this study is reported only for fe vi determination briefly 0 5 ml sample mixtures were added into 1 ml 10 mm abts to quench the reaction and form colored abts after centrifugation the abts in supernatant was determined by colorimetric method at 415 nm with molar absorbance of 34 000 m 1 cm 1 then the fe vi concentration was calculated by dividing the coefficient from abts concentration based on the stoichiometric ratio of abts to fe vi which was approximately 1 90 at ph 7 0 and 8 0 huang et al 2018 and 1 64 at ph 9 0 in 20 mm borate buffer reaction system fig s2 2 3 4 determination of h2o2 and fe ii the accumulated h2o2 in degradation system was quantified by horseradish peroxidase method catalyzing the oxidation of abts by h2o2 lee et al 2014 any produced fe ii was detected by adding 1 0 mm bipyridine bpy into the degradation system before and after the oxidation reaction 2 h after fe vi addition and the red colored fe ii bpy complex was determined by colorimetry at 522 nm ε 8650 m 1 cm 1 shao et al 2019 2 3 5 electron paramagnetic resonance analysis free radicals such as hydroxyl radical from mineral fe vi system were investigated using electron paramagnetic resonance epr dimethylpyridine oxide dmpo was used as the radical spin trapping compound the analysis procedure was as follows each mineral 0 04 g was mixed with 2 ml 1 0 mm fe vi solution in borate buffer ph 8 0 and then dmpo final concentration 100 mm was applied to trap the free radicals epr analysis was conducted by a bruker emx plus spectrometer karlsruhe germany following the procedure described previously wang et al 2021a 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation efficiency of mineral immobilized pyrene efficient degradation of mineral immobilized pyrene by fe vi oxidation was observed after 2 h reaction at ph 7 0 9 0 fig 1 increase of oxidant dosage accelerated pyrene degradation for example when initial fe vi concentration increased from 0 06 mm to 1 0 mm at ph 9 0 fe vi pyrene molar ratio from 6 1 to 100 1 the degradation efficiency of pyrene 10 μm immobilized on three minerals increased from 33 2 to 98 9 for montmorillonite from 29 9 to 92 2 for kaolinite and from 37 7 to 94 5 for goethite respectively montmorillonite system showed higher degradation efficiency than kaolinite and goethite system under the same condition at ph 7 0 and 8 0 the montmorillonite pyrene was almost completely degraded 98 at 0 50 mm fe vi dosage fig 1a increase of solution reaction ph resulted in varied response of pyrene degradation on different minerals fig 1 as the reaction ph increased from 7 0 to 9 0 the degradation efficiency decreased for montmorillonite but increased for goethite system fig 1a c in the case of kaolinite system the best degradation performance with increasing ph was fe vi dosage dependent and alkaline condition was conducive to pyrene degradation fig 1b these results indicated that fe vi oxidation of pyrene immobilized on minerals was affected by oxidant dosage reaction ph and mineral type 3 2 degradation kinetics of mineral immobilized pyrene mineral immobilized pyrene degraded rapidly in the first 10 min with fe vi decomposition especially for goethite fig 2 as reaction period increased the decrease of pyrene and fe vi concentration became slower while the oxidation mostly completed in 1 h as the residual concentration of pyrene remained almost unchanged fig 3 d f it was generally reported that the fe vi oxidation of an organic contaminant followed second order kinetics sharma et al 2016 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 li et al 2021 the calculation of apparent second order rate constants k is as described in eqs 1 and 2 1 d pyrene d t k fe vi pyrene 2 k ln pyrene pyrene 0 0 t fe vi d t where pyrene and fe vi are the concentrations of pyrene and fe vi at time t respectively and the term 0 t fe vi d t is the time dependent fe vi exposure namely the integrated fe vi concentration with time zhu et al 2020 the degradation of pyrene immobilized on minerals at different fe vi dosages and reaction ph did not fit into the second order kinetic model fig 3a f the plots of ln pyrene pyrene 0 against fe vi exposure at varied initial fe vi dosages did not coincide as the reaction time prolonged these plots departed from linearity and the trend was more obvious at higher fe vi 0 and reaction ph fig 3a f especially for reaction in kaolinite and goethite systems one possible explanation is that fe vi is not stable in solution and could self decompose following second order kinetics table 1 lee et al 2014 and the presence of minerals could accelerate fe vi self decomposition eqs 3 and 4 fig s3 3 d fe vi d t k fe vi 2 4 1 f e v i k t 1 f e v i 0 this means that fe vi concentration at time t depends on not only the reaction with pyrene but also the fe vi self decomposition especially in the later reaction period where the fe vi self decay might occupy the major fe vi loss thus if the fe vi decomposes more fe vi exposure is needed to obtain a fixed pyrene degradation which leads to the down deviation of linear relationships between ln pyrene pyrene 0 and fe vi exposure fig 3a f in mineral pyrene degradation systems the loss of fe vi also obeyed second order kinetics at ph 7 0 8 0 figs s4 and s5 considering the two paths of fe vi loss a third order kinetics was employed to model the pyrene degradation with reaction time as described in eqs 5 7 the third order reaction kinetics also can be found in manganese oxide and fenton catalyzed organic pollutant degradation kuan et al 2013 zhou et al 2020 5 d pyrene d t k fe vi 2 pyrene 6 d pyrene fe vi 2 pyrene k d t the integrated form is 7 1 a 2 b 2 2 x 2 b a a a 2 x l n b a 2 x a b x k t where a and b are initial fe vi 0 and pyrene 0 concentration respectively x is the concentration of degraded pyrene pyrene 0 pyrene t at time t the third order degradation kinetics could be considered as combination of a second order kinetics for fe vi decomposition and a first order kinetics for pyrene degradation the coefficients of determination r2 of third order degradation kinetics were almost higher than 0 99 at ph 7 0 8 0 fig 3g l suggesting that the fe vi oxidation of mineral immobilized pyrene apparently follows more the third order kinetics than the second order kinetics at ph 7 0 8 0 fig 3 table 2 however at ph 9 0 none of second and third order kinetics described the reaction accurately luo et al found the self decomposition of fe vi obeys first order kinetics unimolecular decomposition at ph 9 0 which is different from the decay of protonated fe vi species that follow second order kinetics at lower ph luo et al 2020 this might lead to the different degradation kinetics of pyrene at ph 9 0 from those at ph 7 0 8 0 to verify this we determined fe vi oxidation of pyrene in water solution without the presence of minerals at ph 9 0 and found that both pyrene degradation and fe vi decomposition followed pseudo first order kinetics fig 4 c originally pyrene degradation in water solution at ph 9 0 without the presence of minerals also followed second order kinetics while the fe vi concentration is far higher than pyrene concentration 10 folds and the decay of fe vi is slow at ph 9 0 the pyrene degradation rate is faster or comparative to fe vi decomposition which makes the change of fe vi concentration negligible compared to the change of pyrene concentration therefore the degradation of pyrene in water without minerals follows pseudo first order kinetics as well as the fe vi decomposition does however in the presence of minerals pyrene degradation without pre immobilization showed different kinetics from those of pyrene immobilized on minerals for example pyrene degradation followed first order kinetics in the presence of montmorillonite and kaolinite while it followed second order kinetics in the presence of goethite fig 4c d these were different from the trends observed in the degradation of pyrene immobilized on minerals which none of first second or third order kinetics satisfactorily fitted furthermore the pyrene degradation rate without minerals was apparently lower than that in the presence of minerals fig 4c d these results suggested that minerals could act as solid catalysts for efficient fe vi oxidation of pyrene and also alter the degradation kinetics among the three minerals the oxidation rate constant of pyrene on goethite was at least one order of magnitude greater than on montmorillonite and kaolinite for example at ph 8 0 and fe vi dosage of 0 50 mm the apparent reaction rate k 3rd for the goethite system 7 39 mm 2 min 1 was 18 5 and 15 1 fold the values of the montmorillonite 0 40 mm 2 min 1 and kaolinite 0 49 mm 2 min 1 systems table 2 respectively the fast degradation of pyrene on goethite is probably because of the enhancement of fe vi decomposition that produces more oxidative reactive ferrate species fe v and fe iv r1 table 1 however goethite might also accelerate the decay of the oxidative ferrate species fe vi fe v and fe iv other than promote their oxidation capacity resulting in reduction of ferrate exposure in the goethite system and finally leading to lower degradation efficiency compared to the montmorillonite system fig 1a c increase of reaction ph could significantly improve fe vi oxidation efficiency of pyrene in goethite system due to the slower fe vi decomposition under such conditions figs 1c and 2c 3 3 dominant oxidant in the ferrate mineral system for pyrene degradation fe vi decomposition in aqueous solutions generates fe v fe iv fe iii fe ii and h2o2 table 1 lee et al 2014 h2o2 formation with reaction time during the degradation of mineral immobilized pyrene 21 μm at ph 8 0 was detected the results indicated that the h2o2 production 10 7 μm reached the highest within 10 min fig s6 fe vi dosage influenced the h2o2 formation increase of oxidant dosage resulted in increase at first and then decrease in h2o2 production with greatest h2o2 content observed at 0 12 mm initial fe vi dosage fig 5 a the h2o2 yield h2o2 fe vi 0 100 decreased with increasing fe vi dosage and varied among the mineral treatments fig 5a indicating the h2o2 yield closely depended on fe vi dosage and the support mineral lee et al 2014 fe ii was not detected in the minerals system without fe vi addition with fe vi involved in the mineral systems the bipyridine bpy was added before the fe vi addition to trap fe ii formed during the complete reaction period the formation of fe ii 1 90 5 82 μm was confirmed by the appearance of red colored fe ii bpy complex when bpy was added before initiation of the reaction while hardly any fe ii was detected when bpy was added after the oxidation reaction completed figs 5b and s7 this suggested that fe ii is an intermediate produced from fe vi reduction in pyrene oxidation process similar to the formation of h2o2 more fe ii was produced in the montmorillonite system 5 82 μm than in kaolinite 2 67 μm and goethite 1 90 μm systems fig 5b considering the coexistence of h2o2 and fe ii fe iii in the reaction system oh radicals might contribute to the organic contaminant oxidation zhu et al 2020 the epr analysis confirmed the production of oh with an especially high concentration of oh in the montmorillonite system fig 5d unlike in the goethite and kaolinite systems where weak oh signal was observed fig 5d to further confirm the role of oh we performed the quenching experiment with the alcohol scavenger tba the oh oxidizes tba and pyrene with a second order rate constant of 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 5 0 6 1010 m 1 s 1 lindsey and tarr 2000 shao et al 2019 respectively the 0 1 mm tba significantly inhibit pyrene degradation increase of tba concentration to 10 mm the pyrene degradation was not affected greatly compared to the degradation at 0 1 mm tba fig s8c the oxidation of pyrene by oh should be totally inhibited by 10 mm of tba k oh pyrene pyrene k oh tba tba 1 975 at this tba concentration the fe vi decomposition is not significantly affected fig s8a tba addition 10 mm caused 11 5 27 4 10 8 21 4 and 5 1 12 4 reduction in pyrene removal for montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite systems respectively fig 5e indicating that the oh plays a role in fe vi mineral systems for pyrene degradation and the contribution of oh depends on the mineral type the montmorillonite system showed a higher contribution of oh oxidation than the kaolinite and goethite systems which might be attributed to the higher yield of h2o2 and fe ii and corresponding greater oh production with this mineral fig 5a d fe v and fe iv have strong oxidation activities but exist only for short times and are difficult to detect directly lee et al 2014 as the produced fe iv can oxidize micropollutants through a two electron transfer approach accompanied with fe iv reduction to fe ii shao et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the existence of fe iv in pyrene degrading process can be proved by the appearance of fe ii previous studies reported that fe iv react with h2o2 producing negligible fe ii during the fe vi self decomposition process zhu et al 2020 thus the produced fe ii abovementioned indicated fe iv involvement in the fe vi mineral pyrene oxidation processes fig s7 similarly fe ii production and the oxidative role of fe iv were proved in the degradation of contaminants such as methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso carbamazepine and caffeine shao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 the produced fe ii was quickly oxidized by fe vi to form fe v r5 table 1 indicating that fe v is indispensable in pyrene oxidation this could be corroborated by the inhibition of pyrene degradation when bpy was added to prevent fe v species formation in montmorillonite and kaolinite systems fig 5c the strong inhibition of bpy on pyrene degradation in montmorillonite system indicates fe v species was the dominant oxidative species while low inhibition or even enhancement effect of bpy on pyrene degradation in kaolinite and goethite systems suggests fe iv but not fe v was the dominant oxidative species in these two mineral systems sulfoxide pmso is known to be readily oxidized by fe v fe iv but not by fe vi to produce methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 which is different from the oxidation pathway by hydroxyl radical zhu et al 2020 huang et al 2021 pmso can also quench oh at a high rate constant of 3 61 109 m 1s 1 wang et al 2018 the formation of pmso2 and the stoichiometry of δpmso δpmso2 was almost 1 indicating that ferrate species not radicals dominate the reaction in the fe vi mineral systems huang et al 2021 the rate constant of fe vi species with pmso is about 30 m 1 s 1 which is far slower than that of fe v with pmso k 1 52 107 m 1 s 1 ph 7 0 huang et al 2021 and fe iv with pmso k 2 58 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 0 in borate buffer zhu et al 2020 fe v species could contribute up to 99 to ferrate oxidation of pmso in borate buffer huang et al 2021 high concentrations of pmso could consume fe vi though the reaction is relatively slow fig s8b however our results showed that a low concentration of pmso 0 08 mm could almost completely inhibit pyrene degradation in montmorillonite and kaolinite system and less than 10 pyrene degradation was observed in goethite system at ph of 7 0 and 8 0 conditions furthermore the pyrene degradation was very low 12 7 even at a smaller concentration of pmso 0 05 mm since fe vi oxidation of pmso is slow the competition between pmso and pyrene for fe v fe iv species possibly contributes to the inhibitory effect of pmso on pyrene oxidation suggesting fe v fe iv species are the dominant active oxidative species in pyrene degradation by fe vi it is reported that the higher fe vi dosage the greater the contribution of fe v fe iv in micropollutant removal zhu et al 2020 huang et al 2021 to clarify the contribution of fe vi pmso and tba were co added to consume the fe v fe iv species and oh and the oxidation of pyrene thus was attributed to the oxidation by fe vi species in the presence of pmso and tba the results showed that the oxidation of pyrene by fe vi was significantly inhibited in the ph range of 7 0 9 0 and only up to 7 3 of pyrene degraded at ph 8 0 in goethite system with 10 mm tba and 0 05 mm pmso fig 5e indicating that the contribution of fe vi species is negligible compared to fe v fe iv species in pyrene oxidation 3 4 effects of h2o2 and fe iii on degradation of mineral immobilized pyrene h2o2 and fe iii are major stable products in micropollutant oxidation processes by fe vi lee et al 2014 which might affect pyrene oxidation to verify that the effect of freshly prepared h2o2 and fe iii ion on mineral immobilized pyrene degradation by fe vi was examined the removal of pyrene by added fe iii or h2o2 alone was negligible the addition of h2o2 and fe iii caused diverse influences on pyrene degradation by fe vi that depend on the oxidant dosage as well as the support mineral type at ph 8 0 fig 6 for montmorillonite and kaolinite systems the increase of h2o2 dosage 20 μm accelerated pyrene oxidation utmost by 17 however inhibitory effect occurred with higher h2o2 dosage fig 6a in the goethite pyrene system h2o2 application adverse affected pyrene degradation even at a low dosage about 24 reduction in pyrene degradation was observed at exogenous h2o2 dosage of 50 μm exogenous fe iii at a greater dosage than that of h2o2 facilitated pyrene degradation in the montmorillonite and kaolinite systems fig 6b similar to h2o2 fe iii addition did not increase goethite pyrene degradation which was even inhibited at higher fe iii dosage 100 μm the fe vi self decomposition and fe vi oxidation of h2o2 can be catalyzed by fe iii to generate fe iv r1 2 table 1 zhang et al 2021a the formed oxidative fe iv species can be immediately reduced by h2o2 to produce fe ii r3 table 1 which can further be oxidized by fe vi to form fe v r5 table 1 thus the facilitated formation of intermediate oxidative ferrate species fe iv and fe v may explain the enhancing effects of both h2o2 and fe iii on pyrene oxidation by fe vi shao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 however higher h2o2 and fe iii concentrations could lead to competition between h2o2 and pyrene for ferrate species fe vi fe iv and fe v r2 r3 r7 table 1 as a consequence inhibit pyrene oxidation especially for goethite pyrene degradation fig 6 3 5 effect of ions and dissolved organic matter on degradation of mineral immobilized pyrene the ubiquitous cations anions and dissolved organic matter in natural environments are key factors affecting the redox conditions and cannot be ignored in redox reactions thus the influence of ions and dissolved organic matter were investigated different concentrations of nacl 1 100 mm did not significantly alter pyrene degradation fig s9a indicating that the cl and na ions and the ionic strength 1 100 mm had little effect on fe vi oxidation of pyrene two mm of each test cation except for k had adverse effects on mineral immobilized pyrene degradation that depend on cation and mineral types fig 7 ca2 and mg2 had no effect on montmorillonite and kaolinite pyrene degradation but inhibited goethite pyrene degradation cu2 showed the highest inhibition on goethite pyrene degradation and the removal efficiency decreased from 44 8 to 9 7 fig 7a former studies showed enhancing effect of cations on fe vi oxidation of micropollutants due to the formation of highly reactive oxidative ferrate species fe iv fe v zhao et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a zheng et al 2021 the enhanced oxidation was found to be dose dependent with cation fe vi ratios up to 2 0 zhang et al 2021a however the ratio of cation fe vi 2 mm 0 06 mm in this study was markedly high which could increase fe vi decomposition fig s10 feng et al 2016 leading to decreased efficiency of fe vi oxidation of pyrene the presence of minerals might increase metal cation sensitivity and magnify the inhibition effects especially for goethite for the fast fe vi decomposition fig 7a as for anions pyrene degradation on minerals was not significantly affected in most cases especially for the kaolinite system fig 7b no3 and co3 2 addition facilitated montmorillonite and goethite pyrene degradation respectively while cl and po4 3 inhibited goethite pyrene degradation the presence of minerals might cause different response of micropollutants degradation to anions for example co3 2 was found to inhibit 4 tert butylphenol and diclofenac degradation by fe vi zhao et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 but accelerated goethite pyrene degradation humic acid ha caused a decreased in pyrene degradation efficiency in the three mineral systems and the inhibition increased with increasing ha concentration fig 7c when the initial ha concentration was increased to 50 mg l 1 the pyrene degradation was almost totally inhibited in goethite system fig 7c degradation of some micropollutants such as diclofenac bisphenols pmso caffeine and chlorpyrifos by fe vi oxidation was also found to be inhibited by ha due to consumption of fe vi fig s10 zhao et al 2018 liu et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 however some studies demonstrated an accelerated degradation effect of ha by fe vi oxidation as shown for 4 tert butylphenol sulfonamides bromophenols and carbamazepine sun et al 2019a pan et al 2020 tian et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 this effect was explained by cross coupling and electron shuttle reactions zheng et al 2021 ha is abundant in phenolic moieties which are readily oxidized by fe vi to produce benzoquinone like compounds or phenoxy radicals and subsequently cross couple with pollutant molecules thereby enhancing their transformation bialk et al 2005 zheng et al 2021 furthermore the various functional groups of ha or carbonaceous materials may also function as electron mediators to facilitate fe v fe iv formation and improve the removal efficiency of micropollutants pan et al 2020 tian et al 2020 pyrene is a substance of low water solubility and becomes readily immobilized on minerals due to the limited bioavailability cross coupling reactions with ha unlikely occur furthermore oxygen atom transfer reaction mechanism not radical mechanism was mainly involved in the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons by fe vi oxidation sharma 2013 3 6 oxidation products and reaction pathways intermediates of pyrene degradation were identified by lc tof ms ms and the total ion chromatogram fig s11 a total of 10 possible intermediate products were tentatively identified p1 p10 including 4 5 dihydroxy pyrene p1 m z 233 1 1 biphenyl 2 2 diformaldehyde 6 6 dicarboxylic acid p2 m z 297 2 2 6 6 biphenyltetracarboxylic acid p3 m z 329 1 2 3 benzenetricarboxylic acid p4 m z 209 3 4 dihydrophenanthrene 4 carboxylic p5 m z 223 3 4 dihydroxy 3 4 dihydrophenanthrene 4 carboxylic p6 m z 255 2 hydroxy 2h benzo h chromene 2 carboxylate p7 m z 242 3 1 hydroxy 2 naphthalenyl 2 propenal p8 m z 197 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid p9 m z 187 and phthalic acid p10 m z 165 table s1 fig s12 accordingly two possible pathways of fe vi oxidation of pyrene were proposed fig 8 both pathways initiated by ferrate attacking the electron rich pyrene through an oxygen transfer process to form the hydroxylation product p1 the typical hydroxylation reaction was frequently detected in the fe vi degradation of some micropollutants such as phenol compounds chlorpyrifos and sulfachloropyridazine liu et al 2019 li et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 for pathway i the product p1 is further hydroxylated by electrophilic ferrate attack to form r1 hypothetical product and followed by ring cleavage and oxidation reactions to form p2 and p3 with continued ferrate attack p3 was oxidized through hydroxylation ring cleavage chain bond cleavage and carboxylation to produce p4 finally phthalic acid p10 was formed by decarboxylation of p4 another pathway starts with aromatic ring opening of p1 and subsequently oxidation and decarboxylation to produce p5 the p6 was formed by transferring two o atoms to c3 and c4 sites of aromatic ring of p5 after a series of steps of hydroxylation decarboxylation and carboxylation the p7 is formed this product is also found in phenanthrene biodegradation pathway ban et al 2016 then the p8 is formed after decarboxylation of p7 the olefinic double bond of p8 is found active for fe vi oxidation islam et al 2018 and the cleavage of olefinic double bonds results in the formation of p9 after further o atoms transfer ring cleavage and carboxylation phthalic acid is also formed through pathway ii in short four main reaction processes including hydroxylation reaction o atom transfer aromatic ring opening decarboxylation and chain breaking reactions are involved in the fe vi oxidation of pyrene the abovementioned two degradation pathways were also observed in other studies focused on the abiotic and microbial degradation of pyrene gupta and gupta 2015 sun et al 2019b supporting our findings on the diverse degradation mechanisms of pyrene by ferrate oxidation 3 7 possible mechanisms of minerals as catalysts on pyrene oxidation by fe vi different minerals resulted in different enhancement of pyrene degradation by fe vi goethite catalyzed the fastest decomposition of fe vi but montmorillonite yielded the most efficient pyrene degradation figs 1 3 similar with most metal oxo species fe vi shows enhanced oxidizing power upon protonation ho and lau 2000 kim et al 2015 thus activation of ferrate species upon protonation does explain the strong catalytic activity under acidic conditions ho and lau 2000 kim et al 2015 montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite have zero point of charge at ph 2 5 ph 3 6 and ph 8 3 respectively cai et al 2006 this means montmorillonite and kaolinite are deprotonated under our experimental conditions ph 7 0 9 0 while goethite is protonated at ph 7 0 8 0 thus the extent of protonation might be one of the reasons that goethite catalyzes a faster pyrene degradation by fe vi than montmorillonite and kaolinite like protons transition metal ions may act as lewis acids that can bind to ferrate and activate its oxidation capacity corma and garcía 2002 mechanistically an oxygen of the ferrate ion coordinates to the metal ion to form a metal ferrate adduct similar to ferrate proton adduct eq 8 8 fe o 4 2 m n o 3 fe o m n 2 the metal ion causes withdrawal of electron density from the oxygen ligand increasing the oxidation efficiency of the oxo iron species which is one of the reasons that some transition metal ions enhance the degradation of micropollutants by ferrate zhao et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a this could be confirmed by our results that lower concentrations of additional fe3 facilitated pyrene degradation in montmorillonite and kaolinite systems fig 6b the reactivity and stability of metal ferrate adducts would ultimately determine the degradation rate and efficiency high concentration of metal ions could induce quick fe vi decomposition fig s10a when fe vi decomposition is stronger than the oxidation reaction with pyrene it will result in lower oxidation capacity of pyrene due to the quick loss of ferrate species through decomposition this also can be confirmed by the inhibition of pyrene oxidation in the presence of higher concentrations of metal ions e g 2 mm cu2 fe3 and zn2 attributed to the instability of excessive metal ferrate adducts corma and garcía 2002 montmorillonite as a 2 1 type dioctahedral smectite is a typical solid lewis acid that contains exchangeable metal ions in its interlayer which are considered responsible for the oxidation of adsorbed pah compounds corma and garcía 2002 the presence of lewis acid sites on montmorillonite are proved by the ftir spectra of pyridine adsorption peaks fig s13a when fe vi ions bind to lewis acid sites on montmorillonite lewis acid fe vi adducts with enhanced electrophilicity are formed fig 9 a these adducts withdraw electron density from pyrene or its intermediates to form highly reactive and short lived organic radical cations corma and garcía 2002 the resulting organic radical cations subsequently react with oxygen produced by breakdown of the oxo ferrate species forming finally oxygenated products concomitantly with fe iii formation from fe vi reduction montmorillonite associated ferrate has been demonstrated for the efficient oxidation of alcohols thiophenol benzylamine and aniline corma and garcía 2002 to verify that a lewis base orthophosphate po4 3 20 mm was added to screening lewis acid sites on montmorillonite before initiating the reaction at ph 7 0 the results showed that 13 9 and 7 3 reduction in pyrene degradation in montmorillonite and kaolinite system fig s9b respectively the higher reduction in pyrene degradation in montmorillonite might be attributed to the sequestration of lewis acid sites different from montmorillonite kaolinite is considered as a relatively mild lewis base due to its abundant hydroxyl edge surface functional groups puls and bohn 1988 thus lewis acid ferrate adducts of kaolinite will not be formed as a result the degradation efficiency and degradation rate of pyrene adsorbed on kaolinite was lower than that of montmorillonite and goethite figs 1 3 however kaolinite with large surface area and active hydroxyl groups is still superior in pyrene degradation compared to the treatment without minerals fig 4a goethite has surface functional groups including fe o fe oh and fe o fe liu et al 2014 the fe atoms as lewis acids share an electron pair with the surface hydroxyl groups making goethite an excellent catalyst ghose et al 2010 liu et al 2014 the oxidation of goethite pyrene by fe vi follows the mars and van krevelen mechanism that provides a catalytic center corma and garcía 2002 an inorganic oxide molecular cluster of a lewis acid site fe3 atom in goethite a lewis base site surface hydroxyl group and a metal redox center feo4 2 during the catalytic process fig 9c three primary steps are included in the oxidation process i substrate activation on a metallic cation ii oxygen insertion and iii a redox process and the transfer of electrons at the metallic site in the first step the aromatic substrate is activated by cation π interaction with the lewis acidic fe atom on the ferrate surface the aromatic substrate then undergoes hydrogen abstraction oxygen insertion and carbon bond cleavage compared to montmorillonite goethite has more metal exposure sites due to more oxygen vacancies ni et al 2021 rendering goethite more active for oxidation reactions however goethite might also accelerate the decomposition of the oxidative ferrate adduct species fe vi fe v fe iv other than promote the oxidation of pyrene due to protonation at ph 8 3 cai et al 2006 the fe vi decay in the presence of goethite 28 6 mm 1 min 1 was far faster than in the presence of montmorillonite k 1 13 mm 1 min 1 and kaolinite k 1 02 mm 1 min 1 fig s3d at ph 7 0 too rapid decomposition of ferrate species fe vi fe v fe iv in goethite system can lead to the competition between the ferrate self decomposition and the reaction with pyrene when the self decomposition 28 6 mm 1 min 1 is stronger than the reaction with pyrene 2 65 mm 1 min 1 at ph 7 0 table 2 the resulted non effective loss of ferrate species will decrease the oxidation capacity of pyrene 4 conclusion our study demonstrated efficient fe vi oxidation of pyrene immobilized on minerals at ph 7 0 9 0 different minerals favored different ph optima from neutral to alkaline conditions following the order of montmorillonite kaolinite and goethite for pyrene degradation protonation and mineral surface functional groups play important roles in the fe vi oxidation of pyrene the fast decomposition of ferrate species catalyzed by goethite is unfavorable for pyrene degradation fe vi oxidation of pyrene was mostly ascribed to its oxidative intermediates fe v fe iv species high contents of cations and dissolved humic acid as they may occurred in the environment had adverse effects on pyrene degradation this study provides valuable

has a decisive impact on the attenuation of such pollutants this reactivity is not yet well understood for lower order agricultural streams which are often anthropogenically altered and lack the streambed complexity allowing for extensive hyporheic exchange reactive hot spots in such streambeds have been hypothesized as a function of hydrology which controls the local gaining groundwater exfiltration or losing infiltration of stream water however streambed microbial communities and activities associated with such reactive zones remain mostly uncharted in this study sediments of a first order agriculturally impacted stream in southern germany were investigated along with a hydraulic dissection of distinct gaining and losing reaches of the stream community composition and the abundance of bacterial communities in the streambed were investigated using pacbio long read sequencing of bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicons and qpcr of bacterial 16s rrna and denitrification genes nirk and nirs we show that bidirectional water exchange between groundwater and the stream represents an important control for sediment microbiota especially for nitrate reducing populations typical heterotrophic denitrifiers were most abundant in a midstream net losing section while up and downstream net gaining sections were associated with an enrichment of sulfur oxidizing potential nitrate reducers affiliated with sulfuricurvum and thiobacillus spp dispersal based community assembly was found to dominate such spots of groundwater exfiltration our results indicate a coupling of n and s cycling processes in the streambed of an agricultural first order stream and a prominent control of microbiology by hydrology and hydrochemistry in situ such detailed local heterogeneities in exchange fluxes and streambed microbiomes have not been reported to date but seem relevant for understanding the reactivity of lower order streams graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lower order streams streambed microbiomes nitrate reduction losing and gaining stream groundwater surface water exchange 1 introduction up to 85 of the total stream length in a river system consists of lower order streams typically classified as first and second order streams horton 1945 peterson et al 2001 scheidegger 1965 lower order streams act as the fountainhead of fluvial networks and have a substantial imprint on stream water chemistry peterson et al 2001 however their reactivity and elimination potential towards incoming pollutants in particular from diffuse agricultural sources are not well understood especially the partitioning of this reactivity between instream processing and the streambed remains sparsely addressed higher order streams are typically connected to extensive hyporheic and parafluvial flow paths which move stream water through streambed and riparian sediments to subsequently return to the stream boano et al 2014 gomez velez et al 2015 krause et al 2011 mcclain et al 2003 water passage through hyporheic zones can significantly stimulate biogeochemical turnover of pollutants and nutrient elimination because of elongated transit times compared to instream transit times and increased biogeochemical and physical heterogeneity in contrast lower order agricultural streams are often strongly modified straightened and typically of low streambed morphological complexity thus minimizing the potential for hyporheic exchange therefore such streams have often been considered to act predominantly as drainage systems largely receiving water from the surrounding landscape kaandorp et al 2018 needelman et al 2007 yu et al 2018 this currently limits the perspective of how hydrology and biogeochemistry can interact to control oxidative and reductive pollutant transformation in lower order agricultural streams nitrate loading mainly stemming from agricultural fertilizer inputs and also nitrification of ammonia arising from livestock manure is a particular concern for stream and groundwater quality peterson et al 2001 starry et al 2005 capacities for the assimilative removal of nitrate in the stream itself mostly involve algal or macrophyte growth gooseff et al 2004 smith et al 2006 more importantly nitrate can also be removed by stream sediment microbial communities through heterotrophic denitrification and or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra kuypers et al 2018 mulholland et al 2008 storey et al 2004 tiedje 1988 nitrate reduction can also occur autotrophically coupled to the oxidation of iron and sulfur species hydrogen or methane kuypers et al 2018 however as all of these processes require microoxic or anoxic conditions the local hydraulic pattern becomes a decisive parameter of control seitzinger et al 2002 zarnetske et al 2011 it is now recognized that lower order streams not only receive water but steadily interact with the surrounding groundwater along successive and seasonally variable gaining groundwater exfiltration or losing stream water infiltration reaches covino and mcglynn 2007 mallard et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 this sequential exchange and replacement of water along the flow of a lower order stream has been termed hydrologic turnover which can substantially influence the biogeochemistry of the stream mallard et al 2014 depending on the local availability of electron donors such as organic carbon reduced iron and or sulfur species in the sediment reactive hot spots for denitrification may thus be generated in the streambed especially in losing reaches trauth et al 2018 in an agriculturally impacted first order stream in southern germany we recently identified substantial and seasonally variable bidirectional exchange fluxes between the stream and surrounding groundwater contributing significantly to nitrate reduction in water entering the near stream anoxic aquifer jimenez fernandez et al 2022 however the interplay of such hydrological and biogeochemical processes in shaping sedimentary bacterial communities and their activities in nitrogen cycling has not yet been addressed previous studies addressing the microbiology of rivers and streams report that sediment microbial communities are typically distinct to those found in surface water and the surrounding groundwater and suggest a depth dependent stratification danczak et al 2016 graham et al 2017 lin et al 2012 saup et al 2019 longitudinally successions in microbial community structure have been investigated from headwaters to large rivers and even estuaries and are taken to be controlled by local stream characteristics landscape type and anthropogenic impact battin et al 2008 crump et al 2004 hullar et al 2006 liao et al 2019 stegen et al 2016 winter et al 2007 it is also assumed that local sediment community assembly is dominated by deterministic selection particularly for higher order streams danczak et al 2016 graham et al 2017 in contrast mechanisms of dispersal based stochastic assembly indicate zones impacted by direct hydrologic transport such as hydrologic mixing and interstitial flow graham et al 2017 graham and stegen 2017 to date studies on structural patterns of microbial communities in the sediment of agricultural impacted lower order streams i e first and second order streams remain scarce especially in a dedicated hydrologic perspective here we address this research gap by dissecting sedimentary bacterial communities in the above mentioned agricultural first order stream via qpcr and pacbio full length 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing long read amplicon sequencing was chosen to provide more reliable phylogenetic resolution on possible taxon distribution patterns associated with local hydrology characteristics we posit that typical hydrological and geochemical parameters alone are necessary but not sufficient for understanding nitrate reduction mechanisms in such systems and explicitly address the interplay of hydrologic and microbial process controls harvey et al 2013 mulholland et al 2008 we hypothesize that 1 sediment microbial communities along successive net gaining and losing sections of the first order stream are distinct and impacted by local hydrology 2 the impact of hydrology on sediment microbial communities should be apparent in distinct assembly patterns between communities over longitudinal stream sections and over streambed sediment depths and 3 local hydrologic turnover caused by simultaneous bidirectional water exchange impacts the distribution and the abundance of nitrate reducing populations 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the schönbrunnen stream 48 32 n latitude and 8 57 e longitude is a first order stream located in a predominantly agricultural area it is a tributary of the second order käsbach stream within the ammer catchment in the west of the city of tübingen germany fig 1 both hydrology and hydrochemistry of the site table 1 have been described elsewhere jimenez fernandez et al 2022 the studied section of the stream has a length of approximately 550 m a mean discharge of approximately 1 l s 1 under baseflow conditions and drains an area of approximately 1 km2 the mean stream water depth varies between 5 and 13 cm under baseflow conditions the stream section runs in the käsbach valley mainly filled with fine alluvial quaternary sediments overlying the geological unit of the lower keuper erfurt formation dolomites sand and claystones which act as the primary bedrock along the eastern hillslopes the lower keuper is overlain by the grabfeld formation of the middle keuper this formation contains thick gypsum units interspersed with dolomite and limestone banks and forms a local aquifer draining hillslope groundwater towards the alluvial groundwater system d affonseca et al 2020 the eastern hillslope groundwater exhibits higher sulfate concentrations than the alluvial groundwater during this study the majority of the surrounding area of the studied schönbrunnen section was covered by meadows due to crop and fallow rotation with the exception of the northwestern area which was utilized for farming and pasture purposes the streambed sediment is comprised of silty clayey and loamy materials hydraulic parameters of groundwater were calculated by performing a series of two slug tests per groundwater monitoring well the hydraulic conductivity kf of the streambed sediments was calculated by tracing a perpendicular line to groundwater flow direction on the head contours maps the extent of the area associated with this kf value was defined by assessing the influence of infiltrating stream water on the locally varying mean groundwater heads we defined the hydraulic head differences δh at a given distance δl groundwater discharge q was derived from the gross losses in each reach according to a series of tracer tests jimenez fernandez et al 2022 defining a fixed sediment area within each of the tracer test reaches the hydraulic conductivity kf for each reach was determined this parameter was assumed to be constant alongside the studied stream section the permeability value k of the streambed was between 10 7 to 10 9 cm2 s 1 table 1 which was calculated using the equation below 1 k k f η ρ g where η dynamic viscosity 10 3 ps at 10 c ρ mass density of water and g gravitational acceleration 2 2 sediment sampling streambed sediments were collected in august 2017 at selected locations along the schönbrunnen stream fig 1 table s1 by taking sediment push cores using a stainless steel piston corer eijkelkamp giesbeek netherlands there had not been any major precipitation events 5 mm in the week preceding the sampling campaign agrometeorology of baden württemberg 2017 after coring sediments were dispensed onto clean plastic furrows and sediment subsamples were collected using sterile stainless steel spatulas at two distinct sediment depths 5 2 cm and 15 2 cm below the streambed surface replicate cores were taken within 30 cm distances from the first core to minimize lateral disturbances subsamples were stored in sterile 50 ml pe tubes fisher scientific gmbh schwerte germany and cooled during immediate transport back to the lab then stored at 80 c until further processing additionally some fresh sediment cores 25 cm in length were also stored intact in sterilized glass cylinders in duplicates covered with 5 cm of stream water before transport back to the 15 c sample storage room in the lab this was similar to the average stream water temperature of 13 2 c during the sampling month i e august 2017 2 3 hydrological description and water chemistry the interaction between the stream and adjacent groundwater as well as the hydrologic turnover were quantified by repeated field measurements and tracer tests performed between summer 2017 and summer 2018 jimenez fernandez et al 2022 thus the schönbrunnen stream was divided into six reaches r1 r6 characterized by distinct and seasonally variable net water gains or losses to or from the stream respectively fig 1 according to the groundwater heads water exchange in the summer season was characterized by net gaining conditions in the section further upstream of the reach r1 the major water source area of the schönbrunnen owing to the predominant groundwater inflow here defined as the spring generally net losing but locally variable conditions in the midstream reaches r2 to r4 and again mostly gaining but locally variable conditions in the downstream reaches r5 and r6 fig 2 a however gross water fluxes in both directions infiltration and exfiltration likely occurred simultaneously in all reaches these reach scale exchange fluxes had been further investigated with salt tracer tests jimenez fernandez et al 2022 again net gaining conditions appeared relatively more important in downstream r5 and r6 whereas locally variable but generally net losing conditions were observed in midstream reaches r2 and r4 for r3 salt tracers indicated a similar magnitude of stream water gaining and losing fluxes fig 2a moreover the studied stream section was not affected by other water sources such as unidentified tributaries or tile drainage systems water samples for major ions and doc dissolved organic carbon analyses were obtained from the stream and the surrounding network of groundwater monitoring wells in august 2018 for both stream and groundwater samples 100 ml and 25 ml samples were taken in glass bottles and filtered through 0 45 μm filters millexha darmstadt germany within 48 h for the analysis of major ions and doc respectively the samples were kept at 4 c in the dark until analysis major ions were determined by ion chromatography dionex dx 500 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa loq 0 1 mg l 1 for chloride and nitrate and 0 3 mg l 1 for sulfate the ph of samples for doc measurement was adjusted to 2 then samples were measured on a toc analyzer elementar hightoc langenselbold germany at selected locations sediment porewater was also sampled using mini piezometers 2 5 ml min 1 with fine scale depth differentiation 0 30 cm below streambed fig s2 duff et al 1998 all samples were filtered and kept at 4 c in the dark until further analysis as mentioned above stream water electrical conductivity ec was monitored using vented pressure transducers integrated into ctd probes with data loggers uit gmbh dresden germany which were installed in situ groundwater ec 0 5 of value temperature compensation to 25 c was measured in the field by hand held probes wtw gmbh weilheim in oberbayern germany the assessment of other parameters including discharge q water mixing ratios and groundwater heads are described elsewhere jimenez fernandez et al 2022 2 4 nucleic acid extraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing samples from replicate sediment cores of each location and depth were homogenized over 3 4 cm intervals before further processing genomic dna of sediment samples was extracted as described pilloni et al 2012 with minor modifications all was done at 4 c approximately 0 6 g wet sediment was used for each dna extraction and dna was extracted in triplicates from each sample dna quality and quantity in extracts were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and by using the quant it picogreen dsdna assay kit thermo fisher scientific waltham usa on an mx3000p cycler agilent santa clara usa for full length 16s rrna gene sequencing a two step pcr was performed the first amplification was done with the kapa hifi hotstart pcr kit kapa biosystems boston ma usa and universal primers for the bacterial 16s rrna gene forward and reverse tailed with pacbio universal sequence adapters table s2 detailed information on pcr reactions is given in the supplementary information si sequencing library construction was performed utilizing the smrtbell template prep kit 1 0 following the pacbio online documentation procedure checklist amplification of full length 16s gene with barcoded primers for multiplexed smrtbell library preparation and sequencing version june 2018 the libraries were sequenced on a pacbio sequel platform 2 5 sequencing data analysis raw sequencing data were processed using the smrtlink implemented secondary analysis platform provided by pacbio version 6 0 to generate demultiplexed sequences and circular consensus sequence ccs reads which were converted to fastq files table s4 the majority of reads had a number of passes i e the number of rounds that the same single molecule was sequenced through the pacbio circular sequencing mode 10 suggesting highly accurate sequence information wenger et al 2019 primer sequences were trimmed using cutadapt v1 14 martin 2011 read lengths were filtered and retained by geneious r10 biomatters ltd auckland new zealand to an average range of 1400 1600 bp afterwards samples with a total read number 1500 were excluded n 3 from downstream analysis sequence data were deposited in the european nucleotide archive ena with the study accession number prjeb49634 sequencing data were further processed in r version 3 5 0 r core team 2019 using the dada2 version 1 10 1 algorithms for quality filtering generating high accuracy exact amplicon sequence variants asvs with single nucleotide resolution and chimera removal according to the dada2 pacbio workflow callahan et al 2019 we did not manually discard asvs low in abundance across all samples prior to the taxonomic classification idtaxa classifier wright 2016 was used with a confidence level of 50 high to map asv sequences against the silva ssu database release 132 for taxonomic classification quast et al 2013 asvs classified as mitochondria chloroplasts or unclassified root were removed the fasttree price et al 2009 algorithm was applied for generating a midpoint rooted phylogenetic tree after asv sequence alignment by the decipher package version 2 12 0 wright 2015 maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed for specific taxa i e sulfuricurvum spp and thiobacillus spp with mega x kumar et al 2018 aligned with selected reference 16s rrna gene sequences from ncbi and img m databases agarwala et al 2018 chen et al 2019 using the clustalw algorithm with default settings 1 000 bootstrap replications we utilized raw read counts and proportions for alpha and beta diversity analysis respectively cameron et al 2021 mcmurdie and holmes 2014 detailed information on alpha diversity analysis is given in the supplementary information si bray curtis dissimilarities were calculated to demonstrate differences in microbial community composition among samples at the family level using hierarchical clustering methods average linkage and non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds using the vegan package version 2 5 5 oksanen et al 2019 similarity percentage simper analysis was applied to evaluate which taxa contributed to the structural differences of two communities using the vegan package permutations 1000 version 2 5 5 oksanen et al 2019 bacterial community structure was also investigated in order to evaluate the assembly mechanisms under the impact of bidirectional water exchange in the streambed therefore a two step null model approach taking both phylogenetic distance and abundance into consideration was applied as the first step this is based on the assumption that phylogenetically close taxa are more likely to have similar ecological niches stegen et al 2013 we first calculated β mean nearest taxa distance β mntd in order to quantify the phylogenetic distance of a species in one community to its closest relatives in another β mntd was calculated with 999 randomizations then β nearest taxon index β nti which represents the number of standard deviations between the observed β mntd and the mean of the null distribution was calculated to indicate whether species in two compared communities are phylogenetically significantly close or different than expected by chance if β nti 2 a significant deviation from the null distribution is assumed indicating that species in two compared communities are phylogenetically significantly close or distinct this is likely because of deterministic environmental selection processes such as homogeneous and variable selection if β nti 2 dispersal based and other stochastic processes should be further examined we applied the bray curtis distance based raup crick index rcbray chase and myers 2011 to evaluate stochastic assembly mechanisms rcbray only requires species occurrence and abundance in one community rcbray 0 95 suggests that two communities have significantly more or less common species than expected by chance indicating homogenizing dispersal or dispersal limitation and drift processes rcbray 0 95 indicates drift or undominated processes rcbray was also calculated with 999 randomizations in assembly analysis all samples were rarefied to the 1800 reads seed 123 the minimum number of reads among all samples reads from duplicate samples were then merged and further processed using the picante package version 1 7 kembel et al 2010 moreover in this analysis we omitted samples from the confluence as we only applied this approach to samples with comprehensive hydrological metadata correlations between gene abundances and geodesic distance were calculated using spearman correlation and least square linear models in the r package stats version 4 0 3 respectively r core team 2019 packages used for data visualization are described in the si 2 6 quantitative pcr qpcr of bacterial 16s rrna and nitrite reduction genes abundances of bacterial 16s rrna nirk and nirs genes were determined via qpcr on an mx3000p qpcr system agilent santa clara usa the primers used for qpcr are listed in table s3 triplicate dna extracts per sample were quantified in technical duplicates for bacterial 16s rrna genes 40 μl reactions consisting of 1 x takyon sybr mastermix eurogentec cologne germany with 0 6 μl 50 x rox reference dye thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa 0 2 μm bovine serum albumin bsa roche diagnostics gmbh basel switzerland 0 3 μm of each of the forward and reverse primer and 2 μl of adequately diluted dna template were used for amplification of the nitrite reductase genes all components were identical except that 1 x brilliant iii ultra fast qpcr master mix agilent santa clara ca usa was used in 40 μl qpcr reactions the temperature and cycling profile for each assay were as follows initial denaturation at 95 c 3 min 35 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 c 30 s annealing at a given temperature 30 s elongation at 72 c 30 s followed by a final a melting at 95 c 30 s and a melting curve recorded between 60 and 95 c primer annealing temperature was set to 54 c for bacterial 16s genes and to 58 c for nirk and nirs genes respectively standardization was done via ten fold dilution series of synthetic gene fragments gblocks integrated dna technologies leuven belgium of known concentration covering all respective primer sites for 16s rrna genes a 980 bp fragment of the e coli 16s rrna gene was used for nirk a 450 bp fragment of the respective gene of sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 and for nirs a 660 bp fragment of the respective gene of pseudomonas stutzeri dsm 4166 was employed each standard curve reached r square value greater than 0 99 and amplification efficiency of all genes was at 100 15 absolute abundances of target genes were reported as copies g 1 of fresh sediment gww 1 of sediment relative abundances of nitrite reductases are shown as the log10 ratio of each gene to the bacterial 16s rrna gene copies gww 1 of sediment 3 results 3 1 hydrology and hydrochemistry of the schönbrunnen stream nitrate concentrations in schönbrunnen stream water and the alluvial aquifer were repeatedly measured over several years and a representative set of water chemistry data corresponding to our sampling season is shown in fig 2b nitrate was generally highest in the northwestern most upstream section of the schönbrunnen with concentrations 50 mg l 1 consistent with the intensive agricultural activities in this area this was also reflected in the highest nitrate concentrations 60 mg l 1 found in the surrounding groundwater monitoring wells of the northwestern hillslope e g gws 2 and gws 6 interestingly the high nitrate concentrations clearly decreased along the course of the schönbrunnen and were lowest 30 mg l 1 before the confluence with the käsbach even though the farming activities vary each year the general trend of decreasing nitrate concentrations from upstream to downstream of the schönbrunnen remains the same fig s1 at selected streambed locations fine scale depth resolved pore water analyses of nitrate nitrite and doc were also conducted fig s2 these data showed a strong decline of nitrate concentrations between 0 and 20 cm below the streambed which was also the depth 10 20 cm below streambed where pore water doc concentrations were highest fig s2 similar to nitrate concentrations in the stream nitrate concentrations in groundwater decreased with increasing distance from the north western hillslope in contrast to nitrate concentrations sulfate concentrations in the stream increased over the schönbrunnen reaches with concentrations 200 mg l 1 at the confluence fig 2c sulfate concentrations were generally lower in groundwater from the northwestern hillslope but higher in eastern groundwater 1200 mg l 1 in between käsbach and schönbrunnen indicative of groundwater influenced by gypsum dissolution flowing from the east the ditch upstream of r1 was also characterized by elevated sulfate concentrations 170 mg l 1 fig 2c indicative of sulfate rich groundwater entering the stream in this upstream net gaining section 3 2 bacterial communities in streambed sediments triplicate sampling of sediment microbial communities was done in three major sections of the schönbrunnen two upstream locations up a and up b further upstream of r1 two in the midstream net losing sections mid a r3 mid b boundary of r3 r4 as well as one location each in the downstream net gaining section down boundary of r6 and directly after the confluence with the käsbach conf for all sampling locations full length 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was done at 5 and 15 cm depths corresponding to the assumed nitrate reduction zone fig s2 alpha diversity indices were similar h 5 27 0 88 across all schönbrunnen sediment samples fig s3 whereas confluence samples displayed a significantly lower diversity both at 5 and at 15 cm depth dunn s kruskal wallis p 0 01 samples from up a and the two midstream locations showed greater evenness j dunn s kruskal wallis p 0 05 than the confluence samples depth had no consistent effect on diversity indices although some significant differences were observed for specific locations for instance up a 5 cm samples showed a higher shannon diversity dunn s kruskal wallis p 0 01 than the corresponding 15 cm samples hierarchical clustering of bray curtis dissimilarities between samples revealed three major clusters fig 3 samples from the confluence formed a disparate cluster connoting that taxonomic composition was distinct here from all other samples a second major cluster mainly comprised samples from 5 cm depth as well as one set of 15 cm samples mid b the majority of the third cluster contained samples from 15 cm depth plus one set of shallow depth samples from mid a generally triplicate or duplicate libraries were grouped closely except for one replicate of the down 5 cm site which was more similar to the mid b 15 cm samples possibly reflecting small scale local heterogeneities of the sampled streambed the 9024 unique asvs identified could be assigned to 55 phyla table s5 all samples were dominated by three phyla proteobacteria 2173 asvs bacteroidota 1125 asvs and acidobacteriota 1160 asvs which all together accounted for up to 50 of each library in total 429 families were assigned nitrosomonadaceae 216 asvs chitinophagaceae 187 asvs and vicinamibacteraceae 391 asvs appeared as the most abundant families within those three dominant phyla respectively accounting for 10 relative abundance of the respective phylum on average chitinophagaceae were generally more abundant in 5 cm samples while nitrosomonadaceae were mostly more abundant in 15 cm samples especially mid and downstream in addition to these phyla the sulfurimonadaceae phylum campilobacterota were the most abundant family mean relative abundance 3 5 especially in 5 cm samples taken midstream and at the confluence from up to downstream and the confluence 12 1083 asvs of all asvs belonging to 167 families were shared between at least five out of the six sampling locations fig s4a as for the five locations within the schönbrunnen 793 asvs were presented from up to downstream the samples from 5 cm generally shared a greater number of common asvs than samples from 15 cm depth figs s4b s4c differences in bacterial community structure along the schönbrunnen were further investigated via non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and similarity percentage simper analyses fig 4 the 5 cm samples generally featured a higher abundance of typical heterotrophic aerobic or facultative anaerobic microbial lineages these included rhodanobacteraceae dominated by ahniella spp rhodobacteraceae dominated by rhodobacter and tabrizicola spp microscillaceae dominated by chryseolinea spp xanthomonadaceae dominated by arenimonas spp chitinophagaceae dominated by dinghuibacter and terrimonas spp and the saprospiraceae members of the rhodocyclaceae were also particularly abundant in 5 cm samples taken from up b and mid b 2 3 mainly including reads associated with denitratisoma dechloromonas and rhodocyclus spp fig 5 however samples from 5 cm depth of up a mid a and down also featured taxa similarly abundant at 15 cm depth of mid b these included the nitrosomonadaceae 3 and nitrospiraceae 1 in contrast the dissimilarity of bacterial communities observed in other samples from 15 cm depth was mainly driven by typical anaerobic or microaerophilic lineages this included typical fermenters anaerolineaceae anaerovoracaceae clostridiaceae and prevotellaceae potential sulfate reducers desulfobaccaceae thermodesulfovibrionia but also potential iron oxidizing bacteria within the gallionellaceae sideroxydans spp the confluence samples were clearly distinguished from the other schönbrunnen samples taxa typical for inorganic sulfide and sulfur oxidation sulfuricellaceae sulfurimonadaceae and thiobacillus spp within the hydrogenophilaceae were among the major drivers of dissimilarity between those samples moreover flavobacteriaceae flavobacterium spp and comamonadaceae rhizobacter spp were also relevant for the separation of confluence samples from others typical sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob were rather abundant throughout the schönbrunnen sediments not only at the confluence fig 3 consider their potential role in linking sulfur and nitrogen cycling in the streambed their distribution at asv level was further investigated facilitated by the high resolution of full length 16s rrna amplicon reads we specifically focused on asvs within two dominating genera sulfuricurvum spp relative abundance up to 14 79 and thiobacillus spp relative abundance up to 5 6 sulfuricurvum spp was the only taxon within the sulfurimonadaceae detected in this study thiobacillus spp 73 asvs took up 99 88 of the family hydrogenophilaceae and unclassified hydrogenophilaceae 2 asvs took up 0 12 of the family hydrogenophilaceae were genera detected within hydrogenophilaceae in total 65 asvs were identified within the genus sulfuricurvum including 34 of them were only detected within schönbrunnen samples such as the most dominant asv9 relative abundance up to 1 99 fig 6 a however some asvs especially asv2 and asv8 relative abundance up to 3 71 and 3 23 respectively were found exclusively in the confluence samples another typical sulfur oxidizing lineage detected was thiobacillus here out of 73 asvs detected in total fig 6b only two asvs appeared specifically enriched at the confluence asv19 relative abundance up to 1 26 and asv127 relative abundance up to 0 61 in the schönbrunnen streambed asv3 relative abundance up to 1 12 and asv291 relative abundance up to 0 33 were relatively more abundant for further context on the detected asvs asvs within both sulfuricurvum spp and thiobacillus spp were embedded in phylogenetic dendrograms figs 7 a 7b the phylogenetic tree of sulfuricurvum spp revealed that schönbrunnen and confluence asvs were separated into two distinct clusters nominated schönbrunnen cluster and käsbach cluster fig 7a the phylogenetic tree of thiobacillus spp suggested that schönbrunnen and confluence asvs of thiobacillus spp were closely related to thiobacillus thioparus whereas asv19 and asv291 were more related to thiobacillus thiophilus and thiobacillus denitrificans respectively fig 7b 3 3 streambed community assembly to investigate the potential impact of bidirectional water exchange on the assembly of bacterial communities in the streambed the β nearest taxon β nti and rcbray indices were inferred the importance of deterministic versus stochastic microbial community assembly can thus be estimated stegen et al 2013 2012 for samples in this study over half of pairwise comparisons resulted in β nti values 2 significantly different from the expectation of the null model fig 8 this indicated that the community assembly of schönbrunnen sediments was largely triggered by deterministic variable selection a β nti index 2 generally suggests that a pair of samples is likely to be selected by stochastic processes the rcbray index was calculated to further delineate these patterns an rcbray index 0 95 or 0 95 indicates that two samples share more asvs or fewer asvs than expected respectively we assume that homogenizing dispersal could be relevant between samples from 5 cm and 15 cm of the same sampling location depending on the local hydraulic conditions indeed a homogenizing dispersal was suggested at up a and mid a sampling spots moreover a longitudinal homogenizing dispersal was observed between 5 cm samples of up a and mid a and between 15 cm samples of mid a and down 3 4 quantification of denitrifying communities in addition to 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing we also quantified absolute abundances of bacterial 16s rrna and nitrite reduction genes indicative of denitrifying communities over the schönbrunnen streambed bacterial 16s rrna genes ranged from 9 1 2 5 106 to 9 0 8 107 copies gww 1 of sediment fig 9 a nirk genes were more abundant than nirs across all samples ranging from 2 2 1 2 105 to 5 3 2 5 106 copies gww 1 of sediment the abundance of bacterial 16s rrna genes was positively correlated with the abundance of nirk r 0 791 p 0 001 pearson s and nirs r 0 909 p 0 001 pearson s genes a notable increase in the relative abundance of nirk genes to up to 10 of total bacterial 16s rrna gene counts was observed from upstream to downstream samples especially at 15 cm depth fig 9b a positive linear relationship p 0 05 adjusted r 2 0 235 was noted between the relative abundance of nirk and the geodesic distance from upstream to confluence 4 discussion in this study we comprehensively interrogate the microbial community structure in the streambed of the schönbrunnen an agriculturally impacted first order stream we differentiate microbes in sections of the streambed where seasonal bidirectional gaining and losing fluxes of water are occurring we propose that the demonstrated longitudinal and vertical heterogeneity of the streambed microbial communities and the distribution of distinct functional capacities were impacted by this specific hydrologic setting here we discuss the evidence supporting these conclusions as well as the implications for our understanding of the reactivity of lower order streams 4 1 bidirectional water exchange as a control of water chemistry and streambed bacterial communities the influence of bidirectional water exchange on the biogeochemistry of lower order streams may represent an under regarded mechanism for the control of solute fluxes in the catchment jimenez fernandez et al 2022 our hydrological analyses delineate the schönbrunnen from upstream to downstream of which upstream and downstream sections were identified as net gaining whereas midstream sections were identified as net losing reaches irrespective of small scale local heterogeneities of gross bidirectional fluxes revealed by salt tracer tests e g location mid a it has been proposed that such net losing reaches could represent reactive hot spots for denitrification along infiltrating river water trauth et al 2018 under losing conditions microbial denitrification will largely depend on sediment borne electron donors and on doc that is still available after oxygen depletion from the infiltrating stream water water leaving the schönbrunnen in midstream net losing sections however may not immediately return to the stream or return to the stream as groundwater exfiltration after a prolonged travel distance and mixing with the surrounding groundwater mixing of stream and groundwater is not likely in the first few decimeters below the streambed this differentiates the hydrologic setting from typical hyporheic flow and hyporheic exchange processes in which stream water infiltrates into the streambed and subsequently returns to the stream over short flow distances mainly induced by complex streambed morphology bayani cardenas and wilson 2006 hester et al 2013 however if nitrate reduction is largely associated with infiltrating water fluxes nitrate concentrations in the stream water of net losing reaches e g midstream should remain relatively constant this was observed in our study fig 2b instream nitrate concentrations only decreased in downstream net gaining reaches r5 and r6 where adjacent groundwater depleted in nitrate fig s2 and enriched in sulfate and likely also sulfide or other reduced sulfur species entered the schönbrunnen under gaining scenarios mixing of groundwater and reduced solutes with the stream water in shallower depths of the streambed should thus result in a distinct reactivity compared to sections of stream water infiltration over the schönbrunnen longitudinal profile nitrate concentrations appeared tentatively negatively correlated with that of sulfate indicating that sulfur and nitrogen cycling in downstream net gaining reaches were possibly linked we propose that bidirectional water exchange fluxes not only affected water chemistry but also shaped streambed bacterial communities the high spatial variability of abiotic factors that determined the local presence and relative abundance of microbial taxa should be apparent in strong deterministic variable selection patterns dini andreote et al 2015 over the schönbrunnen stream in accordance microbial communities in top streambed sediments of the schönbrunnen mostly showed high ßnti values 2 indicating strong variable selection stegen et al 2013 this was consistent with previous studies on river sediment bacterial community assembly danczak et al 2016 graham et al 2017 however dispersal based stochastic processes especially homogenizing dispersal processes rcbray 0 95 were found in samples from typical net gaining reaches e g up a and down homogenizing dispersal patterns can be an indicator of the actual physical transport of organisms stegen et al 2016 and thus might infer the impact of groundwater exfiltration under the specific hydrologic setting of schönbrunnen homogenizing dispersal patterns were also observed at mid a which was located in reach r3 predominated by net losing conditions according to groundwater heads figs 2a 8 however several lines of circumstantial evidence indicate that mid a might also be impacted by local exfiltration fluxes of groundwater similar to upstream and downstream samples on the one hand bidirectional gross fluxes are likely in all reaches tracer tests showed that gaining and losing water fluxes in r3 could be very similar fig 2a on the other hand the mid a 5 cm samples showed similar bacterial community composition as other 15 cm samples whereas mid b appeared more representative of the generally net losing conditions midstream fig 3 moreover the presence of a greater abundance of asvs affiliated with sulfuricurvum spp was also observed at up a and down two obvious groundwater exfiltration spots such local heterogeneities in gross hydrologic fluxes and streambed microbiomes were fortuitously recovered in our study as the streambed permeability of the schönbrunnen is consistently low according to our estimation the transport of microbial populations and homogenizing processes due to bidirectional water fluxes can be further constrained saup et al 2019 yet apart from bidirectional water fluxes substrate factors like fine scale geochemical heterogeneities e g redox potential and ph or the sediment matrix may also be relevant in controlling local communities graham et al 2017 jorgensen et al 2012 pett ridge et al 2006 vos et al 2013 to more comprehensively document and quantify such patterns at smaller scales a more comprehensive spatial sampling grid per reach may clearly be necessary in the future dispersal based assembly processes can lead to rather maladapted local communities and can therefore restrict the biogeochemical potentials and functional stability of specific communities graham and stegen 2017 however in our study dispersal based assembly processes were found at locations dominated by exfiltration in concert with a high abundance of sulfur oxidizing and autotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria thus chemolithoautotrophic mechanisms rather than canonical denitrification processes might actually be prioritized at groundwater exfiltration sections the extent of the contribution of chemolithoautotrophic nitrate reduction versus physical mixing between nitrate depleted exfiltrating groundwater and stream water to overall nitrate removal from the stream in downstream sections remains to be further elucidated nevertheless such fine scale heterogeneities in exchange fluxes and microbial community structure in streambed sediments have not been reported to date but may be relevant indicators of streambed reactivity in situ 4 2 microbial communities potentially involved in nitrate reduction our data suggest that distinct mechanisms could be driving microbial nitrate reduction in the streambed of different sections of the schönbrunnen firstly the net losing sections appeared to be associated with heterotrophic denitrifiers in the streambed although absolute or relative abundances of denitrification genes were not the highest in this section fig 9 respective sediment communities especially in mid b were clearly enriched in typical canonical heterotrophic denitrifier lineages these included members of the rhodobacteraceae tarhriz et al 2013 tosques et al 1997 flavobacteriaceae tekedar et al 2017 comamonadaceae khan et al 2002 wang and chu 2016 rhodocyclaceae fahrbach et al 2006 all known to host typical nirk or nirs carrying denitrifiers the abundance of these potential denitrifiers especially the rhodocyclaceae was increased in 5 cm samples of up b and mid b whereas the relative abundance of potential sulfur associated autotrophic nitrate reducers including sulfuricurvum and thiobacillus beller et al 2006 kodama and watanabe 2004 was relatively low here figs 5 6 dominant genera within the rhodocyclaceae were well known denitrifiers such as denitratisoma dechloromonas fahrbach et al 2006 horn et al 2005 as well as rhodocyclus spp tang et al 2020 in turn potential sulfur driven nitrate reducing populations were more abundant in groundwater exfiltration locations such as up a mid a and down the phylogenetic tree for sulfuricurvum spp revealed two major clusters of asvs distributed between schönbrunnen and käsbach fig 7a species level taxonomy of sulfuricurvum spp reads was not fully resolved due to the existence of only a few pure culture isolates fida et al 2021 han et al 2012 kodama and watanabe 2004 li et al 2019 even though the schönbrunnen cluster was mostly related to sulfuricurvum kujiense kodama and watanabe 2004 the käsbach cluster did not include any previously reported sulfuricurvum isolates the currently known sulfuricurvum strains are known for respiratory reduction of nitrate but not of nitrite fida et al 2021 in addition the asvs of another typical sulfide and sulfur oxidizer thiobacillus spp hydrogenophilaceae were widespread in both schönbrunnen and confluence sediments currently three species have been described within the genus t thioparus t thiophilus and t denitrificans boden et al 2017 t denitrificans is a well defined denitrifier and carries nirs genes beller et al 2006 t thioparus and t thiophilus may perform only partial denitrification reducing nitrate to nitrite hutt et al 2017 kellerman and griebler 2009 thus both the detected sulfuricurvum and thiobacillus spp could have contributed to a sulfide and or other sulfur species driven nitrate reduction especially in streambeds impacted by gaining fluxes it has been previously proposed that the infiltration of stream water rich in nitrate and organic carbon may trigger heterotrophic denitrification in streambeds whereas the exfiltration of reduced groundwater could prioritize autotrophic denitrifiers and dnra graham et al 2017 storey et al 2004 while high ratios between organic carbon and nitrate are known to generally trigger dnra wang et al 2020 also high sulfide levels in aquatic environments may favour this process delgado vela et al 2020 dnra was reported to dominate over denitrification in salt marsh sediments amended with 100 µm sulfide murphy et al 2020 although sulfide was not routinely measured in our regular field sampling across the schönbrunnen catchment during our study total sulfide concentrations measured in sediments in the following year reached values of 50 μm at a depth of 2 cm data not shown apart from such exemplary porewater measurements groundwater from the southeastern monitoring wells e g gws 25 clearly smelled sulfidic upon sampling apart from sulfuricurvum spp several other lineages detected in our libraries are also known for dnra such as geobacter spp van den berg et al 2017 members of the desulfocapsaceae arshad et al 2017 bell et al 2020 or sulfurimonas spp bell et al 2020 generally nirk carrying denitrifiers have a greater probability of harbouring a respiratory dnra pathway nrfa as well while nirs carrying nitrate reducers are more likely to perform complete denitrification helen et al 2016 despite some bacteria carrying both nirk or nirs genes most known nitrate reducers only have one copy of either of the two genes etchebehere and tiedje 2005 graf et al 2014 however even though the distribution pattern of nirk genes appeared more related to nitrate concentration in the stream rather than nirs linking nirk genes with denitrification rates in situ must be done with caution graham et al 2010 veraart et al 2017 to further address this the site specific in situ denitrification rates should be determined across reaches 4 3 pacbio long read sequencing for a high resolution dissection of sediment microbial communities pacbio long read sequencing of full length 16s rrna gene amplicons provided a valuable opportunity to dissect sediment bacterial communities at a robust and taxonomically informative asv level lam et al 2020 in contrast to the more widely used short illumina reads long read asvs can likely be resolved beyond the genus level callahan et al 2017 as exemplified for the species level resolution for asvs of sulfur oxidizing populations here this may well be relevant to assess spatial patterns in investigated populations and to infer their potential impact on streambed biogeochemistry although 16s rrna gene affiliation can be only an indicator not a diagnostic for actual process relevance within environmental microbiomes functionally relevant context like a reliable differentiation between t denitrificans and other thiobacillus related asvs would not have been possible using shorter reads though pacbio long read sequencing does not produce comparable amounts of total sequencing output as other platforms it can offer comparable biodiversity coverage for more frequent taxa lam et al 2020 as shown here this may be relevant for the functional interpretation of environmental amplicon datasets 5 conclusions in this study we show that bidirectional water exchange between an agricultural first order stream and the surrounding alluvial aquifer is important not only for stream water chemistry but also for sediment microbial populations and their presumed activities in attenuating agricultural solute inputs by disentangling the stream into net gaining and losing sections we show that sediment microbial community assembly was mostly dominated by deterministic heterogeneous assembly processes except for zones of the streambed influenced by groundwater exfiltration such net gaining sections were associated with an enrichment of typical sulfur oxidizing lineages indicative of possibly ongoing sulfur driven autotrophic nitrate attenuation processes in contrast canonical heterotrophic denitrifying populations were more abundant in midstream net losing reaches of the schönbrunnen our study thus advances the current understanding of the reactivity of lower order streams towards incoming agricultural pollutants compared to more natural lower order streams we propose a reactivity of the streambed and an assembly of its microbiota strongly impacted by bidirectional water exchange fluxes rather than by bedform driven hyporheic flow given that the schönbrunnen is located in a very typical agricultural landscape in central europe we are confident that this concept is generally relevant also for other comparable lower order streams in agricultural lowlands even if local explicit turnover processes and microbial communities will be distinct this may open new opportunities for stream management and restoration as well as for the prediction of watershed level pollutant attenuation and water quality in agricultural landscapes credit authorship contribution statement zhe wang investigation writing original draft formal analysis

16019,the input of nitrate and other agricultural pollutants in higher order streams largely derives from first order streams the streambed as the transition zone between groundwater and stream water has a decisive impact on the attenuation of such pollutants this reactivity is not yet well understood for lower order agricultural streams which are often anthropogenically altered and lack the streambed complexity allowing for extensive hyporheic exchange reactive hot spots in such streambeds have been hypothesized as a function of hydrology which controls the local gaining groundwater exfiltration or losing infiltration of stream water however streambed microbial communities and activities associated with such reactive zones remain mostly uncharted in this study sediments of a first order agriculturally impacted stream in southern germany were investigated along with a hydraulic dissection of distinct gaining and losing reaches of the stream community composition and the abundance of bacterial communities in the streambed were investigated using pacbio long read sequencing of bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicons and qpcr of bacterial 16s rrna and denitrification genes nirk and nirs we show that bidirectional water exchange between groundwater and the stream represents an important control for sediment microbiota especially for nitrate reducing populations typical heterotrophic denitrifiers were most abundant in a midstream net losing section while up and downstream net gaining sections were associated with an enrichment of sulfur oxidizing potential nitrate reducers affiliated with sulfuricurvum and thiobacillus spp dispersal based community assembly was found to dominate such spots of groundwater exfiltration our results indicate a coupling of n and s cycling processes in the streambed of an agricultural first order stream and a prominent control of microbiology by hydrology and hydrochemistry in situ such detailed local heterogeneities in exchange fluxes and streambed microbiomes have not been reported to date but seem relevant for understanding the reactivity of lower order streams graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lower order streams streambed microbiomes nitrate reduction losing and gaining stream groundwater surface water exchange 1 introduction up to 85 of the total stream length in a river system consists of lower order streams typically classified as first and second order streams horton 1945 peterson et al 2001 scheidegger 1965 lower order streams act as the fountainhead of fluvial networks and have a substantial imprint on stream water chemistry peterson et al 2001 however their reactivity and elimination potential towards incoming pollutants in particular from diffuse agricultural sources are not well understood especially the partitioning of this reactivity between instream processing and the streambed remains sparsely addressed higher order streams are typically connected to extensive hyporheic and parafluvial flow paths which move stream water through streambed and riparian sediments to subsequently return to the stream boano et al 2014 gomez velez et al 2015 krause et al 2011 mcclain et al 2003 water passage through hyporheic zones can significantly stimulate biogeochemical turnover of pollutants and nutrient elimination because of elongated transit times compared to instream transit times and increased biogeochemical and physical heterogeneity in contrast lower order agricultural streams are often strongly modified straightened and typically of low streambed morphological complexity thus minimizing the potential for hyporheic exchange therefore such streams have often been considered to act predominantly as drainage systems largely receiving water from the surrounding landscape kaandorp et al 2018 needelman et al 2007 yu et al 2018 this currently limits the perspective of how hydrology and biogeochemistry can interact to control oxidative and reductive pollutant transformation in lower order agricultural streams nitrate loading mainly stemming from agricultural fertilizer inputs and also nitrification of ammonia arising from livestock manure is a particular concern for stream and groundwater quality peterson et al 2001 starry et al 2005 capacities for the assimilative removal of nitrate in the stream itself mostly involve algal or macrophyte growth gooseff et al 2004 smith et al 2006 more importantly nitrate can also be removed by stream sediment microbial communities through heterotrophic denitrification and or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra kuypers et al 2018 mulholland et al 2008 storey et al 2004 tiedje 1988 nitrate reduction can also occur autotrophically coupled to the oxidation of iron and sulfur species hydrogen or methane kuypers et al 2018 however as all of these processes require microoxic or anoxic conditions the local hydraulic pattern becomes a decisive parameter of control seitzinger et al 2002 zarnetske et al 2011 it is now recognized that lower order streams not only receive water but steadily interact with the surrounding groundwater along successive and seasonally variable gaining groundwater exfiltration or losing stream water infiltration reaches covino and mcglynn 2007 mallard et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 this sequential exchange and replacement of water along the flow of a lower order stream has been termed hydrologic turnover which can substantially influence the biogeochemistry of the stream mallard et al 2014 depending on the local availability of electron donors such as organic carbon reduced iron and or sulfur species in the sediment reactive hot spots for denitrification may thus be generated in the streambed especially in losing reaches trauth et al 2018 in an agriculturally impacted first order stream in southern germany we recently identified substantial and seasonally variable bidirectional exchange fluxes between the stream and surrounding groundwater contributing significantly to nitrate reduction in water entering the near stream anoxic aquifer jimenez fernandez et al 2022 however the interplay of such hydrological and biogeochemical processes in shaping sedimentary bacterial communities and their activities in nitrogen cycling has not yet been addressed previous studies addressing the microbiology of rivers and streams report that sediment microbial communities are typically distinct to those found in surface water and the surrounding groundwater and suggest a depth dependent stratification danczak et al 2016 graham et al 2017 lin et al 2012 saup et al 2019 longitudinally successions in microbial community structure have been investigated from headwaters to large rivers and even estuaries and are taken to be controlled by local stream characteristics landscape type and anthropogenic impact battin et al 2008 crump et al 2004 hullar et al 2006 liao et al 2019 stegen et al 2016 winter et al 2007 it is also assumed that local sediment community assembly is dominated by deterministic selection particularly for higher order streams danczak et al 2016 graham et al 2017 in contrast mechanisms of dispersal based stochastic assembly indicate zones impacted by direct hydrologic transport such as hydrologic mixing and interstitial flow graham et al 2017 graham and stegen 2017 to date studies on structural patterns of microbial communities in the sediment of agricultural impacted lower order streams i e first and second order streams remain scarce especially in a dedicated hydrologic perspective here we address this research gap by dissecting sedimentary bacterial communities in the above mentioned agricultural first order stream via qpcr and pacbio full length 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing long read amplicon sequencing was chosen to provide more reliable phylogenetic resolution on possible taxon distribution patterns associated with local hydrology characteristics we posit that typical hydrological and geochemical parameters alone are necessary but not sufficient for understanding nitrate reduction mechanisms in such systems and explicitly address the interplay of hydrologic and microbial process controls harvey et al 2013 mulholland et al 2008 we hypothesize that 1 sediment microbial communities along successive net gaining and losing sections of the first order stream are distinct and impacted by local hydrology 2 the impact of hydrology on sediment microbial communities should be apparent in distinct assembly patterns between communities over longitudinal stream sections and over streambed sediment depths and 3 local hydrologic turnover caused by simultaneous bidirectional water exchange impacts the distribution and the abundance of nitrate reducing populations 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the schönbrunnen stream 48 32 n latitude and 8 57 e longitude is a first order stream located in a predominantly agricultural area it is a tributary of the second order käsbach stream within the ammer catchment in the west of the city of tübingen germany fig 1 both hydrology and hydrochemistry of the site table 1 have been described elsewhere jimenez fernandez et al 2022 the studied section of the stream has a length of approximately 550 m a mean discharge of approximately 1 l s 1 under baseflow conditions and drains an area of approximately 1 km2 the mean stream water depth varies between 5 and 13 cm under baseflow conditions the stream section runs in the käsbach valley mainly filled with fine alluvial quaternary sediments overlying the geological unit of the lower keuper erfurt formation dolomites sand and claystones which act as the primary bedrock along the eastern hillslopes the lower keuper is overlain by the grabfeld formation of the middle keuper this formation contains thick gypsum units interspersed with dolomite and limestone banks and forms a local aquifer draining hillslope groundwater towards the alluvial groundwater system d affonseca et al 2020 the eastern hillslope groundwater exhibits higher sulfate concentrations than the alluvial groundwater during this study the majority of the surrounding area of the studied schönbrunnen section was covered by meadows due to crop and fallow rotation with the exception of the northwestern area which was utilized for farming and pasture purposes the streambed sediment is comprised of silty clayey and loamy materials hydraulic parameters of groundwater were calculated by performing a series of two slug tests per groundwater monitoring well the hydraulic conductivity kf of the streambed sediments was calculated by tracing a perpendicular line to groundwater flow direction on the head contours maps the extent of the area associated with this kf value was defined by assessing the influence of infiltrating stream water on the locally varying mean groundwater heads we defined the hydraulic head differences δh at a given distance δl groundwater discharge q was derived from the gross losses in each reach according to a series of tracer tests jimenez fernandez et al 2022 defining a fixed sediment area within each of the tracer test reaches the hydraulic conductivity kf for each reach was determined this parameter was assumed to be constant alongside the studied stream section the permeability value k of the streambed was between 10 7 to 10 9 cm2 s 1 table 1 which was calculated using the equation below 1 k k f η ρ g where η dynamic viscosity 10 3 ps at 10 c ρ mass density of water and g gravitational acceleration 2 2 sediment sampling streambed sediments were collected in august 2017 at selected locations along the schönbrunnen stream fig 1 table s1 by taking sediment push cores using a stainless steel piston corer eijkelkamp giesbeek netherlands there had not been any major precipitation events 5 mm in the week preceding the sampling campaign agrometeorology of baden württemberg 2017 after coring sediments were dispensed onto clean plastic furrows and sediment subsamples were collected using sterile stainless steel spatulas at two distinct sediment depths 5 2 cm and 15 2 cm below the streambed surface replicate cores were taken within 30 cm distances from the first core to minimize lateral disturbances subsamples were stored in sterile 50 ml pe tubes fisher scientific gmbh schwerte germany and cooled during immediate transport back to the lab then stored at 80 c until further processing additionally some fresh sediment cores 25 cm in length were also stored intact in sterilized glass cylinders in duplicates covered with 5 cm of stream water before transport back to the 15 c sample storage room in the lab this was similar to the average stream water temperature of 13 2 c during the sampling month i e august 2017 2 3 hydrological description and water chemistry the interaction between the stream and adjacent groundwater as well as the hydrologic turnover were quantified by repeated field measurements and tracer tests performed between summer 2017 and summer 2018 jimenez fernandez et al 2022 thus the schönbrunnen stream was divided into six reaches r1 r6 characterized by distinct and seasonally variable net water gains or losses to or from the stream respectively fig 1 according to the groundwater heads water exchange in the summer season was characterized by net gaining conditions in the section further upstream of the reach r1 the major water source area of the schönbrunnen owing to the predominant groundwater inflow here defined as the spring generally net losing but locally variable conditions in the midstream reaches r2 to r4 and again mostly gaining but locally variable conditions in the downstream reaches r5 and r6 fig 2 a however gross water fluxes in both directions infiltration and exfiltration likely occurred simultaneously in all reaches these reach scale exchange fluxes had been further investigated with salt tracer tests jimenez fernandez et al 2022 again net gaining conditions appeared relatively more important in downstream r5 and r6 whereas locally variable but generally net losing conditions were observed in midstream reaches r2 and r4 for r3 salt tracers indicated a similar magnitude of stream water gaining and losing fluxes fig 2a moreover the studied stream section was not affected by other water sources such as unidentified tributaries or tile drainage systems water samples for major ions and doc dissolved organic carbon analyses were obtained from the stream and the surrounding network of groundwater monitoring wells in august 2018 for both stream and groundwater samples 100 ml and 25 ml samples were taken in glass bottles and filtered through 0 45 μm filters millexha darmstadt germany within 48 h for the analysis of major ions and doc respectively the samples were kept at 4 c in the dark until analysis major ions were determined by ion chromatography dionex dx 500 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa loq 0 1 mg l 1 for chloride and nitrate and 0 3 mg l 1 for sulfate the ph of samples for doc measurement was adjusted to 2 then samples were measured on a toc analyzer elementar hightoc langenselbold germany at selected locations sediment porewater was also sampled using mini piezometers 2 5 ml min 1 with fine scale depth differentiation 0 30 cm below streambed fig s2 duff et al 1998 all samples were filtered and kept at 4 c in the dark until further analysis as mentioned above stream water electrical conductivity ec was monitored using vented pressure transducers integrated into ctd probes with data loggers uit gmbh dresden germany which were installed in situ groundwater ec 0 5 of value temperature compensation to 25 c was measured in the field by hand held probes wtw gmbh weilheim in oberbayern germany the assessment of other parameters including discharge q water mixing ratios and groundwater heads are described elsewhere jimenez fernandez et al 2022 2 4 nucleic acid extraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing samples from replicate sediment cores of each location and depth were homogenized over 3 4 cm intervals before further processing genomic dna of sediment samples was extracted as described pilloni et al 2012 with minor modifications all was done at 4 c approximately 0 6 g wet sediment was used for each dna extraction and dna was extracted in triplicates from each sample dna quality and quantity in extracts were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and by using the quant it picogreen dsdna assay kit thermo fisher scientific waltham

biosystems boston ma usa and universal primers for the bacterial 16s rrna gene forward and reverse tailed with pacbio universal sequence adapters table s2 detailed information on pcr reactions is given in the supplementary information si sequencing library construction was performed utilizing the smrtbell template prep kit 1 0 following the pacbio online documentation procedure checklist amplification of full length 16s gene with barcoded primers for multiplexed smrtbell library preparation and sequencing version june 2018 the libraries were sequenced on a pacbio sequel platform 2 5 sequencing data analysis raw sequencing data were processed using the smrtlink implemented secondary analysis platform provided by pacbio version 6 0 to generate demultiplexed sequences and circular consensus sequence ccs reads which were converted to fastq files table s4 the majority of reads had a number of passes i e the number of rounds that the same single molecule was sequenced through the pacbio circular sequencing mode 10 suggesting highly accurate sequence information wenger et al 2019 primer sequences were trimmed using cutadapt v1 14 martin 2011 read lengths were filtered and retained by geneious r10 biomatters ltd auckland new zealand to an average range of 1400 1600 bp afterwards samples with a total read number 1500 were excluded n 3 from downstream analysis sequence

1 10 1 algorithms for quality filtering generating high accuracy exact amplicon sequence variants asvs with single nucleotide resolution and chimera removal according to the dada2 pacbio workflow callahan et al 2019 we did not manually discard asvs low in abundance across all samples prior to the taxonomic classification idtaxa classifier wright 2016 was used with a confidence level of 50 high to map asv sequences against the silva ssu database release 132 for taxonomic classification quast et al 2013 asvs classified as mitochondria chloroplasts or unclassified root were removed the fasttree price et al 2009 algorithm was applied for generating a midpoint rooted phylogenetic tree after asv sequence alignment by the decipher package version 2 12 0 wright 2015 maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed for specific taxa i e sulfuricurvum spp and thiobacillus spp with mega x kumar et al 2018 aligned with selected reference 16s rrna gene sequences from ncbi and img m databases agarwala et al 2018 chen et al 2019 using the clustalw algorithm with default settings 1 000 bootstrap replications we utilized raw read counts and proportions for alpha and beta diversity analysis respectively cameron et al 2021 mcmurdie and holmes 2014 detailed information on alpha diversity analysis is given in the supplementary information si bray curtis dissimilarities were calculated to demonstrate differences in microbial community composition among samples at the family level using hierarchical clustering methods average linkage and non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds using the vegan package version 2 5 5 oksanen et al 2019 similarity percentage simper analysis was applied to evaluate which taxa contributed to the structural differences of two communities using the vegan package permutations 1000 version 2 5 5 oksanen et al 2019 bacterial community structure was also investigated in order to evaluate the assembly mechanisms under the impact of bidirectional water exchange in the streambed therefore a two step null model approach taking both phylogenetic distance and abundance into consideration was applied as the first step this is based on the assumption that phylogenetically close taxa are more likely to have similar ecological niches stegen et al 2013 we first calculated β mean nearest taxa distance β mntd in order to quantify the phylogenetic distance of a species in one community to its closest relatives in another β mntd was calculated with 999 randomizations then β nearest taxon index β nti which represents the number of standard deviations between the observed β mntd and the mean of the null distribution was calculated to indicate whether species in two compared communities are phylogenetically significantly close or different than expected by chance if β nti 2 a significant deviation from the null distribution is assumed indicating that species in two compared communities are phylogenetically significantly close or distinct this is likely because of deterministic environmental selection processes such as homogeneous and variable selection if β nti 2 dispersal based and other stochastic processes should be further examined we applied the bray curtis distance based raup crick index rcbray chase and myers 2011 to evaluate stochastic assembly mechanisms rcbray only requires species occurrence and abundance in one community rcbray 0 95 suggests that two communities have significantly more or less common species than expected by chance indicating homogenizing dispersal or dispersal limitation and drift processes rcbray 0 95 indicates drift or undominated processes rcbray was also calculated with 999 randomizations in assembly analysis all samples were rarefied to the 1800 reads seed 123 the minimum number of reads among all samples reads from duplicate samples were then merged and further processed using the picante package version 1 7 kembel et al 2010 moreover in this analysis we omitted samples from the confluence as we only applied this approach to samples with comprehensive hydrological metadata correlations between gene abundances and geodesic distance were calculated using spearman correlation and least square linear models in the r package stats version 4 0 3 respectively r core team 2019 packages used for data visualization are described in the si 2 6 quantitative pcr

concentrations in schönbrunnen stream water and the alluvial aquifer were repeatedly measured over several years and a representative set of water chemistry data corresponding to our sampling season is shown in fig 2b nitrate was generally highest in the northwestern most upstream section of the schönbrunnen with concentrations 50 mg l 1 consistent with the intensive agricultural activities in this area this was also reflected in the highest nitrate concentrations 60 mg l 1 found in the surrounding groundwater monitoring wells of the northwestern hillslope e g gws 2 and gws 6 interestingly the high nitrate concentrations clearly decreased along the course of the schönbrunnen and were lowest 30 mg l 1 before the confluence with the käsbach even though the farming activities vary each year the general trend of decreasing nitrate concentrations from upstream to downstream of the schönbrunnen remains the same fig s1 at selected streambed locations fine scale depth resolved pore water analyses of nitrate nitrite and doc were also conducted fig s2 these data showed a strong decline of nitrate concentrations between 0 and 20 cm below the streambed which was also the depth 10 20 cm below streambed where pore water doc concentrations were highest fig s2 similar to nitrate concentrations in the stream nitrate concentrations in groundwater decreased with increasing distance from the north western hillslope in contrast to nitrate concentrations sulfate concentrations in the stream increased over the schönbrunnen reaches with concentrations 200 mg l 1 at the confluence fig 2c sulfate concentrations were generally lower in groundwater from the northwestern hillslope but higher in eastern groundwater 1200 mg l 1 in between käsbach and schönbrunnen indicative of groundwater influenced by gypsum dissolution flowing from the east the ditch upstream of r1 was also characterized by elevated sulfate concentrations 170 mg l 1 fig 2c indicative of sulfate rich groundwater entering the stream in this upstream net gaining section 3 2 bacterial communities in streambed sediments triplicate sampling of sediment microbial communities was done in three major sections of the schönbrunnen two upstream locations up a and up b further upstream of r1 two in the midstream net losing sections mid a r3 mid b boundary of r3 r4 as well as one location each in the downstream net gaining section down boundary of r6 and directly after the confluence with the käsbach conf for all sampling locations full length 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was done at 5 and 15 cm depths corresponding to the assumed nitrate reduction zone fig s2 alpha diversity indices were similar h 5 27 0 88 across all schönbrunnen sediment samples fig s3 whereas confluence samples displayed a significantly lower diversity both at 5 and at 15 cm depth dunn s kruskal wallis p 0 01 samples from up a and the two midstream locations showed greater evenness j dunn s kruskal wallis p 0 05 than the confluence samples depth had no consistent effect on diversity indices although some significant differences were observed for specific locations for instance up a 5 cm samples showed a higher shannon diversity dunn s kruskal wallis p 0 01 than the corresponding 15 cm samples hierarchical clustering of bray curtis dissimilarities between samples revealed three major clusters fig 3 samples from the confluence formed a disparate cluster connoting that taxonomic composition was distinct here from all other samples a second major cluster mainly comprised samples from 5 cm depth as well as one set of 15 cm samples mid b the majority of the third cluster contained samples from 15 cm depth plus one set of shallow depth samples from mid a generally triplicate or duplicate libraries were grouped closely except for one replicate of the down 5 cm site which was more similar to the mid b 15 cm samples possibly reflecting small scale local heterogeneities of the sampled streambed the 9024 unique asvs identified could be assigned to 55 phyla table s5 all samples were dominated by three phyla proteobacteria 2173 asvs bacteroidota 1125 asvs and acidobacteriota 1160 asvs which all together accounted for up to 50 of each library in total 429 families were assigned nitrosomonadaceae 216 asvs chitinophagaceae 187 asvs and vicinamibacteraceae 391 asvs appeared as the most abundant families within those three dominant phyla respectively accounting for 10 relative abundance of the respective phylum on average chitinophagaceae were generally more abundant in 5 cm samples while nitrosomonadaceae were mostly more abundant in 15 cm samples especially mid and downstream in addition to these phyla the sulfurimonadaceae phylum campilobacterota were the most abundant family mean relative abundance 3 5 especially in 5 cm samples taken midstream and at the confluence from up to downstream and the confluence 12 1083 asvs of all asvs belonging to 167 families were shared between at least five out of the six sampling locations fig s4a as for the five locations within the schönbrunnen 793 asvs were presented from up to downstream the samples from 5 cm generally shared a greater number of common asvs than samples from 15 cm depth figs s4b s4c differences in bacterial community structure along the schönbrunnen were further investigated via non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and similarity percentage simper analyses fig 4 the 5 cm samples generally featured a higher abundance of typical heterotrophic aerobic or facultative anaerobic microbial lineages these included rhodanobacteraceae dominated by ahniella spp rhodobacteraceae dominated by rhodobacter and tabrizicola spp microscillaceae dominated by chryseolinea spp xanthomonadaceae dominated by arenimonas spp chitinophagaceae dominated by dinghuibacter and terrimonas spp and the saprospiraceae members of the rhodocyclaceae were also particularly abundant in 5 cm samples taken from up b and mid b 2 3 mainly including reads associated with denitratisoma dechloromonas and rhodocyclus spp fig 5 however samples from 5 cm depth of up a mid a and down also featured taxa similarly abundant at 15 cm depth of mid b these included the nitrosomonadaceae 3 and nitrospiraceae 1 in contrast the dissimilarity of bacterial communities observed in other samples from 15 cm depth was mainly driven by typical anaerobic or microaerophilic lineages this included typical fermenters anaerolineaceae anaerovoracaceae clostridiaceae and prevotellaceae potential sulfate reducers desulfobaccaceae thermodesulfovibrionia but also potential iron oxidizing bacteria within the gallionellaceae sideroxydans spp the confluence samples were clearly distinguished from the other schönbrunnen samples taxa typical for inorganic sulfide and sulfur oxidation sulfuricellaceae sulfurimonadaceae and thiobacillus spp within the hydrogenophilaceae were among the major drivers of dissimilarity between those samples moreover flavobacteriaceae flavobacterium spp and comamonadaceae rhizobacter spp were also relevant for the separation of confluence samples from others typical sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob were rather abundant throughout the schönbrunnen sediments not only at the confluence fig 3 consider their potential role in linking sulfur and nitrogen cycling in the streambed their distribution at asv level was further investigated facilitated by the high resolution of full length 16s rrna amplicon reads we specifically focused on asvs within two dominating genera sulfuricurvum spp relative abundance up to 14 79 and thiobacillus spp relative abundance up to 5 6 sulfuricurvum spp was the only taxon within the sulfurimonadaceae detected in this study thiobacillus spp 73 asvs took up 99 88 of the family hydrogenophilaceae and unclassified hydrogenophilaceae 2 asvs took up 0 12 of the family hydrogenophilaceae were genera detected within hydrogenophilaceae in total 65 asvs were identified within the genus sulfuricurvum including 34 of them were only detected within schönbrunnen samples such as the most dominant asv9 relative abundance up to 1 99 fig 6 a however some asvs especially asv2 and asv8 relative abundance up to 3 71 and 3 23 respectively were found exclusively in the confluence samples another typical sulfur oxidizing lineage detected was thiobacillus here out of 73 asvs detected in total fig 6b only two asvs appeared specifically enriched at the confluence asv19 relative abundance up to 1 26 and asv127 relative abundance up to 0 61 in the schönbrunnen streambed asv3 relative abundance up to 1 12 and asv291 relative abundance up to 0 33 were relatively more abundant for further context on the detected asvs asvs within both sulfuricurvum spp and thiobacillus spp were embedded in phylogenetic dendrograms figs 7 a 7b the phylogenetic tree of sulfuricurvum spp revealed that schönbrunnen and confluence asvs were separated into two distinct clusters nominated schönbrunnen cluster and käsbach cluster fig 7a the phylogenetic tree of thiobacillus spp suggested that schönbrunnen and confluence asvs of thiobacillus spp were closely related to thiobacillus thioparus whereas asv19 and asv291 were more related to thiobacillus thiophilus and thiobacillus denitrificans respectively fig 7b 3 3 streambed community assembly to investigate the potential impact of bidirectional water exchange on the assembly of bacterial communities in the streambed the β nearest taxon β nti and rcbray indices were inferred the importance of deterministic versus stochastic microbial community assembly can thus be estimated stegen et al 2013 2012 for samples in this study over half of pairwise comparisons resulted in β nti values 2 significantly different from the expectation of the null model fig 8 this indicated that the community assembly of schönbrunnen sediments was largely triggered by deterministic variable selection a β nti index 2 generally suggests that a pair of samples is likely to be selected by stochastic processes the rcbray index was calculated to further delineate these patterns an rcbray index 0 95 or 0 95 indicates that two samples share more asvs or fewer asvs than expected respectively we assume that homogenizing dispersal could be relevant between samples from 5 cm and 15 cm of the same sampling location depending on the local hydraulic conditions indeed a homogenizing dispersal was suggested at up a and mid a sampling spots moreover a longitudinal homogenizing dispersal was observed between 5 cm samples of up a and mid a and between 15 cm samples of mid a and down 3 4 quantification of denitrifying communities in addition to 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing we also quantified absolute abundances of bacterial 16s rrna and nitrite reduction genes indicative of denitrifying communities over the schönbrunnen streambed bacterial 16s rrna genes ranged from 9 1 2 5 106 to 9 0 8 107 copies gww 1 of sediment fig 9 a nirk genes were more abundant than nirs across all samples ranging from 2 2 1 2 105 to 5 3 2 5 106 copies gww 1 of sediment the abundance of bacterial 16s rrna genes was positively correlated with the abundance of nirk r 0 791 p 0 001 pearson s and nirs r 0 909 p 0 001 pearson s genes a notable increase in the relative abundance of nirk genes to up to 10 of total bacterial 16s rrna gene counts was observed from upstream to downstream samples especially at 15 cm depth fig 9b a positive linear relationship p 0 05 adjusted r 2 0 235 was noted between the relative abundance of nirk and the geodesic distance from upstream to confluence 4 discussion in this study we comprehensively interrogate the microbial community structure in the streambed of the schönbrunnen an agriculturally impacted first order stream we differentiate microbes in sections of the streambed where seasonal bidirectional gaining and losing fluxes of water are occurring we propose that the demonstrated longitudinal and vertical heterogeneity of the streambed microbial communities and the distribution of distinct functional capacities were impacted by this specific hydrologic setting here we discuss the evidence supporting these conclusions as well as the implications for our understanding of the reactivity of lower order streams 4 1 bidirectional water exchange as a control of water chemistry and streambed bacterial communities the influence of bidirectional water exchange on the biogeochemistry of lower order streams may represent an under regarded mechanism for the control of solute fluxes in the catchment jimenez fernandez et al 2022 our hydrological analyses delineate the schönbrunnen from upstream to downstream of which upstream and downstream sections were identified as net gaining whereas midstream sections were identified as net losing reaches irrespective of small scale local heterogeneities of gross bidirectional fluxes revealed by salt tracer tests e g location mid a it has been proposed that such net losing reaches could represent reactive hot spots for denitrification along infiltrating river water trauth et al 2018 under losing conditions microbial denitrification will largely depend on sediment borne electron donors and on doc that is still available after oxygen depletion from the infiltrating stream water water leaving the schönbrunnen in midstream net losing sections however may not immediately return to the stream or return to the stream as groundwater exfiltration after a prolonged travel distance and mixing with the surrounding groundwater mixing of stream and groundwater is not likely in the first few decimeters below the streambed this differentiates the hydrologic setting from typical hyporheic flow and hyporheic exchange processes in which stream water infiltrates into the streambed and subsequently returns to the stream over short flow distances mainly induced by complex streambed morphology bayani cardenas and wilson 2006 hester et al 2013 however if nitrate reduction is largely associated with infiltrating water fluxes nitrate concentrations in the stream water of net losing reaches e g midstream should remain relatively constant this was observed in our study fig 2b instream nitrate concentrations only decreased in downstream net gaining reaches r5 and r6 where adjacent groundwater depleted in nitrate fig s2 and enriched in sulfate and likely also sulfide or other reduced sulfur species entered the schönbrunnen under gaining scenarios mixing of groundwater and reduced solutes with the stream water in shallower depths of the streambed should thus result in a distinct reactivity compared to sections of stream water infiltration over the schönbrunnen longitudinal profile nitrate concentrations appeared tentatively negatively correlated with that of sulfate indicating that sulfur and nitrogen cycling in downstream net gaining reaches were possibly linked we propose that bidirectional water exchange fluxes not only affected water chemistry but also shaped streambed bacterial communities the high spatial variability of abiotic factors that determined the local presence and relative abundance of microbial taxa should be apparent in strong deterministic variable selection patterns dini andreote et al 2015 over the schönbrunnen stream in accordance microbial communities in top streambed sediments of the schönbrunnen mostly showed high ßnti values 2 indicating strong variable selection stegen et al 2013 this was consistent with previous studies on river sediment bacterial community assembly danczak et al 2016 graham et al 2017 however dispersal based stochastic processes especially homogenizing dispersal processes rcbray 0 95 were found in samples from typical net gaining reaches e g up a and down homogenizing dispersal patterns can be an indicator of the actual physical transport of organisms stegen et al 2016 and thus might infer the impact of groundwater exfiltration under the specific hydrologic setting of schönbrunnen homogenizing dispersal patterns were also observed at mid a which was located in reach r3 predominated by net losing conditions according to groundwater heads figs 2a 8 however several lines of circumstantial evidence indicate that mid a might also be impacted by local exfiltration fluxes of groundwater similar to upstream and downstream samples on the one hand bidirectional gross fluxes are likely in all reaches tracer tests showed that gaining and losing water fluxes in r3 could be very similar fig 2a on the other hand the mid a 5 cm samples showed similar bacterial community composition as other 15 cm samples whereas mid b appeared more representative of the generally net losing conditions midstream fig 3 moreover the presence of a greater abundance of asvs affiliated with sulfuricurvum spp was also observed at up a and down two obvious groundwater exfiltration spots such local heterogeneities in gross hydrologic fluxes and streambed microbiomes were fortuitously recovered in our study as the streambed permeability of the schönbrunnen is consistently low according to our estimation the transport of microbial populations and homogenizing processes due to bidirectional water fluxes can be further constrained saup et al 2019 yet apart from bidirectional water fluxes substrate factors like fine scale geochemical heterogeneities e g redox potential and ph or the sediment matrix may also be relevant in controlling local communities graham et al 2017 jorgensen et al 2012 pett ridge et al 2006 vos et al 2013 to more comprehensively document and quantify such patterns at smaller scales a more comprehensive spatial sampling grid per reach may clearly be necessary in the future dispersal based assembly processes can lead to rather maladapted local communities and can therefore restrict the biogeochemical potentials and functional stability of specific communities graham and stegen 2017 however in our study dispersal based assembly processes were found at locations dominated by exfiltration in concert with a high abundance of sulfur oxidizing and autotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria thus chemolithoautotrophic mechanisms rather than canonical denitrification processes might actually be prioritized at groundwater exfiltration sections the extent of the contribution of chemolithoautotrophic nitrate reduction versus physical mixing between nitrate depleted exfiltrating groundwater and stream water to overall nitrate removal from the stream in downstream sections remains to be further elucidated nevertheless such fine scale heterogeneities in exchange fluxes and microbial community structure in streambed sediments have not been reported to date but may be relevant indicators of streambed reactivity in situ 4 2 microbial communities potentially involved in nitrate reduction our data suggest that distinct mechanisms could be driving microbial nitrate reduction in the streambed of different sections of the schönbrunnen firstly the net losing sections appeared to be associated with heterotrophic denitrifiers in the streambed although absolute or relative abundances of denitrification genes were not the highest in this section fig 9 respective sediment communities especially in mid b were clearly enriched in typical canonical heterotrophic denitrifier lineages these included members of the rhodobacteraceae tarhriz et al 2013 tosques et al 1997 flavobacteriaceae tekedar et al 2017 comamonadaceae khan et al 2002 wang and chu 2016 rhodocyclaceae fahrbach et al 2006 all known to host typical nirk or nirs carrying denitrifiers the abundance of these potential denitrifiers especially the rhodocyclaceae was increased in 5 cm samples of up b and mid b whereas the relative abundance of potential sulfur associated autotrophic nitrate reducers including sulfuricurvum and thiobacillus beller et al 2006 kodama and watanabe 2004 was relatively low here figs 5 6 dominant genera within the rhodocyclaceae were well known denitrifiers such as denitratisoma dechloromonas fahrbach et al 2006 horn et al 2005 as well as rhodocyclus spp tang et al 2020 in turn potential sulfur driven nitrate reducing populations were more abundant in groundwater exfiltration locations such as up a mid a and down the phylogenetic tree for sulfuricurvum spp revealed two major clusters of asvs distributed between schönbrunnen and käsbach fig 7a species level taxonomy of sulfuricurvum spp reads was not fully resolved due to the existence of only a few pure culture isolates fida et al 2021 han et al 2012 kodama and watanabe 2004 li et al 2019 even though the schönbrunnen cluster was mostly related to sulfuricurvum kujiense kodama and watanabe 2004 the käsbach cluster did not include any previously reported sulfuricurvum isolates the currently known sulfuricurvum strains are known for respiratory reduction of nitrate but not of nitrite fida et al 2021 in addition the asvs of another typical sulfide and sulfur oxidizer thiobacillus spp hydrogenophilaceae were widespread in both schönbrunnen and confluence sediments currently three species have been described within the genus t thioparus t thiophilus and t denitrificans boden et al 2017 t denitrificans is a well defined denitrifier and carries nirs genes beller et al 2006 t thioparus and t thiophilus may perform only partial denitrification reducing nitrate to nitrite hutt et al 2017 kellerman and griebler 2009 thus both the detected sulfuricurvum and thiobacillus spp could have contributed to a sulfide and or other sulfur species driven nitrate reduction especially in streambeds impacted by gaining fluxes it has been previously proposed that the infiltration of stream water rich in nitrate and organic carbon may trigger heterotrophic denitrification in streambeds whereas the exfiltration of reduced groundwater could prioritize autotrophic denitrifiers and dnra graham et al 2017 storey et al 2004 while high ratios between organic carbon and nitrate are known to generally trigger dnra wang et al 2020 also high sulfide levels in aquatic environments may favour this process delgado vela et al 2020 dnra was reported to dominate over denitrification in salt marsh sediments amended with 100 µm sulfide murphy et al 2020 although sulfide was not routinely measured in our regular field sampling across the schönbrunnen catchment during our study total sulfide concentrations measured in sediments in the following year reached values of 50 μm at a depth of 2 cm data not shown apart from such exemplary porewater measurements groundwater from the southeastern monitoring wells e g gws 25 clearly smelled sulfidic upon sampling apart from sulfuricurvum spp several other lineages detected in our libraries are also known for dnra such as geobacter spp van den berg et al 2017 members of the desulfocapsaceae arshad et al 2017 bell et al 2020 or sulfurimonas spp bell et al 2020 generally nirk carrying denitrifiers have a greater probability of harbouring a respiratory dnra pathway nrfa as well while nirs carrying nitrate reducers are more likely to perform complete denitrification helen et al 2016 despite some bacteria carrying both nirk or nirs genes most known nitrate reducers only have one copy of either of the two genes etchebehere and tiedje 2005 graf et al 2014 however even though the distribution pattern of nirk genes appeared more related to nitrate concentration in the stream rather than nirs linking nirk genes with denitrification rates in situ must be done with caution graham et al 2010 veraart et al 2017 to further address this the site specific in situ denitrification rates should be determined across reaches 4 3 pacbio long read sequencing for a high resolution dissection of sediment microbial communities pacbio long read sequencing of full length 16s rrna gene amplicons provided a valuable opportunity to dissect sediment bacterial communities at a robust and taxonomically informative asv level lam et al 2020 in contrast to the more widely used short illumina reads long read asvs can likely be resolved beyond the genus level callahan et al 2017 as exemplified for the species level resolution for asvs of sulfur oxidizing populations here this may well be relevant to assess spatial patterns in investigated populations and to infer their potential impact on streambed biogeochemistry although 16s rrna gene affiliation can be only an indicator not a diagnostic for actual process relevance within environmental microbiomes functionally relevant context like a reliable differentiation between t denitrificans and other thiobacillus related asvs would not have been possible using shorter reads though pacbio long read sequencing does not produce comparable amounts of total sequencing output as other platforms it can offer comparable biodiversity coverage for more frequent taxa lam et al 2020 as shown here this may be relevant for the functional interpretation of environmental amplicon datasets 5 conclusions in this study we show that bidirectional water exchange between an agricultural first order stream and the surrounding alluvial aquifer is important not only for stream water chemistry but also for sediment microbial populations and their presumed activities in attenuating agricultural solute inputs by disentangling the stream into net gaining and losing sections we show that sediment microbial community assembly was mostly dominated by deterministic heterogeneous assembly processes except for zones of the streambed influenced by groundwater exfiltration such net gaining sections were associated with an enrichment of typical sulfur oxidizing lineages indicative of possibly ongoing sulfur driven autotrophic nitrate attenuation processes in contrast canonical heterotrophic denitrifying populations were more abundant in midstream net losing reaches of the schönbrunnen our study thus advances the current understanding of the reactivity of lower order streams towards incoming agricultural pollutants compared to more natural lower order streams we propose a reactivity of the streambed and an assembly of its microbiota strongly impacted by bidirectional water exchange fluxes rather than by bedform driven hyporheic flow given that the schönbrunnen is located in a very typical agricultural landscape in central europe we are confident that this concept is generally relevant also for other comparable lower order streams in agricultural lowlands even if local explicit turnover processes and microbial communities will be distinct this may open new opportunities for stream management and restoration as well as for the prediction of watershed level pollutant attenuation and water quality in agricultural landscapes credit authorship contribution statement zhe wang investigation writing original draft formal analysis
