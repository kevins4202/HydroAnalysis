9465,in arid and semi arid regions water scarcity and soil salinization are major factors impacting sustainable agricultural production in this study a macroscopic root water uptake model was used to adapt a plant water deficit index pwdi for irrigation scheduling under conditions of coexisting soil water and salinity stress causing factors the traditional approach estimating pwdi with average root zone soil water and salt amounts was improved by weighting the effects of soil water and salinity according to the normalized root length density profile an experiment growing wheat triticum aestivum l in soil columns and an experiment growing cotton gossypium hirsutum l in a salinized field were implemented to explore and quantify the effects of soil water and salinity conditions on plant water status and thus to validate the improvement and evaluate its application by monitoring soil water and salinity dynamics and plant growth indexes e g leaf area dry weight leaf water potential transpiration and yield the results indicate that even under conditions with equal root zone averages of soil matric and osmotic potentials plant water status might be significantly different in general plants were less stressed when more water and less salinity were allocated in the upper root zone with more roots while less water and more salinity occurred in the lower root zone with less roots by referring to some information in the soil column experiment a numerical experiment was conducted to further demonstrate the improvement the root weighted approach resulted in improved pwdi estimation and thus was more reliable for irrigation scheduling leading to higher irrigation frequency and quantity leaf area index biomass yield and transpiration without significant decrease in water productivity however further improvement could be possible by considering the effects of historical soil water and salinity stresses as well as meteorological conditions on plant

distributed around the world accounting for about 7 of total land area and seriously threatening agricultural production and ecosystem stability wichelns and qadir 2014 li et al 2018 in some arid and semi arid regions such as xinjiang territory in northwest china about 32 of total irrigated land is saline yang et al 2019 therefore to enhance water productivity wp defined as crop yield per unit of applied irrigation water and or to increase yield itself in arid and semiarid regions irrigation scheduling must be designed to relieve water and salinity stresses simultaneously li et al 2016 salinity affects crops both via non specific lowering of soil osmotic potential sop and by specific ion toxicity homaee 1999 karlberg et al 2006 in saline soil root water uptake rwu often declines with decreasing water potential gradient between soil and roots resulting from decreased soil water content and or increased salt concentration in soil solution homaee et al 2002a 2002b water deficit occurs when plant transpiration cannot satisfy atmospheric demand the ratio of decrease in transpiration relative to demand is defined as a plant water deficit index pwdi woli et al 2012 shi et al 2015 1 pwdi t p t a t p 1 t a t p where t a and t p are the actual and potential transpiration rates cm d 1 respectively proper evaluation of pwdi can promote accurate irrigation to efficiently use water resources and or enhance production shi et al 2015 2020 wu et al 2017 in addition to transpiration other physiological indicators such as leaf water potential photosynthetic rate leaf stomatal conductance or canopy temperature can theoretically also reflect plant water deficit gardner et al 1992 jones 2004 candogan et al 2013 and be used for irrigation scheduling nevertheless these plant and canopy based indicators suffer from difficulty and expense in data acquisition and challenge in translating data into irrigation quantities jones 2004 shi et al 2015 wu et al 2017 alternatively the soil based approach has been more widely adopted by taking soil water and salinity conditions into account such as dirksen et al 1993 homaee et al 2002c muñoz carpena et al 2008 2 pwdi 1 γ h β φ where h and φ are the arithmetic averages of soil matric potential smp and sop over the root zone cm respectively γ h and β φ are dimensionless soil water and salinity stress response functions respectively in fact besides soil water and salt amounts the relative positions of water and salt to roots also significantly impact plant transpiration by changing soil water effectiveness raats 1974 homaee 1999 homaee et al 2002a fujimaki et al 2008 when soil water and salt amounts over the root zone are constant more water or less salt in sub zones with more roots is beneficial for water uptake compared to situations where more water or less salt occurs in soil with less roots dirksen et al 1993 homaee 1999 shi et al 2015 tzohar et al 2021 to accurately estimate pwdi with a soil based approach in addition to soil water and salt amounts the relative distribution relationship among water salt and roots should therefore also be considered under conditions with negligible salinity stress shi et al 2015 improved the soil based approach to estimate pwdi by weighting the effect of soil water according to root distribution 3 pwdi 1 0 1 γ h l n r d z r dz r where z r z l r is the normalized depth z is the positive downwards vertical coordinate cm originating from the soil surface and l r is rooting depth cm l nrd z r is the normalized root length density nrld h is the smp cm this improvement has been validated to more accurately evaluate plant water status under various soil atmosphere crop and irrigation conditions shi et al 2015 wu et al 2017 compared to the traditional approach based on eq 2 in the lysimetric experiment the relative errors of pwdi estimation was reduced from 12 1 19 0 to 9 1 9 5 and thus taking root weighted pwdi as a signal to initiate irrigation led to higher irrigation precision yield and wp wu et al 2017 furthermore the improved pwdi estimation exhibited great potential in data driven smart irrigation by promoting timely supply of appropriate quantities of water to crops according to predetermined targets of yield and or wp shi et al 2020 2021 however the improvement of pwdi estimation obtained under drought stressed condition cannot be applied in saline soil where water and salinity stresses coexist consequently the objective of the current study was to improve pwdi estimation in saline soil by exploring and quantifying the effects of soil water and salinity conditions on plant water status and subsequently to evaluate the effects of the improvement on irrigation scheduling crop yield and wp 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical background to improve pwdi estimation for water and salinity stressed crops assuming the maximal rwu rate under optimal soil conditions s max cm3 cm 3 d 1 is proportional to root length density the actual rwu rate s cm3 cm 3 d 1 of water and salinity stressed crops can be described as follows belmans et al 1983 homaee 1999 feddes and raats 2004 4 s z γ h β φ s max z γ h β φ t p l n r

conditions on plant water status weighted by nrld since root length density information is still difficult to measure timely in practice a generalized function of nrld can be adopted to make the root weighted pwdi estimation approach feasible zuo et al 2013 shi et al 2015 2020 8 l n r d z r p 1 z r p 1 where p is a fitting parameter representing the nrld at soil surface z r 0 various functional

winter wheat triticum aestivum l shijiazhuang 8 conducted in 2009 and partially described by wang et al 2012 was adopted to investigate the effects of the relative distribution relationship among soil water salt and roots on plant water status and thus to verify the theoretical improvement for estimating pwdi in total 156 polyvinyl chloride columns 53 cm high by 15 cm in diameter were prepared and each was reconnected by two halves and sealed at its bottom all the columns were packed with air dried sandy soil up to the height of 50 cm at a bulk density of 1 65 g cm 3 table 1 the original soil nutrient status was poor and negligible and the initial soil salt content was 0 23 g kg 1 soil water retention table 1 was measured with a pressure membrane plate soil moisture equipment co usa and

and w1s3 treatments columns were irrigated to field capacity and the irrigation amount for w2 w2s1 w2s2 and w2s3 treatments was half of that corresponding to the w1 treatments three columns were randomly chosen from each treatment and then were weighed daily at 20 00 to determine evapotranspiration rom 22 to 51 das sampling was carried out twice every 6 d 0 5 and 5 5 d after each irrigation event for a total of 10 times for each sampling event two columns from each treatment were opened after removing shoots soil cores were cut into 5 cm soil layers and soil was sampled to measure water content by oven drying to a constant weight at 105 c and electrical conductivity ec of 1 5 soil water extracts s230 seven compact usa green leaves were scanned perfection v700 seiko epson japan and analyzed with a software package winrhizo regent instruments inc canada for leaf area for each treatment three additional soil columns without plants were simultaneously managed with soil water contents kept similar to those with plants by adjusting irrigation amount the soil columns without plants were also weighed daily at 20 00 to determine soil evaporation and thus daily transpiration under each treatment was estimated by subtracting soil evaporation from evapotranspiration zuo et al 2006 2 2 2 exp 2 a field experiment of cotton to validate the results in exp 1 and investigate the effects of applying the improved pwdi estimation method on irrigation scheduling crop growth water consumption and yield a field experiment of cotton gossypium hirsutum l xinnongda 2 was conducted at the experimental station of xinjiang agricultural university 85 40 33 e 44 26 20 n shawan county xinjiang china the station is located in a continental mid temperate arid region with an annual mean precipitation of 14 35 cm where supplemental irrigation is necessary for successful cotton production tang et al 2010 the soil from surface to 100 cm depth can be divided into three layers with a mean salt content of 4 19 g kg 1 soil properties were measured as described for exp 1 table 1 water content at field capacity was determined corresponding to smp of 300 cm for silty loam soil romano and santini 2002 on april 21 st 2018 sterilized seeds were sown in 16 independent plots 690 cm wide by 750 cm long including three strips with a planting mode of one film three drip lines and six rows fig 1a the interval between plants was 12 cm in each row and the space between drippers 2 4 l h 1 was 30 cm along the line in a similar pattern and density 5 plants were planted in 12 nearby weighing lysimeters 60 cm in diameter and 83 cm high fig 1b in which the soil profile from surface to 80 cm depth was the same as that in the field according to local agricultural production management

monoammonium phosphate and 130 05 kg k2o hm 2 of drip potassium fertilizer were applied through fertigation for each drip irrigation event fertilizer was pulsed into the irrigation water within the last 30 min fertilizer amounts were determined according to the nutrient demand along the various growth stages and dry matter accumulation pattern in cotton makhdum et al 2007 specifically the fertilization at seedling before 48 das budding 49 68 das flowering and bolling 69 113 das and boll opening 114 160 das stages of cotton accounted for 3 23 67 and 7 of the seasonal application amount respectively from sowing to june 22 nd 2018 62 das there was 6 64 cm precipitation which was supplemented with 7 14 cm irrigation to the lysimeters and field plots table 2 subsequently four irrigation treatments were designed with three replicates in lysimeters and four replicates in the field for w1 w2 w3 and w4 treatments irrigation was initiated when the estimated pwdi exceeded the predesigned thresholds of 0 36 0 46 0 46 and 0 58 respectively for w1 w2 and w4 treatments pwdi was estimated with eq 7 named as pwdi ra while eq 2 for w3 treatment pwdi ta for each event irrigation depth i cm

with a salt content of 0 49 g l 1 a ph value of 7 85 and an ec value of 932 65 μs cm 1 according to local commercial practice irrigation ceased for all the treatments during the last month before harvesting regardless of pwdi estimation an outlet was installed at the bottom of each lysimeter for drainage measurement daily transpiration was estimated according to the weights of lysimeter and plants as well as drainage due to the negligible soil evaporation under film mulch for each treatment one lysimeter was randomly chosen to measure soil water content temperature permittivity and ec every 30 min at 5 10 15 20 35 55 and 75 cm depth using soil sensors tdr315 acclima usa an automatic agro meteorological station weatherhawk 500 campbell scientific usa was installed adjacent to the lysimeters to monitor data including air temperature relative humidity rainfall solar radiation and wind speed from sowing to harvest at 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 cm depth under drip tape soil in each plot was sampled 5 7 times before triggering irrigation to measure soil water content and ec of 1 5 soil water extracts as described for exp 1 and to calibrate the tdr315 probes in addition during seedling budding flowering and bolling and boll opening stages on 53 84 113 and 137 das respectively three plants were randomly removed from the two lateral strips in each plot to measure leaf area as described for exp 1 and aboveground biomass by drying to a constant weight at 70 c to compare the real time plant water status among treatments the water potential of the youngest fully expanded leaves before triggering irrigation was measured 4 times under each treatment using a pressure chamber pms corvallis oregon usa at about 11 00 am on 158 das by excluding 1 5 m at both ends of the middle strip a non sampling zone 4 5 2 3 m2 was reserved to measure yield manually 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 theoretical pwdi calculation to theoretically evaluate plant water status according to eq

samplings many studies have revealed that when soil water conditions are immediately ameliorated by irrigation rwu and transpiration can only recover gradually from stress status usually taking several days bielorai and hopmans 1975 wu et al 2020 under w1s1 treatment in exp 1 due to negligible salinity stress and nutrient solution supply every 6 days wheat was assumed to recover completely and the measured maximal actual transpiration rate per unit effective leaf area t ae v a la e cm d 1 during each irrigation cycle was assumed as t pe wu et al 2020 subsequently t pe was fitted as a

statistical results for wheat p 3 85 zuo et al 2013 and cotton p 1 96 ning et al 2015 were adopted respectively fig 2 for the soil water and salt thresholds impacting wheat and cotton growth in eqs 9

estimated in exp 1 fig 3 and re estimated in exp 2 fig 4 based on the traditional approach eq 2 pwdi ta and the root weighted approach eq 7 pwdi ra therefore the pwdi thresholds 0 36 0 46 0 46 and 0 58 initially designed to trigger the irrigation events under w1 w4 treatments in exp 2 on the linear assumption of eqs 9 and 10 were adjusted to 0 39 0 49 0 49 and 0 62 fig 4 according to the re estimated pwdi values 3 1 the effects of soil water and salinity conditions on plant water status during the treatment period from 16 to 51 das in exp 1 the total input amounts of water and nacl supplied for each column were 1310 cm3 and zero 1130 cm3 and 3390 mg 990 cm3 and 4950 mg under w1s1 w1s2 and w1s3 treatments while those under w2s1 w2s2 and w2s3 treatments were half respectively fig 3 as per experimental design before each irrigation event the average of smp over the root zone for w1 w1s1 w1s2 and w1s3 treatments was correspondingly higher than w2 w2s1 w2s2 and w2s3 treatments fig 5a and thus the leaf area index and transpiration under w2 treatments were significantly lower fig 6a and b similarly under w1 or w2 treatments the increasing nacl input from s1 to s2 and even s3 level resulting in gradually lower sop fig 5b significantly limited wheat growth and transpiration figs 6a and b under w1 treatments compared to s1 the mean smp before each irrigation event for s2 or s3 was higher even though irrigation was less fig 5a also indicating that transpiration consumption was significantly reduced fig 6b by increasing nacl fig 5b throughout the various irrigation periods the maximum pwdi th values under w1s1 or w2s1 without nacl input were relatively stable while under the other four treatments they generally increased with irrigation times and amounts fig 3 resulting from the increased nacl input and decreased sop fig 5b in general with decreasing input of water and increasing input of salt plant water status gradually deteriorated accompanied by higher pwdi th fig 3 slower growth fig 6a and less transpiration consumption fig 6b agreeing well with previous findings homaee 1999 hütsch et al 2014 the average pwdi th during the treatment period increased from 0 16 under w1s1 to 0 29 0 34 0 34 0 42 and even 0 49 under w1s2 w1s3 w2s1 w2s2 and w2s3 respectively in addition to soil water and salt amounts plant transpiration and water status should also be affected by the distribution relationship among water salt and roots raats 1974 homaee 1999 shi et al 2015 tzohar et al 2021 on 32 5 das under w1s3 the root zone averaged smp 232 4 cm and sop 9995 4 cm were very similar to those 262 5 cm and 9952 2 cm on 44 5 das under w1s2 fig 5 while pwdi th was much lower 0 48 versus 0 58 figs 3b and c due to the fact that the former soil water and salt distribution patterns fig 7 were more beneficial for rwu connecting the smp and sop profiles fig 7 with nrld distribution fig 2 indicated that compared to 44 5 das under w1s2 on 32 5 das under w1s3 more water and less salinity were allocated in the upper root zone with more roots while less water and more salinity occurred in the lower root zone with less roots and thus plants were less stressed by water and salinity this demonstrated the importance of considering the relative position of roots to soil water and salt when adopting the soil based approach to estimate pwdi under the circumstance only considering the amounts of soil water and salt as in the traditional approach of eq 2 pwdi was always underestimated to mask the extent of the stress before irrigation events in exp 1 fig 3 since most of water was located in the lower root zone with few roots figs 2 and 7 and its effectiveness was overestimated for example on 44 5 das under w1s2 and 32 5 das under w1s3 compared to pwdi th pwdi ta was underestimated 34 8 fig 3b and 32 3 fig 3c respectively besides real time conditions previous soil water and salinity conditions might also impact plant water status pérez pérez et al 2007 wu et al 2020 known as a hysteresis effect after almost all the irrigation or rainfall events in exps 1 and 2 pwdi th gradually decreased to its minimum through 1 3 days and then increased until next water input event figs 3 and 4 indicating that wheat and cotton could not recover immediately from previous water and or salinity stress guo et al 2015 wu et al 2020 therefore according to the traditional approach of eq 2 pwdi ta was always significantly underestimated during the recovery periods i e the descending processes of pwdi th figs 3 and 4 3 2 improving pwdi estimation by considering the relative distribution relationship among soil water salt and roots generally compared to the traditional soil based approach whether for winter wheat in growth chambers or for cotton under field conditions the root weighted approach could significantly enhance pwdi estimation precision except during the recovery periods 1 3 days following irrigation or rainfall corresponding to the descending processes of pwdi th with widely observed and reported hysteresis phenomena figs 3 and 4 on the non recovery day prior to irrigation for all the treatments in exp 1 the determination coefficient r2 between the estimated and theoretical pwdi values increased from 0 84 for pwdi ta to 0 95 for pwdi ra and rmse decreased from 0 13 to 0 03 fig 3 similarly compared to pwdi ta pwdi ra agreed better with pwdi th under each treatment in exp 2 with higher r2 and lower rmse fig 4 during the entire treatment period from 61 to 135 das in exp 2 the relative errors of average pwdi ra 4 0 12 2 to average pwdi th were also much lower than those of average pwdi ta 14 6 28 0 for the four treatments table 2 during the recovery periods when the hysteresis effect of previous water and salinity stress dominated pérez pérez et al 2007 significant improvement was not found when salinity stress was negligible wu et al 2020 improved the soil based approach to estimate pwdi by quantifying the hysteresis effect however determining methods for incorporating plant response hysteresis for cases where crops are simultaneously stressed by water and salinity require further study to further demonstrate the improvement through additionally considering the effects of the relative distribution relationship among water salt and roots a numerical experiment exp n was conducted by referring to some information in exp 1 the measured data on 32 5 das under w1s3 treatment were chosen to create various combinations regarding the relative distribution relationship among water salt and roots by keeping constant absolute arithmetic averages of smp and sop over root zone h 232 4 cm φ 9995 4 cm five profiles were respectively assumed for h w 1 w 5 and φ s 1 s 5 according to different functions including exactly the same as the nrld function for wheat zuo et al 2013 no 1 in fig 8 and its inverse situation no 2 two linear no 3 and 4 and one uniform no 5 under each situation pwdi was estimated through eqs 2 and 7 respectively for the 25 5 5 scenarios pwdi ta equaled to 0 32 consistently while pwdi ra fluctuated sharply table 3 sensitive to the relative position of water and salt to roots with increasing mean absolute difference between the normalized h or φ profile and the cited nrld function of wheat zuo et al 2013 fig 2 pwdi ra decreased from 0 66 under w 1s 1 0 03 under w 2s 2 table 3 this result indicated that w 1s 1 was the worst situation when the three profiles of normalized h φ and root length density coincided while w 2s 2 was the most favorable due to the opposite distributions of h and φ to roots agreeing well with rwu mechanism raats 1974 homaee 1999 furthermore the larger the deviation of the normalized distribution of h or φ from the uniform compared to the traditional approach the improvement resulted from the root weighted approach was more significant table 3 for example from w 5s 5 to w 3s 3 and w 1s 1 the improvement of the root weighted approach increased from 0 00 to 0 18 and even 0 34 change in meteorological factors would also impact plant water status li et al 2006 wu et al 2017 in exp 2 besides irrigation and rainfall events the dynamics of wind speed or solar radiation also resulted in sharp fluctuation of pwdi th fig 4 however whether the improved or traditional approach was adopted pwdi estimation could not catch the fluctuation of pwdi th caused by the change of meteorological conditions some recent studies have indicated that the lower threshold of optimal soil water and salt conditions h l in eq 9 or φ l in eq 10 should be adjusted according to weather conditions rather than a constant homaee et al 2002a 2002b groenveld et al 2013 yang et al 2013 3 3 the effects of root weighted pwdi estimation on irrigation scheduling crop growth and water use during the short period after an irrigation or rainfall event smp and sop always decreased with soil depth and pwdi ra was lower than pwdi ta since the effectiveness of soil water in the upper root zone with most roots was underestimated by the traditional approach figs 3 and 4 subsequently due to the higher rwu rate in the upper root zone smp and sop generally increased with soil depth fig 7 and pwdi ra were higher than pwdi ta since the effectiveness of soil water in the lower root zone with few roots was overestimated by the traditional approach figs 3 and 4 on the days just before all the irrigation events in exps 1 and 2 pwdi ta was about 25 0 lower than pwdi ra on average therefore compared to the root weighted approach if the traditional approach is adopted to schedule irrigation by comparing pwdi with a pre designed threshold irrigation would be almost always delayed and crops would suffer more serious stress than the designed fig 4 agreeing well with previous results for maize only stressed by water wu et al 2017 for instance during a typical irrigation cycle from 62 to 67 das under w4 treatment in exp 2 with a pwdi threshold of 0 62 pwdi ra increased from 0 40 to 0 62 while pwdi ta increased from 0 35 to 0 43 only fig 4d coincidentally on 78 das the two treatments w2 and w3 with an identical pwdi threshold of 0 49 while different pwdi estimation methods were simultaneously irrigated figs 4b and 4c however the leaf water potential before irrigation under w2 based on pwdi ra 1 78 0 10 mpa was much higher than that under w3 based on pwdi ta 2 65 0 15 mpa during the whole treatment period cotton under w2 was supplied 40 82 cm water via 25 irrigation events accompanied by an average leaf water potential of 1 84 mpa before irrigation while only 12 97 cm via 8 irrigation events was applied under w3 with an average leaf water potential of 2 92 mpa figs 4b and 4c table 2 compared to w3 higher irrigation frequency and quantity under w2 promoted crop transpiration and growth leading to higher leaf area index biomass and yield figs 6c and 6d table 2 on 137 das aboveground biomass and leaf area index under w2 were 136 9 and 78 7 higher than those under w3 leading to a 98 4 higher yield in exp 2 wp generally increased with increasing stress degree of water and salinity and then decreased under extreme stress condition of w4 agreeing well with many other previous studies kang et al 2002 candogan et al 2013 shi et al 2020 although cotton under w2 was less stressed significant decrease in wp was not found under w2 in comparison to w3 which might be attributed to the favorable effects of timely irrigation at critical growth stages shi et al 2020 for example at flowering and bolling stages 69 113 das when cotton was evidently sensitive to drought and salinity stress doorenbos 1977 li et al 2016 irrigation was carried out 17 times under w2 and only 5 times under w3 figs 3b and c 4 conclusions besides soil water and salt amounts their relative positions to roots also significantly affect plant water status therefore the traditional soil based approach estimating plant water deficit index on the root zone averages of soil matric and osmotic potentials was remarkably improved by weighting the effects of soil water and salt according to normalized root length density compared to the traditional approach the root weighted approach led to better estimation except for the situations with uniform soil matric and osmotic potentials or root system and thus was more reliable for scheduling irrigation since the effects of soil water and salt were underestimated in the upper root zone and overestimated in the lower zone plant water deficit index was almost always significantly underestimated by the traditional approach and thus irrigation was delayed therefore the application of the root weighted approach led to higher irrigation frequency and quantity as well as higher leaf area index biomass yield and transpiration without a significant decrease in water productivity however besides real time soil water and salinity conditions the effects of previous soil water or salinity stress and climate conditions on plant water status should be further investigated and quantified before the root weighted approach is widely adopted in practice conflict of interest

9465,in arid and semi arid regions water scarcity and soil salinization are major factors impacting sustainable agricultural production in this study a macroscopic root water uptake model was used to adapt a plant water deficit index pwdi for irrigation scheduling under conditions of coexisting soil water and salinity stress causing factors the traditional approach estimating pwdi with average root zone soil water and salt amounts was improved by weighting the effects of soil water and salinity according to the normalized root length density profile an experiment growing wheat triticum aestivum l in soil columns and an experiment growing cotton gossypium hirsutum l in a salinized field were implemented to explore and quantify the effects of soil water and salinity conditions on plant water status and thus to validate the improvement and evaluate its application by monitoring soil water and salinity dynamics and plant growth indexes e g leaf area dry weight leaf water potential transpiration and yield the results indicate that even under conditions with equal root zone averages of soil matric and osmotic potentials plant water status might be significantly different in general plants were less stressed when more water and less salinity were allocated in the upper root zone with more roots while less water and more salinity occurred in the lower root zone with less roots by referring to some information in the soil column experiment a numerical experiment was conducted to further demonstrate the improvement the root weighted approach resulted in improved pwdi estimation and thus was more reliable for irrigation scheduling leading to higher irrigation frequency and quantity leaf area index biomass yield and transpiration without significant decrease in water productivity however further improvement could be possible by considering the effects of historical soil water and salinity stresses as well as meteorological conditions on plant

semi arid regions such as xinjiang territory in northwest china about 32 of total irrigated land is saline yang et al 2019 therefore to enhance water productivity wp defined as crop yield per unit of applied irrigation water and or to increase yield itself in arid and semiarid regions irrigation scheduling must be designed to relieve water and salinity stresses simultaneously li et al 2016 salinity affects crops both via non specific lowering of soil osmotic potential sop and by specific ion toxicity homaee 1999 karlberg et al 2006 in saline soil root water uptake rwu often declines with decreasing water potential gradient between soil and roots resulting from decreased soil water content and or increased salt concentration in soil solution homaee et al 2002a 2002b water deficit occurs when plant transpiration cannot satisfy atmospheric demand the ratio of decrease in transpiration relative to demand is defined as a plant water deficit index pwdi woli et al 2012 shi et al 2015 1 pwdi t p t a t p 1 t a t p where t a and t p are the actual and potential transpiration rates cm d 1 respectively proper evaluation of pwdi can promote accurate irrigation to efficiently use water resources and or enhance production shi et al 2015 2020 wu et al 2017 in addition to transpiration other physiological indicators such as leaf water potential photosynthetic rate leaf stomatal conductance or canopy temperature can theoretically also reflect plant water deficit gardner et al 1992 jones 2004 candogan et al 2013 and be used for irrigation scheduling nevertheless these plant and canopy based indicators suffer from difficulty and expense in data acquisition and challenge in translating data into irrigation quantities jones 2004 shi et al 2015 wu et al 2017 alternatively the soil based approach has been more widely adopted by taking soil water and salinity conditions into account such as dirksen et al 1993 homaee et al 2002c muñoz carpena et al 2008 2 pwdi 1 γ h β φ where h and φ are the arithmetic averages of soil matric potential smp and sop over the root zone cm respectively γ h and β φ are dimensionless soil water and salinity stress response functions respectively in fact besides soil water and salt amounts the relative positions of water and salt to roots also significantly impact plant transpiration by changing soil water effectiveness raats 1974 homaee 1999 homaee et al 2002a fujimaki et al 2008 when soil water and salt amounts over the root zone are constant more water or less salt in sub zones with more roots is beneficial for water uptake compared to situations where more water or less salt occurs in soil with less roots dirksen et al 1993 homaee 1999 shi et al 2015 tzohar et al 2021 to accurately estimate pwdi with a soil based approach in addition to soil water and salt amounts the relative distribution relationship among water salt and roots should therefore also be considered under conditions with negligible salinity stress shi et al 2015 improved the soil based approach to estimate pwdi by weighting the effect of soil water according to root distribution 3 pwdi 1 0 1 γ h l n r d z r dz r where z r z l r is the

this improvement has been validated to more accurately evaluate plant water status under various soil atmosphere crop and irrigation conditions shi et al 2015 wu et al 2017 compared to the traditional approach based on eq 2 in the lysimetric experiment the relative errors of pwdi estimation was reduced from 12 1 19 0 to 9 1 9 5 and thus taking root weighted pwdi as a signal to initiate irrigation led to higher irrigation precision yield and wp wu et al 2017 furthermore the improved pwdi estimation exhibited great potential in data driven smart irrigation by promoting timely supply of appropriate quantities of water to crops according to predetermined targets of yield and or wp shi et al 2020 2021 however the improvement of pwdi estimation obtained under drought stressed condition cannot be applied in saline soil where water and salinity stresses coexist consequently the objective of the current study was to improve pwdi estimation in saline soil by exploring and quantifying the effects of soil water and salinity conditions on plant water status and subsequently to evaluate the effects of the improvement on irrigation scheduling crop yield and wp 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical background to improve pwdi estimation for water and salinity stressed crops assuming the maximal rwu rate under optimal soil conditions s max cm3 cm 3 d 1 is proportional to root length

conditions on plant water status weighted by nrld since root length density information is still difficult to measure timely in practice a generalized function of nrld can be adopted to make the root

winter wheat triticum aestivum l shijiazhuang 8 conducted in 2009 and partially described by wang et al 2012 was adopted to investigate the effects of the relative distribution relationship among soil water salt and roots on plant water status and thus to verify the theoretical improvement for estimating pwdi in total 156 polyvinyl chloride columns 53 cm high by 15 cm in diameter were prepared and each was reconnected by two halves and sealed at its bottom all the columns were packed with air dried sandy soil up to the height of 50 cm at a bulk density of 1 65 g cm 3 table 1 the original soil

analyzed with a software package winrhizo regent instruments inc canada for leaf area for each treatment three additional soil columns without plants were simultaneously managed with soil water contents kept similar to those with plants by adjusting irrigation amount the soil columns without plants were also weighed daily at 20 00 to determine soil evaporation and thus daily transpiration under each treatment was estimated by subtracting soil evaporation from evapotranspiration zuo et al 2006 2 2 2 exp 2 a field experiment of cotton to validate the results in exp 1 and investigate the effects of applying the improved pwdi estimation method on irrigation scheduling crop growth water consumption and yield a field experiment of cotton gossypium hirsutum l xinnongda 2 was conducted at

during seedling budding flowering and bolling and boll opening stages on 53 84 113 and 137 das respectively three plants were randomly removed from the two lateral strips in each plot to measure leaf

estimated in exp 1 fig 3 and re estimated in exp 2 fig 4 based on the traditional approach eq 2 pwdi ta and the root weighted approach eq 7 pwdi ra therefore the pwdi thresholds 0 36 0 46 0 46 and 0 58 initially designed to trigger the irrigation events under w1 w4 treatments in exp 2 on the linear assumption of eqs 9 and 10 were adjusted to 0 39 0 49 0 49 and 0 62 fig 4 according to the re estimated pwdi values 3 1 the effects of soil water and salinity conditions on plant water status during the treatment period from 16 to 51 das in exp 1 the total input amounts of water and nacl supplied for each column were 1310 cm3 and zero 1130 cm3 and 3390 mg 990 cm3 and 4950 mg under w1s1 w1s2 and w1s3 treatments while those under w2s1 w2s2 and w2s3 treatments were half respectively fig 3 as per experimental design before each irrigation event the average of smp over the root zone for w1 w1s1 w1s2 and w1s3 treatments was correspondingly higher than w2 w2s1 w2s2 and w2s3 treatments fig 5a and thus the leaf area index and transpiration under w2 treatments were significantly lower fig 6a and b similarly under w1 or w2 treatments the increasing nacl input from s1 to s2 and even s3 level resulting in gradually lower sop fig 5b significantly limited wheat growth and transpiration figs 6a and b under w1 treatments compared to s1 the mean smp before each irrigation event for s2 or s3 was higher even though irrigation was less fig 5a also indicating that transpiration consumption was significantly reduced fig 6b by increasing nacl fig 5b throughout the various irrigation periods the maximum pwdi th values under w1s1 or w2s1 without nacl input were relatively stable while under the other four treatments they generally increased with irrigation times and amounts fig 3 resulting from the increased nacl input and decreased sop fig 5b in general with decreasing input of water and increasing input of salt plant water status gradually deteriorated accompanied by higher pwdi th fig 3 slower growth fig 6a and less transpiration consumption fig 6b agreeing well with previous findings homaee 1999 hütsch et al 2014 the average pwdi th during the treatment period increased from 0 16 under w1s1 to 0 29 0 34 0 34 0 42 and even 0 49 under w1s2 w1s3 w2s1 w2s2 and w2s3 respectively in addition to soil water and salt amounts plant transpiration and water status should also be affected by the distribution relationship among water salt and roots raats 1974 homaee 1999 shi et al 2015 tzohar et al 2021 on 32 5 das under w1s3 the root zone averaged smp 232 4 cm and sop 9995 4 cm were very similar to those 262 5 cm and 9952 2 cm on 44 5 das under w1s2 fig 5 while pwdi th was much lower 0 48 versus 0 58 figs 3b and c due to the fact that the former soil water and salt distribution patterns fig 7 were more beneficial for rwu connecting the smp and sop profiles fig 7 with nrld distribution fig 2 indicated that compared to 44 5 das under w1s2 on 32 5 das under w1s3 more water and less salinity were allocated in the upper root zone with more roots while less water and more salinity occurred in the lower root zone with less roots and thus plants were less stressed by water and salinity this demonstrated the importance of considering the relative position of roots to soil water and salt when adopting the soil based approach to estimate pwdi under the circumstance only considering the amounts of soil water and salt as in the traditional approach of eq 2 pwdi was always underestimated to mask the extent of the stress before irrigation events in exp 1 fig 3 since most of water was located in the lower root zone with few roots figs 2 and 7 and its effectiveness was overestimated for example on 44 5 das under w1s2 and 32 5 das under w1s3 compared to pwdi th pwdi ta was underestimated 34 8 fig 3b and 32 3 fig 3c respectively besides real time conditions previous soil water and salinity conditions might also impact plant water status pérez pérez et al 2007 wu et al 2020 known as a hysteresis effect after almost all the irrigation or rainfall events in exps 1 and 2 pwdi th gradually decreased to its minimum through 1 3 days and then increased until next water input event figs 3 and 4 indicating that wheat and cotton could not recover immediately from previous water and or salinity stress guo et al 2015 wu et al 2020 therefore according to the traditional approach of eq 2 pwdi ta was always significantly underestimated during the recovery periods i e the descending processes of pwdi th figs 3 and 4 3 2 improving pwdi estimation by considering the relative distribution relationship among soil water salt and roots generally compared to the traditional soil based approach whether for winter wheat in growth chambers or for cotton under field conditions the root weighted approach could significantly enhance pwdi estimation precision except during the recovery periods 1 3 days following irrigation or rainfall corresponding to the descending processes of pwdi th with widely observed and reported hysteresis phenomena figs 3 and 4 on the non recovery day prior to irrigation for all the treatments in exp 1 the determination coefficient r2 between the estimated and theoretical pwdi values increased from 0 84 for pwdi ta to 0 95 for pwdi ra and rmse decreased from 0 13 to 0 03 fig 3 similarly compared to pwdi ta pwdi ra agreed better with pwdi th under each treatment in exp 2 with higher r2 and lower rmse fig 4 during the entire treatment period from 61 to 135 das in exp 2 the relative errors of average pwdi ra 4 0 12 2 to average pwdi th were also much lower than those of average pwdi ta 14 6 28 0 for the four treatments table 2 during the recovery periods when the hysteresis effect of previous water and salinity stress dominated pérez pérez et al 2007 significant improvement was not found when salinity stress was negligible wu et al 2020 improved the soil based approach to estimate pwdi by quantifying the hysteresis effect however determining methods for incorporating plant response hysteresis for cases where crops are simultaneously stressed by water and salinity require further study to further demonstrate the improvement through additionally considering the effects of the relative distribution relationship among water salt and roots a numerical experiment exp n was conducted by referring to some information in exp 1 the measured data on 32 5 das under w1s3 treatment were chosen to create various combinations regarding the relative distribution relationship among water salt and roots by keeping constant absolute arithmetic averages of smp and sop over root zone h 232 4 cm φ 9995 4 cm five profiles were respectively assumed for h w 1 w 5 and φ s 1 s 5 according to different functions including exactly the same as the nrld function for wheat zuo et al 2013 no 1 in fig 8 and its inverse situation no 2 two linear no 3 and 4 and one uniform no 5 under each situation pwdi was estimated through eqs 2 and 7 respectively for the 25 5 5 scenarios pwdi ta equaled to 0 32 consistently while pwdi ra fluctuated sharply table 3 sensitive to the relative position of water and salt to roots with increasing mean absolute difference between the normalized h or φ profile and the cited nrld function of wheat zuo et al 2013 fig 2 pwdi ra decreased from 0 66 under w 1s 1 0 03 under w 2s 2 table 3 this result indicated that w 1s 1 was the worst situation when the three profiles of normalized h φ and root length density coincided while w 2s 2 was the most favorable due to the opposite distributions of h and φ to roots agreeing well with rwu mechanism raats 1974 homaee 1999 furthermore the larger the deviation of the normalized distribution of h or φ from the uniform compared to the traditional approach the improvement resulted from the root weighted approach was more significant table 3 for example from w 5s 5 to w 3s 3 and w 1s 1 the improvement of the root weighted approach increased from 0 00 to 0 18 and even 0 34 change in meteorological factors would also impact plant water status li et al 2006 wu et al 2017 in exp 2 besides irrigation and rainfall events the dynamics of wind speed or solar radiation also resulted in sharp fluctuation of pwdi th fig 4 however whether the improved or traditional approach was adopted pwdi estimation could not catch the fluctuation of pwdi th caused by the change of meteorological conditions some recent studies have indicated that the lower threshold of optimal soil water and salt conditions h l in eq 9 or φ l in eq 10 should be adjusted according to weather conditions rather than a constant homaee et al 2002a 2002b groenveld et al 2013 yang et al 2013 3 3 the effects of root weighted pwdi estimation on irrigation scheduling crop growth and water use during the short period after an irrigation or rainfall event smp and sop always decreased with soil depth and pwdi ra was lower than pwdi ta since the effectiveness of soil water in the upper root zone with most roots was underestimated by the traditional approach figs 3 and 4 subsequently due to the higher rwu rate in the upper root zone smp and sop generally increased with soil depth fig 7 and pwdi ra were higher than pwdi ta since the effectiveness of soil water in the lower root zone with few roots was overestimated by the traditional approach figs 3 and 4 on the days just before all the irrigation events in exps 1 and 2 pwdi ta was about 25 0 lower than pwdi ra on average therefore compared to the root weighted approach if the traditional approach is adopted to schedule irrigation by comparing pwdi with a pre designed threshold irrigation would be almost always delayed and crops would suffer more serious stress than the designed fig 4 agreeing well with previous results for maize only stressed by water wu et al 2017 for instance during a typical irrigation cycle from 62 to 67 das under w4 treatment in exp 2 with a pwdi threshold of 0 62 pwdi ra increased from 0 40 to 0 62 while pwdi ta increased from 0 35 to 0 43 only fig 4d coincidentally on 78 das the two treatments w2 and w3 with an identical pwdi threshold of 0 49 while different pwdi estimation methods were simultaneously irrigated figs 4b and 4c however the leaf water potential before irrigation under w2 based on pwdi ra 1 78 0 10 mpa was much higher than that under w3 based on pwdi ta 2 65 0 15 mpa during the whole treatment period cotton under w2 was supplied 40 82 cm water via 25 irrigation events accompanied by an average leaf water potential of 1 84 mpa before irrigation while only 12 97 cm via 8 irrigation events was applied under w3 with an average leaf water potential of 2 92 mpa figs 4b and 4c table 2 compared to w3 higher irrigation frequency and quantity under w2 promoted crop transpiration and growth leading to higher leaf area index biomass and yield figs 6c and 6d table 2 on 137 das aboveground biomass and leaf area index under w2 were 136 9 and 78 7 higher than those under w3 leading to a 98 4 higher yield in exp 2 wp generally increased with increasing stress degree of water and salinity and then decreased under extreme stress condition of w4 agreeing well with many other previous studies kang et al 2002 candogan et al 2013 shi et al 2020 although cotton under w2 was less stressed significant decrease in wp was not found under w2 in comparison to w3 which might be attributed to the favorable effects of timely irrigation at critical growth stages shi et al 2020 for example at flowering and bolling stages 69 113 das when cotton was evidently sensitive to drought and salinity stress doorenbos 1977 li et al 2016 irrigation was carried out 17 times under w2 and only 5 times under w3 figs 3b and c 4 conclusions besides soil water and salt amounts their relative positions to roots also significantly affect plant water status therefore the traditional soil based approach estimating plant water deficit index on the root zone averages of soil matric and osmotic potentials was remarkably improved by weighting the effects of soil water and salt according to normalized root length density compared to the traditional approach the root weighted approach led to better estimation except for the situations with uniform soil matric and osmotic potentials or root system and thus was more reliable for scheduling irrigation since the effects of soil water and salt were underestimated in the upper root zone and overestimated in the lower zone plant water deficit index was almost always significantly underestimated by the traditional approach and thus irrigation was delayed therefore the application of the root weighted approach led to higher irrigation frequency and quantity as well as higher leaf area index biomass yield and transpiration without a significant decrease in water productivity however besides real time soil water and salinity conditions the effects of previous soil water or salinity stress and climate conditions on plant water status should be further investigated and quantified before the root weighted approach is widely adopted in practice conflict of interest

9466,beef production is one of the largest water consumers of all food production systems but there are substantial knowledge gaps about the accounting and interpretation of its freshwater consumption moreover hardly any study has assessed the freshwater fluxes related to beef cattle in integrated crop livestock icl and crop livestock forestry iclf systems we aimed at quantifying the freshwater fluxes related to beef cattle raised on continuous permanent brachiaria pastures con or in icl and iclf systems in the brazilian cerrado in the rainy and dry seasons evapotranspiration of forage grass eucalyptus trees in iclf and from drinking water troughs were calculated from meteorological data collected in the field forage accumulation was measured in 11 paddocks over both seasons and forage intake drinking water intake and bodyweight were quantified in 12 growing nellore heifers per system during two months per season freshwater fluxes related to forage production and animals were estimated drinking water intake and water intake via forage did not differ p 0 073 between the systems and were greater p 0 035 in the rainy than the dry season faecal and urinary water excretions were greater in the dry than the rainy season p 0 005 the respiratory and cutaneous water losses were greater p 0 001 in the rainy than the dry season in the rainy season evapotranspiration related to forage accumulation and freshwater consumption for raising beef cattle were greatest in con whereas they were greatest in iclf in the dry season although iclf appeared to be less resilient to dry periods both integrated systems offer the potential for reduced freshwater consumption for raising beef cattle under grazing conditions by improving the efficiency of forage use and or decreasing evapotranspiration of forage keywords agroforestry farming system ruminant silvopastoral tropical pasture water footprint 1 introduction quantifying the freshwater consumption in agriculture and understanding the freshwater fluxes within cattle farming systems has become of increasing public and scientific interests during recent years fao 2019 this increasing interests is on the one hand due to the declining availability of freshwater resources and the increasing competition in their use for different purposes mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 on the other hand the projected consequences of climate change such as more intense rainfall events decreases in precipitation the occurrence of severe to extreme droughts and prolonged dry seasons endanger the stability of freshwater supplies in agriculture reyer et al 2017 hence there is a growing need to understand the water fluxes within cattle farming systems in order to evaluate their resilience to periods of water scarcity and to develop strategies to reduce their overall demand and to enhance water use efficiency lathuillière et al 2019 in latin america extensive grasslands are used for beef cattle production as a consequence of the growing demand for animal products and increasing competition for land and other natural resources the use of these grasslands has continuously been intensified over the past decades anache et al 2019 resulting in widespread degradation of these grassland resources in this line the integrated crop livestock icl and integrated crop livestock forestry iclf systems have been promoted during recent years as valuable options for sustainable beef production in latin america and particularly the brazilian cerrado almeida et al 2013 by combining crop and livestock as well as forestry in case of iclf in the same location in rotation consortium or succession those systems increase soil fertility and biological activity salton et al 2014 increase grassland productivity improve animal welfare oliveira et al 2019 offset carbon emissions from cattle figueiredo et al 2017 and foster biodiversity and economy costa et al 2018 among others compared to the continuous con pasturing system commonly found in the brazilian cerrado iclf and icl systems differ in ambient temperatures relative air humidity solar radiation karvatte junior et al 2016 as well as forage growth and nutritional value gamarra et al 2017 and thus feed and drinking water intakes of grazing animals these differences will likely affect the water fluxes as well as the total freshwater consumption related to beef cattle rearing however may vary depending on the season of the year and the prevailing climatic conditions nevertheless to our knowledge no one has analysed so far the freshwater consumption related to beef cattle at animal and paddock level in these systems nor quantified the freshwater consumption for raising beef cattle on icl and iclf systems instead previous research related to freshwater consumption in grazing based systems rather focused on global comparisons of freshwater consumption between different farm animals and countries mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 on individual components kannan et al 2017 or water sources harding et al 2017 within cattle systems on cow calf production andreini et al 2018 and the finishing phase in feedlot systems palhares et al 2017 and or dismissed the impacts of seasonal differences on freshwater fluxes therefore our objectives were to characterize quantify and compare freshwater fluxes in three different grazing systems and to evaluate the contribution of animal related fluxes to total freshwater fluxes within these systems we hypothesized that trees in iclf systems would decrease ambient temperatures and solar radiation oliveira et al 2018 and increase nutritional quality of the available forage pereira et al 2021 thereby decreasing evapotranspiration et of forage and drinking water intake of grazing cattle while increasing their forage intake and performance furthermore rotation with soybean cultivation would increase soil fertility and forage yields in both icl and iclf systems as compared to con these effects would lower overall freshwater consumption for beef cattle raising in iclf and icl than con it is expected that these differences will be more pronounced for iclf than icl and greater in the rainy than the dry season due to lower et of tropical forage in iclf than icl as expected to be one of the main freshwater fluxes in grazing based beef cattle production systems instead trees and forage may compete for water glatzle et al 2021 which may increase the vulnerability of iclf to water shortage in the dry season 2 materials and methods field data collection was carried out in three different grazing based beef production systems from november 2018 to july 2019 including the main rainy season from november to march and the main dry season from april to july the experimental area was located at embrapa beef cattle in campo grande mato grosso do sul in the central west of brazil 20 24 54 9 s 54 42 25 8 w 530 m above sea level according to the köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 the experimental area is in the transition between the warm temperature fully humid and hot summer cfa and the equatorial winter dry i e aw zone average annual precipitation in the area is 1560 mm and average annual ambient air temperature 23 c based on historical data from 1977 to 2006 marcuzzo et al 2012 the variables used to represent the freshwater fluxes in the systems with growing nellore cattle are depicted in fig 1 the transport of water via precipitation evaporation from drinking water troughs et of forage and trees as well as via the drinking and forage water intakes urinary and faecal water excretions respiratory and cutaneous water losses metabolic water releases and the water retention in bodyweight bw gain of experimental animals were considered as freshwater fluxes within as well as into and out of the systems freshwater consumption refers to water removed from but not returned to the same drainage basin fao 2019 therefore the total et of forage drinking and forage water intakes and water evaporated from drinking water troughs were defined as freshwater consumption related to beef cattle fig 1 and table 1 2 1 experimental area and system description the

stocking method allen et al 2011 for three consecutive years the measurements were taken after one year of soybean cultivation the icl and iclf systems were implanted in 2008 and the con system in 1993 more details on the establishment of icl and iclf systems are given by oliveira et al 2014 since its implantation in 1993 con system had been managed extensively without fertilizer and lime applications and a constant stocking density which had led to severe degradation of the pasture therefore at the end of 2017 the system was renewed by soil preparation through a harrow disk before re seeding and applications of 2000 kg of lime ha 1 800 kg of gypsum ha 1 and 16 kg ha 1 of phosphorus pentoxide and 16 kg ha 1 of potassium oxide incorporated into the soil afterwards an additional application of 6 kg ha 1 of phosphorus pentoxide and 6 kg ha 1 of potassium oxide broadcasted over the pasture canopy and after seeding an application of 45 kg of nitrogen ha 1 in form of urea in

latosol oxisol by the brazilian system of soil classification embrapa 2013 two subsamples were pooled from ten disturbed soil samples collected at the 0 20 cm soil depth from sampling points randomly located across each paddock in 2019 the soil acidification chemical and texture characterization were performed according to procedure proposed by teixeira et al 2017 table 2 2 3 climate and forage

march and from april to july were used to calculate the percentage of shading in the iclf canopy for the rainy and dry season respectively as a ratio between the par reaching the forage canopy at the

range of the par wavelength that relates to the global radiation about 0 45 for the ratio par rn 1 mj m 2 and d 1 mj m 2 and d 1 gonzález and calbó 2002 sudhakar et al 2013 those values were then used

exclusion cages were established in each icl n 5 and iclf n 5 to prevent grazing forage biomass inside exclusion cages was harvested by a brush cutter at a height of 0 04 m above the ground every month and the exclusion cages were moved to a new random location simultaneously comparable points outside the cages in a metal frame of similar dimension 1 0 m x 1 0 m located at three for con or five for icl and iclf locations were harvested by a brush cutter at a height of 0 04 m above the ground the criteria for the selection of points outside the cages were that the vegetation had as near as possible the same canopy height measured by a graduated ruler morphological composition and soil cover assessed visually than the vegetation inside of the cages the forage harvested in those points outside of cages were to simulate the initial forage biomass of the exclusion cage there were a total of five harvests in the rainy season and four in the dry season from january to february rainy season and june to july dry season forage biomass was harvested at a 15 d interval i e three harvests per season to quantify the above ground forage biomass available to grazing heifers all the forage samples were individually weighed immediately after the harvest by balances with a maximum capacity of 9000 g and an accuracy 0 01 g for each harvest all biomass harvested either inside or outside the cages were pooled to each paddock i e one pooled sample each for inside and outside the cages one sub sample of about 600 g of fresh matter from each paddock inside and outside the cages and in case of the samples harvested to characterize the instantaneous above ground biomass two sub samples from each paddock were taken put into paper bags and dried in forced air oven at 65 ºc until constant mass for determination of crude water concentration of forage later this crude water concentration of forage was used to calculate the water intake by the animals via the forage given in l animal 1 and d 1 by assuming that 1 kg 1 l by multiplying feed intake on fresh matter basis by its crude water concentration forage accumulation rate kg dry matter dm ha 1 and d 1 was calculated as the forage biomass kg dm ha 1 inside the cage minus the biomass outside the cage at the previous harvest divided by the days of interval between each harvest as described by the paired cage difference method radcliffe 1974 the initial forage biomass harvested in november 2018 as well as the forage biomass harvested in april 2019 were added to the average forage accumulation rate of the rainy and dry season multiplied by the days of measurements of each season respectively to determine the seasonal forage accumulation kg dm ha 1 and season 1 out of 353 measurements for forage accumulation rate twenty negative values that were lower than the calculated mean of the paddock within the respective month minus its standard deviation were considered as outliers data of forage biomass harvested in the 15 d interval sampling were averaged per paddock and harvest date however one paddock of iclf was included only in the dry season due to a strong decline in forage biomass see section 2 5 resulting in 63 mean values for the three sampling periods per season i e 10 paddocks x 2 seasons x 3 sampling periods 1 paddock x 1 season x 3 sampling periods 2 5 feed intake and performance of heifers all procedures of animal handling care and sampling were approved by the ethics and animal use commission of the embrapa beef cattle under protocol nº 014 2014 a total of 96 nellore heifers were used with an initial age of 21 months and an initial bw of 293 kg one standard deviation 28 9 in november 2018 in january 2019 34 animals were randomly allocated to the experimental paddocks and 62 heifers to an extra area with brachiaria sp pasture which were used to adjust the stocking densities in iclf and icl paddocks throughout the study animals had unrestricted access to the entire pasture areas they were vaccinated against brucellosis after weaning and foot and mouth disease every year in november 2018 and may 2019 in addition they were treated against endo and ectoparasites once in may 2019 they had free access to the drinking water troughs see section 2 6 and were offered a commercial mineral supplement connan 60 connan company são gabriel do oeste brazil for composition data see https www connan com br produtos connan 60 sft produtos category suplemento mineral aglomerado at 0 140 kg animal 1 and d 1 as fed basis the animals were weighed once every 37 d by an individual balance mrg campo toledo são bernardo do campo brazil precision of 0 500 kg totalling four weighings in the rainy season and four in the dry seasons animal weighing was done in the morning after 16 h of feed withdrawal wherein the evening before the handling the animals were brought to the pen until the weighing in the early morning average daily bw gain adg kg bw animal 1 and d 1 was calculated as the difference between the initial and subsequent bw divided by the number of days between two consecutive weighings additionally total bw gain kg bw ha 1 and season 1 was the adg of each season multiplied by the number of days between the weighings and by the average stocking density in animals ha 1 in each month of both seasons stocking rates in animal unit ha 1 and season 1 were calculated for each paddock and season as the weighted average stocking density during each time interval between the weighings multiplied by the animals average bw and divided by 450 kg bw defined as one animal unit scarnecchia 1985 feed intake was estimated using a total of 36 animals in three subsequent periods of ten days each during the rainy from january to february and the dry season from june to july in those periods four animals were used per paddock and period for the iclf and icl systems whereas in the con two paddocks with two animals each were used to achieve a total number of four animals per period table 3 during the dry season two paddocks with two animals each were also used per period due to a decrease in forage biomass in iclf likewise as in the con system none of the animals were repeated per paddock and period within each season however the same animals were assessed for all systems in the rainy and dry season the external faecal marker titanium dioxide was used to estimate daily faecal excretion of individual animals the marker was orally administered to each animal via gelatine capsules in two dosages per day of 5 g each in the rainy season and two dosages of 7 g each in the dry season at 07 00 and 16 00 h local time for ten days there was a 5 d adaptation period to achieve a homogenous titanium dioxide distribution in the digestive tract after this adaptation period faeces grab samples about 250 g fresh matter in each period were collected manually from the rectum of the animals twice a day at the same time than the titanium dioxide dosing over the last five days of each period i e sampling period for marker application and faeces collection the animals were removed from the paddocks and kept in a collection pen for about 1 h each day the faeces samples were stored in styrofoam coolers boxes with dry ice until they were frozen at 20 ºc at the end of each sampling at the end of each season faecal samples were thawed overnight pooled per animal and season by taking the same amount of material from each individual sample and divided in two sub samples about 60 g fresh matter each one of each sub samples was weighed oven dried at 40 ºc for 72 h and weighed again in order to estimate the water concentration in faeces afterwards the dried samples were ground to pass a 1 mm sieve willye star model ft 80 1 knife mill and analysed in duplicate for dm by drying at 105 ºc for 4 h and for crude ash by incineration at 550 c overnight the organic matter om concentrations in faeces were calculated as the difference between 1000 g kg 1 dm and crude ash concentrations g kg 1 dm the titanium dioxide concentrations in dried faecal samples were determined in duplicate according to the procedures described by boguhn et al 2009 with minor modifications the other fresh sub samples were analyzed in duplicate for nitrogen using the micro kjeldahl procedure aoac 1961 2010 method no 960 52 the concentrations of crude protein cp were calculated by multiplying the nitrogen concentrations in faeces by 6 25 apparent total tract om digestibility of the consumed diet was estimated from the faecal cp concentrations based on the curvilinear relationship developed by lukas et al 2005 using ai a2 from gumpenstein location data subsequently om intake kg animal 1 and d 1 and kg kg 0 75 bw and d 1 was estimated from faecal om excretion and om digestibility of the consumed diet 2 6 drinking water intake of heifers each paddock had a fixed concrete circular drinking water trough of an average circumference of 2 9 m one

supply drinking water intake of the entire animal group per paddock was recorded through water meters nevos volumetric itron inc liberty lake usa reading capacity of 1 5 m3 h 1 of water that were installed to the water inlet plumbing of the drinking water troughs in each paddock water meters were manually checked for accuracy before the experiment started readings were taken every day at 15 00 local time during the period of feed intake measurements and entered into a spreadsheet microsoft excel microsoft inc seattle usa for the calculations of total l of water flowing into each drinking water trough in a daily basis water lost through evaporation from the drinking water troughs and the rainwater were taken into account for this daily mean of evaporation from the drinking water troughs was subtracted from daily water inflow into the drinking water troughs and the precipitation given in l was added precipitation was measured in the systems by rain gauges placed in a single paddock in con and another in iclf hobo rg3 onset computer corporation bourne usa water evaporated from drinking water troughs during the experiment were derived from the evaporation water losses mm measured in one class a pan a702 brazilian inmet placed at the embrapa beef cattle meteorological station multiplied by the water surface area m2 of each drinking water trough evaporation data was transformed in l for the calculations of total l of water flowing into the drinking water troughs for the rainy season the evaporation data was an average of the daily recordings automatically collected at 08 00 of local time in december january and february n 77 d for the dry season the evaporation data was an average of the daily recordings manually taken at 08 00 of local time over 23 consecutive days from june to july on the same days as the water meter readings were conducted the automatic readings changed to manual due to a failure in the automatic readings of class a pan before the dry season started average daily drinking water intake l animal 1 and l kg 0 75 bw was then calculated by dividing the daily water flows l into the drinking water troughs corrected for the water evaporation and precipitation by the number of animals or total metabolic bw per paddock on the respective day outlier data were deleted from the dataset a total of 480 observations were retained with a mean of 22 consecutive daily readings per paddock and season i e 11 paddocks x 2 seasons x 22 d the data of om intake drinking water intake and faecal excretion of individual animals were assessed only in the three periods from january to february and from june to july hence the results obtained were extrapolated to all animals grazing the paddocks throughout the seasons by multiplying the results in kg of metabolic bw kg0 75 bw and d 1 by the total metabolic bw per hectare and season 2 7 freshwater fluxes related to faeces and urine excretion respiration and cutaneous evaporation and the animal s metabolism the faecal water excretion was calculated as follows 4 4 faecal water excretion kg animal 1 and d 1 faeces kg dm animal 1 and d 1 cwf g kg 1 fresh matter dmf g kg 1 fresh matter where faeces is faecal excretion cwf is faecal crude water concentration and dmf is faecal dry matter concentration to obtain the faecal water excretions the unit obtained in kg of water was

eucalyptus the et of eucalyptus trees in iclf was estimated as a function of the cumulative precipitation during the entire experimental period 252 d and the leaf area index m2 of leaf area m 2 of crown area proposed as follow almeida et al 2007 7 evapotranspiration of eucalyptus mm experimental period 1 266 92 91 041 leaf area index m 2 of leaf area m 2 of crown area 0 536 cumulative precipitation mm experimental period 1 leaf area of three randomly selected trees per paddock were measured destructively to obtain the leaf area index for this the whole tree canopy was weighed and three sub samples of about 2000 g of fresh leaves per tree were taken and their areas measured using a leaf area meter li 3100 c area meter li cor biosciences lincoln usa afterwards those leaf sub samples were put into paper bags and dried in forced air oven at 65 ºc until constant mass the leaf area of each tree was then calculated proportionally to the weight of the whole tree canopy of each tree respectively the crown area m² tree 1 of twelve other randomly selected trees per paddock was posteriorly estimated based on their crown radius m tree 1 which was measured with a tape by fixing ground points on either side of the trunk perpendicular to the tips of the longest branch subsequently the leaf area index was calculated by dividing the leaf area m2 tree 1 by the crown area m2 tree 1 to calculate the et of eucalyptus plantation the average of the twelve leaf area index estimations per paddock was used and as it was measured only once in 2019 the et was estimated for the entire experimental period rather than each season the et of eucalyptus mm experimental period 1 was divided by the cumulative precipitation mm experimental period 1 to obtain the ratio of et mm mm 1 precipitation according to almeida et al 2007 as the experimental area was flat soil surface water runoff was not considered as water flux gyenge et al 2002 2 9 freshwater consumption related to beef cattle the et of eucalyptus was not considered part of the freshwater consumption related to beef cattle given in l kg 1 bw and season 1 total et of forage accumulation l kg 1 om was calculated by

paddock resulting in 21 or 22 observations per each variable for the rainy any dry seasons respectively data were analysed by glimmix procedure of sas v9 4 sas institute inc cary nc usa considering season system and their interactions as fixed effects paddock as subject and a random residual effect the et from forage accumulation and freshwater consumption related to beef cattle were grouped by et to classify paddocks where the et was assessed and those for which et was not assessed the homogeneity of variance was tested through covtest statement for both et from forage accumulation and freshwater consumption related to beef cattle the hypothesis of equal variance was accepted p 0 127 for all models performed the ddfm kenwardroger option of the model statement was invoked all mean

means at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 climate and evapotranspiration the cumulative precipitation during the 4 month rainy season was 694 mm whereas it was 233 mm during the 4 month dry season table 4 there were four wet days with precipitation 1 mm d 1 levy et al 2017 at the end of december whereas there were more wet days 10 11 days from the beginning to the end of the months of january to march which

p 0 007 daily forage accumulation rate kg dm ha 1 was not affected by the interaction between system and season p 0 092 and no differences were found between systems p 0 087 or seasons p 0 082 nevertheless there was an interaction p 0 047 between system and season for forage accumulation kg dm ha 1 and season 1 while for con forage accumulation was similar p 0 836 in both seasons it was

as a consequence bw gain per hectare kg season 1 was also superior p 0 001 in the rainy than the dry season for all systems but lower p 0 001 for con than for icl and iclf the bw gain per hectare over the entire experimental period of 243 d was 116 359 and 254 kg bw ha 1 in con icl and iclf respectively 3 4 freshwater fluxes at animal level none of the daily freshwater fluxes related to the heifers

were affected by the interaction p 0 05 between system and season table 6 drinking water intake did not differ between systems p 0 214 but was greater p 0 035 in the rainy than the dry season similarly water intake via forage did not differ between systems p 0 073 but was greater p 0 038 in the rainy than the dry season by contrast differences were found between systems p 0 010 but not between seasons p 0 433 for water release during metabolism animals in iclf released more water during metabolism than animals in con p 0 032 and icl p 0 012 whereas no differences p 0 761 were found

proportion of forage actually consumed by the animals see eq 10 freshwater consumption related to beef cattle was lower in iclf p 0 001 and icl p 0 027 than con in the rainy season but greater p 0 001 in iclf than con in the dry season irrespective of the season there were no differences between icl and iclf p 0 058 in the dry season icl was also similar p 0 949 to con across the three systems freshwater consumption related to beef cattle was lower p 0 001 in the dry compared to the rainy season except for icl for which it was similar p 0 405 between seasons the et of eucalyptus trees in iclf was 1018 mm during the entire experimental period the ratio between et and precipitation mm mm 1 both for the entire experimental period of 243 d was 1 10 according to the total area covered by eucalyptus of 447 m2 ha 1 total et of eucalyptus trees was 455 046 l ha 1 for the entire experimental period the total freshwater consumption per hectare during the whole experimental period is the sum of et from forage accumulation and from eucalyptus plus water evaporated from the drinking water troughs plus water intake via forage and drinking of the animals and the results are depicted in fig 2 4 discussion 4 1 climate and evapotranspiration the observed climatic conditions were typical for the rainy and dry seasons in the brazilian cerrado with the exception of the very low precipitation in december and january which are normally above 150 mm per month with an average cumulative precipitation of 211 mm in mato grosso do sul in january marcuzzo et al 2012 mean monthly ambient air temperatures were numerically similar between systems also oliveira et al 2018 who evaluated the microclimate in the same experimental area than of the present study from 2011 to 2012 observed similar ambient air temperatures between iclf and icl similarly giro et al 2019 found no differences in ambient air temperature between iclf and icl who evaluated the microclimate of an experimental area in the brazilian cerrado during summer and autumn with similar tree density 165 eucalyptus trees ha 1 and tree height 26 m than in the present study the forestry component in iclf is often considered to decrease ambient air temperatures and to reduce solar radiation however these effects do not occur uniformly across the whole area and during the entire seasons because the ellipsoid crown shape of eucalyptus and its spaced branches result in little interception of radiance karvatte junior et al 2016 therefore radiation may be high in some locations whereas elsewhere the attenuation of solar radiation can be significant during most of the day oliveira et al 2018 part of this incident sunlight is reflected back thereby contributing to increasing ambient air temperatures also underneath the cover of the trees in iclf systems schumacher and poggiani 1993 moreover the lack of differences in ambient air temperature between the systems along the seasons could be explained by the shade projection in the canopy of iclf which does not occur uniformly during the entire season due to the sun displacement relative to the tree arrangement for instance a greater radiation incidence is found in the middle of the paddocks compared to the one near to the trees in the summer conversely in the winter solstice the low sun inclination in the southern hemisphere results in general in less radiation incidence in the whole canopy and sunlight concentrates near the rows of trees therefore one explanation among other effects is that unevenly distributed solar irradiance in iclf hinders a clear reduction in ambient air temperature compared to the full sun conditions in con and icl nevertheless shading effectively reduced solar radiation and increased relative air humidity in iclf compared with icl and con in both seasons in the present study as a result et of forage was lower in iclf than icl and con during the rainy season except january although being similar between systems in the dry season the et obtained in icl and con in the rainy season was comparable to the findings of meirelles et al 2011 and santos et al 2004 who assessed the et in open brachiaria brizantha pasture in brazilian cerrado in december 2001 3 8 mm d 1 or from november to may in 2000 3 4 mm d 1 respectively in most wet tropics radiation greatly influences et of forage and as hypothesized et of forage was lower in iclf than in con and icl in response to tree shading eastham and rose 1988 additionally the vapour pressure deficit is a driving force for water losses from the internal leaf to the atmosphere with lower vapour deficits reducing the atmosphere s demand for water from plant transpiration zhang et al 2017 as well as its capacity to take up additional water allen et al 1998 given the similar ambient air temperatures across the systems relative air humidity was greater and thus vapour pressure deficit lower in iclf than icl and con in the rainy season which in addition to the lower solar radiation explain the lower et of forage in iclf nevertheless et of forage was similar across the systems in the dry season the stomatal closure in response to reduced soil water supply regulates transpiration fisher et al 2009 irrespective of the system daily et of forage was greater in the rainy than the dry season although wind speed was faster in the dry than the rainy season the greater global radiation ambient air temperatures cumulative precipitation and hence kc increased et during the rainy season moreover lack of precipitation reduces et of forage by declining soil water stocks leaf water potential and leaf area index and consequently kc and et decrease for most land covers lathuillière et al 2012 in this line anache et al 2019 found that et of brachiaria decumbens in open pastures in the brazilian cerrado decreased during the dry season due to the lack of water readily available for plants within the root zone 4 2 forage biomass and accumulation in general forage accumulation rates were similar to those reported in the literature for instance daily forage accumulation rate in con in the rainy season was in line with the mean forage accumulation rate of 42 1 kg dm ha 1 and d 1 determined by braga et al 2008 for a brachiaria decumbens pasture in the brazilian cerrado during the rainy season of 2007 and 2008 moreover forage accumulation rate in icl in the rainy season of the present study was similar to those reported by euclides et al 2016 and santos et al 2016 for piatã grass pasture used in conventional open grazing system i e con 64 1 kg dm ha 1 and d 1 and an icl system 64 5 kg dm ha 1 and d 1 respectively both in the brazilian cerrado finally daily forage accumulation rate in iclf was in agreement with that of santos et al 2016 who measured mean forage accumulation rate of piatã grass grown in the understory of eucalyptus urograndis trees 22 m distance between rows in the brazilian cerrado of 41 8 kg and 13 7 kg dm ha 1 and d 1 during the rainy and dry seasons respectively forage biomass and forage accumulation were greater in icl compared with con in both seasons possibly due to synergies among the components of the system the litter accumulated from the soybean as a crop planted one year before the experiment its symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria and fertilizer residues likely increased nitrogen accumulation om concentrations and cation exchange capacity of the soil salton et al 2014 the greater cation exchange capacity acts as a buffer against soil acidification which is particularly relevant given the natural acidity of the soils in the brazilian cerrado yamada 2005 these benefits would further enhance forage accumulation rate salton et al 2014 not only in icl but also for iclf however in iclf the lower par likely reduced the photosynthetic rates of the perennial c4 forage grass pignon et al 2017 along with a possible competition between trees and the forage for water in the dry season bosi et al 2020 thus the lowest forage biomass and forage accumulation were observed in iclf in the dry season nevertheless if as in the present study trees are widely spaced light and precipitation interception and thus the decline in forage accumulation rate are rather small due to the narrow shape of the eucalyptus crown with time these differences in forage accumulation rate between systems may change while in con soil fertility forage canopy cover and forage accumulation rate may decrease in response to continuous grazing year after year the beneficial residual effects of soybean cultivation on forage accumulation rate observed in icl and iclf in the first year will decline in subsequent years the seasonal differences in forage accumulation confirm similar findings in literature for tropical grasses pereira et al 2021a salton et al 2014 santos et al 2016 they were more pronounced in icl and iclf than con suggesting that besides a lower par also water availability in the dry season limited forage accumulation in iclf the seasonal forage accumulation rate did not reduce in the dry compared to the rainy season in con as it did for the other systems at the beginning of the dry season the first forage biomass harvested was greater in con than icl and iclf the constant and lower stocking rate in con than in the other two systems in the rainy season possibly avoided a pronounced decline in forage biomass from the rainy to the beginning of the dry season the much lower forage accumulation in iclf than the open grazing systems during water stress conditions has been attributed to the leaf stomatal responses to changes in sunlight intensity as influenced by water restriction feldhake 2009 leaf stomata open to allow for carbon dioxide diffusion into the leaf to utilize par however during water shortage leaf stomata close at least partially to reduce water loss which hampers carbon dioxide uptake therefore plants cannot compensate for the limited radiation by triggering mechanisms to increase radiation use efficiency feldhake 2009 additionally eucalyptus trees have a developed root system which competes strongly for moisture with pasture ferraz et al 2019 in this line glatzle et al 2021 found that soil water content at 0 30 cm depth where 80 of brachiaria roots are located guenni et al 2002 was often 25 of a field capacity within the same experimental site during the dry season of 2016 and 2017 additionally soil moisture at 20 100 cm depth was lower in iclf compared to icl and con system glatzle personal communication hence despite not measured in the present study the forage accumulation in iclf was likely restricted by water competition between forage and eucalyptus in the dry season whereas precipitation was sufficiently high to compensate for this competition in the rainy season 4 3 feed intake and performance of heifers the adg of animals in iclf was similar to that of heifers in icl and greater in both these systems than in con whereas om intake was only greater in iclf but not in icl than in con these findings partially support our hypothesis of a greater forage intake of the animals in the integrated systems enhancing their adg a superior nutritional quality of forage may explain the greater om intake and adg of heifers in iclf hence cp concentrations of tropical forage grasses grown under shading such as in iclf are generally greater and thus their nutritional value higher than of those under full sun conditions gamarra et al 2017 oliveira et al 2014 pereira et al 2021a in this line also greater cp and lower lignin concentrations and thus greater apparent total tract digestibility of om were found in forage in iclf than in con in the present experiment zawada 2020 the superior om digestibility in iclf allowed for a greater voluntary feed intake machado et al 2016 and thus intake of digestible om and adg of the animals in this system moreover animals in the tropics and subtropics are commonly exposed to heat stress although moderate to severe heat stress conditions occurred in all systems during the rainy season fewer hours of severe heat stress were observed in the rainy season and of moderate heat stress in the dry season in iclf compared to icl and con pereira et al 2021b additionally shading effectively reduces solar radiation load for the animals giro et al 2019 the reduced exposure to severe heat stress and radiation load might have prolonged the animals grazing time morrison 1983 souza et al 2017 and hence increased their om intake and adg in iclf instead om intake of heifers in icl did not differ from those in con while their adg was greater than in con and similar to that in iclf in line with results of the present study the adg of nellore heifers continuously grazing on piatã grass did not differ between iclf and icl systems in previous studies gamarra et al 2017 oliveira et al 2014 pereira et al 2021a with comparable mean adg of 0 40 kg gamarra et al 2017 0 38 kg oliveira et al 2014 and 0 39 kg bw animal 1 and d 1 pereira et al 2021a than determined in the present experiment reasons for the greater adg in icl than in con despite the similar om intake are not fully clear microclimatic conditions were less favourable in icl than in iclf pereira et al 2021b and the nutritive value of forage was lower zawada 2020 than in the other two systems which might have limited om intake of heifers in icl however the greater forage allowance in icl than in con and iclf pereira et al 2019 likely enabled heifers to select for forage biomass of higher nutritional quality and thus allowed for an adg greater than in con and similar than in iclf consequently bw gain per hectare and season was also greater in icl than in iclf rainy season only and con nevertheless as result of the greater forage allowance and the most likely high degree of selective grazing efficiency of pasture utilization in kg bw gain per kg of forage biomass was lower in icl than in iclf in this line the proportions of dead matter and stem material were greater in icl than in iclf and con for proportion of stem material only towards the end of the dry season pereira et al 2021b indicating the potential to increase productivity of this system by improved grazing management 4 4 freshwater fluxes at animal level in contrast to our expectations there were no interactions between system and season for freshwater fluxes at animal level despite variable differences between systems within each season in for instance forage biomass table 5 moreover only minor effects of system on the freshwater fluxes at animal level were found instead the effects of season were more pronounced animals in iclf were expected to have a lower drinking water intake compared to those in the other systems due to a more favourable microclimate and thus thermal comfort of the animals as well as the low dm concentration of the forage and thus a greater water intake via the feed in iclf yet drinking water intake did not differ between systems regardless of the longer exposure to severe and moderate heat stress in the systems without trees in the rainy and dry season respectively see section 4 3 drinking water intake is correlated positively to feed intake of nellore heifers raised in feedlot systems zanetti et al 2019 and of crossbred beef steers heifers and bull calves growing in feedlot systems brew et al 2011 in the present study om intake of heifers were greater in iclf than in con which could thus at least partly explain the similar drinking water intake see section 3 3 at the same time there were no differences in the water intake via forage between systems likely because forage dm concentrations were not always lower throughout the paddocks in iclf than the other systems in every forage measurement moreover urinary water excretion was greater in iclf than in icl and con possibly due to the greater cp concentrations zawada 2020 and om digestibility see section 4 3 of available forage in iclf than in the other systems and the consequently greater intake of digestible nitrogen which may have increased renal nitrogen load and thus urine volume and urinary water excretion khelil arfa et al 2012 together with the greater water retention in bw in iclf the greater urinary water excretion likely increased water requirements of heifers in iclf which together with their greater om intake but similar water intake via forage could explain the lack of differences between systems in drinking water intake hardly any study has evaluated drinking water intake under grazing conditions in the tropics and subtropics nevertheless drinking water intakes of the animals in con and icl in the rainy season in the present study were very similar to that of nellore heifers raised in a feedlot system under tropical conditions during the rainy season 16 7 l animal 1 and d 1 one standard deviation 6 1 as determined by zanetti et al 2019 in grazing clover dominant pasture in a temperate climate drinking water intake of non lactating jersey cows and their crossbreds jersey x friesian or jersey x shorthorn was also similar to the heifers in con and icl with a range from 13 6 to 20 5 l animal 1 and d 1 wright and jones 1974 a minor system effect was observed for water release during metabolism animals in iclf released more water during metabolism than those in con and icl the greatest om intake and om digestibility of this consumed forage in iclf increased the metabolic water supply by increasing the availability of some nutrients within the animals cells with 1 g of lipid protein and carbohydrate oxidized resulting in 1 07 0 41 and 0 60 g of water respectively being produced martin 1985 as cited in murphy 1992 nevertheless from a quantitative point of view also in the present study main freshwater fluxes were water intakes via drinking and forage faecal and urinary water excretions as well as water evaporation via respiration and skin which thus should be measured and considered in analysing seasonal or system effects on freshwater fluxes and balance at animal level voluntary intakes of drinking water and forage water as well as excretions of faecal and urinary water and respiratory and cutaneous water losses were greater in the rainy than the dry season under challenging thermal conditions such as in the rainy season nellore cattle drink more water than in the dry season and lose more water via respiration and sweating than any other route because sweating is their most important mechanism to control their body temperature melo costa et al 2018 water intake via forage was also greater in the rainy than the dry season due to a lower crude water concentration in the forage during the dry season mainly in the con system the proportion of dead plant material of total forage biomass which is characterized by greater dm concentrations compared to fresh leaves and stems pereira et al 2021b increased with advancing dry season for all systems and was particularly high in con additionally this fibrous material absorbs large amounts of water as well as contributes to the bulkiness of the faeces ireland perry and stallings 1993 this great amount of undigested lignified matter passing through the digestive tract in the dry season could thus explain the greater faecal dm excretion data not shown and faecal water excretion in the dry than the rainy season in the present study at animal level water inputs are the consumption of water via feed and drinking water as well as the metabolic water released during nutrient metabolism the water outputs are the excretion of water via urine and faeces as well as the respiratory and cutaneous water losses the water balance at animal level i e total inputs minus total outputs should be positive because animals in the present study gained bw although water retention in bw gain was rather small however the sum of mean water outputs exceeded that of the mean water inputs at animal level in particular during the dry season while water intake via drinking and forage consumption as well as faecal water losses were either measured or calculated from actually measured variables equations published in the literature were used to estimate metabolic water release respiratory and cutaneous water losses and urinary water excretion metabolic water release was similar to values presented by khelil arfa et al 2012 indicating that urinary and or respiratory and cutaneous water losses were likely overestimated in the present study 4 5 freshwater fluxes at system level as hypothesized differences in the freshwater consumption related to beef cattle between grazing systems varied with season freshwater consumption related to beef cattle was lower in both integrated systems than in con in the rainy season as discussed above see section 4 2 the synergies among crop and livestock components favour forage accumulation and animal production thereby decreasing the overall freshwater consumption for raising beef cattle moreover the lower et of forage in iclf than in con and icl in the rainy season reduced even further freshwater consumption in this system however while et from forage accumulation was lower in the dry than the rainy season in con the et from forage accumulation in iclf during the dry season was greater as compared to the rainy season and to the other systems indicating that iclf systems may be more prone to water shortage nevertheless the freshwater consumption related to beef cattle in iclf was greater in the rainy than the dry season as for the other systems despite the challenges and the great et from forage accumulation in iclf during the dry season beef cattle production in iclf is still feasible in this season the stocking density was adjusted to match forage biomass hence the seasonal et from forage multiplied by a lower total forage intake in the dry than the rainy season due to the lower number of animals grazing resulted in the lower freshwater consumption related to beef in the dry than the rainy season in iclf moreover we considered the continuous flow of cattle growth over the seasons freshwater consumption for beef cattle production e g about 15 415 l kg 1 bw gerbens leenes et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 was greater than other livestock e g pork was about 6000 l kg 1 bw and about 3800 l kg 1 bw for poultry gerbens leenes et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 or even crop production systems e g sugar and oil crops starchy roots and cereals were about 197 1644 387 and 2364 l kg 1 respectively mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 however in particular integrated systems do not only produce beef but fulfil several functions and provide multiple outputs such as the production of soybeans and timber from eucalyptus in the case of iclf in this line the et of eucalyptus plantation in iclf were much greater than by the pasture highlighting that despite the low tree density in the present study the et of eucalyptus may reduce the et from forage accumulation which represents a large proportion over the total freshwater consumption in this system moreover the forage biomass does not only provide feed for the animals for instance in contrast to the con system with forage for livestock as sole anthropogenic output the forage grasses provide litter for the following crop component in both integrated agro pastoral systems as well as for the eucalyptus trees in iclf thereby preserving residual soil moisture and reducing soil compaction and degradation fao 2019 additionally the forage root system increases soil carbon stocks and enhances soil structure for crop growth salton et al 2014 in this line cattle in the present study only consumed a small proportion of the total forage accumulation in both seasons about 18 on om basis and the freshwater consumption was much lower when only accounting for the et of the forage actually consumed by the animals table 7 accordingly also andreini et al 2018 estimated that 18 of the total freshwater consumption by range plants for et can be attributed to beef cattle taking into account these multiple functions and the small proportion of forage consumed by the animals in iclf and icl the freshwater consumptions were even lower than in con during the rainy 1022 and 721 l kg 1 bw and season 1 vs 7562 l kg 1 bw and season 1 and dry season 789 and 264 l kg 1 bw and season 1 vs 1984 l kg 1 bw and season 1 hence freshwater consumption related to beef cattle appear to be much smaller in integrated than conventional continuous pasture systems moreover these results emphasize the need to consider multiple functions of grassland forage and livestock when quantifying freshwater consumptions and assigning them to different components of integrated systems the greatest total freshwater consumption was in icl and con followed by iclf with a consumption 8 5 lower than the others despite the inclusion of et of eucalyptus eucalyptus plantations potentially use more water than other types of vegetation due to their high productivity and growth rates however at a spatial arrangement of 22 m only a small proportion of the area is covered by trees and then it might counterbalance the impacts on water resource ferraz et al 2019 there is considerable scope of integrated systems for decreasing freshwater consumption related to beef cattle kept under tropical grazing conditions in this line the et from forage accumulation holds considerable potential for optimizing water use efficiency being the main driver of the freshwater consumption related to beef cattle and strongly depending on grazing management feed intake animal performance and feed conversion efficiency lathuillière et al 2019 instead the share of drinking water intake and evaporated from the reservoirs over the total freshwater consumption was fairly little with only about 6 of the freshwater consumption related to beef cattle in the present study nevertheless drinking water is commonly sourced from farm reservoirs surface water bodies or groundwater which competes with other human uses lathuillière et al 2019 and thus should also be quantified and considered in developing solutions for improved water use in grazing based livestock systems 5 conclusions freshwater fluxes related to forage production and consumption are the main freshwater fluxes in grazing based beef cattle production systems in tropical environments accounting for 94 of the total animal related freshwater fluxes grassland forage however carries out several functions beyond feed source for the animals especially in integrated systems although drinking water intake accounts for only a small proportion of total animal related freshwater fluxes it originates from potentially limited groundwater sources and should thus be considered in future research freshwater fluxes differ between different grazing systems and seasons with significant interactions between system and season for main freshwater fluxes freshwater consumption related to beef cattle is lower in integrated than in continuous pasture systems in the rainy season due to lower evapotranspiration from forage accumulation nevertheless freshwater consumption is greater in agro silvopastoral than in agro pastoral or pure grazing systems in the dry season indicating that they may be more sensitive to water scarcity integrated systems are thus efficient grazing systems to reduce freshwater consumption of beef cattle but management strategies should be investigated for mitigating droughts impacts on agro silvopastoral systems funding the present research was funded by research training group water people

9466,beef production is one of the largest water consumers of all food production systems but there are substantial knowledge gaps about the accounting and interpretation of its freshwater consumption moreover hardly any study has assessed the freshwater fluxes related to beef cattle in integrated crop livestock icl and crop livestock forestry iclf systems we aimed at quantifying the freshwater fluxes related to beef cattle raised on continuous permanent brachiaria pastures con or in icl and iclf systems in the brazilian cerrado in the rainy and dry seasons evapotranspiration of forage grass eucalyptus trees in iclf and from drinking water troughs were calculated from meteorological data collected in the field forage accumulation was measured in 11 paddocks over both seasons and forage intake drinking water intake and bodyweight were quantified in 12 growing nellore heifers per system during two months per season freshwater fluxes related to forage production and animals were estimated drinking water intake and water intake via forage did not differ p 0 073 between the systems and were greater p 0 035 in the rainy than the dry season faecal and urinary water excretions were greater in the dry than the rainy season p 0 005 the respiratory and cutaneous water losses were greater p 0 001 in the rainy than the dry season in the rainy season evapotranspiration related to forage accumulation and freshwater consumption for raising beef cattle were greatest in con whereas they were greatest in iclf in the dry season although iclf appeared to be less resilient to dry periods both integrated systems offer the potential for reduced freshwater consumption for raising beef cattle under grazing conditions by improving the efficiency of forage use and or decreasing evapotranspiration of forage keywords agroforestry farming system ruminant silvopastoral tropical pasture water footprint 1 introduction quantifying the freshwater consumption in agriculture and understanding the freshwater fluxes within cattle farming systems has become of increasing public and scientific interests during recent years fao 2019 this increasing interests is on the one hand due to the declining availability of freshwater resources and the increasing competition in their use for different purposes mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 on the other hand the projected consequences of climate change such as more intense rainfall events decreases in precipitation the occurrence of severe to extreme droughts and prolonged dry seasons endanger the stability of freshwater supplies in agriculture reyer et al 2017 hence there is a growing need to understand the water fluxes within cattle farming systems in order to evaluate their resilience to periods of water scarcity and to develop strategies to reduce their overall demand and to enhance water use efficiency lathuillière et al 2019 in latin america extensive grasslands are used for beef cattle production as a consequence of the growing demand for animal products and increasing competition for land and other natural resources the use of these grasslands has continuously been intensified over the past decades anache et al 2019 resulting in widespread degradation of these grassland resources in this line the integrated crop livestock icl and integrated crop livestock forestry iclf systems have been promoted during recent years as valuable options for sustainable beef production in latin america and particularly the brazilian cerrado almeida et al 2013 by combining crop and livestock as well as forestry in case of iclf in the same location in rotation consortium or succession those systems increase soil fertility and biological activity salton et al 2014 increase grassland productivity improve animal welfare oliveira et al 2019 offset carbon emissions from cattle figueiredo et al 2017 and foster biodiversity and economy costa et al 2018 among others compared to the continuous con pasturing system commonly found in the brazilian cerrado iclf and icl systems differ in ambient temperatures relative air humidity solar radiation karvatte junior et al 2016 as well as forage growth and nutritional value gamarra et al 2017 and thus feed and drinking water intakes of grazing animals these differences will likely affect the water fluxes as well as the total freshwater consumption related to beef cattle rearing however may vary depending on the season of the year and the prevailing climatic conditions nevertheless to our knowledge no one has analysed so far the freshwater consumption related to beef cattle at animal and paddock level in these systems nor quantified the freshwater consumption for raising beef cattle on icl and iclf systems instead previous research related to freshwater consumption in grazing based systems rather focused on global comparisons of freshwater consumption between different farm animals and countries mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 on individual components kannan et al 2017 or water sources harding et al 2017 within cattle systems on cow calf production andreini et al 2018 and the finishing phase in feedlot systems palhares et al 2017 and or dismissed the impacts of seasonal differences on freshwater fluxes therefore our objectives were to characterize quantify and compare freshwater fluxes in three different grazing systems and to evaluate the contribution of animal related fluxes to total freshwater fluxes within these systems we hypothesized that trees in iclf systems would decrease ambient temperatures and solar radiation oliveira et al 2018 and increase nutritional quality of the available forage pereira et al 2021 thereby decreasing evapotranspiration et of forage and drinking water intake of grazing cattle while increasing their forage intake and performance furthermore rotation with soybean cultivation would increase soil fertility and forage yields in both icl and iclf systems as compared to con these effects would lower overall freshwater consumption for beef cattle raising in iclf and icl than con it is expected that these differences will be more pronounced for iclf than icl and greater in the rainy than the dry season due to lower et of tropical forage in iclf than icl as expected to be one of the main freshwater fluxes in grazing based beef cattle production systems instead trees and forage may compete for water glatzle et al 2021 which may increase the vulnerability of iclf to water shortage in the dry season 2 materials and methods field data collection was carried out in three different grazing based beef production systems from november 2018 to july 2019 including the main rainy season from november to march and the main dry season from april to july the experimental area was located at embrapa beef cattle in campo grande mato grosso do sul in the central west of brazil 20 24 54 9 s 54 42 25 8 w 530 m above sea level according to the köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 the experimental area is in the transition between the warm temperature fully humid and hot summer cfa and the equatorial winter dry i e aw zone average annual precipitation in the area is 1560 mm and average annual ambient air temperature 23 c based on historical data from 1977 to 2006 marcuzzo et al 2012 the variables used to represent the freshwater fluxes in the systems with growing nellore cattle are depicted in fig 1 the transport of water via precipitation evaporation from drinking water troughs et of forage and trees as well as via the drinking and forage water intakes urinary and faecal water excretions respiratory and cutaneous water losses metabolic water releases and the water retention in bodyweight bw gain of experimental animals were considered as freshwater fluxes within as well as into and out of the systems freshwater consumption refers to water removed from but not returned to the same drainage basin fao 2019 therefore the total et of forage drinking and forage water intakes and water evaporated from drinking water troughs were defined as freshwater consumption related to beef cattle fig 1 and table 1 2 1 experimental area and system description the three grazing based beef cattle systems evaluated are characterized as follows table 2 1 conventional continuous pasture con system as a monoculture pasture of brachiaria decumbens cv basilisk grazed

stocking method allen et al 2011 for three consecutive years the measurements were taken after one year of soybean cultivation the icl and iclf systems were implanted in 2008 and the con system in 1993 more details on the establishment of icl and iclf systems are given by oliveira et al 2014 since its implantation in 1993 con system had been managed extensively without fertilizer and lime applications and a constant stocking density which had led to severe degradation of the pasture therefore at the end of 2017 the system was renewed by soil preparation through a harrow disk before re seeding and applications of 2000 kg of lime ha 1 800 kg of gypsum ha 1 and 16 kg ha 1 of phosphorus pentoxide and 16 kg ha 1 of potassium oxide incorporated into the soil afterwards an additional application of 6 kg ha 1 of phosphorus pentoxide and 6 kg ha 1 of potassium oxide broadcasted over the pasture canopy and after seeding an application of 45 kg of nitrogen ha 1 in form of urea in april 2018 thereafter the pasture was used extensively for cattle grazing at a stocking density of 2 5 animals ha 1 2 2 soil characteristics the experimental area soil is classified as dark red latosol oxisol by the brazilian system of soil classification embrapa 2013 two subsamples were pooled from ten disturbed soil samples collected at the 0 20 cm soil depth from sampling points randomly located across each paddock in 2019 the soil acidification chemical and texture characterization were performed according to procedure proposed by teixeira et al 2017 table 2 2 3 climate and forage

exclusion cages were established in each icl n 5 and iclf n 5 to prevent grazing forage biomass inside exclusion cages was harvested by a brush cutter at a height of 0 04 m above the ground every month and the exclusion cages were moved to a new random location simultaneously comparable points outside the cages in a metal frame of similar dimension 1 0 m x 1 0 m located at three for con or five for icl and iclf locations were harvested by a brush cutter at a height of 0 04 m above the ground the criteria for the selection of points outside the cages were that the vegetation had as near as possible the same canopy height measured by a graduated ruler morphological composition and soil cover assessed visually than the vegetation inside of the cages the forage harvested in those points outside of cages were to simulate the initial forage biomass of the exclusion cage there were a total of five harvests in the rainy season and four in the dry season from january to february rainy season and june to july dry season forage biomass was harvested at a 15 d interval i e three harvests per season to quantify the above ground forage biomass available to grazing heifers all the forage samples were individually weighed immediately after the harvest by balances with a maximum capacity of 9000 g and an accuracy 0 01 g for each harvest all biomass harvested either inside or outside the cages were pooled to each paddock i e one pooled sample each for inside and outside the cages one sub sample of about 600 g of fresh matter from each paddock inside and outside the cages and in case of the samples harvested to characterize the instantaneous above ground biomass two sub samples from each paddock were taken put into paper bags and dried in forced air oven at 65 ºc until constant mass for determination of crude water concentration of forage later this crude water concentration of forage was used to calculate the water intake by the animals via the forage given in l animal 1 and d 1 by assuming that 1 kg 1 l by multiplying feed intake on fresh matter basis by its crude water concentration forage accumulation rate kg dry matter dm ha 1 and d 1 was calculated as the forage biomass kg dm ha 1 inside the cage minus the biomass outside the cage at the previous harvest divided by the days of interval between each harvest as described by the paired cage difference method radcliffe 1974 the initial forage biomass harvested in november 2018 as well as the forage biomass harvested in april 2019 were added to the average forage accumulation rate of the rainy and dry season multiplied by the days of measurements of each season respectively to determine the seasonal forage accumulation kg dm ha 1 and season 1 out of 353 measurements for forage accumulation rate twenty negative values that were lower than the calculated mean of the paddock within the respective month minus its standard deviation were considered as outliers data of forage biomass harvested in the 15 d interval sampling were averaged per paddock and harvest date however one paddock of iclf was included only in the dry season due to a strong decline in forage biomass see section 2 5 resulting in 63 mean values for the three sampling periods per season i e 10 paddocks x 2 seasons x 3 sampling periods 1 paddock x 1 season x 3 sampling periods 2 5 feed intake and performance of heifers all procedures of animal handling care and sampling were approved by the ethics and animal use commission of the embrapa beef cattle under protocol nº 014 2014 a total of 96 nellore heifers

62 heifers to an extra area with brachiaria sp pasture which were used to adjust the stocking densities in iclf and icl paddocks throughout the study animals had unrestricted access to the entire pasture areas they were vaccinated against brucellosis after weaning and foot and mouth disease every year in november 2018 and may 2019 in addition they were treated against endo and ectoparasites

season from june to july in those periods four animals were used per paddock and period for the iclf and icl systems whereas in the con two paddocks with two animals each were used to achieve a total number of four animals per period table 3 during the dry season two paddocks with two animals each were also used per period due to a decrease in forage biomass in iclf likewise as in the con system

dioxide was used to estimate daily faecal excretion of individual animals the marker was orally administered to each animal via gelatine capsules in two dosages per day of 5 g each in the rainy season and two dosages of 7 g each in the dry season at 07 00 and 16 00 h local time for ten days there was a 5 d adaptation period to achieve a homogenous titanium dioxide distribution in the digestive tract after this adaptation period faeces grab samples about 250 g fresh matter in each period were collected manually from the rectum of the animals twice a day at the same time than the titanium dioxide dosing over the last five days of each period i e sampling period for marker application and faeces collection the animals were removed from the paddocks and kept in a collection pen for about 1 h each day the faeces samples were stored in styrofoam coolers boxes with dry ice until they were frozen at 20 ºc at the end of each sampling at the end of each season faecal samples were thawed overnight pooled per animal and season by taking the same amount of material from each individual sample and divided in two sub samples about 60 g fresh matter each one of each sub samples was weighed oven dried at 40 ºc for 72 h and weighed again in order to estimate the water concentration in faeces afterwards the dried samples were ground to pass a 1 mm sieve willye star model ft 80 1 knife mill and analysed in duplicate for dm by drying at 105 ºc for 4 h and for crude ash by incineration at 550 c overnight the organic matter om concentrations in faeces were calculated as the difference between 1000 g kg 1 dm and crude ash concentrations g kg 1 dm the titanium dioxide concentrations in dried faecal samples were determined in duplicate according to the procedures described by boguhn et al 2009 with minor modifications the other fresh sub samples were analyzed in duplicate for nitrogen using the micro kjeldahl procedure aoac 1961 2010 method no 960 52 the concentrations of crude protein cp were calculated by multiplying the nitrogen concentrations in faeces by 6 25 apparent total tract om digestibility of the consumed diet was estimated from the faecal cp concentrations based on the curvilinear relationship developed by lukas et al 2005 using ai a2 from gumpenstein location data subsequently om intake kg animal 1 and d 1 and kg kg 0 75 bw and d 1 was estimated from faecal om excretion and om digestibility of the consumed diet 2 6 drinking water intake of heifers each paddock had a fixed concrete circular drinking water trough of an average circumference of 2 9 m one standard deviation 0 17 depth of 0 4 m one standard deviation 0 04 and capacity of 280 l one standard deviation 56 32 with an automatic filling controlled by a buoy allowing for ad libitum water supply drinking water intake of the entire animal group per paddock was recorded through water meters nevos volumetric itron inc liberty lake usa reading capacity of 1 5 m3 h 1 of water that were installed to the water inlet plumbing of the drinking water troughs in each paddock water meters were manually checked for accuracy before the experiment started readings were taken every day at 15 00 local time during the period of feed intake measurements and entered into a spreadsheet microsoft excel microsoft inc seattle usa for the calculations of total l of water flowing into each drinking water trough in a daily basis water lost through evaporation from the drinking water troughs and the rainwater were taken into account for this daily mean of evaporation from the drinking water troughs was subtracted from daily water inflow into the drinking water troughs and the precipitation given in l was added precipitation was measured in the systems by rain gauges placed in a single paddock in con and another in iclf hobo rg3 onset computer corporation bourne usa water evaporated from drinking water troughs during the experiment were derived from the evaporation water losses mm measured in one class a pan a702 brazilian inmet placed at the embrapa beef cattle meteorological station multiplied by the water surface area m2 of each drinking water trough evaporation data was transformed in l for the calculations of total l of water flowing into the drinking water troughs for the rainy season the evaporation data was an average of the daily recordings automatically collected at 08 00 of local time in december january and february n 77 d for the dry season the evaporation data was an average of the daily recordings manually taken at 08 00 of local time over 23 consecutive days from june to july on the same days as the water meter readings were conducted the automatic readings changed to manual due to a failure in the automatic readings of class a pan before the dry season started average daily drinking water intake l animal 1 and l kg 0 75 bw was then calculated by dividing the daily water flows l into the drinking water troughs corrected for the water evaporation and precipitation by the number of animals or total metabolic bw per paddock on the respective day outlier data were deleted from the dataset a total of 480 observations were retained with a mean of 22 consecutive daily readings per paddock and season i e 11 paddocks x 2 seasons x 22 d the data of om intake drinking water intake and faecal excretion of individual animals were assessed only in the three periods from january to february and from june to july hence the results obtained were extrapolated to all animals grazing the paddocks throughout the seasons by multiplying the results in kg of metabolic bw kg0 75 bw and d 1 by the total metabolic bw per hectare and season 2 7 freshwater fluxes related to faeces and urine excretion respiration and cutaneous evaporation and the animal s metabolism the faecal water excretion was calculated as follows 4 4 faecal water excretion kg animal 1 and d 1 faeces kg dm animal 1 and d 1 cwf g kg 1 fresh matter dmf g kg 1 fresh matter where faeces is faecal excretion cwf is faecal crude water concentration and dmf is faecal dry matter concentration to obtain the faecal water excretions the unit obtained in kg of water was converted to l animal 1 and d 1 by assuming that 1 kg 1 l the urinary water excretion was estimated from the predictive equation for urine excretion from khelil arfa et al 2012 5 urine excretion kg

matter intake in kg animal 1 and d 1 and cpconcentrate is the cp concentration in concentrate feed offered in g kg 1 dm the forage cp concentration was obtained from near infrared reflectance spectroscopy analysis and concentrate cp was considered as zero because no concentrate feed was fed the dm intake was obtained by dividing the om intake kg om animal 1 and d 1 by the om concentration of forage g kg 1 dm and multiplying it by 1000 estimated urine excretion was multiplied by 967 g water kg 1 urine and then converted to l animal 1 and d 1 by assuming that 1 kg 1 l water derived from

eucalyptus the et of eucalyptus trees in iclf was estimated as a function of the cumulative precipitation during the entire experimental period 252 d and the leaf area index m2 of leaf area m 2 of crown area proposed as follow almeida et al 2007 7 evapotranspiration of eucalyptus mm experimental period 1 266 92 91 041 leaf area index m 2 of leaf area m 2 of crown area 0 536 cumulative precipitation mm experimental period 1 leaf area of three randomly selected trees per paddock were measured destructively to obtain the leaf area index for this the whole tree canopy was weighed and three sub samples of about 2000 g of fresh leaves per tree were taken and their areas measured using a leaf area meter li 3100 c area meter li cor biosciences lincoln usa afterwards those leaf sub samples were put into paper bags and dried in forced air oven at 65 ºc until constant mass the leaf area of each tree was then calculated proportionally to the weight of the whole tree canopy of each tree respectively the crown area m² tree 1 of twelve other randomly selected trees per paddock was posteriorly estimated based on their crown radius m tree 1 which was measured with a tape by fixing ground points on either side of the trunk perpendicular to the tips of the longest branch subsequently the leaf area index was calculated by dividing the leaf area m2 tree 1 by the crown area m2 tree 1 to calculate the et of eucalyptus plantation the average of the twelve leaf area index estimations per paddock was used and as it was measured only once in 2019 the et was estimated for the entire experimental period rather than each season the et of eucalyptus mm experimental period 1 was divided by the cumulative precipitation mm experimental period 1 to obtain the ratio of et mm mm 1 precipitation according to almeida et al 2007 as the experimental area was flat soil surface water runoff was not considered as water flux gyenge et al 2002 2 9 freshwater consumption related to beef cattle the et of eucalyptus was not considered part of the freshwater consumption related to beef cattle given in l kg 1 bw and season 1 total et of forage accumulation l kg 1 om was calculated by multiplying the actual et of forage l ha 1 where mm d 1 was multiplied by 104 for conversion by the number of days per season and dividing it by the seasonal forage accumulation in kg om ha 1 and season 1 for details of et of forage see section 2 3 and for forage accumulation see section 2 4 thereafter freshwater consumption related to beef cattle l kg 1 bw and season 1 was calculated as

10 statistical analysis with exception of data on climate n 486 om intake n 71 an animal was removed from faeces sampling due to injury and et of eucalyptus trees n 12 means were calculated for each paddock resulting in 21 or 22 observations per each variable for the rainy any dry seasons respectively data were analysed by glimmix procedure of sas v9 4 sas institute inc cary nc usa considering season system and their interactions as fixed effects paddock as subject and a random residual effect the et from forage accumulation and freshwater consumption related to beef cattle were grouped by et to classify paddocks where the et was assessed and those for which et was not assessed the homogeneity of variance was tested through covtest statement for both et from forage accumulation and freshwater consumption related to beef cattle the hypothesis of equal variance was accepted p 0 127 for all models performed the ddfm kenwardroger option of the model statement was invoked all mean values are presented as least square means unless indicated otherwise in case of significant interactions p 0 05 between system and season the interactions were explored using the slice statement to test for the differences between system and season within each other for non significant interactions p 0 05 the tukey kramer test was used for comparisons between systems and seasons of least square means at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 climate and evapotranspiration the cumulative precipitation during the 4 month rainy season was 694 mm whereas it was 233 mm during the 4 month dry season table 4 there were four wet days with precipitation 1 mm d 1 levy et al 2017 at the end of december whereas there were more wet days 10 11 days from the beginning to the end of the months of january to march which were also more evenly distributed however there were also intense rainfall events for instance of 54 mm d 1 in january and 57 mm d 1 in february in the dry season there were four to six wet days per

global radiation in iclf was 23 and 27 lower as compared to con and icl pronounced seasonal differences in precipitation were observed for all systems yet when daily precipitation started to decline with advancing dry season the drop in relative air humidity was more pronounced in iclf than in con and icl actual daily et of forage was greater in the rainy than the dry season for all systems it was similar among the systems in the dry season in con and icl 1 3 mm one standard deviation 0 2 iclf 1 2 mm one standard deviation 0 2 but greater in con and icl 3 7 mm one standard deviation 1 2

p 0 007 daily forage accumulation rate kg dm ha 1 was not affected by the interaction between system and season p 0 092 and no differences were found between systems p 0 087 or seasons p 0 082 nevertheless there was an interaction p 0 047 between system and season for forage accumulation kg dm ha 1 and season 1 while for con forage accumulation was similar p 0 836 in both seasons it was

between each other across all systems adg was superior p 0 001 in the rainy least squares mean 0 51 one standard error 0 028 compared to the dry season least squares mean 0 20 one standard error 0 027 as a consequence bw gain per hectare kg season 1 was also superior p 0 001 in the rainy than the dry season for all systems but lower p 0 001 for con than for icl and iclf the bw gain per hectare over the entire experimental period of 243 d was 116 359 and 254 kg bw ha 1 in con icl and iclf respectively 3 4 freshwater fluxes at animal level none of the daily freshwater fluxes related to the heifers such as drinking water and forage water intakes water release during metabolism urinary and faecal water excretions respiratory cutaneous water losses and water retention in bw gain l animal 1 and d 1 were affected by the interaction p 0 05 between system and season table 6 drinking water intake did not differ between systems p 0 214 but was greater p 0 035 in the rainy than the dry season similarly water intake via forage did not differ between systems p 0 073 but was greater p 0 038 in the rainy than the dry season by contrast differences were found between systems p 0 010 but not between seasons p 0 433 for water release during metabolism animals in iclf released more water during metabolism than animals in con p 0 032 and icl p 0 012 whereas no differences p 0 761 were found between con and icl daily faecal water excretion did not differ between systems p 0 475 but was greater p 0 003 in the dry than the rainy season table 6 likewise daily urinary water excretion was

et from forage accumulation l kg 1 om and freshwater consumption related to beef cattle l kg 1 bw and season 1 table 7 the differences in et from forage accumulation and freshwater consumption related to beef cattle between systems varied with season the et from forage accumulation was lower p 0 001 in iclf than con in the rainy season whereas it was greatest p 0 021 in iclf in the dry season moreover et from forage accumulation was greater p 0 001 in the rainy than the dry season in con whereas it was greater p 0 001 in the dry compared to the rainy season in iclf total freshwater consumption related to beef cattle differed p 0 001 between icl and iclf in the dry season and was lower p 0 001 in the dry than the rainy season for all the systems when only accounting for the proportion of forage actually consumed by the animals see eq 10 freshwater consumption related to beef cattle was lower in iclf p 0 001 and icl p 0 027 than con in the rainy season but greater p 0 001 in iclf than con in the dry season irrespective of the season there were no differences between icl and iclf p 0 058 in the dry season icl was also similar p 0 949 to con across the three systems freshwater consumption related to beef cattle was lower p 0 001 in the dry compared to the rainy season except for icl for which it was similar p 0 405 between seasons the et of eucalyptus trees in iclf was 1018 mm during the entire experimental period the ratio between et and precipitation mm mm 1 both for the entire experimental period of 243 d was 1 10 according to the total area covered by eucalyptus of 447 m2 ha 1 total et of eucalyptus trees was 455 046 l ha 1 for the entire experimental period the total freshwater consumption per hectare during the whole experimental period is the sum of et from forage accumulation and from eucalyptus plus water evaporated from the drinking water troughs plus water intake via forage and drinking of the animals and the results are depicted in fig 2 4 discussion 4 1 climate and evapotranspiration the observed climatic conditions were typical for the rainy and dry seasons in the brazilian cerrado with the exception of the very low precipitation in december and january which are normally above 150 mm per month with an average cumulative precipitation of 211 mm in mato grosso do sul in january marcuzzo et al 2012 mean monthly ambient air temperatures were numerically similar between systems also oliveira et al 2018 who evaluated the microclimate in the same experimental area than of the present study from 2011 to 2012 observed similar ambient air temperatures between iclf and icl similarly giro et al 2019 found no differences in ambient air temperature between iclf and icl who evaluated the microclimate of an experimental area in the brazilian cerrado during summer and autumn with similar tree density 165 eucalyptus trees ha 1 and tree height 26 m than in the present study the forestry component in iclf is often considered to decrease ambient air temperatures and to reduce solar radiation however these effects do not occur uniformly across the whole area and during the entire seasons because the ellipsoid crown shape of eucalyptus and its spaced branches result in little interception of radiance karvatte junior et al 2016 therefore radiation may be high in some locations whereas elsewhere the attenuation of solar radiation can be significant during most of the day oliveira et al 2018 part of this incident sunlight is reflected back thereby contributing to increasing ambient air temperatures also underneath the cover of the trees in iclf systems schumacher and poggiani 1993 moreover the lack of differences in ambient air temperature between the systems along the seasons could be explained by the shade projection in the canopy of iclf which does not occur uniformly during the entire season due to the sun displacement relative to the tree arrangement for instance a greater radiation incidence is found in the middle of the paddocks compared to the one near to the trees in the summer conversely in the winter solstice the low sun inclination in the southern hemisphere results in general in less radiation incidence in the whole canopy and sunlight concentrates near the rows of trees therefore one explanation among other effects is that unevenly distributed solar irradiance in iclf hinders a clear reduction in ambient air temperature compared to the full sun conditions in con and icl nevertheless shading effectively reduced solar radiation and increased relative air humidity in iclf compared with icl and con in both seasons in the present study as a result et of forage was lower in iclf than icl and con during the rainy season except january although being similar between systems in the dry season the et obtained in icl and con in the rainy season was comparable to the findings of meirelles et al 2011 and santos et al 2004 who assessed the et in open brachiaria brizantha pasture in brazilian cerrado in december 2001 3 8 mm d 1 or from november to may in 2000 3 4 mm d 1 respectively in most wet tropics radiation greatly influences et of forage and as hypothesized et of forage was lower in iclf than in con and icl in response to tree shading eastham and rose 1988 additionally the vapour pressure deficit is a driving force for water losses from the internal leaf to the atmosphere with lower vapour deficits reducing the atmosphere s demand for water from plant transpiration zhang et al 2017 as well as its capacity to take up additional water allen et al 1998 given the similar ambient air temperatures across the systems relative air humidity was greater and thus vapour pressure deficit lower in iclf than icl and con in the rainy season which in addition to the lower solar radiation explain the lower et of forage in iclf nevertheless et of forage was similar across the systems in the dry season the stomatal closure in response to reduced soil water supply regulates transpiration fisher et al 2009 irrespective of the system daily et of forage was greater in the rainy than the dry season although wind speed was faster in the dry than the rainy season the greater global radiation ambient air temperatures cumulative precipitation and hence kc increased et during the rainy season moreover lack of precipitation reduces et of forage by declining soil water stocks leaf water potential and leaf area index and consequently kc and et decrease for most land covers lathuillière et al 2012 in this line anache et al 2019 found that et of brachiaria decumbens in open pastures in the brazilian cerrado decreased during the dry season due to the lack of water readily available for plants within the root zone 4 2 forage biomass and accumulation in general forage accumulation rates were similar to those reported in the literature for instance daily forage accumulation rate in con in the rainy season was in line with the mean forage accumulation rate of 42 1 kg dm ha 1 and d 1 determined by braga et al 2008 for a brachiaria decumbens pasture in the brazilian cerrado during the rainy season of 2007 and 2008 moreover forage accumulation rate in icl in the rainy season of the present study was similar to those reported by euclides et al 2016 and santos et al 2016 for piatã grass pasture used in conventional open grazing system i e con 64 1 kg dm ha 1 and d 1 and an icl system 64 5 kg dm ha 1 and d 1 respectively both in the brazilian cerrado finally daily forage accumulation rate in iclf was in agreement with that of santos et al 2016 who measured mean forage accumulation rate of piatã grass grown in the understory of eucalyptus urograndis trees 22 m distance between rows in the brazilian cerrado of 41 8 kg and 13 7 kg dm ha 1 and d 1 during the rainy and dry seasons respectively forage biomass and forage accumulation were greater in icl compared with con in both seasons possibly due to synergies among the components of the system the litter accumulated from the soybean as a crop planted one year before the experiment its symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria and fertilizer residues likely increased nitrogen accumulation om concentrations and cation exchange capacity of the soil salton et al 2014 the greater cation exchange capacity acts as a buffer against soil acidification which is particularly relevant given the natural acidity of the soils in the brazilian cerrado yamada 2005 these benefits would further enhance forage accumulation rate salton et al 2014 not only in icl but also for iclf however in iclf the lower par likely reduced the photosynthetic rates of the perennial c4 forage grass pignon et al 2017 along with a possible competition between trees and the forage for water in the dry season bosi et al 2020 thus the lowest forage biomass and forage accumulation were observed in iclf in the dry season nevertheless if as in the present study trees are widely spaced light and precipitation interception and thus the decline in forage accumulation rate are rather small due to the narrow shape of the eucalyptus crown with time these differences in forage accumulation rate between systems may change while in con soil fertility forage canopy cover and forage accumulation rate may decrease in response to continuous grazing year after year the beneficial residual effects of soybean cultivation on forage accumulation rate observed in icl and iclf in the first year will decline in subsequent years the seasonal differences in forage accumulation confirm similar findings in literature for tropical grasses pereira et al 2021a salton et al 2014 santos et al 2016 they were more pronounced in icl and iclf than con suggesting that besides a lower par also water availability in the dry season limited forage accumulation in iclf the seasonal forage accumulation rate did not reduce in the dry compared to the rainy season in con as it did for the other systems at the beginning of the dry season the first forage biomass harvested was greater in con than icl and iclf the constant and lower stocking rate in con than in the other two systems in the rainy season possibly avoided a pronounced decline in forage biomass from the rainy to the beginning of the dry season the much lower forage accumulation in iclf than the open grazing systems during water stress conditions has been attributed to the leaf stomatal responses to changes in sunlight intensity as influenced by water restriction feldhake 2009 leaf stomata open to allow for carbon dioxide diffusion into the leaf to utilize par however during water shortage leaf stomata close at least partially to reduce water loss which hampers carbon dioxide uptake therefore plants cannot compensate for the limited radiation by triggering mechanisms to increase radiation use efficiency feldhake 2009 additionally eucalyptus trees have a developed root system which competes strongly for moisture with pasture ferraz et al 2019 in this line glatzle et al 2021 found that soil water content at 0 30 cm depth where 80 of brachiaria roots are located guenni et al 2002 was often 25 of a field capacity within the same experimental site during the dry season of 2016 and 2017 additionally soil moisture at 20 100 cm depth was lower in iclf compared to icl and con system glatzle personal communication hence despite not measured in the present study the forage accumulation in iclf was likely restricted by water competition between forage and eucalyptus in the dry season whereas precipitation was sufficiently high to compensate for this competition in the rainy season 4 3 feed intake and performance of heifers the adg of animals in iclf was similar to that of heifers in icl and greater in both these systems than in con whereas om intake was only greater in iclf but not in icl than in con these findings partially support our hypothesis of a greater forage intake of the animals in the integrated systems enhancing their adg a superior nutritional quality of forage may explain the greater om intake and adg of heifers in iclf hence cp concentrations of tropical forage grasses grown under shading such as in iclf are generally greater and thus their nutritional value higher than of those under full sun conditions gamarra et al 2017 oliveira et al 2014 pereira et al 2021a in this line also greater cp and lower lignin concentrations and thus greater apparent total tract digestibility of om were found in forage in iclf than in con in the present experiment zawada 2020 the superior om digestibility in iclf allowed for a greater voluntary feed intake machado et al 2016 and thus intake of digestible om and adg of the animals in this system moreover animals in the tropics and subtropics are commonly exposed to heat stress although moderate to severe heat stress conditions occurred in all systems during the rainy season fewer hours of severe heat stress were observed in the rainy season and of moderate heat stress in the dry season in iclf compared to icl and con pereira et al 2021b additionally shading effectively reduces solar radiation load for the animals giro et al 2019 the reduced exposure to severe heat stress and radiation load might have prolonged the animals grazing time morrison 1983 souza et al 2017 and hence increased their om intake and adg in iclf instead om intake of heifers in icl did not differ from those in con while their adg was greater than in con and similar to that in iclf in line with results of the present study the adg of nellore heifers continuously grazing on piatã grass did not differ between iclf and icl systems in previous studies gamarra et al 2017 oliveira et al 2014 pereira et al 2021a with comparable mean adg of 0 40 kg gamarra et al 2017 0 38 kg oliveira et al 2014 and 0 39 kg bw animal 1 and d 1 pereira et al 2021a than determined in the present experiment reasons for the greater adg in icl than in con despite the similar om intake are not fully clear microclimatic conditions were less favourable in icl than in iclf pereira et al 2021b and the nutritive value of forage was lower zawada 2020 than in the other two systems which might have limited om intake of heifers in icl however the greater forage allowance in icl than in con and iclf pereira et al 2019 likely enabled heifers to select for forage biomass of higher nutritional quality and thus allowed for an adg greater than in con and similar than in iclf consequently bw gain per hectare and season was also greater in icl than in iclf rainy season only and con nevertheless as result of the greater forage allowance and the most likely high degree of selective grazing efficiency of pasture utilization in kg bw gain per kg of forage biomass was lower in icl than in iclf in this line the proportions of dead matter and stem material were greater in icl than in iclf and con for proportion of stem material only towards the end of the dry season pereira et al 2021b indicating the potential to increase productivity of this system by improved grazing management 4 4 freshwater fluxes at animal level in contrast to our expectations there were no interactions between system and season for freshwater fluxes at animal level despite variable differences between systems within each season in for instance forage biomass table 5 moreover only minor effects of system on the freshwater fluxes at animal level were found instead the effects of season were more pronounced animals in iclf were expected to have a lower drinking water intake compared to those in the other systems due to a more favourable microclimate and thus thermal comfort of the animals as well as the low dm concentration of the forage and thus a greater water intake via the feed in iclf yet drinking water intake did not differ between systems regardless of the longer exposure to severe and moderate heat stress in the systems without trees in the rainy and dry season respectively see section 4 3 drinking water intake is correlated positively to feed intake of nellore heifers raised in feedlot systems zanetti et al 2019 and of crossbred beef steers heifers and bull calves growing in feedlot systems brew et al 2011 in the present study om intake of heifers were greater in iclf than in con which could thus at least partly explain the similar drinking water intake see section 3 3 at the same time there were no differences in the water intake via forage between systems likely because forage dm concentrations were not always lower throughout the paddocks in iclf than the other systems in every forage measurement moreover urinary water excretion was greater in iclf than in icl and con possibly due to the greater cp concentrations zawada 2020 and om digestibility see section 4 3 of available forage in iclf than in the other systems and the consequently greater intake of digestible nitrogen which may have increased renal nitrogen load and thus urine volume and urinary water excretion khelil arfa et al 2012 together with the greater water retention in bw in iclf the greater urinary water excretion likely increased water requirements of heifers in iclf which together with their greater om intake but similar water intake via forage could explain the lack of differences between systems in drinking water intake hardly any study has evaluated drinking water intake under grazing conditions in the tropics and subtropics nevertheless drinking water intakes of the animals in con and icl in the rainy season in the present study were very similar to that of nellore heifers raised in a feedlot system under tropical conditions during the rainy season 16 7 l animal 1 and d 1 one standard deviation 6 1 as determined by zanetti et al 2019 in grazing clover dominant pasture in a temperate climate drinking water intake of non lactating jersey cows and their crossbreds jersey x friesian or jersey x shorthorn was also similar to the heifers in con and icl with a range from 13 6 to 20 5 l animal 1 and d 1 wright and jones 1974 a minor system effect was observed for water release during metabolism animals in iclf released more water during metabolism than those in con and icl the greatest om intake and om digestibility of this consumed forage in iclf increased the metabolic water supply by increasing the availability of some nutrients within the animals cells with 1 g of lipid protein and carbohydrate oxidized resulting in 1 07 0 41 and 0 60 g of water respectively being produced martin 1985 as cited in murphy 1992 nevertheless from a quantitative point of view also in the present study main freshwater fluxes were water intakes via drinking and forage faecal and urinary water excretions as well as water evaporation via respiration and skin which thus should be measured and considered in analysing seasonal or system effects on freshwater fluxes and balance at animal level voluntary intakes of drinking water and forage water as well as excretions of faecal and urinary water and respiratory and cutaneous water losses were greater in the rainy than the dry season under challenging thermal conditions such as in the rainy season nellore cattle drink more water than in the dry season and lose more water via respiration and sweating than any other route because sweating is their most important mechanism to control their body temperature melo costa et al 2018 water intake via forage was also greater in the rainy than the dry season due to a lower crude water concentration in the forage during the dry season mainly in the con system the proportion of dead plant material of total forage biomass which is characterized by greater dm concentrations compared to fresh leaves and stems pereira et al 2021b increased with advancing dry season for all systems and was particularly high in con additionally this fibrous material absorbs large amounts of water as well as contributes to the bulkiness of the faeces ireland perry and stallings 1993 this great amount of undigested lignified matter passing through the digestive tract in the dry season could thus explain the greater faecal dm excretion data not shown and faecal water excretion in the dry than the rainy season in the present study at animal level water inputs are the consumption of water via feed and drinking water as well as the metabolic water released during nutrient metabolism the water outputs are the excretion of water via urine and faeces as well as the respiratory and cutaneous water losses the water balance at animal level i e total inputs minus total outputs should be positive because animals in the present study gained bw although water retention in bw gain was rather small however the sum of mean water outputs exceeded that of the mean water inputs at animal level in particular during the dry season while water intake via drinking and forage consumption as well as faecal water losses were either measured or calculated from actually measured variables equations published in the literature were used to estimate metabolic water release respiratory and cutaneous water losses and urinary water excretion metabolic water release was similar to values presented by khelil arfa et al 2012 indicating that urinary and or respiratory and cutaneous water losses were likely overestimated in the present study 4 5 freshwater fluxes at system level as hypothesized differences in the freshwater consumption related to beef cattle between grazing systems varied with season freshwater consumption related to beef cattle was lower in both integrated systems than in con in the rainy season as discussed above see section 4 2 the synergies among crop and livestock components favour forage accumulation and animal production thereby decreasing the overall freshwater consumption for raising beef cattle moreover the lower et of forage in iclf than in con and icl in the rainy season reduced even further freshwater consumption in this system however while et from forage accumulation was lower in the dry than the rainy season in con the et from forage accumulation in iclf during the dry season was greater as compared to the rainy season and to the other systems indicating that iclf systems may be more prone to water shortage nevertheless the freshwater consumption related to beef cattle in iclf was greater in the rainy than the dry season as for the other systems despite the challenges and the great et from forage accumulation in iclf during the dry season beef cattle production in iclf is still feasible in this season the stocking density was adjusted to match forage biomass hence the seasonal et from forage multiplied by a lower total forage intake in the dry than the rainy season due to the lower number of animals grazing resulted in the lower freshwater consumption related to beef in the dry than the rainy season in iclf moreover we considered the continuous flow of cattle growth over the seasons freshwater consumption for beef cattle production e g about 15 415 l kg 1 bw gerbens leenes et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 was greater than other livestock e g pork was about 6000 l kg 1 bw and about 3800 l kg 1 bw for poultry gerbens leenes et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 or even crop production systems e g sugar and oil crops starchy roots and cereals were about 197 1644 387 and 2364 l kg 1 respectively mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 however in particular integrated systems do not only produce beef but fulfil several functions and provide multiple outputs such as the production of soybeans and timber from eucalyptus in the case of iclf in this line the et of eucalyptus plantation in iclf were much greater than by the pasture highlighting that despite the low tree density in the present study the et of eucalyptus may reduce the et from forage accumulation which represents a large proportion over the total freshwater consumption in this system moreover the forage biomass does not only provide feed for the animals for instance in contrast to the con system with forage for livestock as sole anthropogenic output the forage grasses provide litter for the following crop component in both integrated agro pastoral systems as well as for the eucalyptus trees in iclf thereby preserving residual soil moisture and reducing soil compaction and degradation fao 2019 additionally the forage root system increases soil carbon stocks and enhances soil structure for crop growth salton et al 2014 in this line cattle in the present study only consumed a small proportion of the total forage accumulation in both seasons about 18 on om basis and the freshwater consumption was much lower when only accounting for the et of the forage actually consumed by the animals table 7 accordingly also andreini et al 2018 estimated that 18 of the total freshwater consumption by range plants for et can be attributed to beef cattle taking into account these multiple functions and the small proportion of forage consumed by the animals in iclf and icl the freshwater consumptions were even lower than in con during the rainy 1022 and 721 l kg 1 bw and season 1 vs 7562 l kg 1 bw and season 1 and dry season 789 and 264 l kg 1 bw and season 1 vs 1984 l kg 1 bw and season 1 hence freshwater consumption related to beef cattle appear to be much smaller in integrated than conventional continuous pasture systems moreover these results emphasize the need to consider multiple functions of grassland forage and livestock when quantifying freshwater consumptions and assigning them to different components of integrated systems the greatest total freshwater consumption was in icl and con followed by iclf with a consumption 8 5 lower than the others despite the inclusion of et of eucalyptus eucalyptus plantations potentially use more water than other types of vegetation due to their high productivity and growth rates however at a spatial arrangement of 22 m only a small proportion of the area is covered by trees and then it might counterbalance the impacts on water resource ferraz et al 2019 there is considerable scope of integrated systems for decreasing freshwater consumption related to beef cattle kept under tropical grazing conditions in this line the et from forage accumulation holds considerable potential for optimizing water use efficiency being the main driver of the freshwater consumption related to beef cattle and strongly depending on grazing management feed intake animal performance and feed conversion efficiency lathuillière et al 2019 instead the share of drinking water intake and evaporated from the reservoirs over the total freshwater consumption was fairly little with only about 6 of the freshwater consumption related to beef cattle in the present study nevertheless drinking water is commonly sourced from farm reservoirs surface water bodies or groundwater which competes with other human uses lathuillière et al 2019 and thus should also be quantified and considered in developing solutions for improved water use in grazing based livestock systems 5 conclusions freshwater fluxes related to forage production and consumption are the main freshwater fluxes in grazing based beef cattle production systems in tropical environments accounting for 94 of the total animal related freshwater fluxes grassland forage however carries out several functions beyond feed source for the animals especially in integrated systems although drinking water intake accounts for only a small proportion of total animal related freshwater fluxes it originates from potentially limited groundwater sources and should thus be considered in future research freshwater fluxes differ between different grazing systems and seasons with significant interactions between system and season for main freshwater fluxes freshwater consumption related to beef cattle is lower in integrated than in continuous pasture systems in the rainy season due to lower evapotranspiration from forage accumulation nevertheless freshwater consumption is greater in agro silvopastoral than in agro pastoral or pure grazing systems in the dry season indicating that they may be more sensitive to water scarcity integrated systems are thus efficient grazing systems to reduce freshwater consumption of beef cattle but management strategies should be investigated for mitigating droughts impacts on agro silvopastoral systems funding the present research was funded by research training group water people

9467,the root zone soil moisture rzsm is essential for monitoring and forecasting agricultural hydrological and meteorological systems accordingly researchers are determined to improve robust machine learning ml models to increase the accuracy of the rzsm predictions this paper designed new complementary forecasting paradigms hybridizing empirical wavelet transform ewt and two modern ensemble based ml models namely extreme gradient boosting xgboost and categorical boosting catboost to forecast long term multi step ahead daily rzsm in very cold and very warm semi arid regions of iran for this purpose the required datasets consisting of soil properties and meteorological information were extracted from the satellite datasets during 2005 2020 for ardabil and minab sites afterward the significant lags of rzsm time series and optimal influence candidate inputs were sought based on the partial autocorrelation function pacf and mutual information techniques respectively selected lagged components of rzsm time series were decomposed using ewt into different sub sequences and consequently concatenated with candidate inputs to feed the ensemble ml models to forecast one three and seven day ahead rzsm at each case study the performance of ewt catboost and ewt xgboost and their counterpart standalone approaches was firstly evaluated in forecasting one three and seven day

monitoring meteorological systems agricultural systems irrigation management and rzsm is used as an indicator to predict and monitor drought souissi et al 2020 xu et al 2021 zhuang et al 2020 the usual approach to measure the rzsm is in situ soil moisture instruments which is time consuming and costly on a large scale xu et al 2021 the most suitable method for global sm data is the microwave active and passive remote sensing technique al yaari 2014 microwave instruments with lower microwave frequency l band have higher penetration into the sm sampling depth than those with higher frequencies c and x band and the attenuation effects of vegetation and atmosphere in the l band are the lowest escorihuela et al 2010 l band signals are sensitive to measuring sm due to the significant difference between the water and dry soil dielectric constants therefore the l band is particularly suitable for estimating surface sm entekhabi et al 2010 kerr et al 2010 the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa soil moisture active passive smap missions are dedicated satellites for providing the global sm and rzsm data from l band microwave observations entekhabi et al 2010 1 2 applied machine learning models for sm computation the applicability of machine learning ml for modeling sm has been recognized since a decade ago ahmad et al 2010 ali et al 2015 in the earliest research conducted by pasolli et al 2009 the authors used microwave remote sensing data to build an artificial neural network ann and support vector regression svr models for sm prediction a

reported studies and several others approved the capability of ml methods for modeling sm at diverse regions around the world using different types of remote sensing data using the vosviewer software the collected literature was analyzed for the major keywords occurrence and the countries adopted for sm prediction using the feasibility of ml based on 91 research articles that appeared in the scopus database fig 1 indicated that 190 keywords are the major used for the established research of sm prediction the presented vosviewer algorithm revealed the significance of the sm prediction as it participated in diverse geo science and agriculture problems however for the recently conducted research the focus was on studying sm using the availability of remote sensing microwave remote sensing and satellite data this provides the data intelligence credibility for delivering a robust and reliable modeling technology that can predict sm more accurately it is worth highlighting that the major countries studying this geo science engineering problem include the united states italy china india and canada limited countries are interested in this research domain yet more exploration is needed particularly for developing countries 1 3 research significant and motivation sm is the truly connected parameter to the hydrological cycle and it is governed by the interaction between the atmosphere and land and thus impacted by hydro climatological parameters bayatvarkeshi et al 2021 hence its accurate quantification is a challenging problem in addition sm magnitude varies with soil depth and several other morphological parameters might influence the soil water content rzsm is one of the essential parameters that can be predicted accurately as it contributes to diverse geo science engineering applications and among them agriculture and crops production as per the literature survey limited research was adopted on the rzsm prediction thus the current study intends to develop a reliable data intelligent model for the accurate prediction of rzsm 1 4 research objectives based on the reported literature review and the identified research gap the following research

the minab site the skewness of daily rzsm data is lower than 2 and kurtosis is limited in the range 0 2 3 which implies that the data distribution is close to near normal 2 3 mutual information and partial autocorrelation function mutual information mi which measures the correlation between random variables is a non negative and symmetric parameter the entropy of a random variable which measures the amount of information contained in a random variable is intrinsically linked to the concept of mi one way to define the mi between two discrete random variables is as follows tian et al 2019 1 mi x y p xy log p x y p x p y where p x y is the joint probability math function of variables x and y and p x and p y are marginal probability distribution functions for variables x and y respectively if the mi between the two variables is significant the variables are highly connected he et al 2018 if the random variables are continuous the relationship is defined as a double definite integral as follows 2 mi x y p xy log p x y p x p y dx dy 2 4 empirical wavelet methodology ewt ewt uses an adaptive wavelet filter to extract the signal s mode components combining the adaptive decomposition

throughout the segmentation process to lift the fourier spectrum s amplitude and frequency modulation am fm the am fm signal is then processed using the hilbert transform to obtain the instantaneous frequency amplitude from the perspective of the fourier transform this operation is equivalent to building a set of band pass filters gu et al 2021 ewt can be applied in the three steps listed below liu et al 2021 i applying fft to discrete signals f t provides the fourier spectrum x ω using the first n maximum values m m i i 1 2 n in the fourier spectrum to extract the related frequencies ω ω i

2016 presented xgboost a highly scalable end to end tree boosting system that has been widely deployed and optimized in a wide variety of research domains dong et al 2020 lu and ma 2020 osman et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 when the xgboost is used to solve regression issues it continuously adds new regression trees and then fits the residuals of the prior model using the newly generated cart classifier and regression tree ensemble tao et al 2021a as a cart ensemble the xbgoost combines similar weak learners to produce a stronger learner zhu et al 2021 friedman 2002 9 y ˆ m y ˆ m 1 α f m x θ m α j 1 m f j x θ j where m is the number of boosting regression trees θ j is the parameter dictating how the j th tree is constructed α is the shrinkage factor f j x θ j is the output of the j th regression tree based on the structure of θ j without shrinkage x is the predictor and y ˆ j is the prediction of the j th regression tree as a result the residual will often decrease as the number of regression trees increases gradient boosting regression s purpose is to discover the optimal θ j and to construct f j x θ j at the j th step in order to minimize the objective function below hastie et al 2009 bhagat et al 2021 10 l i l y ˆ i y i i l y ˆ i j 1 α f j x i θ j y i where l is the loss function which is typically the squared error between the estimated value y ˆ i and the observed value

regression tree λ is the regularization term on the regression tree s leaf weight and w k j denotes the weight of the k th leaf in the j th regression tree it is evident that more leaves larger t j will be punished by a more significant factor γ to optimize the objective function tao et al 2021b tao et al 2018 the tree parameter θ j in the xgboost model can be determined during training but some hyperparameters such as γ λ m a and d max must be supplied before the training process the grid search approach was used in this study to optimize the performance of the xgboost model by adjusting the following four critical hyperparameters max depth d max it regulates the model s complexity a more sophisticated model is far more prone to overfitting learning rate α this is a critical parameter in the majority of ml methods it can be changed to increase the model s robustness gamma γ it is used to govern regularization and the optimal value may aid in avoiding overfitting lambda λ it regulates weight regularization to prevent overfitting zhu et al 2021 2 6 2 6 categorical boosting catboost prokhorenkova et al 2017 created catboost a gradient boosting decision tree gbdt framework based on tree boosting similar to other decision tree approaches like xgboost chen et al 2015 and lightgbm catboost is based on the theoretical expectation that iteratively combining weak regressors can create a powerful regressor ding et al 2021 the catboost algorithm is capable of handling categorical features the conventional gbdt technique can be used to replace categorical features with an average label value in a decision tree the average label value will be used as the criterion for node splitting this procedure is referred to as greedy target based statistics greedy tbs and can be presented as follows dorogush et al 2018 huang et al 2019 13 j 1 p x j k x i k y i j 1 n x j k x i k on average features include more data than labels we will see a conditional shift if we utilize the average label value to express features aggressively catboost enhances greedy tbs by adding a previous value assume we have a dataset of observations d x i y i i 1 n and if a permutation is σ σ 1 σ n x σ p k is replaced with jabeur et al 2021 14 j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k y σ j ap j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k a where a is the weight of the prior value and p denotes a prior value this strategy helps to reduce the noise produced by the low frequency category fig 4 depicts the structure of the catboost algorithm 2 7 2 7 kernel ridge regression krr when dealing with high dimensional problems ridge regression rr is a popular regression based model because it can generally provide acceptable accuracy even when it contains multicollinearity linear correlation and imposes a penalty on the size of regression coefficients to reduce their size an et al 2007 unlike the traditional ridge kernel approach the krr approach may train a function in a reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs to capture the non linear case and is consistent with the rkhs regularized learning issue the krr model has the following mathematical function ali et al 2020 15 arg min 1 m i 1 m f i y i 2 λ f h 2 16 f i j 1 α j φ x j x i the hilbert normed space is denoted by h eq 15 can be simply expressed for a m m kernel matrix k you et al 2018 17 k λ ni y 18 y i 1 m α i φ x i x the krr method approximates α during the training stage by locating solutions to eq 19 it then determines the optimal γ and α values from the parameter set to achieve the best performance then in the testing stage the α is utilized to calculate the regressand for the newer samples x as in eq 20 the linear polynomial and gaussian kernels were employed in this investigation to get the highest accuracy ali et al 2020 2 8 models evaluation indices

forecasted data 3 model development 3 1 dataset pre processing and feature selection procedure recently various ml based techniques have been devoted to hydrological soil properties problems such as sm forecasting however limited literature focused on complementary ml based models using pre processing such as wavelet transform families and empirical mode decomposition techniques here two new complementary empirical wavelet transform based ensemble ml models namely ewt catboost and ewt xgboost were developed to forecast daily rzsm for one three and seven days ahead horizons in two sites i e ardabil and minab having two opposite climates in iran moreover the ewt krr model was adopted better to evaluate the predictive potential of both complementary models for constructing a forecasting model of the daily rzsm the soil properties i e soil temperature at six depths and rzsm time series and climatological dataset i e tave tmin tmax pr ws10 m and rh2 m of both considered sites in the period of march 2015 to december 2020 were extracted from the smap and erra2 satellites respectively in other words the candidate input variables are climatological information temperature based soil properties antecedent information of observed rzsm for non complementary models and the ewt decomposed components of rzsm for complementary models in each site in recent research a systematic process for selecting the appropriate inputs to train the predictive models based on the effectiveness of essential parameters and elimination of redundant ones in achieving a promising result has been highly welcomed by researchers partial autocorrelation function pacf tiwari and adamowski 2013 mutual information mi and different feature selection schemes are common tools utilized in ml based studies for identifying the influential candidate input variables quilty and adamowski 2021 2020 here concerning the non linear relationship through sm physical process the mi approach correlation analysis and pacf assessment are used to determine the relevance of candidate inputs for both understudy sites fig 5 illustrates the pacf for rzsm at ardabil and minab as can be seen the first four lags for ardabil and the first five lags for minab had significant values regarding upper and lower confidence limits that were taken into account as candidate input variables for adopting the complementary ml based models fig 6 showed the degree of dependency between candidate inputs and rzsm for ardabil and minab sites based on mi score and pearson correlation coefficient according to fig 6 the most impact was related to the antecedent information rzsm t 1 rzsm t 2 rzsm t 5 of rzsm in both sites with a score of more than mi 1 5 whereas the rh2 m ws10 m and pr m i 0 1 had the most negligible effect on forecasting the rzsm for all multi head horizons among all non antecedent candidate inputs the soil temperature variables in the lower levels stl4 stl5 and stl6 had the most important followed by tave tmin and tmax respectively the pearson correlation coefficients confirm the feature mentioned above selection process accordingly therefore the pr and ws10 m were omitted due to their negligible effect on rzsm the optimal input combinations in each site and for all the time scale horizons are reported in table 3 3 2 complementary models description ewt pre processing algorithm is one of the most recent signal processing tools to decompose original time series into sub sequence to extract the in depth information of the signal this algorithm can properly overcome the drawbacks insufficient mathematical information of traditional decomposition tools such as the emd eemd feemd and ceemdan li et al 2018 liu et al 2018 the setting parameter of decomposition of time series using ewt is the length of filter 10 sigma filter 1 5 and a maximum number of band pass 3 filtering which are selected as the default values furthermore the mode number of ewt decomposition level as the most crucial setting of ewt for ardabil and minab were obtained at 12 and 8 respectively a trial and error procedure was applied to reduce the complexity of the residual component and gain higher accuracy the decomposed sub sequences of rzsm signals by ignoring the residual signal for both sites are shown in fig 7 3 3 data division strategy as mentioned before the duration period of gathered datasets was between 03 31 2015 and 12 31 2020 regarding backward time lagging for multi step ahead horizons rzsm t 1 rzsm t 2 and rzsm t 3 a total number of 2103 records associated with observed rzsm in every site were reduced to 2099 2097 and 2093 records respectively for each horizon the remaining records including selected candidate input variable and target were split into training calibration and testing validation sets in principle there is no universal strategy for separating data in training and testing and what is clear is that test data does not participate in the training process palani et al 2008 zheng et al 2018 many partitioning strategies have been proposed in the literature such as k fold cross validation hold out and jackknifing arlot and celisse 2010 quilty and adamowski 2021 approximately allocating 20 40 of the records for testing is acceptable in modeling hydrological issues ahmadianfar et al 2020 jamei et al 2020a so in this study we have used a ratio of 75 25 for training and testing phases respectively the schematic workflow of rzsm forecasting is illustrated in fig 8 3 4 setting parameter optimization most ml models 3 applied to highly non linear hydrological problems require the careful choice of their hyper parameters to gain promising outcomes selecting the non optimal setting of ml might yield underperformance in this paper the main hyper parameters for catboost are the learning rate l rate max depth iteration number and loss function whereas for the xgboost model the learning rate l rate max depth and n estimators are the primary hyperparameters besides in the krr approach the kernel function type alfa and gamma coefficients have the most impact on the model s accuracy according to the promising results reported in the literature the radial basis function rbf kernel was adopted as the kernel function in the krr model it is noteworthy that all hyper parameters above were optimized using a random search process jamei et al 2021 tables 4 and 5 listed all the optimized hyper parameters for each model in this work the ewt pre processing technique was adopted in matlab 2020a and the ml models were accomplished through python 3 6 1 platform on a laptop computer supported by intel r core tm i7 6700 cpu 3 20 ghz for this aim ctaboost and xgboost models were developed using by catboost and xgboost libraries moreover krr and mutual information techniques were developed in scikit learn library in python 3 6 1 for both standalone and complementary models the data sets were normalized between 0 and 1 to speed up convergence and avoid the negative effects of data scales the normalization relationship is expressed as 24 ψ ψ ψ min ψ max ψ min where ψ denotes the normalized variable and ψ is the original value of the variable besides ψ min and ψ max are the minimum and maximum values respectively 4 application results and discussion 4 1 models assessment for ardabil site the effectiveness of developed

the hybrid ewt catboost model was closely tracked by ewt xgboost model while ewt krr model showed the poorest performance the viability of the ewt catboost ewt xgboost ewt krr catboost xgboost and krr models was appraised by drawing the spider plots fig 9 for multi time step ahead i e t 1 t 3 t 7 during the testing period it is seen from these figures the complementary ewt catboost model provides

the spider plots fig 12 on multiple time scales i e t 1 t 3 and t 7 days in the testing phase these figures also highlight the supremacy of the ewt xgboost model as said in above sub section 4 2 next the scatter plot of observed versus forecasted rzsm values on multiple scales by the catboost xgboost krr ewt catboost ewt xgboost and ewt krr models in the testing period are represented in fig 13 these figures clearly show that the forecasted rzsm values of the ewt xgboost model are close to the observed one or concentrated on the 1 1 line and most of the data are within the limits of 20

vital parameter of the climate system hence the reliable forecasting of rzsm is important for understanding the hydrological processes and agricultural applications this research utilized different ml algorithms including catboost xgboost krr ewt catboost ewt xgboost and ewt krr models to forecast the daily rzsm at ardabil and minab sites located in iran these models were trained with 75 data and

illustrates the graphical representation of relative deviation among the complementary models i e ewt catboost ewt xgboost and ewt krr models in the forecasting of rzsm for 1 3 7 days ahead at ardbil and minab sites these figures show the relative deviation was small for ewt catboost at ardabil 0 117 0 348 0 160 and ewt xgboost at minab 0 035 0 031 0 243 for t 1 t 3 and t 7 days ahead forecasting of daily rzsm this way of analysis also acknowledges the better viability of complementary ml models at both study sites besides fig 16 exhibited the accuracy improvement of rmse for each complementary model and its counterpart standalone in all horizons of both sites according to the fig 16 in the very cold climate ardabil the best improvements of ewt catboost ewt xgboost and ewt krr were associated with rzsm t 7 horizon equal to 32 48 14 84 and 7 37 while for the very warm climate minab the best improvement for ewt catboost and ewt xgboost were 39 94 and 30 9 obtained at rzsm t 3 and rzsm t 7 horizons compared to corresponding standalone models respectively it is noteworthy that the ewt krr yielded disappointing performance in the warm climate compared with the corresponding standalone model to validate the outcomes of the present research it was compared with the existing work on sm prediction using ml models ahmed et al 2021 maroufpoor et al 2019 prasad et al 2018b

confirmed the effectiveness of ml models and supported the findings of the current study inclusive results indicate that the hybrid ml models including ewt catboost ewt xgboost are robust and reliable in forecasting daily rzsm for multi step ahead in two different environments i e very cold semi arid ardabil site and very warm semi humid minab site of iran the current research was adopted based on the inspiration of introducing a robust and reliable computer aid model where it can contribute to the basic knowledge of geo science engineering having such a machine learning based model established for rzsm can be substantially beneficial for monitoring soil capacity and properties for diverse applications such as agriculture crops production plantations health and several other environmental related aspects this can be implemented for an automated machine learning model connected with sensors that obtain the data remotely and converted to digitalized records that the computer machine can read in this manner a practical implication can be achieved for rzsm monitoring and detection in addition the development of the ml model based on microwave satellite soil moisture data can add another potential to use satellite data for such purpose and take advantage of the open access freely available remote sensing data in conclusion the obtained modeling results support the initiated hypothesized and the adopted methodology can be remarkably implemented as actual practice for rzsm monitoring and detection 5 conclusion and future direction in this research two new complementary ensemble based ml models namely ewt catboost and ewt xgboost were developed for multi step ahead forecasting of the rzsm in two different climate zones of iran also the krr in both standalone and complementary ewt krr models was examined to validate the ensemble based models 12 input time series comprised of microwave satellite based soil properties and metrological datasets were collected from the smap and merra 2 satellites to seek the optimal candidate antecedent components of rzsm the pacf was employed besides the mutual information along with correlation analysis was adopted to find the most influential candidate climate datasets and soil properties variables separately for each case study the selected lag components of rzsm for each site were decomposed using ewt pre processing technique and along with the optimal candidate were fed the ensemble and krr models in forecasting rzsm for the one three and seven ahead horizons i e t 1 t 3 and t 7 the following conclusions can be derived from the outcomes of the presented study in case of very cold and semi arid climate the proposed standalone catboost method can outperform the xgboost and krr models in forecasting rzsm t 1 whereas for horizons of rzsm t 3 and rzsm t 7 the xgboost in terms of merit was superior to the catboost and krr models in addition in the case of the complementary models the ewt xgboost model can provide the best results and accuracy for all the horizons of rzsm compared to the other complementary models in case of a very warm and semi humid climate the provided standalone xgboost method can outperform the catboost and krr models in forecasting the rzsms for three time horizons i e one three and seven day ahead in addition in the case of the hybrid models the ewt xgboost model can provide the best outcomes for all the horizons of rzsm compared to the other complementary models in the case of forecasting multi step ahead of rzsm in the ardabil site the statistical results indicate the superiority of the catboost model for rzsm horizons to enhance the accuracy of standalone models the complementary models i e ewt coupled with catboost xgboost and krr models were developed the outcomes of complementary models exhibited that the proposed ewt catboost model yielded superior precision compared with the standalone models and outperformed the other complementary models in terms of diagnostic analysis regarding the minab site in forecasting the rzsm t 1 the standalone xgboost model yielded more promising performance than the catboost and krr while for the rzsm t 7 and rzsm t 3 the standalone krr outperformed the catboost and xgboost models the results of integrating the ewt and the three standalone models exhibited that the ewt xgboost has the best accuracy for all the three horizons of rzsm than the other complementary models ewt catboost approach followed its standalone counterpart model the quantitative analysis associated with the minab site demonstrated that the xgboost was identified as the best model for rzsm t 1 while for rzsm t 3 and rzsm t 7 krr was selected as the best among the standalone models however the results obtained from the coupling of each model with the ewt pre processing technique showed the superiority of ewt xgboost at all the time horizons among all complementary and standalone models examination of the results in both climates showed a more noticeable improvement in inaccuracy due to the ewt pre processing technique and the second standalone models in very cold semi arid climates both proposed models i e ewt catboost and ewt xgboost have good modeling of rzsm in different climates overall ewt catboost can be introduced as due to the importance of the rzsm variable in the global water cycle reliable data forecast is invaluable for hydrological and agricultural applications future research will be focused on forecasting the rzsm data from esa s smos satellite products

this purpose the required datasets consisting of soil properties and meteorological information were extracted from the satellite datasets during 2005 2020 for ardabil and minab sites afterward the significant lags of rzsm time series and optimal influence candidate inputs were sought based on the partial autocorrelation function pacf and mutual information techniques respectively selected

cycle that plays an essential role in evaluating the water and energy balance components mason et al 2010 numerical weather forecasting climate modeling and extreme events monitoring brocca et al 2017 jamei et al 2020b the root zone soil moisture rzsm is a vital environmental parameter that influences the hydrological cycle process agricultural water management carranza et al 2021 santos et al 2014 monitoring meteorological systems agricultural systems irrigation management and rzsm is used as an indicator to predict and monitor drought souissi et al 2020 xu et al 2021 zhuang et al 2020 the usual approach to measure the rzsm is in situ soil moisture instruments which is time consuming and costly on a large scale xu et al 2021 the most suitable method for global sm data is the microwave active and passive remote sensing technique al yaari 2014 microwave instruments with lower microwave frequency l band have higher penetration into the sm sampling depth than those with higher frequencies c and x band and the attenuation effects of vegetation and atmosphere in the l band are the lowest escorihuela et al 2010 l band signals are sensitive to measuring sm due to the significant difference between the water and dry soil dielectric constants therefore the l band is particularly suitable for estimating surface sm entekhabi et al 2010 kerr et al 2010 the national

reported studies and several others approved the capability of ml methods for modeling sm at diverse regions around the world using different types of remote sensing data using the vosviewer software the collected literature was analyzed for the major keywords occurrence and the countries adopted for sm prediction using the feasibility of ml based on 91 research articles that appeared in the scopus database fig 1 indicated that 190 keywords are the major used for the established research of sm prediction the presented vosviewer algorithm revealed the significance of the sm prediction as it participated in diverse geo science and agriculture problems however for the recently conducted research the focus was on studying sm using the availability of remote sensing microwave remote sensing and satellite data this provides the data intelligence credibility for delivering a robust and reliable modeling technology that can predict sm more accurately it is worth highlighting that the major countries studying this geo science engineering problem include the united states italy china india and canada limited countries are interested in this research domain yet more exploration is needed particularly for developing countries 1 3 research significant and motivation sm is the truly connected parameter to the hydrological cycle and it is governed by the interaction between the atmosphere and land and thus impacted by hydro climatological parameters bayatvarkeshi et al 2021 hence its accurate quantification is a challenging problem in addition sm magnitude varies with soil depth and several other morphological parameters might influence the soil water content rzsm is one of the essential parameters that can be predicted accurately as it contributes to diverse geo science engineering applications and among them agriculture and crops production as per the literature survey limited research was adopted on the rzsm prediction thus the current study intends to develop a reliable data intelligent model for the accurate prediction of rzsm 1 4 research objectives based on the reported literature review and the identified research gap the following research

the minab site the skewness of daily rzsm data is lower than 2 and kurtosis is limited in the range 0 2 3 which implies that the data distribution is close to near normal 2 3 mutual information and partial autocorrelation function mutual information mi which measures the correlation between random variables is a non negative and symmetric parameter the entropy of a random variable which measures the amount of information contained in a random variable is intrinsically linked to the concept of mi one way to define the mi between two discrete random variables is as follows tian et al 2019 1 mi x y p xy log p x y p x p y where p x y is the joint probability math function of variables x and y and p x and p y are marginal probability distribution functions for variables x and y respectively if the mi between the two variables is significant the variables are highly connected he et al 2018 if the random variables are continuous the relationship is defined as a double definite integral as follows 2 mi x y p xy log p x y p x p y dx dy 2 4 empirical wavelet methodology ewt ewt uses an adaptive wavelet filter to extract the signal s mode components combining the adaptive decomposition

throughout the segmentation process to lift the fourier spectrum s amplitude and frequency modulation am fm the am fm signal is then processed using the hilbert transform to obtain the instantaneous frequency amplitude from the perspective of the fourier transform this operation is equivalent to building a set of band pass filters gu et al 2021 ewt can be applied in the three steps listed below liu et al 2021 i applying fft to discrete signals f t provides the fourier spectrum x ω using the first n maximum values m m i i 1 2 n in the fourier spectrum to extract the related frequencies ω ω i

2016 presented xgboost a highly scalable end to end tree boosting system that has been widely deployed and optimized in a wide variety of research domains dong et al 2020 lu and ma 2020 osman et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 when the xgboost is used to solve regression issues it continuously adds new regression trees and then fits the residuals of the prior model using the newly generated cart classifier and regression tree ensemble tao et al 2021a as a cart ensemble the xbgoost combines similar weak learners to produce a stronger learner zhu et al 2021 friedman 2002 9 y ˆ m y ˆ m 1 α f m x θ m α j 1 m f j x θ j where m is the number of boosting regression trees θ j is the parameter dictating how the j th tree is constructed α is the shrinkage factor f j x θ j is the output of the j th regression tree based on the structure of θ j without shrinkage x is the predictor and y ˆ j is the prediction of the j th regression tree as a result the residual will often decrease as the number of regression trees increases gradient boosting regression s purpose is to discover the optimal θ j and to construct f j x θ j at the j th step in order to minimize the objective function below hastie et al 2009 bhagat et al 2021 10 l i l y ˆ i y i i l y ˆ i j 1 α f j x i θ j y i where l is the loss function which is typically the squared error between the estimated value y ˆ i and the observed value y i in comparison to the conventional gbrt algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 included a regularization component to the traditional function of loss in xgboost to penalize model complexity and prevent overfitting eq 10 is rewritten in xgboost as 11 l i l y ˆ i y i j ω θ j i l y ˆ i j 1 α f j x i θ j y i j q θ j where ω θ j is the j th regression tree s regularization item to prevent overfitting 12 ω θ j γ t j 1 2 λ w k γ t j 1 2 λ k 1 t j w k j 2 where γ is the smallest loss reduction necessary for another node partition in the regression tree t j denotes the number of leaves in the j th regression tree λ is the regularization term on the regression tree s leaf weight and w k j denotes the weight of the k th leaf in the j th regression tree it is evident that more leaves larger t j will be punished by a more significant factor γ to optimize the objective function tao et al 2021b tao et al 2018 the tree parameter θ j in the xgboost model can be determined during training but some hyperparameters such as γ λ m a and d max must be supplied before the training process the grid search approach was used in this study to optimize the performance of the xgboost model by adjusting the following four critical hyperparameters max depth d max it regulates the model s complexity a more sophisticated model is far more prone to overfitting learning rate α this is a critical parameter in the majority of ml methods it can be changed to increase the model s robustness gamma γ it is used to govern regularization and the optimal value may aid in avoiding overfitting lambda λ it regulates weight regularization to prevent overfitting zhu et al 2021 2 6 2 6 categorical boosting catboost prokhorenkova et al 2017 created catboost a gradient boosting decision tree gbdt framework based on tree boosting similar to other decision tree approaches like xgboost chen et al 2015 and lightgbm catboost is based on the theoretical expectation that iteratively combining weak regressors can create a powerful regressor ding et al 2021 the catboost algorithm is capable of handling categorical features the conventional gbdt technique can be used to replace categorical features with an average label value in a decision tree the average label value will be used as the criterion for node splitting this procedure is referred to as greedy target based statistics greedy tbs and can be presented as follows dorogush et al 2018 huang et al 2019 13 j 1 p x j k x i k y i j 1 n x j k x i k on average features include more data than labels we will see a conditional shift if we utilize the average label value to express features aggressively catboost enhances greedy tbs by adding a previous value assume we have a dataset of observations d x i y i i 1 n and if a permutation is σ σ 1 σ n x σ p k is replaced with jabeur et al 2021 14 j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k y σ j ap j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k a where a is the weight of the prior value and p denotes a prior value this strategy helps to reduce the noise produced by the low frequency category fig 4 depicts the structure of the catboost algorithm 2 7 2 7 kernel ridge regression krr when dealing with high dimensional problems ridge regression rr is a popular regression based model because it can generally provide acceptable accuracy even when it contains multicollinearity linear correlation and imposes a penalty on the size of regression coefficients to reduce their size an et al 2007 unlike the traditional ridge kernel approach the krr approach may train a function in a reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs to capture the non linear case and is consistent with the rkhs regularized learning issue the krr model has the following mathematical function ali et al 2020 15 arg min 1 m i 1 m f i y i 2 λ f h 2 16 f i j 1 α j φ x j x i the hilbert normed space is denoted by h eq 15 can be simply expressed for a m m kernel matrix k you et al 2018 17 k λ ni y 18 y i 1 m α i φ x i x the krr method approximates α during the training stage by locating solutions to eq 19 it then determines the optimal γ and α values from the parameter set to achieve the best performance then in the testing stage the α is utilized to calculate the regressand for the newer samples x as in eq 20 the linear polynomial and gaussian kernels were employed in this investigation to get the highest accuracy ali et al 2020 2 8 models evaluation indices several statistical criteria have been employed to evaluate the efficiency of the produced models containing the pearson correlation coefficient r root mean squared error rmse kling gupta efficiency kge nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and willmott s index ia the r describes the linear correlation between observed and forecasted values and prasad et al 2018a rmse is used to

2020 vergopolan et al 2020 where μ is the mean value and σ denots the standard deviation vergopolan et al 2020 kge varies between and 1 values close to 1 indicate that model predictions are accurate massari et al 2020 the ens is used to compare the performance of models ranging between to 1 and the optimal value of nse is 1 the performance of the model is rated with respect to this index as

forecasted data 3 model development 3 1 dataset pre processing and feature selection procedure recently various ml based techniques have been devoted to hydrological soil properties problems such as sm forecasting however limited literature focused on complementary ml based models using pre processing such as wavelet transform families and empirical mode decomposition techniques here two new complementary empirical wavelet transform based ensemble ml models namely ewt catboost and ewt xgboost were developed to forecast daily rzsm for one three and seven days ahead horizons in two sites i e ardabil and minab having two opposite climates in iran moreover the ewt krr model was adopted better to evaluate the predictive potential of both complementary models for constructing a forecasting model of the daily rzsm the soil properties i e soil temperature at six depths and rzsm time series and climatological dataset i e tave tmin tmax pr ws10 m and rh2 m of both considered sites in the period of march 2015 to december 2020 were extracted from the smap and erra2 satellites respectively in other words the candidate input variables are climatological information temperature based soil properties antecedent information of observed rzsm for non complementary models and the ewt decomposed components of rzsm for complementary models in each site in recent research a systematic process for selecting the appropriate inputs to train the predictive models based on the effectiveness of essential parameters and elimination of redundant ones in achieving a promising result has been highly welcomed by researchers partial autocorrelation function pacf tiwari and adamowski 2013 mutual information mi and different feature selection schemes are common tools utilized in ml based studies for identifying the influential candidate input variables quilty and adamowski 2021 2020 here concerning the non linear relationship through sm physical process the mi approach correlation analysis and pacf assessment are used to determine the relevance of candidate inputs for both understudy sites fig 5 illustrates the pacf for rzsm at ardabil and minab as can be seen the first four lags for ardabil and the first five lags for minab had significant values regarding upper and lower confidence limits that were taken into account as candidate input variables for adopting the complementary ml based models fig 6 showed the degree of dependency between candidate inputs and rzsm for ardabil and minab sites based on mi score and pearson correlation coefficient according to fig 6 the most impact was related to the antecedent information rzsm t 1 rzsm t 2 rzsm t 5 of rzsm in both sites with a score of more than mi 1 5 whereas the rh2 m ws10 m and pr m i 0 1 had the most negligible effect on forecasting the rzsm for all multi head horizons among all non antecedent candidate inputs the soil temperature variables in the lower levels stl4 stl5 and stl6 had the most important followed by tave tmin and tmax respectively the pearson correlation coefficients confirm the feature mentioned above selection process accordingly therefore the pr and ws10 m were omitted due to their negligible effect on rzsm the optimal input combinations in each site and for all the time scale horizons are reported in table 3 3 2 complementary models description ewt pre processing algorithm is one of the most recent signal processing tools to decompose original time series into sub sequence to extract the in depth information of the signal this algorithm can properly overcome the drawbacks insufficient mathematical information of traditional decomposition tools such as the emd eemd feemd and ceemdan li et al 2018 liu et al 2018 the setting parameter of decomposition of time series using ewt is the length of filter 10 sigma filter 1 5 and a maximum number of band pass 3 filtering which are selected as the default values furthermore the mode number of ewt decomposition level as the most crucial setting of ewt for ardabil and minab were obtained at 12 and 8 respectively a trial and error procedure was applied to reduce the complexity of the residual component and gain higher accuracy the decomposed sub sequences of rzsm signals by ignoring the residual signal for both sites are shown in fig 7 3 3 data division strategy as mentioned before the duration period of gathered datasets was between 03 31 2015 and 12 31 2020 regarding backward time lagging for multi step ahead horizons rzsm t 1 rzsm t 2 and rzsm t 3 a total number of 2103 records associated with observed rzsm in every site were reduced to 2099 2097 and 2093 records respectively for each horizon the remaining records including selected candidate input variable and target were split into training calibration and testing validation sets in principle there is no universal strategy for separating data in training and testing and what is clear is that test data does not participate in the training process palani et al 2008 zheng et al 2018 many partitioning strategies have been proposed in the literature such as k fold cross validation hold out and jackknifing arlot and celisse 2010 quilty and adamowski 2021 approximately allocating 20 40 of the records for testing is acceptable in modeling hydrological issues ahmadianfar et al 2020 jamei et al 2020a so in this study we have used a ratio of 75 25 for training and testing phases respectively the schematic workflow of rzsm forecasting is illustrated in fig 8 3 4 setting parameter optimization most ml models 3 applied to highly non linear hydrological problems require the careful choice of their hyper parameters to gain promising outcomes selecting the non optimal setting of ml might yield underperformance in this paper the main hyper parameters for catboost are the learning rate l rate max depth iteration number and loss function whereas for the xgboost model the learning rate l rate max depth and n estimators are the primary hyperparameters besides in the krr approach the kernel function type alfa and gamma coefficients have the most impact on the model s accuracy according to the promising results reported in the literature the radial basis function rbf kernel was adopted as the kernel function in the krr model it is noteworthy that all hyper parameters above were optimized using a random search process jamei et al 2021 tables 4 and 5 listed all the optimized hyper parameters for each model in this work the ewt pre processing technique was adopted in matlab 2020a and the ml models were accomplished through python 3 6 1 platform on a laptop computer supported by intel r core tm i7 6700 cpu 3 20 ghz for this aim ctaboost and xgboost models were developed using by catboost and xgboost libraries moreover krr and mutual information techniques were developed in scikit learn library in python 3 6 1 for both standalone and complementary models the data sets were normalized between 0 and 1 to speed up convergence and avoid the negative effects of data scales the normalization relationship is expressed as 24 ψ ψ ψ min ψ max ψ min where ψ denotes the normalized variable and ψ is the original value of the variable besides ψ min and ψ max are the minimum and maximum values respectively 4 application results and discussion 4 1 models assessment for ardabil site the effectiveness of developed

the hybrid ewt catboost model was closely tracked by ewt xgboost model while ewt krr model showed the poorest performance the viability of the ewt catboost ewt xgboost ewt krr catboost xgboost and krr models was appraised by drawing the spider plots fig 9 for multi time step ahead i e t 1 t 3 t 7 during the testing period it is seen from these figures the complementary ewt catboost model provides better estimates of rzsm compared to other alternatives as justified by table 6 furthermore the predictive performance of applied complementary and standalone ml models was assessed by employing the goodness of fit approaches i e scatter plots and time variations plots fig 10 shows the scatter plots for observed versus multi step ahead forecasted rzsm values by the catboost xgboost krr ewt

the best model and closely followed by the ewt catboost model the weakest performance was noted in case of ewt krr model additionally the evaluation of the applied models was carried out by plotting the spider plots fig 12 on multiple time scales i e t 1 t 3 and t 7 days in the testing phase these figures also highlight the supremacy of the ewt xgboost model as said in above sub section 4 2 next the scatter plot of observed versus forecasted rzsm values on multiple scales by the catboost xgboost krr ewt catboost ewt xgboost and ewt krr models in the testing period are represented in fig 13 these figures clearly show that the forecasted rzsm values of the ewt xgboost model are close to the observed one or concentrated on the 1 1 line and most of the data are within the limits of 20 relative error bands furthermore fig 14 demonstrates the temporal variation of complementary ml models observed vs forecasted rzsm values these figures show the proper consistency of the forecasted rzsm with the observed rzsm values by the ewt xgboost model and prove its better applicability in forecasting multi step ahead daily rzsm at the minab site 4 3 discussion and comparison rzsm is a vital parameter of the climate system hence the reliable forecasting of rzsm is important for understanding the hydrological processes and agricultural applications this research utilized different ml algorithms including catboost xgboost krr ewt catboost ewt xgboost and ewt krr models to forecast the daily rzsm at ardabil and minab sites located in iran these models were trained with 75 data and tested with the remaining 25 data the perusal of the results revealed that the ewt catboost had better predictability than the other models on multiple scales at ardabil whereas at minab the ewt xgboost was found to be the best model moreover considering the rmse of catboost xgboost krr ewt xgboost and ewt krr models the prediction accuracies were respectively enhanced by 24 0 26 9 82 1 34 5 81 6 for t 1 day 28 6 20 5 67 9 7 9 66 7 for t 3 days and 31 2 27 4 53 9 13 1 51 4 for t 7 days at ardabil site by implementing the ewt catboost model during the testing phase the ewt xgboost model improved prediction accuracy of the catboost xgboost krr ewt catboost and ewt krr models by 20 0 16 9 44 3 12 3 43 9 for t 1 day by 30 3 28 1 27 6 14 8 27 6 for t 3 days and by 24 1 23 6 27 6 14 8 27 6 for t 7 days concerning the rmse in testing period at minab site additionally the applied models were categorized based on moriasi et al 2015 and paul and negahban azar 2018 classification of nse i e excellent 0 80 nse 1 00 good 0 70 nse 0 80 satisfactory 0 50 nse 0 70 and unsatisfactory nse 0 50 according to the nse classification all the casted models come under the excellent category but the highest was achieved by the ewt catboost nse 0 9958 0 9858 0 9683 and ewt xgboost nse 0 9805 0 9589 0 9309 for the time scales of t 1 t 3 and t 7 at ardabil and minab locations respectively fig 15 illustrates the graphical representation of relative deviation among the complementary models i e ewt catboost ewt xgboost and ewt krr models in the forecasting of rzsm for 1 3 7 days ahead at ardbil and minab sites these figures show the relative deviation was small for ewt catboost at ardabil 0 117 0 348 0 160 and ewt xgboost at minab 0 035 0 031 0 243 for t 1 t 3 and t 7 days ahead forecasting of daily rzsm this way of analysis also acknowledges the better viability of complementary ml models at both study sites besides fig 16 exhibited the accuracy improvement of rmse for each complementary model and its counterpart standalone in all horizons of both sites according to the fig 16 in the very cold climate ardabil the best improvements of ewt catboost ewt xgboost and ewt krr were associated with rzsm t 7 horizon equal to 32 48 14 84 and 7 37 while for the very warm climate minab the best improvement for ewt catboost and ewt xgboost were 39 94 and 30 9 obtained at rzsm t 3 and rzsm t 7 horizons compared to corresponding standalone models respectively it is noteworthy that the ewt krr yielded disappointing performance in the warm climate compared with the corresponding standalone model to validate the outcomes of the present research it was compared with the existing work on sm prediction using ml models ahmed et al 2021 maroufpoor et al 2019 prasad et al 2018b sanuade et al 2020 prasad et al 2019 forecasted weekly sm by using hybrid eemd b elm ensemble empirical mode decomposition boruta extreme learning machines and standalone elm and mars multivariate

confirmed the effectiveness of ml models and supported the findings of the current study inclusive results indicate that the hybrid ml models including ewt catboost ewt xgboost are robust and reliable in forecasting daily rzsm for multi step ahead in two different environments i e very cold semi arid ardabil site and very warm semi humid minab site of iran the current research was adopted based on the inspiration of introducing a robust and reliable computer aid model where it can contribute to the basic knowledge of geo science engineering having such a machine learning based model established for rzsm can be substantially beneficial for monitoring soil capacity and properties for diverse applications such as agriculture crops production plantations health and several other environmental related aspects this can be implemented for an automated machine learning model connected with sensors that obtain the data remotely and converted to digitalized records that the computer machine can read in this manner a practical implication can be achieved for rzsm monitoring and detection in addition the development of the ml model based on microwave satellite soil moisture data can add another potential to use satellite data for such purpose and take advantage of the open access freely available remote sensing data in conclusion the obtained modeling results support the initiated hypothesized and the adopted methodology can be remarkably implemented as actual practice for rzsm monitoring and detection 5 conclusion and future direction in this research two new complementary ensemble based ml models namely ewt catboost and ewt xgboost were developed for multi step ahead forecasting of the rzsm in two different climate zones of iran also the krr in both standalone and complementary ewt krr models was examined to validate the ensemble based models 12 input time series comprised of microwave satellite based soil properties and metrological datasets were collected from the smap and merra 2 satellites to seek the optimal candidate antecedent components of rzsm the pacf was employed besides the mutual information along with correlation analysis was adopted to find the most influential candidate climate datasets and soil properties variables separately for each case study the selected lag components of rzsm for each site were decomposed using ewt pre processing technique and along with the optimal candidate were fed the ensemble and krr models in forecasting rzsm for the one three and seven ahead horizons i e t 1 t 3 and t 7 the following conclusions can be derived from the outcomes of the presented study in case of very cold and semi arid climate the proposed standalone catboost method can outperform the xgboost and krr models in forecasting rzsm t 1 whereas for horizons of rzsm t 3 and rzsm t 7 the xgboost in terms of merit was superior to the catboost and krr models in addition in the case of the complementary models the ewt xgboost model can provide the best results and accuracy for all the horizons of rzsm compared to the other complementary models in case of a very warm and semi humid climate the provided standalone xgboost method can outperform the catboost and krr models in forecasting the rzsms for three time horizons i e one three and seven day ahead in addition in the case of the hybrid models the ewt xgboost model can provide the best outcomes for all the horizons of rzsm compared to the other complementary models in the case of forecasting multi step ahead of rzsm in the ardabil site the statistical results indicate the superiority of the catboost model for rzsm horizons to enhance the accuracy of standalone models the complementary models i e ewt coupled with catboost xgboost and krr models were developed the outcomes of complementary models exhibited that the proposed ewt catboost model yielded superior precision compared with the standalone models and outperformed the other complementary models in terms of diagnostic analysis regarding the minab site in forecasting the rzsm t 1 the standalone xgboost model yielded more promising performance than the catboost and krr while for the rzsm t 7 and rzsm t 3 the standalone krr outperformed the catboost and xgboost models the results of integrating the ewt and the three standalone models exhibited that the ewt xgboost has the best accuracy for all the three horizons of rzsm than the other complementary models ewt catboost approach followed its standalone counterpart model the quantitative analysis associated with the minab site demonstrated that the xgboost was identified as the best model for rzsm t 1 while for rzsm t 3 and rzsm t 7 krr was selected as the best among the standalone models however the results obtained from the coupling of each model with the ewt pre processing technique showed the superiority of ewt xgboost at all the time horizons among all complementary and standalone models examination of the results in both climates showed a more noticeable improvement in inaccuracy due to the ewt pre processing technique and the second standalone models in very cold semi arid climates both proposed models i e ewt catboost and ewt xgboost have good modeling of rzsm in different climates overall ewt catboost can be introduced as due to the importance of the rzsm variable in the global water cycle reliable data forecast is invaluable for hydrological and agricultural applications future research will be focused on forecasting the rzsm data from esa s smos satellite products

9468,agriculture in atlantic canada ac is dominated by a rain fed potato production system with potatoes typically rotating with cereal crops such as barley and oats under rain fed conditions crop yields are sensitive to weather and its variations and are thus affected by climate change previous research regarding climate change impacts on crop yields in ac has been limited to a regional scale assessment mostly focusing on climate without considering real world field conditions e g soil and topography in this study an enhanced soil and water assessment tool swat model was used to estimate crop yields at the watershed scale under climate change conditions projected for the period of 2020 2099 using global climate models with three different greenhouse gas ghg emission scenarios from the representative concentration pathways i e rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 results suggest that climate change will negatively impact potato and barley yields under all three rcp scenarios in particular under the rcp8 5 scenario there will be significant reductions 13 23 in crop yields between 2060 and 2099 the leading cause of crop yield reductions is attributed to the soil water stress resulting from increased temperature and evapotranspiration during the growing season due to climate change elevated carbon dioxide co2 concentrations could potentially increase crop yields due to the co2 fertilization effect however it is not enough to offset the negative impacts of soil water stress our results suggest that on top of controlling ghg emissions to below the rcp4 5 level it is critical to develop and adapt crop soil and water management practices such as new crop rotation systems early planting dates and supplemental irrigation to maintain future crop yields in ac keywords climate change swat crop yield atlantic canada co2 fertilization 1 introduction the increase in fossil fuel consumption generates elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentrations which in turn traps heat and warms the earth s surface leading to rising temperatures losses in snowpack ice and changing precipitation patterns ahiablame et al 2017 pathak et al 2018 rajib et al 2016 rising atmospheric co2 concentrations will further influence the distribution of precipitation and increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as flooding and drought harrison et al 2014 these ongoing climate changes have great impacts on water budgets increasing water demands by agricultural crops ashraf vaghefi et al 2014 paul 2016 in particular projected changes in seasonal temperature and precipitation distributions have pronounced impacts on crop growth at different growing stages ahiablame et al 2017 ashraf vaghefi et al 2014 studies have indicated that an increase in atmospheric co2 concentrations is expected to promote plant growth through co2 fertilization cure and acock 1986 idso and idso 1994 however other studies have found that stomatal closure responses to elevated ambient co2 concentrations led to reduced evapotranspiration and co2 uptake y chen et al 2019 raymundo et al 2018 the overall impact of climate change on crop yields is thus complicated requiring further studies future changes in annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation patterns and their implications on different agricultural productions vary regionally for instance in the semi arid northern high plains of texas y chen et al 2019 predicted reductions in corn and sorghum yields under future climatic conditions smith et al 2013 indicated that cereal yields would decrease under the influence of future climate change in northern europe however wheat yields were projected to increase in the taihang mountain region of east asia rashid et al 2019 paul et al 2020 also predicted that corn yields would decline in both the mid and late 21st centuries whereas soybean yields were predicted to increase in the mid 21st century but decline by the late 21st century in mid atlantic usa motha and baier 2005 found that all major unirrigated crops would experience decreases in yield generalized over the usa in canada spring wheat winter wheat and corn yields were projected to increase in the west smith et al 2013 however corn yields in more humid regions of central canada were found to decrease he et al 2018 it is thus important to assess the impacts of climate change on local water resources and crop yields to evaluate and implement adaptive agricultural management practices needed to maintain expected crop productivity ozturk et al 2017 potatoes solanum tuberosum l are the largest non cereal food crop ranked as the fourth most important food crop in the world fao 2019 it is also the most important horticultural crop accounting for one third of all vegetable farm revenues in canada potatopro 2018 atlantic canada ac is the most important potato production region in canada producing more than 40 of the country s potatoes mukezangango 2017 barley hordeum vulgare l is the most frequently used rotation crop for potato fields in ac it also accounts for the second largest field crop area in prince edward island the largest barley production area in ac statistics canada 2017 historical records show that the climate in ac has become progressively warmer over the past hundred years motha and baier 2005 zhang et al 2000 intensified water stress associated with higher temperatures in the future can adversely impact the growth and yields of potatoes and barley there are few studies of climate change impacts on crop yields to inform agricultural water management in ac there is a lack of information about rain fed regions influenced by seasonal snow cover where climate change will have great impacts to address this knowledge gap we have employed a modeling approach to assess the impacts of future climate change on hydrology and crop yields at the watershed scale in ac s environment hydrological models incorporating crop growth modules are widely used to assess the change in crop yields under future climate change conditions ahmad et al 2020 x chen et al 2019 srivastava et al 2012 they have the advantages of low cost high efficiency and easy control of variables compared with field laboratory experiments particularly for agricultural watersheds y chen et al 2019 paul et al 2020 among them the soil and water assessment tool swat has been widely used to investigate climate change effects at the watershed scale worldwide arnold et al 1998 the swat model has been modified to better address ac s environment so can be adopted to investigate climate change impacts on crop yields in ac qi et al 2016b 2019b wang et al 2020b the objectives of this study are thus to 1 investigate future climatic conditions as impacted by elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations 2 evaluate the performance of the enhanced swat model in simulating hydrology and crop growth in a small experimental watershed and 3 predict the impacts of climate change on crop yields with major economic importance i e potatoes and barley and identify the key driving factors for crop yield changes in ac in this study we considered three representative concentration pathway rcp emission scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 based on projections from five global climate models gcms to represent future conditions with different adaptation strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and data collection the black brook watershed bbw is located in northwestern new brunswick canada 47 5 47 9 n 67 44 67 48 w with elevations ranging from 150 to 242 m above mean sea level fig 1 the region is considered a typical watershed in ac strongly influenced by marine weather chow et al 2011 the average temperature is 3 7 and the annual precipitation is 1037 4 mm of which about one third of the annual precipitation is in the form of snow snow melting in spring is the major source of surface runoff and groundwater recharge chow and rees 2006 qi et al 2017 the area of the watershed is 14 5 km2 with agricultural forest and residential land accounting for 65 21 and 14 of the total area respectively chow et al 2011 the main crop within the bbw is potatoes in rotation with barley soils in the bbw are classified into six mineral soil classes namely grand falls holmesville interval muniac siegas and undine and one organic soil sait quentin mellerowicz 1993 a water monitoring station has been in operation since 1992 at the outlet of the bbw ms 1 fig 1 recorded flow rates have been used to calculate discharge from 1992 to 2015 chow et al 2011 weather data including daily precipitation air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed from 1992 to 2015 were acquired from the st leonard environment climate change canada weather station approximately 5 km from the bbw fig 1 as part of long term research efforts field level land use information on crop rotation fertilizer application management practices planting and harvest dates and crop yields from individual farms have been collected via annual surveys since 1992 liang et al 2019 we set up our swat project with each hydrologic response unit hru explicitly representing a farm within the bbw and management practices were configured according to long term detailed records at the hru level qi et al 2017 a high resolution digital elevation model 1 m

mellerowicz 1993 2 2 model description 2 2 1 enhanced swat model the swat model has the capability of predicting hydrological processes water quality plant biomass growth and crop yields as impacted by climate change and land use management arnold et al 1998 the model is a semi distributed and processed based watershed model providing a flexible framework for simulating the effectiveness of a broad range of beneficial management practices gassman et al 2005 qi et al 2020 ullrich and volk 2009 wang et al 2020a major model components include a weather simulator hydrology plant growth and land management as well as loads and fluxes of sediment nutrients pesticides bacteria and pathogens neitsch et al 2011 provided a detailed description of the swat model the conventional swat model used an empirical equation to calculate the soil temperature neitsch et al 2011 which was found to severely underestimate soil temperatures during winter in regions with substantial snow cover qi et al 2016b this is because the insulating effects of snow reducing heat loss of the soil surface were not taken into account by the empirical module in a previous version of swat qi et al 2016b to address this issue a physically based soil temperature module has been integrated into the swat model to account these effects due to freeze thaw cycles of soil water qi et al 2016a 2016b 2019a 2019b the enhanced swat model has proven to dramatically improve snow dominated hydrological responses to rising temperature wang et al 2020a 2021 2020b thus increasing the credibility of climate change impacts in ac the time lagging effect of snowmelt was also addressed by calibrating relevant parameters against measured high flows in early spring the model assumes that the lagging effect will not be impacted by climate change qi et al 2016b provided details about the algorithms and parameter determination 2 2 2 hydrology and crop yield simulation the hydrological process in the soil profile simulated by the swat model is based on the water balance equation eq 1 which includes the processes of precipitation surface runoff infiltration evapotranspiration lateral flow and percolation arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 1 sw t sw o i 1 n r day q surf e a q lat w seep where sw t is the final soil water content mm sw o is the initial soil water content mm t is the time step day r day is the amount of precipitation on day i or snowmelt mm q surf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm e a is the amount of actual evapotranspiration on day i mm q lat is the amount of lateral flow on day i mm and w seep is the amount of percolation on day i mm surface runoff is estimated using a modified soil conservation service curve number method mishra and singh 2013 a kinematic storage model is used to calculate lateral flow sloan and moore 1984 soil water movement is modeled using a tip bucket algorithm water is allowed to percolate if the water content exceeds the field capacity and the layer below is not saturated the amount of water moving from one layer to the underlying layer is calculated using the storage routing method arnold et al 2011 neitsch et al 2011 water percolating out of the lowest soil layer enters the vadose zone eventually recharging aquifers in the swat model evapotranspiration can be calculated with three different methods including the penman monteith method monteith 1965 the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 and the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 in this study the penman monteith method was utilized to simulate evapotranspiration the heat unit theory was used to regulate the plant growth cycle based on plant specific input parameters summarized in a plant growth database boswell 1926 magoon and culpepper 1932 actual growth was then deducted from potential growth due to stresses such as extreme temperatures water and nutrient i e nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies specifically plant growth was controlled by the leaf area index lai light interception and conversion of intercepted light into biomass by radiation use efficiency defined as the amount of dry biomass produced per unit intercepted solar radiation lastly the swat model partitioned crop yield from the total biomass based on the harvest index with a fraction of plant dry biomass removed as dry economic yield arnold et al 2011 2 3

multiple hrus for crop calibration in the bbw shahvari et al 2019 sinnathamby et al 2017 sun and ren 2014 for potatoes to compare with the swat simulated dry biomass we adjusted measurements by multiplying an average dry mass percentage 0 23 of the potato yield according to experiments on four potato varieties russet burbank goldrush prospect and shepody in ac liang et al 2019 since the swat model does not take the potato variety into account we only examined the trend of average potato yields under different climate conditions at the watershed scale regarding barley because of the absence of experiments in ac we compared actual and simulated yields directly because the dry mass percentage of barely is 85 2 89 8 poulsen et al 2012 negligible to that of potatoes at 15 25 kapoor

effects on crop yields were summarized by 40 year periods discussed in section 4 we used 40 year periods for assessing co2 fertilization effects rather than 20 year periods due to the difficulty in configuring co2 in the swat model the co2 concentration input to the swat model is not set up as a time series like precipitation and temperature are in this case the bl is from 1980 to 2019 and the two future periods are 2020 2059 and 2060 2099 with 40 year averaged co2 concentrations tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test tukey 1949 a single step multiple comparison procedure and

concentrations in ac are projected to increase relative to the bl 330 ppm for all future periods and rcp scenarios their projection curves are different between different rcp scenarios fig 2 for the rcp2 6 scenario the co2 concentration will increase from p1 to p2 then decrease from p2 to p4 with p2 having a maximum of 454 ppm the co2 concentration will increase monotonically from p1 to p4 under the rcp8 5 scenario with a maximum of 1084 ppm under the rcp4 5 scenario the co2 concentration will increase from p1 to p3 then slightly decrease from p3 to p4 with p3 having a maximum of 567 ppm 3 1 2 annual and seasonal precipitation projections projected average annual precipitation amounts simulated by the five gcms are greater than that during the bl period 1103 mm for all future periods and rcp scenarios except for a slight reduction in p1 under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 2a the changing patterns of precipitation follow those of atmospheric co2 concentrations under different rcp scenarios with maximum percentage increases of 4 8 6 4 and 13 8 in p2 p3 and p4 under the rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively however increases in average annual precipitation relative to the bl are significant p 0 05 only in rcp4 5 p3 and in rcp8 5 p2 p3 and p4 attributed to the great variability of projected precipitation amounts due to year to year variations and differences among gcms projected percentage changes of average monthly precipitation in p1 vary around the bl level without clear trends under all rcp scenarios fig 3a and b see tables s1 and s2 in the si document in p2 no clear differences are seen in average monthly precipitation amounts under all rcps scenarios however they all predict substantial increases in precipitation in the winter months february march and a decrease in precipitation in august fig 3c and d in p3 and p4 greater differences in average monthly precipitation occur in the winter months differences extend into spring with the highest precipitation under the rcp8 5 scenario followed by the rcp4 5 then rcp2 6 scenarios fig 3e f g and h during the growing season no evident increases are detected in june and july but a noticeable decrease is seen in august when crops have their highest water demand annual percentage increases in precipitation mainly occur during winter and early spring under the rcp8 5 scenario 3 1 3 annual and seasonal air temperature projections projected average annual temperatures simulated by the five gcms are significantly higher p 0 05 than that during the bl period 4 4 for all future periods and rcp scenarios fig 2b different from those of co2 concentration and precipitation the changing patterns of average annual temperature tend to increase with time with maximum increases of 1 1 2 1 and 4 8 in p4 under all rcp scenarios there appears to be a lag effect of co2 concentration on temperature so that the highest average annual temperature occurs in p3 and p4 under the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios variations in average annual temperature appear low with more variability under higher atmospheric co2 concentration conditions there are also significant differences p 0 05 in temperature increase between different future periods under the rcp8 5 scenario however this is not the case for the other rcp scenarios for example there is no significant difference between different future periods under the rcp2 6 scenario between p3 and p4 and between p2 and p3 under the rcp4 5 scenario average monthly temperatures reach their plateau in july and august under all rcp scenarios with no obvious difference between rcp scenarios in p1 for all months fig 4 also see tables s3 and s4 in the si document after p2 average monthly temperatures projected under the rcp8 5 scenario become greater than under the other two rcp scenarios particularly from july to february of the following year differences in temperature in spring and early summer march to june are not as obvious as in other seasons additionally the rcp8 5 scenario has the greatest seasonal variation in average monthly temperature increases than the other rcp scenarios fig 4 these results imply that higher temperatures in winter under the rcp8 5 scenario could reduce snowfall and accelerate snowmelt causing floods in spring seasonal variations in temperature have increasing uncertainties under high ghg emission scenarios 3 2 model calibration and validation to predict climate change impacts on hydrology and crop yields the enhanced swat model must first be calibrated and validated fig 5 shows that simulated monthly streamflow match observations well in terms of the magnitudes of high and low flows during the calibration 1992 2001 and validation 2001 2015 periods statistical indices follow the model performance evaluation criteria provided by moriasi et al 2007 with r e 5 r 2 0 76 ns 0 76 for the calibration period and r e 3 r 2 0 84 ns 0 84 for the validation period previous studies have reported that the swat model can predict crop yields with an acceptable accuracy without calibration srinivasan et al 2010 however our results indicate that the calibration of crop growth related parameters is necessary to improve the prediction accuracy of crop yields this is likely because the unique biophysical conditions in ac differ from those used in the development of the swat model we adjusted two crop growth related parameters namely the radiation use efficiency bio e and the maximum leaf area index blai for potatoes we increased bio e from 25 to 30 and increased blai from 4 to 5 for barley we increased bio e from 35 to 30 and kept blai equal to 4 fig 6 shows that the model performs well predicting yields of both crops during the calibration and validation periods with particularly low absolute r e values 5 for barley in both periods and potatoes in the validation period 3 3 future crop yields average annual barley and potato yields are predicted to reduce relative to the bl for all future periods under the three rcp scenarios except for rcp2 6 p4 rcp4 5 p1 and rcp8 5 p1 for barley fig 7 and table 1 under the rcp8 5 scenario barley and potato yields have a decreasing trend and no trend under the other rcp scenarios specifically under the rcp8 5 scenario there is a significant p 0 05 reduction in both barley p3 13 2 p4 15 8 and potato yields p3 14 1 p4 23 2 relative to the bl note that the difference in barley and potato yield reductions between the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios in p3 and between rcp8 5 and the other two rcp scenarios in p4 is significant p 0 05 the decline in potato yields is greater than that of barley under all rcp scenarios possibly related to the physiological characteristics of different crops delazari et al 2018 the patterns of yield reduction for both crops mostly mirror those of the average annual precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentration fig 2 however the patterns under the rcp4 5 scenario for the two crops differ the yield reduction is highest in p3 for barley and highest in p4 for potatoes the difference in mean values in different periods under the same rcp scenario or in the same period under different rcp scenarios are mostly not significant except in p3 and p4 under the rcp8 5 scenario this may be attributed to large year to year variations within the same period and the large differences between different gcms overall our results indicate crop yield reduction during the rest of the 21st century due to climate change under a moderately controlled emission scenario rcp4 5 the yield reduction is apparent especially after 2040 ranging from 3 8 to 4 5 for barley and from 4 6 to 7 5 for potatoes the situation could improve under a strictly controlled emission scenario rcp2 6 where the percentage yield reduction in p3 and p4 ranges from 1 4 to 2 4 for both crops by contrast the situation could worsen under an uncontrolled emission scenario rcp8 5 where the yield reductions in p3 and p4 are about three or more times than that under the rcp4 5 scenario for both crops our results are consistent with other studies that reported a reduction in barley yields under future climate conditions in ac bootsma et al 2005 and a reduction in potato yields in southern québec in canada brassard and singh 2008 3 4 crop yield related hydrological parameters average annual et is predicted to significantly increase p 0 05 in the future relative to the bl except in p1 under all three rcp scenarios for barley and in p1 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for potatoes fig 8 changes in average annual et for both crops follow the same pattern of average annual air temperature fig 2b the change in et has an increasing trend under the rcp8 5 scenario with the greatest et increase occurring in p4 for barley 19 7 and potatoes 19 5 the greatest increases in average annual et under the rcp2 6 scenario are 5 1 for both barley and potatoes and 8 4 and 8 2 under the rcp4 5 scenario for barley and potatoes respectively there is a significant p 0 05 difference in the increase in et between the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios in p3 and p4 no significant difference is detected between the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios annually high variations in et are found in all future periods under all rcp scenarios with no observable consistent trend wue is an important indicator describing the trade off between water loss and carbon sequestration during plant photosynthesis and evaluating the response of crop yields to climate change table 1 shows that wue will decrease in all future periods and under all rcp scenarios relative to the bl in particular a decreasing trend in wue is seen under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios whereas under the rcp2 6 scenario the decreasing trend from p1 to p2 reverses from p3 to p4 the greatest percentage decreases in wue for barley and potatoes are 8 7 and 7 0 under the rcp2 6 p2 scenario 13 0 and 14 0 under the rcp4 5 p4 scenario and 30 4 and 34 9 under the rcp8 5 p4 scenario respectively an increase in et along with a decrease in yield leads to a decrease in wue eq 5 table 1 to explore the reasons behind the future decline of crop yields we further analyzed monthly et and soil water content across the bbw predicted variations in average monthly et do not strictly follow those of monthly temperature for different future periods under the three rcp scenarios fig 9 versus fig 4 also see tables s5 and s6 in the si document the highest et appears in june and july almost one month earlier than temperature when crop water demand is not the greatest the difference in average monthly et between rcps becomes greater with time from p1 to p4 especially for winter and early spring from november to may of the next year fig 9 this is consistent with the patterns of monthly precipitation and temperature i e warmer and wetter winters figs 3 and 4 the greatest percentage increase in monthly et occurs from winter into early spring i e from december to may of the next year under all rcp scenarios with the maxima in p4 by contrast the average monthly et from june to november does not change much relative to the bl from p1 to p4 under all rcp scenarios compared to the bl predicted monthly soil water content increases during winter for all rcp scenarios fig 10 however the predicted soil water content becomes much lower than that of the bl as early as in march which is more apparent from p2 to p4 under all rcp scenarios fig 10 also see tables s7 and s8 in the si document note that the dramatic decrease in monthly soil water content from march to october in p4 under the rcp8 5 scenario separates itself from the other two rcp scenarios we speculate that increased early spring evaporation leads to spring drought conditions resulting in a long lasting soil water deficit during the growing season precipitation does not apparently increase during this time even decrease in certain months but temperature increases greatly particularly under the rcp8 5 scenario figs 3 and 4 the pronounced reduction in soil water during the growing season indicates that less water would be used for crop growth resulting in reduced crop yields mitigating atmospheric co2 concentrations to at least within the range of the rcp4 5 scenario may help avoid crop yield reductions 4 discussion 4 1 climate change projections in ac our results indicate increases in annual air temperature and precipitation in ac during the rest of the 21st century consistent with the results of a study focused on ontario canada dong et al 2021 changing trends of temperature and precipitation over time appear to generally follow that of atmospheric co2 concentration under a moderately controlled co2 emission scenario rcp4 5 increases in annual air temperature and precipitation plateau towards the end of the century with overall temperatures rising by 2 1 c and precipitation increasing by 63 mm such increases can be reduced under a strictly controlled atmospheric co2 concentration emission scenario rcp2 6 increases in overall annual temperature and precipitation under the rcp2 6 scenario will be about half of that under the rcp4 5 scenario by contrast increases in temperature and precipitation will be much higher under an uncontrolled emission scenario rcp8 5 with increases in overall annual temperature and precipitation about 2 3 times greater than those under the rcp4 5 scenario by the end of the 21st century on a monthly basis increases in temperature and precipitation appear higher during the winter months than during the growing season the projected precipitation increases in this study area would be favorable to spring crop growth however elevated temperatures would increase evaporation creating spring drought conditions higher temperatures and unchanged lower precipitation during the growing season would lead to water stress for agricultural crops 4 2 climate change impacts on potato yields and water stress climate change will have major impacts on agricultural food production in a complicated way with regional differences potatoes are the largest non cereal crop worldwide zhang et al 2017 and the most valuable vegetable crop in canada potato 2021 high temperatures during the growing season due to climate change may cause an array of physiological changes in potato plants e g height of plants chlorophyll fluorescence in leaves number of tubers mass of an individual tuber tubers deformations and sprouted tubers affecting the development of potatoes and leading to a drastic yield reduction rykaczewska 2015 studies have suggested that potato productivity can be greatly reduced at temperatures higher than the optimum growth temperature of 20 rykaczewska 2015 2017 potato cultivar s responses to high temperatures during the growing season are dependent on its growth stage rykaczewska 2015 2017 heat stress at earlier stages has more negative impacts on potato plant growth exacerbating the reduction in potato yields rykaczewska 2015 in this study average monthly temperatures in p1 and p2 are all below the optimal temperature of potato growth 20 under all rcp scenarios except for july in p2 under the rcp8 5 scenario concerning p3 and p4 temperatures are below 20 under the rcp2 6 scenario with temperatures higher than 20 in july under the rcp4 5 scenario and in july and august under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 4 although we cannot rule out the possibility that temperatures on individual days could be high enough to cause direct yield reductions temperature increases themselves are unlikely to directly cause potato yield reductions in future climate warmer temperatures enhance evaporation reducing surface water and drying out soils and vegetation this makes periods with low precipitation drier than they would be under cooler conditions the projected precipitation increases mainly occur in winter and early spring the minor increase in precipitation during the growing season would not offset the impacts of high temperature induced water stress leading to the reduction in potato yields for example the great reduction in soil water content during the growing season in p3 and p4 under the rcp8 5 scenario is mainly caused by rising temperatures gcms also predict a decrease in precipitation in august under all scenarios especially in p2 p3 and p4 fig 3 the combined impacts of rising temperature and decreased precipitation lead to a reduced soil water content p3 8 4 p4 8 9 in august under the rcp8 5 scenario figs 9 and 10 this reduced soil water content during the growing stage is also severe enough to limit et p3 1 3 p4 2 0 these results suggest that climate change could cause substantial potato yield reductions others have also reported that water stress caused by elevated temperatures may be the main reason for crop yield reductions under climate change conditions asseng et al 2015 mitigation measures such as supplementary irrigation in this region of ac may be needed to combat the negative impacts of climate change 4 3 the impact of atmospheric co2 fertilization previous studies have indicated that elevated co2 concentrations can promote crop growth through carbon fertilization ainsworth and long 2005 however most experiments were conducted on a small scale or in laboratories due to their complex interactions the actual impact of co2 fertilization on crops at the watershed scale has been largely unknown walker and schulze 2008 in this study we attempted to investigate co2 fertilization effects on crop yields in the bbw using the enhanced swat model fig 11 shows crop yields before and after considering co2 fertilization effects in two future 40 year periods 2020 2059 and 2060 2099 and the bl period from 1980 to 2019 under the three rcp scenarios overall projected crop yields still tend to reduce even with co2 fertilization effects crop yield in response to co2 fertilization varies across different future periods and among the two crops barley yields tend to be affected more by co2 fertilization fig 11 co2 fertilization effects are visible in all future periods except for the period of 2020 2059 under the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios however significant differences between the with and without co2 fertilization scenarios only occur in the period of 2060 2099 under the rcp8 5 scenario for both crops these results agree with previous studies for example goswami et al 2018 recorded a drastic reduction in tuber yield when neglecting co2 fertilization raymundo et al 2018 reported a smaller tuber yield reduction after considering co2 fertilization our results suggest that although elevated co2 concentrations could potentially increase crop yields a projected increase in water stress caused by rising temperatures would offset this co2 fertilization effect leading to an overall decrease in crop yields 4 4 mitigation of climate change impacts on crop yields our study shows that climate change under the rcp8 5 scenario would lead to an economically significant crop yield reduction consistent with results reported by others liu et al 2021 at the global level collective efforts are needed to limit co2 emissions below the rcp4 5 level to ensure a sustainable crop yield locally mitigating management practices are needed for example sun and ren 2014 suggested delaying the harvest time of summer maize in the haihe plain in china to reduce adverse climate change effects hijmans 2003 concluded that the reduction in potato yields at high latitudes by climate change might be minimized by changing the planting time using later maturing cultivars and shifting the location of potato production furthermore tatsumi et al 2011 predicted that regions with cold weather under current climate conditions such as canada may become suitable for crop production under future climate scenarios considering changes in land management practices hijmans 2003 kim and lee 2020 to adapt to future climate change conditions would thus be helpful to mitigate the reduction in crop yields especially in ac based on our analyses earlier maturing cultivars may help avoid water stress in summer minimizing negative climate change impacts on potato yields furthermore optimizing cultivation practices e g irrigation and fertilization can conserve water resources reducing water stress during the crop growth period brassard and singh 2008 shahvari et al 2019 however prolonged irrigation could cause nutrient loss through runoff rykaczewska 2015 future comprehensive studies are needed to examine this more thoroughly 4 5 limitations of the present study the current swat model cannot simulate stochastic events such as disease outbreak and extreme weather events based on discrepancies between predicted and measured annual yields for 1992 1993 and 1994 fig 6 also measured barley and potato yields in 2011 were lower than predicted likely due to a severe hail event that occurred that year in the bbw causing serious crop damages this was not accounted for in the current swat model this limitation would not affect the performance of the model for estimating long term average conditions such as climate change impacts however we recognize that climate may also have impacts on disease and insect outbreaks which were not accounted for in this study furthermore rising atmospheric co2 concentrations can have direct impacts on the hydrological cycle ficklin et al 2016 for example elevated co2 concentrations could cause stomatal closure to some plants field et al 1995 medlyn et al 2001 morison 1987 saxe et al 1998 wand et al 1999 leading to a lower transpiration rate at the foliage level leakey et al 2009 sreeharsha et al 2015 xu et al 2016 also in the swat model the reduction in stomatal conductance by elevated co2 levels is assumed to be linear over the co2 concentration range of 330 660 ppm morison and gifford 1983 neitsch et al 2011 however the average atmospheric co2 concentration for the period of 2060 2099 under the rcp8 5 scenario is 958 ppm much greater than 660 ppm the reduction in stomatal conductance caused by this co2 concentration 958 ppm is 80 higher than the swat model s simulation range this suggests that we need to interpret the co2 fertilization effect on crop yields with caution and that further experiments should be carried out under higher atmospheric co2 concentration conditions we also recommend developing new algorithms for conditions when the co2 concentration is greater than 660 ppm in addition a steady state approach was taken in this study with respect to agricultural management practices we assumed that crop rotation and management practices remain unchanged in future scenarios however farmers may implement climate mitigation practices such as adjusting planting dates to earlier in the spring switching to potato and barley cultivars that better tolerate climate change and changing to more climate tolerant crops such as wheat or maize although modifying the swat configuration to account for these mitigation practices is challenging we attempted to simulate crop growth based on heat units however the performance was admittedly unrealistic we believe that this is one of the areas where the swat model can be improved the results presented here can be considered conservative with regard to crop yield predictions 5 summary and conclusions in this study we employed an enhanced soil and water assessment tool swat model to estimate potential impacts of climate change on the yield of two major crops i e potatoes and barley in atlantic canada by considering three greenhouse gas ghg emission scenarios i e representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 projected by five global climate models changes in crop yields were evaluated based on four future 20 year periods 2020 2099 relative to the baseline period bl 2000 2019 including p1 2020 2039 p2 2040 2059 p3 2060 2079 and p4 2080 2099 climate change impacts on hydrological variables associated with crop yields including air temperature precipitation evapotranspiration et soil water content and water use efficiency wue were also investigated analyses of future climate projections in the study area indicate that annual temperatures will significantly increase under all rcp scenarios and future periods with elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations in the 21st century however significant increases in annual precipitation are only found for rcp4 5 p3 and rcp8 5 p2 p3 and p4 seasonal analyses further show that the projected precipitation will mainly occur in winter and early spring with a minimal increase during the crop growing season and even a decrease in certain summer months under high ghg emission scenarios such as rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 our results indicate a significant crop yield reduction under the rcp8 5 scenario with barley yields reduced by 13 2 and 15 8 and potato yields reduced by 14 1 and 23 2 in p3 and p4 relative to the bl respectively no significant trend was detected for the other rcp scenarios the main reason for the crop yield reduction is the soil water stress during the growing season caused by rising temperatures and evapotranspiration projected under the rcp8 5 scenario mitigating atmospheric co2 concentrations to at least within the range of the rcp4 5 scenario would keep crop yields from reducing we also found that future changes in swat predicted annual et for both crops followed the same pattern of annual air temperature the wues of both potatoes and barley were predicted to decrease due to the combined impacts of increased et and reduced crop yields in different future periods further analysis shows that most increases in et occurred in winter and early spring and that changes in monthly et were minimal from summer to fall due to the low soil water content we also attempted to investigate co2 fertilization effects on crop yield and found that the response of crop yield to co2 fertilization varies across different future periods and the two crops in general when co2 fertilization effects are considered the predicted crop yield will still decrease relative to the bl for both crops elevated co2 concentrations can potentially increase crop yields however the projected increase in water stress caused by warmer temperatures would offset this effect leading to overall crop yield decreases under high ghg emission scenarios supplementary irrigation or adjusting land management practices may help avoid crop

9468,agriculture in atlantic canada ac is dominated by a rain fed potato production system with potatoes typically rotating with cereal crops such as barley and oats under rain fed conditions crop yields are sensitive to weather and its variations and are thus affected by climate change previous research regarding climate change impacts on crop yields in ac has been limited to a regional scale assessment mostly focusing on climate without considering real world field conditions e g soil and topography in this study an enhanced soil and water assessment tool swat model was used to estimate crop yields at the watershed scale under climate change conditions projected for the period of 2020 2099 using global climate models with three different greenhouse gas ghg emission scenarios from the representative concentration pathways i e rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 results suggest that climate change will negatively impact potato and barley yields under all three rcp scenarios in particular under the rcp8 5 scenario there will be significant reductions 13 23 in crop yields between 2060 and 2099 the leading cause of crop yield reductions is attributed to the soil water stress resulting from increased temperature and evapotranspiration during the growing season due to climate change elevated carbon dioxide co2 concentrations could potentially increase crop yields due to the co2 fertilization effect however it is not enough to offset the negative impacts of soil water stress our results suggest that on top of controlling ghg emissions to below the rcp4 5 level it is critical to develop and adapt crop soil and water management practices such as new crop rotation systems early planting dates and supplemental irrigation to maintain future crop yields in ac keywords climate change swat crop yield atlantic canada co2 fertilization 1 introduction the increase in fossil fuel consumption generates elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentrations which in turn traps heat and warms the earth s surface leading to rising temperatures losses in snowpack ice and changing precipitation patterns ahiablame et al 2017 pathak et al 2018 rajib et al 2016 rising atmospheric co2 concentrations will further influence the distribution of precipitation and increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as flooding and drought harrison et al 2014 these ongoing climate changes have great impacts on water budgets increasing water demands by agricultural crops ashraf vaghefi et al 2014 paul 2016 in particular projected changes in seasonal temperature and precipitation distributions have pronounced impacts on crop growth at different growing stages ahiablame et al 2017 ashraf vaghefi et al 2014 studies have indicated that an increase in atmospheric co2 concentrations is expected to promote plant growth through co2 fertilization cure and acock 1986 idso and idso 1994 however other studies have found that stomatal closure responses to elevated ambient co2 concentrations led to reduced evapotranspiration and co2 uptake y chen et al 2019 raymundo et al 2018 the overall impact of climate change on crop yields is thus complicated requiring further studies future changes in annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation patterns and their implications on different agricultural productions vary regionally for instance in the semi arid northern high plains of texas y chen et al 2019 predicted reductions in corn and sorghum yields under future climatic conditions smith et al 2013 indicated that cereal yields would decrease under the influence of future climate change in northern europe however wheat yields were projected to increase in the taihang mountain region of east asia rashid et al 2019 paul et al 2020 also predicted that corn yields would decline in both the mid and late 21st centuries whereas soybean yields were predicted to increase in the mid 21st century but decline by the late 21st century in mid atlantic usa motha and baier 2005 found that all major unirrigated crops would experience decreases in yield generalized over the usa in canada spring wheat winter wheat and corn yields were projected to increase in the west smith et al 2013 however corn yields in more humid regions of central canada were found to decrease he et al 2018 it is thus important to assess the impacts of climate change on local water resources and crop yields to evaluate and implement adaptive agricultural management practices needed to maintain expected crop productivity ozturk et al 2017 potatoes solanum tuberosum l are the largest non cereal food crop ranked as the fourth most important food crop in the world fao 2019 it is also the most important horticultural crop accounting for one third of all vegetable farm

canada 2017 historical records show that the climate in ac has become progressively warmer over the past hundred years motha and baier 2005 zhang et al 2000 intensified water stress associated with higher temperatures in the future can adversely impact the growth and yields of potatoes and barley there are few studies of climate change impacts on crop yields to inform agricultural water management in ac there is a lack of information about rain fed regions influenced by seasonal snow cover where climate change will have great impacts to address this knowledge gap we have employed a modeling approach to assess the impacts of future climate change on hydrology and crop yields at the watershed scale in ac s environment hydrological models incorporating crop growth modules are widely used to assess the change in crop yields under future climate change conditions ahmad et al 2020 x chen et al 2019 srivastava et al 2012 they have the advantages of low cost high efficiency and easy control of variables compared with field laboratory experiments particularly for agricultural watersheds y chen et al 2019 paul et al 2020 among them the soil and water assessment tool swat has been widely used to investigate climate change effects at the watershed scale worldwide arnold et al 1998 the swat model has been modified to better address ac s environment so can be adopted to investigate climate change impacts on crop yields in ac qi et al 2016b 2019b wang et al 2020b the objectives of this study are thus to 1 investigate future climatic conditions as impacted by elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations 2 evaluate the performance of the enhanced swat model in simulating hydrology and crop growth in a small experimental watershed and 3 predict the impacts of climate change on crop yields with major economic importance i e potatoes and barley and identify the key driving factors for crop yield changes in ac in this study we considered three representative

address this issue a physically based soil temperature module has been integrated into the swat model to account these effects due to freeze thaw cycles of soil water qi et al 2016a 2016b 2019a 2019b the enhanced swat model has proven to dramatically improve snow dominated hydrological responses to rising temperature wang et al 2020a 2021 2020b thus increasing the credibility of climate change impacts in ac the time lagging effect of snowmelt was also addressed by calibrating relevant parameters against measured high flows in early spring the model assumes that the lagging effect will not be impacted by climate change qi et al 2016b provided details about the algorithms and parameter determination 2 2 2 hydrology and crop yield simulation the hydrological process in the soil profile simulated by the swat model is based on the water balance equation eq 1 which includes the processes of precipitation surface runoff infiltration evapotranspiration lateral flow and percolation arnold

layer below is not saturated the amount of water moving from one layer to the underlying layer is calculated using the storage routing method arnold et al 2011 neitsch et al 2011 water percolating out of the lowest soil layer enters the vadose zone eventually recharging aquifers in the swat model evapotranspiration can be calculated with three different methods including the penman monteith method monteith 1965 the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 and the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 in this study the penman monteith method was utilized to simulate evapotranspiration the heat unit theory was used to regulate the plant growth cycle based on plant specific input parameters summarized in a plant growth database boswell 1926 magoon and culpepper 1932 actual growth was then deducted from potential growth due to stresses such as extreme temperatures water and nutrient i e nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies specifically plant growth was controlled by the leaf area index lai light interception and conversion of intercepted light into biomass by radiation use efficiency defined as the amount of dry biomass produced per unit intercepted solar radiation lastly the swat model partitioned crop yield from the total biomass based on the harvest index with a fraction of plant dry biomass removed as dry economic yield arnold et al 2011 2 3

humidity this weather generator model assumed that the characteristics of solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity remain the same as current levels for different future scenarios implying that temperature and precipitation are the dominant drivers for future hydrology and crop growth lopes et al 2021 somura et al 2009 2 4 statistical analysis and model performance evaluation to predict future climate change impacts on hydrological fluxes and crop yields we used measured streamflow and crop yields in the bbw to calibrate and validate the enhanced swat model for streamflow model

multiple hrus for crop calibration in the bbw shahvari et al 2019 sinnathamby et al 2017 sun and ren 2014 for potatoes to compare with the swat simulated dry biomass we adjusted measurements by multiplying an average dry mass percentage 0 23 of the potato yield according to experiments on four potato varieties russet burbank goldrush prospect and shepody in ac liang et al 2019 since the swat model does not take the potato variety into account we only examined the trend of average potato yields under different climate conditions at the watershed scale regarding barley because of the absence of experiments in ac we compared actual and simulated yields directly because the dry mass percentage of barely is 85 2 89 8 poulsen et al 2012 negligible to that of potatoes at 15 25 kapoor

yield is the crop yield tons ha 1 and et is evapotranspiration mm after model evaluation with historical data in terms of hydrology and crop yields in the bbw climate data projected with five gcms were used to drive the calibrated swat model simulating hydrological processes and crop yields from 1980 to 2099 we summarized simulated results for four future periods i e p1 2020 2039 p2 2040 2059 p3 2060 2079 and p4 2080 2099 changes in hydrological fluxes and crop yields from five gcms under three rcp scenarios were compared with the 20 year baseline bl period of 2000 2019 co2 fertilization effects on crop yields were summarized by 40 year periods discussed in section 4 we used 40 year periods for assessing co2 fertilization effects rather than 20 year periods due to the difficulty in configuring co2 in the swat model the co2 concentration input to the swat model is not set up as a time series like precipitation and temperature are in this case the bl is from 1980 to 2019 and the two future periods are 2020 2059 and 2060 2099 with 40 year averaged co2 concentrations tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test tukey 1949 a single step multiple comparison procedure and statistical test was used to identify the difference between the mean values of different periods using the multcompview package within statistical software r4 0 3 tukey 1949 and the supplementary information si document provide detailed explanations of tukey s hsd 3 results 3 1 atmospheric co2 concentration and climate projections 3 1 1 changes in co2 concentration although atmospheric co2 concentrations in ac are projected to increase relative to the bl 330 ppm for all future periods and rcp scenarios their projection curves are different between different rcp scenarios fig 2 for the rcp2 6 scenario the co2 concentration will increase from p1 to p2 then decrease from p2 to p4 with p2 having a maximum of 454 ppm the co2 concentration will increase monotonically from p1 to p4 under the rcp8 5 scenario with a maximum of 1084 ppm under the rcp4 5 scenario the co2 concentration will increase from p1 to p3 then slightly decrease from p3 to p4 with p3 having a maximum of 567 ppm 3 1 2 annual and seasonal precipitation projections projected average annual precipitation amounts simulated by the five gcms are greater than that during the bl period 1103 mm for all future periods and rcp scenarios except for a slight reduction in p1 under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 2a the changing patterns of precipitation follow those of atmospheric co2 concentrations under different rcp scenarios with maximum percentage increases of 4 8 6 4 and 13 8 in p2 p3 and p4 under the rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively however increases in average annual precipitation relative to the bl are significant p 0 05 only in rcp4 5 p3 and in rcp8 5 p2 p3 and p4 attributed to the great variability of projected precipitation amounts due to year to year variations and differences among gcms projected percentage changes of average monthly precipitation in p1 vary around the bl level without clear trends under all rcp scenarios fig 3a and b see tables s1 and s2 in the si document in p2 no clear differences are seen in average monthly precipitation amounts under all rcps scenarios however they all predict substantial increases in precipitation in the winter months february march and a decrease in precipitation in august fig 3c and d in p3 and p4 greater differences in average monthly precipitation occur in the winter months differences extend into spring with the highest precipitation under the rcp8 5 scenario followed by the rcp4 5 then rcp2 6 scenarios fig 3e f g and h during the growing season no evident increases are detected in june and july but a noticeable decrease is seen in august when crops have their highest water demand annual percentage increases in precipitation mainly occur during winter and early spring under the rcp8 5 scenario 3 1 3 annual and seasonal air temperature projections projected average annual temperatures simulated by the five gcms are significantly higher p 0 05 than that during the bl period 4 4 for all future periods and rcp scenarios fig 2b different from those of co2 concentration and precipitation the changing patterns of average annual temperature tend to increase with time with maximum increases of 1 1 2 1 and 4 8 in p4 under all rcp scenarios there appears to be a lag effect of co2 concentration on temperature so that the highest average annual temperature occurs in p3 and p4 under the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios variations in average annual temperature appear low with more variability under higher atmospheric co2 concentration conditions there are also significant differences p 0 05 in temperature increase between different future periods under the rcp8 5 scenario however this is not the case for the other rcp scenarios for example there is no significant difference between different future periods under the rcp2 6 scenario between p3 and p4 and between p2 and p3 under the rcp4 5 scenario average monthly temperatures reach their plateau in july and august under all rcp scenarios with no obvious difference between rcp scenarios in p1 for all months fig 4 also see tables s3 and s4 in the si document after p2 average monthly temperatures projected under the rcp8 5 scenario become greater than under the other two rcp scenarios particularly from july to february of the following year differences in temperature in spring and early summer march to june are not as obvious as in other seasons additionally the rcp8 5 scenario has the greatest seasonal variation in average monthly temperature increases than the other rcp scenarios fig 4 these results imply that higher temperatures in winter under the rcp8 5 scenario could reduce snowfall and accelerate snowmelt causing floods in spring seasonal variations in temperature have increasing uncertainties under high ghg emission scenarios 3 2 model calibration and validation to predict climate change impacts on hydrology and crop yields the enhanced swat model must first be calibrated and validated fig 5 shows that simulated monthly streamflow match observations well in terms of the magnitudes of high and low flows during the calibration 1992 2001 and validation 2001 2015 periods statistical indices follow the model performance evaluation criteria provided by moriasi et al 2007 with r e 5 r 2 0 76 ns 0 76 for the calibration period and r e 3 r 2 0 84 ns 0 84 for the validation period previous studies have reported that the swat model can predict crop yields with an acceptable accuracy without calibration srinivasan et al 2010 however our results indicate that the calibration of crop growth related parameters is necessary to improve the prediction accuracy of crop yields this is likely because the unique biophysical conditions in ac differ from those used in the development of the swat model we adjusted two crop growth related parameters namely the radiation use efficiency bio e and the maximum leaf area index blai for potatoes we increased bio e from 25 to 30 and increased blai from 4 to 5 for barley we increased bio e from 35 to 30 and kept blai equal to 4 fig 6 shows that the model performs well predicting yields of both crops during the calibration and validation periods with particularly low absolute r e values 5 for barley in both periods and potatoes in the validation period 3 3 future crop yields average annual barley and potato yields are predicted to reduce relative to the bl for all future periods under the three rcp scenarios except for rcp2 6 p4 rcp4 5 p1 and rcp8 5 p1 for barley fig 7 and table 1 under the rcp8 5 scenario barley and potato yields have a decreasing trend and no trend under the other rcp scenarios specifically under the rcp8 5 scenario there is a significant p 0 05 reduction in both barley p3 13 2 p4 15 8 and potato yields p3 14 1 p4 23 2 relative to the bl note that the difference in barley and potato yield reductions between the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios in p3 and between rcp8 5 and the other two rcp scenarios in p4 is significant p 0 05 the decline in potato yields is greater than that of barley under all rcp scenarios possibly related to the physiological characteristics of different crops delazari et al 2018 the patterns of yield reduction for both crops mostly mirror those of the average annual precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentration fig 2 however the patterns under the rcp4 5 scenario for the two crops differ the yield reduction is highest in p3 for barley and highest in p4 for potatoes the difference in mean values in different periods under the same rcp scenario or in the same period under different rcp scenarios are mostly not significant except in p3 and p4 under the rcp8 5 scenario this may be attributed to large year to year variations within the same period and the large differences between different gcms overall our results indicate crop yield reduction during the rest of the 21st century due to climate change under a moderately controlled emission scenario rcp4 5 the yield reduction is apparent especially after 2040 ranging from 3 8 to 4 5 for barley and from 4 6 to 7 5 for potatoes the situation could improve under a strictly controlled emission scenario rcp2 6 where the percentage yield reduction in p3 and p4 ranges from 1 4 to 2 4 for both crops by contrast the situation could worsen under an uncontrolled emission scenario rcp8 5 where the yield reductions in p3 and p4 are about three or more times than that under the rcp4 5 scenario for both crops our results are consistent with other studies that reported a reduction in barley yields under future climate conditions in ac bootsma et al 2005 and a reduction in potato yields in southern québec in canada brassard and singh 2008 3 4 crop yield related hydrological parameters average annual et is predicted to significantly increase p 0 05 in the future relative to the bl except in p1 under all three rcp scenarios for barley and in p1 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for potatoes fig 8 changes in average annual et for both crops follow the same pattern of average annual air temperature fig 2b the change in et has an increasing trend under the rcp8 5 scenario with the greatest et increase occurring in p4 for barley 19 7 and potatoes 19 5 the greatest increases in average annual et under the rcp2 6 scenario are 5 1 for both barley and potatoes and 8 4 and 8 2 under the rcp4 5 scenario for barley and potatoes respectively there is a significant p 0 05 difference in the increase in et between the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios in p3 and p4 no significant difference is detected between the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios annually high variations in et are found in all future periods under all rcp scenarios with no observable consistent trend wue is an important indicator describing the trade off between water loss and carbon sequestration during plant photosynthesis and evaluating the response of crop yields to climate change table 1 shows that wue will decrease in all future periods and under all rcp scenarios relative to the bl in particular a decreasing trend in wue is seen under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios whereas under the rcp2 6 scenario the decreasing trend from p1 to p2 reverses from p3 to p4 the greatest percentage decreases in wue for barley and potatoes are 8 7 and 7 0 under the rcp2 6 p2 scenario 13 0 and 14 0 under the rcp4 5 p4 scenario and 30 4 and 34 9 under the rcp8 5 p4 scenario respectively an increase in et along with a decrease in yield leads to a decrease in wue eq 5 table 1 to explore the reasons behind the future decline of crop yields we further analyzed monthly et and soil water content across the bbw predicted variations in average monthly et do not strictly follow those of monthly temperature for different future periods under the three rcp scenarios fig 9 versus fig 4 also see tables s5 and s6 in the si document the highest et appears in june and july almost one month earlier than temperature when crop water demand is not the greatest the difference in average monthly et between rcps becomes greater with time from p1 to p4 especially for winter and early spring from november to may of the next year fig 9 this is consistent with the patterns of monthly precipitation and temperature i e warmer and wetter winters figs 3 and 4 the greatest percentage increase in monthly et occurs from winter into early spring i e from december to may of the next year under all rcp scenarios with the maxima in p4 by contrast the average monthly et from june to november does not change much relative to the bl from p1 to p4 under all rcp scenarios compared to the bl predicted monthly soil water content increases during winter for all rcp scenarios fig 10 however the predicted soil water content becomes much lower than that of the bl as early as in march which is more apparent from p2 to p4 under all rcp scenarios fig 10 also see tables s7 and s8 in the si document note that the dramatic decrease in monthly soil water content from march to october in p4 under the rcp8 5 scenario separates itself from the other two rcp scenarios we speculate that increased early spring evaporation leads to spring drought conditions resulting in a long lasting soil water deficit during the growing season precipitation does not apparently increase during this time even decrease in certain months but temperature increases greatly particularly under the rcp8 5 scenario figs 3 and 4 the pronounced reduction in soil water during the growing season indicates that less water would be used for crop growth resulting in reduced crop yields mitigating atmospheric co2 concentrations to at least within the range of the rcp4 5 scenario may help avoid crop yield reductions 4 discussion 4 1 climate change projections in ac our results indicate increases in annual air temperature and precipitation in ac during the rest of the 21st century consistent with the results of a study focused on ontario canada dong et al 2021 changing trends of temperature and precipitation over time appear to generally follow that of atmospheric co2 concentration under a moderately controlled co2 emission scenario rcp4 5 increases in annual air temperature and precipitation plateau towards the end of the century with overall temperatures rising by 2 1 c and precipitation increasing by 63 mm such increases can be reduced under a strictly controlled atmospheric co2 concentration emission scenario rcp2 6 increases in overall annual temperature and precipitation under the rcp2 6 scenario will be about half of that under the rcp4 5 scenario by contrast increases in temperature and precipitation will be much higher under an uncontrolled emission scenario rcp8 5 with increases in overall annual temperature and precipitation about 2 3 times greater than those under the rcp4 5 scenario by the end of the 21st century on a monthly basis increases in temperature and precipitation appear higher during the winter months than during the growing season the projected precipitation increases in this study area would be favorable to spring crop growth however elevated temperatures would increase evaporation creating spring drought conditions higher temperatures and unchanged lower precipitation during the growing season would lead to water stress for agricultural crops 4 2 climate change impacts on potato yields and water stress climate change will have major impacts on agricultural food production in a complicated way with regional differences potatoes are the largest non cereal crop worldwide zhang et al 2017 and the most valuable vegetable crop in canada potato 2021 high temperatures during the growing season due to climate change may cause an array of physiological changes in potato plants e g height of plants chlorophyll fluorescence in leaves number of tubers mass of an individual tuber tubers deformations and sprouted tubers affecting the development of potatoes and leading to a drastic yield reduction rykaczewska 2015 studies have suggested that potato productivity can be greatly reduced at temperatures higher than the optimum growth temperature of 20 rykaczewska 2015 2017 potato cultivar s responses to high temperatures during the growing season are dependent on its growth stage rykaczewska 2015 2017 heat stress at earlier stages has more negative impacts on potato plant growth exacerbating the reduction in potato yields rykaczewska 2015 in this study average monthly temperatures in p1 and p2 are all below the optimal temperature of potato growth 20 under all rcp scenarios except for july in p2 under the rcp8 5 scenario concerning p3 and p4 temperatures are below 20 under the rcp2 6 scenario with temperatures higher than 20 in july under the rcp4 5 scenario and in july and august under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 4 although we cannot rule out the possibility that temperatures on individual days could be high enough to cause direct yield reductions temperature increases themselves are unlikely to directly cause potato yield reductions in future climate warmer temperatures enhance evaporation reducing surface water and drying out soils and vegetation this makes periods with low precipitation drier than they would be under cooler conditions the projected precipitation increases mainly occur in winter and early spring the minor increase in precipitation during the growing season would not offset the impacts of high temperature induced water stress leading to the reduction in potato yields for example the great reduction in soil water content during the growing season in p3 and p4 under the rcp8 5 scenario is mainly caused by rising temperatures gcms also predict a decrease in precipitation in august under all scenarios especially in p2 p3 and p4 fig 3 the combined impacts of rising temperature and decreased precipitation lead to a reduced soil water content p3 8 4 p4 8 9 in august under the rcp8 5 scenario figs 9 and 10 this reduced soil water content during the growing stage is also severe enough to limit et p3 1 3 p4 2 0 these results suggest that climate change could cause substantial potato yield reductions others have also reported that water stress caused by elevated temperatures may be the main reason for crop yield reductions under climate change conditions asseng et al 2015 mitigation measures such as supplementary irrigation in this region of ac may be needed to combat the negative impacts of climate change 4 3 the impact of atmospheric co2 fertilization previous studies have indicated that elevated co2 concentrations can promote crop growth through carbon fertilization ainsworth and long 2005 however most experiments were conducted on a small scale or in laboratories due to their complex interactions the actual impact of co2 fertilization on crops at the watershed scale has been largely unknown walker and schulze 2008 in this study we attempted to investigate co2 fertilization effects on crop yields in the bbw using the enhanced swat model fig 11 shows crop yields before and after considering co2 fertilization effects in two future 40 year periods 2020 2059 and 2060 2099 and the bl period from 1980 to 2019 under the three rcp scenarios overall projected crop yields still tend to reduce even with co2 fertilization effects crop yield in response to co2 fertilization varies across different future periods and among the two crops barley yields tend to be affected more by co2 fertilization fig 11 co2 fertilization effects are visible in all future periods except for the period of 2020 2059 under the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios however significant differences between the with and without co2 fertilization scenarios only occur in the period of 2060 2099 under the rcp8 5 scenario for both crops these results agree with previous studies for example goswami et al 2018 recorded a drastic reduction in tuber yield when neglecting co2 fertilization raymundo et al 2018 reported a smaller tuber yield reduction after considering co2 fertilization our results suggest that although elevated co2 concentrations could potentially increase crop yields a projected increase in water stress caused by rising temperatures would offset this co2 fertilization effect leading to an overall decrease in crop yields 4 4 mitigation of climate change impacts on crop yields our study shows that climate change under the rcp8 5 scenario would lead to an economically significant crop yield reduction consistent with results reported by others liu et al 2021 at the global level collective efforts are needed to limit co2 emissions below the rcp4 5 level to ensure a sustainable crop yield locally mitigating management practices are needed for example sun and ren 2014 suggested delaying the harvest time of summer maize in the haihe plain in china to reduce adverse climate change effects hijmans 2003 concluded that the reduction in potato yields at high latitudes by climate change might be minimized by changing the planting time using later maturing cultivars and shifting the location of potato production furthermore tatsumi et al 2011 predicted that regions with cold weather under current climate conditions such as canada may become suitable for crop production under future climate scenarios considering changes in land management practices hijmans 2003 kim and lee 2020 to adapt to future climate change conditions would thus be helpful to mitigate the reduction in crop yields especially in ac based on our analyses earlier maturing cultivars may help avoid water stress in summer minimizing negative climate change impacts on potato yields furthermore optimizing cultivation practices e g irrigation and fertilization can conserve water resources reducing water stress during the crop growth period brassard and singh 2008 shahvari et al 2019 however prolonged irrigation could cause nutrient loss through runoff rykaczewska 2015 future comprehensive studies are needed to examine this more thoroughly 4 5 limitations of the present study the current swat model cannot simulate stochastic events such as disease outbreak and extreme weather events based on discrepancies between predicted and measured annual yields for 1992 1993 and 1994 fig 6 also measured barley and potato yields in 2011 were lower than predicted likely due to a severe hail event that occurred that year in the bbw causing serious crop damages this was not accounted for in the current swat model this limitation would not affect the performance of the model for estimating long term average conditions such as climate change impacts however we recognize that climate may also have impacts on disease and insect outbreaks which were not accounted for in this study furthermore rising atmospheric co2 concentrations can have direct impacts on the hydrological cycle ficklin et al 2016 for example elevated co2 concentrations could cause stomatal closure to some plants field et al 1995 medlyn et al 2001 morison 1987 saxe et al 1998 wand et al 1999 leading to a lower transpiration rate at the foliage level leakey et al 2009 sreeharsha et al 2015 xu et al 2016 also in the swat model the reduction in stomatal conductance by elevated co2 levels is assumed to be linear over the co2 concentration range of 330 660 ppm morison and gifford 1983 neitsch et al 2011 however the average atmospheric co2 concentration for the period of 2060 2099 under the rcp8 5 scenario is 958 ppm much greater than 660 ppm the reduction in stomatal conductance caused by this co2 concentration 958 ppm is 80 higher than the swat model s simulation range this suggests that we need to interpret the co2 fertilization effect on crop yields with caution and that further experiments should be carried out under higher atmospheric co2 concentration conditions we also recommend developing new algorithms for conditions when the co2 concentration is greater than 660 ppm in addition a steady state approach was taken in this study with respect to agricultural management practices we assumed that crop rotation and management practices remain unchanged in future scenarios however farmers may implement climate mitigation practices such as adjusting planting dates to earlier in the spring switching to potato and barley cultivars that better tolerate climate change and changing to more climate tolerant crops such as wheat or maize although modifying the swat configuration to account for these mitigation practices is challenging we attempted to simulate crop growth based on heat units however the performance was admittedly unrealistic we believe that this is one of the areas where the swat model can be improved the results presented here can be considered conservative with regard to crop yield predictions 5 summary and conclusions in this study we employed an enhanced soil and water assessment tool swat model to estimate potential impacts of climate change on the yield of two major crops i e potatoes and barley in atlantic canada by considering three greenhouse gas ghg emission scenarios i e representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 projected by five global climate models changes in crop yields were evaluated based on four future 20 year periods 2020 2099 relative to the baseline period bl 2000 2019 including p1 2020 2039 p2 2040 2059 p3 2060 2079 and p4 2080 2099 climate change impacts on hydrological variables associated with crop yields including air temperature precipitation evapotranspiration et soil water content and water use efficiency wue were also investigated analyses of future climate projections in the study area indicate that annual temperatures will significantly increase under all rcp scenarios and future periods with elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations in the 21st century however significant increases in annual precipitation are only found for rcp4 5 p3 and rcp8 5 p2 p3 and p4 seasonal analyses further show that the projected precipitation will mainly occur in winter and early spring with a minimal increase during the crop growing season and even a decrease in certain summer months under high ghg emission scenarios such as rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 our results indicate a significant crop yield reduction under the rcp8 5 scenario with barley yields reduced by 13 2 and 15 8 and potato yields reduced by 14 1 and 23 2 in p3 and p4 relative to the bl respectively no significant trend was detected for the other rcp scenarios the main reason for the crop yield reduction is the soil water stress during the growing season caused by rising temperatures and evapotranspiration projected under the rcp8 5 scenario mitigating atmospheric co2 concentrations to at least within the range of the rcp4 5 scenario would keep crop yields from reducing we also found that future changes in swat predicted annual et for both crops followed the same pattern of annual air temperature the wues of both potatoes and barley were predicted to decrease due to the combined impacts of increased et and reduced crop yields in different future periods further analysis shows that most increases in et occurred in winter and early spring and that changes in monthly et were minimal from summer to fall due to the low soil water content we also attempted to investigate co2 fertilization effects on crop yield and found that the response of crop yield to co2 fertilization varies across different future periods and the two crops in general when co2 fertilization effects are considered the predicted crop yield will still decrease relative to the bl for both crops elevated co2 concentrations can potentially increase crop yields however the projected increase in water stress caused by warmer temperatures would offset this effect leading to overall crop yield decreases under high ghg emission scenarios supplementary irrigation or adjusting land management practices may help avoid crop

9469,olive trees are considered among the most resilient crops in mediterranean basin however prolonged water stress may adversely affect plant productivity and quality of fruits and oil therefore it is essential to design new agronomic strategies to improve plant water stress tolerance and secure yield and product stability of this important agricultural crop under water deficit plants cope with serious threats and melatonin mel as a versatile signaling biomolecule can play a crucial role in morphological and physiological modifications of plants able to enhance drought stress tolerance in this view the current research aimed at elucidating the potential beneficial role of exogenous foliar application of mel 0 and 100 µm to sevillana and roughani olive cultivars under different water stress levels 100 75 and 50 et in particular the morphological physiological and biochemical changes occurring in leaves treated with or without mel and the quality of fruits and oil were discussed a decrease of electrolyte leakage el and malondialdehyde mda content as well as an increase of relative water content rwc in mel sprayed leaves of drought stress trees were observed the application of mel was also associated with higher k to na ratio ca2 content phenolic and soluble carbohydrates contents and a lower decline chlorophyll chl levels mel treated leaves also showed higher catalase cat and peroxidase pod activities responsible for scavenging reactive oxygen species ros generated during drought stress in a severity dependent manner mel foliar application enhanced the oil content and yield in the olive fruits in both cultivars compared to the untreated ones since mel was also able to exert a beneficial effect on both sevillana and roughani cultivar trees by improving their crop water productivity wpc under water deficit it can be considered an effective eco friendly candidate to minimize the detrimental consequences of water stress keywords adaptive mechanisms drought antioxidant defense system yield crop water productivity small bioactive molecules 1 introduction water deficit is a major environmental constraint that jeopardizes crop productivity in many arid and semi arid regions worldwide naeem et al 2018 it is expected to significantly increase by the end of 21st century threatening food security and escalating human migrations and conflicts sun et al 2020 at low drought plants do not noticeably modify their growth pattern while slightly increase their root biomass ma et al 2020 on the contrary moderate or severe drought triggers a broad range of morphological and physiological damages to plants among which stomatal closure reduction of transpiration and photosynthetic rate and decrease of wue cui et al 2017 kumawat and sharma 2018 rahman et al 2020 sun et al 2020 moreover the accumulation of salts in soil upper layers caused by water scarcity further reduces the ability of plants to extract water and nutrient from soil causing a nutrient deficiency in particular of k and ca2 and a decrease of cell turgor pressure ma et al 2020 ahmad et al 2018 plants greatly suffer from mineral shortcoming due to scarce soil nutrient accessibility lower absorption from the soil through their roots and weaker mobilization of mineral elements within the plant itself hosseini et al 2021 in these conditions roots start draining resources from leaves synthetizing compatible osmolytes to avoid dehydration lowering water potential for being able to uptake water and ions and modifying their architecture to explore larger soil portions to access deeper water reservoirs vadez 2014 if the water stress conditions persist the roots shrink and the disturbance of mineral and water balance perturbs redox homeostasis and induce the overproduction of reactive oxygen species ros which further contribute to lipid peroxidation and disturbance of membrane and protein functions naeem et al 2018 liang et al 2019 takahashi et al 2020 in particular this latter condition impairs light harvesting processes photosynthetic electron transport rate and photochemical efficiency of psii determining photosynthetic disfunction and leaf senescence with a strong negative effect on developmental processes plant growth and yield wei et al 2014 fathi and tari 2016 kamran et al 2018 el kelish et al 2020 to cope with the damageable repercussions of drought and protect the cells from ros toxicity plants enact various strategies indeed they have evolved an inbuilt antioxidant system which includes plant s non enzymatic e g antioxidant metabolites and enzymatic e g catalase and superoxide dismutase antioxidants which work simultaneously in a systematic manner to stabilize membranes and proteins scavenge ros and buffer cellular redox potential in plants carillo 2018 soares et al 2019 in particular secondary metabolites including phenolic compounds have a great antioxidant potentials thus contributing to contrast oxidative stress hosseini et al 2021 moreover the synthesis of small molecules 500 da among which nitrogen containing compounds such as amino acids amines and betaines or sugars may play a beneficial role by contributing to the regulate cellular osmotic adjustment detoxify ros protect membrane integrity stabilize stomatal conductance in addition to enhance co2 intake through leaves and water absorption via roots dawood and el awadi 2015 carillo 2018 carillo et al 2019 besides the exploitation of plant tolerant cultivars some applicative and agronomic strategies have also been adopted to minimize or even overcome the deleterious impact of drought stress and improve the plant s adaptability one of the most innovative strategies is the application of biologically active small molecules of natural or synthetic origin that can be applied exogenously at very low concentrations and relieve or protect plants from unfavorable environmental conditions kamran et al 2018 these multifunctional molecules confer tolerance to plants growing under abiotic stresses including high or low temperature heavy metals drought salinity and pesticides sharma et al 2018 carillo et al 2019 several studies have highlighted that melatonin n acetyl 5 methoxytryptamine mel a small natural indoleamine compound of 232 da functioning as circadian mediator antioxidant and immune modulator in animals reiter et al 2018 has been reported as a promising tool for the control of drought stress ahmad et al 2019 bidabadi et al 2020 liang et al 2019 demonstrated that the application of exogenous mel to malus domestica borkh mitigated the inhibitory effects of drought on stomatal apertures relative water content chlorophyll levels and photosynthesis decreasing ros accumulation and electrolyte

metabolism enzymes nr nir gs and gogat even under drought stress and on the synthesis of endogenous melatonin that was highly increased liang et al 2019 mel as an inexpensive and eco friendly substance could be an affordable method to improve plant growth and development under drought stress mel has also been found to promote carbon assimilation and growth in barley li et al 2016a and photosynthesis and growth in kiwifruit seedlings liang et al 2019 under drought mel treated maize seedlings under drought stress showed thicker and taller stems lower mda contents and higher stomatal conductance net photosynthetic rate and leaf rwc than untreated ones ahmad et al 2019 mel modulated redox homeostasis and synthesis of polyamine and nitric in heat stressed tomato seedlings jahan et al 2019 several reports indicate that mel application in numerous crops enhances their tolerance by protecting the photosynthetic apparatus increasing their antioxidant capability and improving the water holding capacity fleta soriano et al 2017 it has been proven that the usage of a proper concentration of mel on sour orange citrus aurantium l seedlings and rapeseed brassica napus l subjected to abiotic stresses significantly increased the concentrations of osmoprotectants zeng et al 2018 tomato plants supplied with 200 µm mel showed an accumulation of phenolic compounds under water

liang et al 2018 under drought stress olive olea eruopea l a precious plant due to its oil nutritional value is broadly cultivated worldwide including iran nejadrezaei et al 2018 however notwithstanding olive plants are known as highly tolerant to water deficit scenarios their remarkable productive characteristics can be highly affected under prolonged drought gholami and zahedi 2019 olive genotypes show different levels of tolerance against water deficit conditions therefore it is essential to design new agronomic strategies to improve olive cultivation in arid and semi arid regions under fluctuating water conditions bianco and scalisi 2017 despite the numerous studies on mel effects on plants under abiotic stresses its mechanisms of action are still not fully elucidated and require a more in depth investigation thus this study is focused on studying the potential beneficial role of exogenous mel 0 and 100 µm on morphological physiological and biochemical changes in sevillana and roughani olive cultivars under different water stress levels 100 75 and 50 et the results obtained will be easily translated in field in order to design new agronomic strategies to enhance drought tolerance in olive genotypes and improve oil production even under stress conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site drought imposition and mel application in the present

procedures of i o o c 2002 protocol the fresh fruits with their pits were dried 70 ºc for 48 h two grams of flesh were charged to the soxhlet extractor with 250 ml diethyl ether for 5 h then transferred and dried in an oven at 70 ºc for 2 h the difference between the 2 obtained dried samples is the oil content dw to calculate the oil content expressed as fw the oil content dw should be multiplied by the fruit dry matter percentage 2 8 yield parameters oil and fruit yield was obtained by the total amount of produced oil fw and fruit in one hectare respectively sepaskhah et al 2006 2

fernandez et al 2020 2 10 statistical analysis this experiment was designed in a complete randomized block in a factorial arrangement with 3 replicates and each replication included 2 trees 3 2 6 trees in each treatment and 3 factors mel treatments water stress levels and cultivars 2 3 2 12 the experimental data were analyzed by the three way analysis of variance mel treatments water stress levels and cultivars using the sas software version 9 1 statistical significance was determined at the p 0 05 level using tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test all data are presented as mean n 3 a heatmap analysis summarizing the two olive cultivars responses to drought and mel treatments was generated using the https biit cs ut ee clustvis online program package with euclidean distance as the similarity measure and hierarchical clustering with complete linkage data were visualized using a false color scale with red indicating an increase and blue a decrease of values rouphael et al 2020 the loading plot and score plot of all analyzed parameters were determined after principal component analysis pca by using minitab 18 statistical software minitab llc state college pa usa ciarmiello et al 2015 3 results 3 1 morphological parameters and oil yield with respect to the biometric variables roughani cultivar rcv showed significant p 0 01 higher fruit diameter table 1 and fruit dry matter fresh pit weight pit length table 2 and superior productivity for oil content fw and dw and oil yield table 3 compared to sevillana cultivar scv whereas significant higher pulp percent p 0 05 table 2 and fruit yield p 0 01 table 3 were observed in scv compared to rcv all drought stressed olive trees displayed obvious retardation in growth parameters in a level dependent manner and the highest growth inhibition was observed in the severe drought stress in fact drought treatments 75et and 50et determined a significant p 0 01 and remarkable reduction of all the morphological parameters tables 1 and 2 fig 1 also in dependence of the severity of stress except for fruit dry matter and pulp percent table 2 irrespective of mel treatment cv x et severe drought 50et significantly decreased p 0 05 shoot growth fruit weight fruit diameter table 1 pit length pit diameter table 2 and fruit yield table 3 in both cultivars mel100 treatment significantly enhanced all growth parameters of olive trees compared to mel0 except for fresh pulp weight table 1 pit diameter and pulp percent table 2 the positive effect of mel100 was particularly evident on oil content fw and dw fruit yield and oil yield table 3 irrespective of drought treatment cv x mel mel positively affected shoot growth shoot diameter fruit length dry pulp weight table 1 fruit dry matter fresh pit weight pulp pit weight table 2 oil content fw and dw and oil yield table 3 in both cultivars all morphological parameters were significantly influenced by cultivar x drought x mel treatment tables 1 2 and 3 cv x mel x et interaction was significant for morphological parameters drought stress triggered a severity dependent decline of these traits tables 1 and 2 indicated a remarkable decrease from 100et to 50et and the use of mel significantly alleviated this detrimental effect on morphological traits in both cultivars cv x mel x et was also significant for oil yield mel treatment mitigated the adverse repercussions of drought on oil yield compared to respective non mel treated olive cultivars table 3 3 2 photosynthetic pigments chlorophylls a and b content of leaves of olive trees was significantly affected by drought stress and mel treatments and by the interaction among cv x mel et x mel and cv x et x mel table 4 whereas chl a b was only affected by drought and mel treatment table 4 in particular severe drought significantly p 0 01 reduced by 56 the content of chl a b compared to respective control table 4 mel treated olive trees exhibited higher levels of photosynthetic pigments independently of drought treatment although mel application was considerably more effective under severe drought table 4 cv x mel x et interaction was significant for chl a and chl b chl b showed a tendency to decrease in a drought severity dependent manner mel treatment was able to alleviate the negative effects of drought stress on this trait compared to the respective mel untreated olive trees and in particular on scv induced an increase of this parameter in comparison with rcv table 4 3 3 leaf macronutrients concentrations the type of cultivar as factor significantly affected the content of k higher in scv and na higher in rcv but not ca2 content table 5 drought stress significantly increased na contents while decreased those of k and ca2 in a severity dependent manner table 5 for instance severe drought enhanced the amounts of na by 59 and 80 in scv and rcv as compared to respective control conditions whereas it decreased the levels of k by 33 and 20 5 and ca2 by 42 and 39 in scv and rcv leaves compared to respective non stressed ones mel foliar spray significantly increased the leaf amounts of ca2 and k while reducing that of na table 5 the concentrations of ca2 was not influenced by cv x mel but it was affected by all the other considered interactions while k and na were oppositely affected by the three considered parameters cv et and mel and their interactions table 5 cv x mel x et interaction was significant concerning macronutrients for instance k and ca2 decreased under drought stress while na increased in a severity dependent manner from 100et to 50et macronutrients underwent a positive effect when treated with mel and in particular scv accumulated higher amounts of beneficial nutrients in particular k while na content decreased as shown in table 5 accordingly the highest value of na was observed in rcv table 5 3 4 osmolytes phenolic contents rwc and el of olive leaves the type of cultivar significantly p 0 01 influenced leaf phenolic contents rwc and el but not proline and total carbohydrates table 6 drought stress triggered a strong severity dependent enhancement of proline total carbohydrate phenolic contents and el while decreased rwc in comparison with respective controls in particular under 75et and 50et there was an increase of proline of 3 7 and 7 1 fold of total carbohydrates of 1 5 and 2 5 fold of phenolic contents of 1 6 and 1 9 fold and of el of 1 5 and 1 8 fold compared with respective controls table 6 all the parameters shown in table 6 were significantly p 0 01 affected by mel treatment but in particular it decreased proline 36 while strongly boosted phenolic contents 158 cv x mel interaction was significant only for phenolics content while cv x et was non significant only for the same parameter table 6 therefore by considering the obtained data the foliar application of mel determined beneficial effects on the biosynthesis and or accumulation of osmolytes under drought and non drought conditions with moderate stress displaying superior results than severe stress cv x mel x et interaction was significant for osmolytes in fact the higher amount of proline was found in scv x 50et x mel0 total carbohydrate in scv x 50et x mel100 and phenolic contents in rcv x 50et x mel100 mel application and drought stress triggered a severity dependent enhancement of osmolytes in both cultivars table 6 obviously drought stress caused a considerable decrease of rwc while mel treatment contributed to enhance it but this contribution was not significant and there was no considerable difference between cultivars additionally el was enhanced significantly in olive trees exposed to drought in a severity dependent manner and mel treatment caused a slight decrease of el table 6 3 5 antioxidant enzymes activity and mda pox antioxidant activity in control leaves was significantly higher 30 p 0 01 in rcv than in scv table 7 drought stress induced a severity dependent increase of mda as well as antioxidant enzymes activity compared with respective controls cat and pox activities in particular were significantly affected by severe drought showing an increase of 3 4 and 2 5 fold in scv and of 3 0 and 3 9 fold in rcv respectively however the cv x et interaction was not significant p 0 05 for mda table 7 foliar treatment of mel alleviated the negative effects of drought in olive trees by improving antioxidative cat and pox activities while reducing mda content and these results were statistically significant as compared with controls however the cv x mel interaction was not statistically significant table 7 cv x mel x et interaction was significant for antioxidant enzymes cat and pox and mda as shown in table 7 drought stress induced a strong severity dependent increase in antioxidant enzymes activity and mel treatment amplified this increase similarly mda increased in olive trees expose to drought but this parameter decreased in mel treated plants table 7 3 6 crop water productivity fruit wpc was higher in scv than in rcv while the opposite happened for oil wpc table 8 drought stress significantly p 0 05 affected wpc in fruits only at 75et while it did not affect oil wpc table 8 application of mel caused a significant p 0 01 increase wpc both in fruit and oil by 1 5 and 3 0 fold respectively compared to controls table 8 these results provided reliable evidence regarding the beneficial impacts of mel on the water balance in olive trees under different conditions cv x mel x et interaction was significant for wpc in fruit and oil in both cultivars scv and rcv mel treated olive trees showed higher wpc in fruit and oil at all irrigation levels table 8 3 7 heat map analysis and principal component analysis pca an aggregated data heat map analysis of all measured parameters was performed to show a visual comparison of the effects determined by the drought stress and mel treatment on the two olive cultivars the dendrogram clustering revealed two main groups i and ii group i on the left was subclustered in group iii aggregating the two cultivars under mel0 x 100et treatments and group iv aggregating on the left rcv mel100 x 75et viii and on the right scv mel100 x 75et scv mel100 x 100et and rcv mel100 x 100et ix group ii on the right was subclustered in group v aggregating the two cultivars under mel0 x 50et treatments and group vi aggregating on the left rcv mel0 x 75et x and on the right scv mel0 x 75et xi scv mel0 x 50et and rcv mel0 x 50et xii fig 2 this indicated that drought stress was the main clustering factor followed by mel treatment it was clearly evident that the treatments mel100 x 100et in both cultivars ix were characterized by the highest fruit and oil yield fruit wpc pulp fresh and dry weight rwc k and ca2 chlorophylls fresh and dry pit weight fruit length weight and diameter while they showed the lowest na el proline concentration and pulp percentage instead subcluster iii aggregating the two cultivars under mel0 x 100et treatments showed the lowest carbohydrates content and cat and pox activities rcv under mel100 x 75et and mel100 x 50et showed the highest pulp pit weight phenolic contents dry matter and oil content dm subcluster v and xii grouping both cultivars under mel100 x 50 et and mel0 x 50et showed the highest carbohydrates content and cat and pox activities while subcluster xii alone showed the lowest morphological parameters but highest na el proline and mda contents fig 2 a clear separation of treatments and cultivars was obtained by applying a principal component analysis pca the first two principal components pcs were related with eigen values higher than 1 and explained 84 5 of the total variance with pc1and pc2 accounting for 61 5 and 23 0 respectively table s5 the evapotranspiration percentage drought stress contributed to the clear separation on pc1 whereas the mel treatment contributed to the separation on pc2 the treatments 100et x mel100 were concentrated in the positive side of pc1 and correlated to current season shoot growth cssg and current season shoot diameter cssd fruit weight and length chl a pit dw and oil yields while 50et x mel0 ones were in the negative side of pc1 and correlated with mda na proline and el the treatments 50et x mel100 were clustered in the positive side of pc2 and correlated with phenolic contents pod and cat enzymatic activities carbohydrates content pulp stone weight oil content fw and dry matter while 100et x mel0 treatments were clustered in the negative side of pc2 and correlated to pulp percentage also correlated to 75et x mel0 rwc chl a b and ca2 fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 morphological parameters and oil yield in mediterranean type areas drought is favored by the hot and dry climate in the spring summer period high rate of evapotranspiration and low rainfalls dell aversana et al 2021 olive trees of these semi arid ecosystems have developed different mechanisms to face drought which involve different strategies and adaptive changes with very high cost in terms of energy consumption that negatively impact on plant vegetative development physiology and reproduction finally decreasing crop yields fahad et al 2017 since the small bioactive molecule melatonin mel has been recently reported as a promising tool for mitigating the negative effects of drought stress ahmad et al 2019 bidabadi et al 2020 in this study the ameliorative morphological physiological and biochemical effects induced by foliar spray of mel0 and 100 µm on two cultivars of twenty years olive plants under different water stress levels 100 75 and 50 et were evaluated the superior iranian local olive oil cultivar called roughani rcv showed in control conditions to have significantly lower fruit yield but much higher oil content than the spanish table olive cultivar known as sevillana scv hajiamiri et al 2010 4 2 photosynthetic pigments this is also proved by the higher content of chlorophylls chl a chl b and chl a b in mel treated olive trees under drought stress water deficit in fact leads to chl degradation due to the high presence of ros that affect the photosynthetic responses by damaging the light harvesting complexes and reaction centers chen et al 2017 mel treatment preserves photosynthetic accessory pigments including carotenoids under drought stress liang et al 2019 hosseini et al 2021 thus mel could contribute to regulate photosynthesis and membrane integrity as well as osmoregulation cellular homeostasis and cell expansion jahan et al 2019 4 3 leaf macronutrients concentrations indeed drought stress caused pleiotropic effects on olive trees which reduced shoot growth and diameter fruit dimension fruit yield and oil yield in both cultivars this could be due to the negative impact of drought on stomatal aperture which decreases transpiration determining nutritional imbalance decrease of ca2 and k na ratio in fact water shortcoming lessens the accessibility to soil nutrient because it causes a significant depletion in water potential that decreases the ability of plants to extract water and minerals from soil and transport them from roots to shoots kheradmand et al 2014 dell aversana et al 2021 in particular in olive plants water deficit reduced k uptake and transport while increased na accumulation in leaves as also observed by qi et al 2019 and hu et al 2013 the drought dependent impact on stomata also decreased the availability of co2 with a consequent reduction of photosynthetic efficiency cui et al 2017 kumawat and sharma 2018 rahman et al 2020 sun et al 2020 mel treatment improved the nutrient imbalance due to the reduced acquisition of minerals like ca2 and k increasing their uptake and transport to leaves while reducing that of na during the drought stress period jahan et al 2019 4 4 osmolytes phenolic contents rwc and el in particular both cultivars under moderate and severe drought synthesized and or accumulated proline soluble carbohydrates and phenolic compounds in leaf tissues for a rapid osmoregulation and toxicity prevention it is still not clarified if proline accumulation is a stress symptom or an adaptative strategy however this small amino acid has multiple roles in fact it can not only act as an osmolyte but is able to detoxify ros buffer cellular redox potential protect and stabilize macromolecules and membranes elicit the expression of stress responsive genes presenting proline responsive elements e g pre actcat woodrow et al 2017 ahmad et al 2019 also the nature of carbohydrate accumulation under stress is still debated in fact it is not clear if under drought they are synthetized as stress protectants or if the reduction of plant growth preceding the decrease of photosynthesis determines accumulation of recent photosynthates sperdouli and moustakas 2012 in any case they can contribute to scavenge ros function as osmolytes balancing the decrease in water potential during cellular dehydration detoxify ros and protect macromolecules dawood and el awadi 2015 the strong accumulation of soluble sugars in kiwifruit actinidia chinensis under drought resulted in cellular osmotic adjustments and a decline of cell injury liang et al 2019 moreover phenolic compounds have a great potential to scavenge ros and protect proteins ad membranes avoiding cell damage complementing the role played by the enzymatic antioxidant system hatier and gould 2008 agati and tattini 2010 kapoor et al 2020 however the synthesis of these protective metabolites has a very high cost in terms of energy consumption 50 70 moles atp for mole cuin et al 2009 highly impacting the ability of plants to grow in addition while proline and sugars after being synthesized and or accumulated under drought stress can be rapidly broken down to provide energy carbon and nitrogen to recover and repair stress induced damages hare and cress 1997 carillo et al 2008 phenolic compounds are less ductile representing long term investment molecules that cannot be easily recycled for sustaining plant metabolism upon relief of stress karabourniotis et al 2014 conversely mel application improved growth parameters in olive trees grown under drought stress notwithstanding the energy spent for the synthesis or accumulation of osmolytes proline decreased remaining still much higher than controls while carbohydrates increased and enzymatic pod and apx and non enzymatic phenolic compounds ros scavengers mel has been found able to increase leaf turgor under water deficit ibrahim et al 2020 mel ameliorated the stomatal functions under drought stress exerting a positive effect on their regulation ahmad et al 2019 improving the efficiency of psii and of the entire photosynthesis zuo et al 2017 and increasing carbon assimilation efficiency xu et al 2016 xu et al 2019 showed that exogenous mel was able to enhance the activity of γ aminobutyric acid gaba shunt and in particular of gaba transaminase gaba t being this latter the main degradative enzyme for gaba the increase of its activity indirectly implied that also gaba synthesis was activated to supply substrate for gaba t renault et al 2010 interestingly gaba and proline are usually accumulated together in response to water stress and or salinity li et al 2016b woodrow et al 2017 dell aversana et al 2021 gaba synthesis is a proton consuming reaction that enables the stationary control of ph buffering the cytosolic acidosis induced by stress kinnersley and turano 2000 gaba as zwitterion may function as osmolyte renault et al 2010 and ros scavenger against superoxide anion radicals singlet oxygen and hydrogen liu et al 2011 gaba shunt is able to supply succinate to calvin cycle and or nadh to the mitochondrial electron transport chain under stress conditions in which respiration is impaired and ros production increased bouché et al 2003 however carillo 2018 also suggested that the synthesis of gaba by glutamate decarboxylase gad could be not only responsible for the dissipation of protons but also for the release co2 while stomata are closed or partially open this could enable the calvin cycle to properly work decreasing the pressure on photosynthetic electron chain and therefore photo oxidation and indirectly ros production even under drought stress therefore mel could safeguard the photosynthetic apparatus against the degradable effects of water shortage ameliorating the photosynthetic efficiency of plant trees liang et al 2018 4 5 antioxidant enzymes activity and mda the drought stress related impairment of photosynthesis could be responsible for the imbalance between excessive generation of reactive oxygen species ros and scavenging reddy et al 2004 hussain et al 2018 notwithstanding the increase of enzymatic cat and pox antioxidant activities probably the increase of ros indirectly determined an enhancement of mda content in leaves of the olive cultivars mda is an indicator of lipid peroxidation and cell damage correlated with hydrogen peroxide accumulation as also recently demonstrated in apple cultivars under drought stress mihaljević et al 2021 the drought dependent osmotic and oxidative stresses caused cellular perturbations responsible for the activation of a wide spectrum of changes in both primary and secondary metabolism to minimize oxidative stress damages and reactivate photosynthesis and growth kapoor et al 2020 mel triggered an improvement of ros scavenging efficiency by increasing molecules in particular phenolic compounds and enzyme cat and pox activities contributing to decrease ros accumulation and protect plants from the disadvantageous effects of drought stress induced oxidative stress cui et al 2017 accordingly soybean plants treated with mel showed substantial increases in the activity of cat and pod imran et al 2021 molecular studies on mel treated drought stressed plants revealed a decline of abscisic acid aba accumulation accompanied by a reduction of ros levels the decline of aba contents was attributed to the mel role in the down regulation of genes involved in aba biosynthesis and the up regulation of genes participating in aba catabolism li et al 2015 in kiwifruit exogenous mel decreased the membrane injury by lowering mda contents liang et al 2019 under water shortage the amounts of mda and el were reduced in mel treated creeping bentgrass agrostis stolonifera plants ma et al 2018 this effect was attributed to the increased antioxidant enzyme activities able to efficiently scavenge excessive ros dawood and el awadi 2015 thus also causing a reduction of mda li et al 2019 accordingly exogenous mel enhanced the accumulation of phenolic compounds in chinese hickory carya cathayensis plants under water shortage sharma et al 2020 contributing to decrease the oxidative damage in drought stressed plants in particular mel treatment is able to upregulate the expression of key player genes like phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal from the phenylpropanoid pathway and genes participating in the ethylene signaling pathway such as erf1 directly or indirectly regulating a more efficient transport of phenolic compounds in the vacuole sharma et al 2020 di matteo et al 2013 this suggested that mel could be implicated in mechanisms able to detoxify ros or reduce their production in plant cells in fact mda strongly decreased thus preserving photosystems which were able to sustain the growth of vegetative tissues and fruit yield also under drought stress 4 6 crop water productivity drought stress caused a decline in water potential in plants and mel triggered the synthesis of compatible solutes such as soluble sugars essential for osmotic adjustment under drought conditions and maintenance of rwc accordingly mel treatment increased rwc in dracocephalum moldavica kabiri et al 2018 and apple trees liang et al 2018 under drought moreover li et al 2015 found that mel reduced el during drought period compared to untreated plants the osmolytes synthetized accumulated under mel and drought treatments decreasing root water potential improved water and mineral uptake through roots and promoted stomatal aperture and co2 absorption through leaves and plants can consume available water more efficient campos et al 2019 finally it is important to highlight that mel treatment increased oil content in both cultivars of drought stressed olive trees in chickpea plants 500 µm mel led to a significant increase in oil content approximately 44 compared to control due to the over expression of genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids el awadi et al 2017 sadak et al 2020 also proved that mel sprayed shrub plants moringa oleifera l underwent an increase of biomass and yield parameters thank to the protective activity exerted by mel on photosynthetic pigments under drought conditions mel100 µm applied to moringa oleifera l plants enhanced leaf yield by enhancing the antioxidant enzymes activities and decreasing the lipid peroxidation under drought stress sadak et al 2020 this promising effect might be attributed to the synergistic role of mel and auxin in the development of crop plants debnath et al 2019 5 conclusion several morphological changes and key physiological processes seems participating in the drought stress tolerance promoted by mel foliar spraying the obtained results highlighted the role of mel in the enhancement of antioxidant mechanisms and scavenging of ros as well as the enhancement of chls content and therefore photosynthesis mineral homeostasis control of water loss increase of fruit yield and oil content in trees subjected to drought stress in particular it was evident that notwithstanding scv showed higher cat and pod activities and carbohydrates content and bigger fruits while rcv accumulated more chls phenolics k and showed better fruit and oil yield in mel treated water stressed olive trees drought stress and mel treatments were more important determinants than cultivars themselves therefore the obtained knowledge provided evidence that mel is an eco friendly and inexpensive small bioactive molecule able to improve olive cultivar s yield and growth parameters even under severe drought stress conditions declaration of competing interest the

serious threats and melatonin mel as a versatile signaling biomolecule can play a crucial role in morphological and physiological modifications of plants able to enhance drought stress tolerance in this view the current research aimed at elucidating the potential beneficial role of exogenous foliar application of mel 0 and 100 µm to sevillana and roughani olive cultivars under different water stress levels 100 75 and 50 et in particular the morphological physiological and biochemical changes occurring in leaves treated with or without mel and the quality of fruits and oil were discussed a decrease of electrolyte leakage el and malondialdehyde mda content as well as an increase of relative water content rwc in mel sprayed leaves of drought stress trees were observed the application of mel was also associated with higher k to na ratio ca2 content phenolic and soluble carbohydrates contents and a lower decline chlorophyll chl levels mel treated leaves also showed higher catalase cat and peroxidase pod activities responsible for scavenging reactive oxygen species ros generated during drought stress in a severity dependent manner mel foliar application enhanced the oil content and yield in the olive fruits in both cultivars compared to the untreated ones since mel was also able to exert a beneficial effect on both sevillana and roughani cultivar trees by improving their crop

semi arid regions worldwide naeem et al 2018 it is expected to significantly increase by the end of 21st century threatening food security and escalating human migrations and conflicts sun et al 2020 at low drought plants do not noticeably modify their growth pattern while slightly increase their root biomass ma et al 2020 on the contrary moderate or severe drought triggers a broad range of morphological and physiological damages to plants among which stomatal closure reduction of transpiration and photosynthetic rate and decrease of wue cui et al 2017 kumawat and sharma 2018 rahman et al 2020 sun et al 2020 moreover the accumulation of salts in soil upper layers caused by water scarcity further reduces the ability of plants to extract water and nutrient from soil causing a nutrient deficiency in particular of k and ca2 and a decrease of cell turgor pressure ma et al 2020 ahmad et al 2018 plants greatly suffer from mineral shortcoming due to scarce soil nutrient accessibility lower absorption from the soil through their roots and weaker mobilization of mineral elements within the plant itself hosseini et al 2021 in these conditions roots start draining resources from leaves synthetizing compatible osmolytes to avoid dehydration lowering water potential for being able to uptake water and ions and modifying their architecture to explore larger soil portions to access deeper water reservoirs vadez 2014 if the water stress conditions persist the roots shrink and the disturbance of mineral and water balance perturbs redox homeostasis and induce the overproduction of reactive oxygen species ros which further contribute to lipid peroxidation and disturbance of membrane and protein functions naeem et al 2018 liang et al 2019 takahashi et al 2020 in particular this latter condition impairs light harvesting processes photosynthetic electron transport rate and photochemical efficiency of psii determining photosynthetic disfunction and leaf senescence with a strong negative effect on developmental processes plant growth and yield wei et al 2014 fathi and tari 2016 kamran et al 2018 el kelish et al 2020 to cope with the damageable repercussions of drought and protect the cells from ros toxicity plants enact various strategies indeed they have evolved an inbuilt antioxidant system which includes plant s non enzymatic e g antioxidant metabolites and enzymatic e g catalase and superoxide dismutase antioxidants which work simultaneously in a systematic manner to stabilize membranes and proteins scavenge ros and buffer cellular redox potential in plants carillo 2018 soares et al 2019 in particular secondary metabolites including phenolic compounds have a great antioxidant potentials thus contributing to contrast oxidative stress hosseini et al 2021 moreover the synthesis of small molecules 500 da among which nitrogen containing compounds such as amino acids amines and betaines or sugars may play a beneficial role by contributing to the regulate cellular osmotic adjustment detoxify ros protect membrane integrity stabilize stomatal conductance in addition to enhance co2 intake through leaves and water absorption via roots dawood and el awadi 2015 carillo 2018 carillo et al 2019 besides the exploitation of plant tolerant cultivars some applicative and agronomic strategies have also been adopted to minimize or even overcome the deleterious impact of drought stress and improve the plant s adaptability one of the most innovative strategies is the application of biologically active small molecules of natural or synthetic origin that can be applied exogenously at very low concentrations and relieve or protect plants from unfavorable environmental conditions kamran et al 2018 these multifunctional molecules confer tolerance to plants growing under abiotic stresses including high or low temperature heavy metals drought salinity and pesticides sharma et al 2018 carillo et al 2019 several studies have highlighted that melatonin n acetyl 5 methoxytryptamine mel a small natural indoleamine compound of 232 da functioning as circadian mediator antioxidant and immune modulator in animals reiter et al 2018 has been reported as a promising tool for the control of drought stress ahmad et al 2019 bidabadi et al 2020 liang et al 2019 demonstrated that the application of exogenous mel to malus domestica borkh mitigated the inhibitory effects of drought on stomatal apertures relative water content chlorophyll levels and photosynthesis decreasing ros accumulation and electrolyte

photosynthesis and growth in kiwifruit seedlings liang et al 2019 under drought mel treated maize seedlings under drought stress showed thicker and taller stems lower mda contents and higher stomatal conductance net photosynthetic rate and leaf rwc than untreated ones ahmad et al 2019 mel modulated redox homeostasis and synthesis of polyamine and nitric in heat stressed tomato seedlings jahan et al 2019 several reports indicate that mel application in numerous crops enhances their tolerance by protecting the photosynthetic apparatus increasing their antioxidant capability and improving the water holding capacity fleta soriano et al 2017 it has been proven that the usage of a proper concentration of mel on sour orange citrus aurantium l seedlings and rapeseed brassica napus l subjected to abiotic stresses significantly increased the concentrations of osmoprotectants zeng et al 2018 tomato plants supplied with 200 µm mel showed an accumulation of phenolic compounds under water deficit karaca and cekic 2019 in tea plants 100 μm mel were able to scavenge ros decrease mda and enhance the tolerance to drought cold and salt stresses while amplifying antioxidant activity and stabilizing photosynthetic efficiency li et al 2018 mel was also proven able to reduce oxidative stress mda content and membrane injury in kiwifruit liang et al 2019 and el and h2o2 content in apple liang et al 2018 under drought stress olive olea eruopea l a precious plant due to its oil nutritional value is broadly cultivated worldwide including iran nejadrezaei et al 2018 however notwithstanding olive plants are known as highly tolerant to water deficit scenarios their remarkable productive characteristics can be highly affected under prolonged drought gholami and zahedi 2019 olive genotypes show different levels of tolerance against water deficit conditions therefore it is essential to design new agronomic strategies to improve olive cultivation in arid and semi arid regions under fluctuating water conditions bianco and scalisi 2017 despite the numerous studies on mel effects on plants under abiotic stresses its mechanisms of action are still not fully elucidated and require a more in depth investigation thus this study is focused on studying the potential beneficial role of exogenous mel 0 and 100 µm on morphological physiological and biochemical changes in sevillana and roughani olive cultivars under different water stress levels 100 75 and 50 et the results obtained will be easily translated in field in order to design new agronomic strategies to enhance drought tolerance in olive genotypes and improve oil production even under stress conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site drought imposition and mel application in the present

procedures of i o o c 2002 protocol the fresh fruits with their pits were dried 70 ºc for 48 h two grams of flesh were charged to the soxhlet extractor with 250 ml diethyl ether for 5 h then transferred and dried in an oven at 70 ºc for 2 h the difference between the 2 obtained dried samples is the oil content dw to calculate the oil content expressed as fw the oil content dw should be multiplied by the fruit dry matter percentage 2 8 yield parameters oil and fruit yield was obtained by the total amount of produced oil fw and fruit in one hectare respectively sepaskhah et al 2006 2

rouphael et al 2020 the loading plot and score plot of all analyzed parameters were determined after principal component analysis pca by using minitab 18 statistical software minitab llc state college pa usa ciarmiello et al 2015 3 results 3 1 morphological parameters and oil yield with respect to the biometric variables roughani cultivar rcv showed significant p 0 01 higher fruit diameter table 1 and fruit dry matter fresh pit weight pit length table 2 and superior productivity for oil content fw and dw and oil yield table 3 compared to sevillana cultivar scv whereas significant higher pulp percent p 0 05 table 2 and fruit yield p 0 01 table 3 were observed in scv compared to rcv all drought stressed olive trees displayed obvious retardation in growth parameters in a level dependent manner and the highest growth inhibition was observed in the severe drought stress in fact drought treatments 75et and 50et determined a significant p 0 01 and remarkable reduction of all the morphological parameters tables 1 and 2 fig 1 also in dependence of the severity of stress except for fruit dry matter and pulp percent table 2 irrespective of mel treatment cv x et severe drought 50et significantly decreased p 0 05 shoot growth fruit weight fruit diameter table 1 pit length pit diameter table 2 and fruit yield table 3 in both cultivars mel100 treatment significantly enhanced all growth parameters of olive trees compared to mel0 except for fresh pulp weight table 1 pit diameter and pulp percent table 2 the positive effect of mel100 was particularly evident on oil content fw and dw fruit yield and oil yield table 3 irrespective of drought treatment cv x mel mel positively affected shoot growth shoot diameter fruit length dry pulp weight table 1 fruit dry matter fresh pit weight pulp pit weight table 2 oil content fw and dw and oil yield table 3 in both cultivars all morphological parameters were significantly influenced by cultivar x drought x mel treatment tables 1 2 and 3 cv x mel x et interaction was significant for morphological parameters drought stress triggered a severity dependent decline of these traits tables 1 and 2 indicated a remarkable decrease from 100et to 50et and the use of mel significantly alleviated this detrimental effect on morphological traits in both cultivars cv x mel x et was also significant for oil yield mel treatment mitigated the adverse repercussions of drought on oil yield compared to respective non mel treated olive cultivars table 3 3 2 photosynthetic pigments chlorophylls a and b content of leaves of olive trees was significantly affected by drought stress and mel treatments and by the interaction among cv x mel et x mel and cv x et x mel table 4 whereas chl a b was only affected by drought and mel treatment table 4 in particular severe drought significantly p 0 01 reduced by 56 the content of chl a b compared to respective control table 4 mel treated olive trees exhibited higher levels of photosynthetic pigments independently of drought treatment although mel application was considerably more effective under severe drought table 4 cv x mel x et interaction was significant for chl a and chl b chl b showed a tendency to decrease in a drought severity dependent manner mel treatment was able to alleviate the negative effects of drought stress on this trait compared to the respective mel untreated olive trees and in particular on scv induced an increase of this parameter in comparison with rcv table 4 3 3 leaf macronutrients concentrations the type of cultivar as factor significantly affected the content of k higher in scv and na higher in rcv but not ca2 content table 5 drought stress significantly increased na contents while decreased those of k and ca2 in a severity dependent manner table 5 for instance severe drought enhanced the amounts of na by 59 and 80 in scv and rcv as compared to respective control conditions whereas it decreased the levels of k by 33 and 20 5 and ca2 by 42 and 39 in scv and rcv leaves compared to respective non stressed ones mel foliar spray significantly increased the leaf amounts of ca2 and k while reducing that of na table 5 the concentrations of ca2 was not influenced by cv x mel but it was affected by all the other considered interactions while k and na were oppositely affected by the three considered parameters cv et and mel and their interactions table 5 cv x mel x et interaction was significant concerning macronutrients for instance k and ca2 decreased under drought stress while na increased in a severity dependent manner from 100et to 50et macronutrients underwent a positive effect when treated with mel and in particular scv accumulated higher amounts of beneficial nutrients in particular k while na content decreased as shown in table 5 accordingly the highest value of na was observed in rcv table 5 3 4 osmolytes phenolic contents rwc and el of olive leaves the type of cultivar significantly p 0 01 influenced leaf phenolic contents rwc and el but not proline and total carbohydrates table 6 drought stress triggered a strong severity dependent enhancement of proline total carbohydrate phenolic contents and el while decreased rwc in comparison with respective controls in particular under 75et and 50et there was an increase of proline of 3 7 and 7 1 fold of total carbohydrates of 1 5 and 2 5 fold of phenolic contents of 1 6 and 1 9 fold and of el of 1 5 and 1 8 fold compared with respective controls table 6 all the parameters shown in table 6 were significantly p 0 01 affected by mel treatment but in particular it decreased proline 36 while strongly boosted phenolic contents 158 cv x mel interaction was significant only for phenolics content while cv x et was non significant only for the same parameter table 6 therefore by considering the obtained data the foliar application of mel determined beneficial effects on the biosynthesis and or accumulation of osmolytes under drought and non drought conditions with moderate stress displaying superior results than severe stress cv x mel x et interaction was significant for osmolytes in fact the higher amount of proline was found in scv x 50et x mel0 total carbohydrate in scv x 50et x mel100 and phenolic contents in rcv x 50et x mel100 mel application and drought stress triggered a severity dependent enhancement of osmolytes in both cultivars table 6 obviously drought stress caused a considerable decrease of rwc while mel treatment contributed to enhance it but this contribution was not significant and there was no considerable difference between cultivars additionally el was enhanced significantly in olive trees exposed to drought in a severity dependent manner and mel treatment caused a slight decrease of el table 6 3 5 antioxidant enzymes activity and mda pox antioxidant activity in control leaves was significantly higher 30 p 0 01 in rcv than in scv table 7 drought stress induced a severity dependent increase of mda as well as antioxidant enzymes activity compared with respective controls cat and pox activities in particular were significantly affected by severe drought showing an increase of 3 4 and 2 5 fold in scv and of 3 0 and 3 9 fold in rcv respectively however the cv x et interaction was not significant p 0 05 for mda table 7 foliar treatment of mel alleviated the negative effects of drought in olive trees by improving antioxidative cat and pox activities while reducing mda content and these results were statistically significant as compared with controls however the cv x mel interaction was not statistically significant table 7 cv x mel x et interaction was significant for antioxidant enzymes cat and pox and mda as shown in table 7 drought stress induced a strong severity dependent increase in antioxidant enzymes activity and mel treatment amplified this increase similarly mda increased in olive trees expose to drought but this parameter decreased in mel treated plants table 7 3 6 crop water productivity fruit wpc was higher in scv than in rcv while the opposite happened for oil wpc table 8 drought stress significantly p 0 05 affected wpc in fruits only at 75et while it did not affect oil wpc table 8 application of mel caused a significant p 0 01 increase wpc both in fruit and oil by 1 5 and 3 0 fold respectively compared to controls table 8 these results provided reliable evidence regarding the beneficial impacts of mel on the water balance in olive trees under different conditions cv x mel x et interaction was significant for wpc in fruit and oil in both cultivars scv and rcv mel treated olive trees showed higher wpc in fruit and oil at all irrigation levels table 8 3 7 heat map analysis and principal component analysis pca an aggregated data heat map analysis of all measured parameters was performed to show a visual comparison of the effects determined by the drought stress and mel treatment on the two olive cultivars the dendrogram clustering revealed two main groups i and ii group i on the left was subclustered in group iii aggregating the two cultivars under mel0 x 100et treatments and group iv aggregating on the left rcv mel100 x 75et viii and on the right scv mel100 x 75et scv mel100 x 100et and rcv mel100 x 100et ix group ii on the right was subclustered in group v aggregating the two cultivars under mel0 x 50et treatments and group vi aggregating on the left rcv mel0 x 75et x and on the right scv mel0 x 75et xi scv mel0 x 50et and rcv mel0 x 50et xii fig 2 this indicated that drought stress was the main clustering factor followed by mel treatment it was clearly evident that the treatments mel100 x 100et in both cultivars ix were characterized by the highest fruit and oil yield fruit wpc pulp fresh

applying a principal component analysis pca the first two principal components pcs were related with eigen values higher than 1 and explained 84 5 of the total variance with pc1and pc2 accounting for 61 5 and 23 0 respectively table s5 the evapotranspiration percentage drought stress contributed to the clear separation on pc1 whereas the mel treatment contributed to the separation on pc2 the

hot and dry climate in the spring summer period high rate of evapotranspiration and low rainfalls dell aversana et al 2021 olive trees of these semi arid ecosystems have developed different mechanisms to face drought which involve different strategies and adaptive changes with very high cost in terms of energy consumption that negatively impact on plant vegetative development physiology and reproduction finally decreasing crop yields fahad et al 2017 since the small bioactive molecule melatonin mel has been recently reported as a promising tool for mitigating the negative effects of drought stress ahmad et al 2019 bidabadi et al 2020 in this study the ameliorative morphological physiological and biochemical effects induced by foliar spray of mel0 and 100 µm on two cultivars of twenty years olive plants under different water stress levels 100 75 and 50 et were evaluated the superior iranian local olive oil cultivar called roughani rcv showed in control conditions to have significantly lower fruit yield but much higher oil content than the spanish table olive cultivar known as sevillana scv hajiamiri et al 2010 4 2 photosynthetic pigments this is also proved by the higher content of chlorophylls chl a chl b and chl a b in mel treated olive trees under drought stress water deficit in fact leads to chl degradation due to the high presence of ros that affect the photosynthetic responses by damaging the light harvesting complexes and reaction centers chen et al 2017 mel treatment preserves photosynthetic accessory pigments including carotenoids under drought stress liang et al 2019 hosseini et al 2021 thus mel could contribute to regulate photosynthesis and membrane integrity as well as osmoregulation cellular homeostasis and cell expansion jahan et al 2019 4 3 leaf macronutrients concentrations indeed drought stress caused pleiotropic effects on olive trees which reduced shoot growth and diameter fruit dimension fruit yield and oil yield in both cultivars this could be due to the negative impact of drought on stomatal aperture which decreases transpiration determining nutritional imbalance decrease of ca2 and k na ratio in fact water shortcoming lessens the accessibility to soil nutrient because it causes a significant depletion in water potential that decreases the ability of plants to extract water and minerals from soil and transport them from roots to shoots kheradmand et al 2014 dell aversana et al 2021 in particular in olive plants water deficit reduced k uptake and transport while increased na accumulation in leaves as also observed by qi et al 2019 and hu et al 2013 the drought dependent impact on stomata also decreased the availability of co2 with a consequent reduction of photosynthetic efficiency cui et al 2017 kumawat and sharma 2018 rahman et al 2020 sun et al 2020 mel treatment improved the nutrient imbalance due to the reduced acquisition of minerals like ca2 and k increasing their uptake and transport to leaves while reducing that of na during the drought stress period jahan et al 2019 4 4 osmolytes phenolic contents rwc and el in particular both cultivars under moderate and severe drought synthesized and or accumulated proline soluble carbohydrates and phenolic compounds in leaf tissues for a rapid osmoregulation and toxicity prevention it is still not clarified if proline accumulation is a stress symptom or an adaptative strategy however this small amino acid has multiple roles in fact it can not only act as an osmolyte but is able to detoxify ros buffer cellular redox potential protect and stabilize macromolecules and membranes elicit the expression of stress responsive genes presenting proline responsive elements e g pre actcat woodrow et al 2017 ahmad et al 2019 also the nature of carbohydrate accumulation under stress is still debated in fact it is not clear if under drought they are synthetized as stress protectants or if the reduction of plant growth preceding the decrease of photosynthesis determines accumulation of recent photosynthates sperdouli and moustakas 2012 in any case they can contribute to scavenge ros function as osmolytes balancing the decrease in water potential during cellular dehydration detoxify ros and protect macromolecules dawood and el awadi 2015 the strong accumulation of soluble sugars in kiwifruit actinidia chinensis under drought resulted in cellular osmotic adjustments and a decline of cell injury liang et al 2019 moreover phenolic compounds have a great potential to scavenge ros and protect proteins ad membranes avoiding cell damage complementing the role played by the enzymatic antioxidant system hatier and gould 2008 agati and tattini 2010 kapoor et al 2020 however the synthesis of these protective metabolites has a very high cost in terms of energy consumption 50 70 moles atp for mole cuin et al 2009 highly impacting the ability of plants to grow in addition while proline and sugars after being synthesized and or accumulated under drought stress can be rapidly broken down to provide energy carbon and nitrogen to recover and repair stress induced damages hare and cress 1997 carillo et al 2008 phenolic compounds are less ductile representing long term investment molecules that cannot be easily recycled for sustaining plant metabolism upon relief of stress karabourniotis et al 2014 conversely mel application improved growth parameters in olive trees grown under drought stress notwithstanding the energy spent for the synthesis or accumulation of osmolytes proline decreased remaining still much higher than controls while carbohydrates increased and enzymatic pod and apx and non enzymatic phenolic compounds ros scavengers mel has been found able to increase leaf turgor under water deficit ibrahim et al 2020 mel ameliorated the stomatal functions under drought stress exerting a positive effect on their regulation ahmad et al 2019 improving the efficiency of psii and of the entire photosynthesis zuo et al 2017 and increasing carbon assimilation efficiency xu et al 2016 xu et al 2019 showed that exogenous mel was able to enhance the activity of γ aminobutyric acid gaba shunt and in particular of gaba transaminase gaba t being this latter the main degradative enzyme for gaba the increase of its activity indirectly implied that also gaba synthesis was activated to supply substrate for gaba t renault et al 2010 interestingly gaba and proline are usually accumulated together in response to water stress and or salinity li et al 2016b woodrow et al 2017 dell aversana et al 2021 gaba synthesis is a proton consuming reaction that enables the stationary control of ph buffering the cytosolic acidosis induced by stress kinnersley and turano 2000 gaba as zwitterion may function as osmolyte renault et al 2010 and ros scavenger against superoxide anion radicals singlet oxygen and hydrogen liu et al 2011 gaba shunt is able to supply succinate to calvin cycle and or nadh to the mitochondrial electron transport chain under stress conditions in which respiration is impaired and ros production increased bouché et al 2003 however carillo 2018 also suggested that the synthesis of gaba by glutamate decarboxylase gad could be not only responsible for the dissipation of protons but also for the release co2 while stomata are closed or partially open this could enable the calvin cycle to properly work decreasing the pressure on photosynthetic electron chain and therefore photo oxidation and indirectly ros production even under drought stress therefore mel could safeguard the photosynthetic apparatus against the degradable effects of water shortage ameliorating the photosynthetic efficiency of plant trees liang et al 2018 4 5 antioxidant enzymes activity and mda the drought stress related impairment of photosynthesis could be responsible for the imbalance between excessive generation of reactive oxygen species ros and scavenging reddy et al 2004 hussain et al 2018 notwithstanding the increase of enzymatic cat and pox antioxidant activities probably the increase of ros indirectly determined an enhancement of mda content in leaves of the olive cultivars mda is an indicator of lipid peroxidation and cell damage correlated with hydrogen peroxide accumulation as also recently demonstrated in apple cultivars under drought stress mihaljević et al 2021 the drought dependent osmotic and oxidative stresses caused cellular perturbations responsible for the activation of a wide spectrum of changes in both primary and secondary metabolism to minimize oxidative stress damages and reactivate photosynthesis and growth kapoor et al 2020 mel triggered an improvement of ros scavenging efficiency by increasing molecules in particular phenolic compounds and enzyme cat and pox activities contributing to decrease ros accumulation and protect plants from the disadvantageous effects of drought stress induced oxidative stress cui et al 2017 accordingly soybean plants treated with mel showed substantial increases in the activity of cat and pod imran et al 2021 molecular studies on mel treated drought stressed plants revealed a decline of abscisic acid aba accumulation accompanied by a reduction of ros levels the decline of aba contents was attributed to the mel role in the down regulation of genes involved in aba biosynthesis and the up regulation of genes participating in aba catabolism li et al 2015 in kiwifruit exogenous mel decreased the membrane injury by lowering mda contents liang et al 2019 under water shortage the amounts of mda and el were reduced in mel treated creeping bentgrass agrostis stolonifera plants ma et al 2018 this effect was attributed to the increased antioxidant enzyme activities able to efficiently scavenge excessive ros dawood and el awadi 2015 thus also causing a reduction of mda li et al 2019 accordingly exogenous mel enhanced the accumulation of phenolic compounds in chinese hickory carya cathayensis plants under water shortage sharma et al 2020 contributing to decrease the oxidative damage in drought stressed plants in particular mel treatment is able to upregulate the expression of key player genes like phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal from the phenylpropanoid pathway and genes participating in the ethylene signaling pathway such as erf1 directly or indirectly regulating a more efficient transport of phenolic compounds in the vacuole sharma et al 2020 di matteo et al 2013 this suggested that mel could be implicated in mechanisms able to detoxify ros or reduce their production in plant cells in fact mda strongly decreased thus preserving photosystems which were able to sustain the growth of vegetative tissues and fruit yield also under drought stress 4 6 crop water productivity drought stress caused a decline in water potential in plants and mel triggered the synthesis of compatible solutes such as soluble sugars essential for osmotic adjustment under drought conditions and maintenance of rwc accordingly mel treatment increased rwc in dracocephalum moldavica kabiri et al 2018 and apple trees liang et al 2018 under drought moreover li et al 2015 found that mel reduced el during drought period compared to untreated plants the osmolytes synthetized accumulated under mel and drought treatments decreasing root water potential improved water and mineral uptake through roots and promoted stomatal aperture and co2 absorption through leaves and plants can consume available water more efficient campos et al 2019 finally it is important to highlight that mel treatment increased oil content in both cultivars of drought stressed olive trees in chickpea plants 500 µm mel led to a significant increase in oil content approximately 44 compared to control due to the over expression of genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids el awadi et al 2017 sadak et al 2020 also proved that mel sprayed shrub plants moringa oleifera l underwent an increase of biomass and yield parameters thank to the protective activity exerted by mel on photosynthetic pigments under drought conditions mel100 µm applied to moringa oleifera l plants enhanced leaf yield by enhancing the antioxidant enzymes activities and decreasing the lipid peroxidation under drought stress sadak et al 2020 this promising effect might be attributed to the synergistic role of mel and auxin in the development of crop plants debnath et al 2019 5 conclusion several morphological changes and key physiological processes seems participating in the drought stress tolerance promoted by mel foliar spraying the obtained results highlighted the role of mel in the enhancement of antioxidant mechanisms and scavenging of ros as well as the enhancement of chls content and therefore photosynthesis mineral homeostasis control of water loss increase of fruit yield and oil content in trees subjected to drought stress in particular it was evident that notwithstanding scv showed higher cat and pod activities and carbohydrates content and bigger fruits while rcv accumulated more chls phenolics k and showed better fruit and oil yield in mel treated water stressed olive trees drought stress and mel treatments were more important determinants than cultivars themselves therefore the obtained knowledge provided evidence that mel is an eco friendly and inexpensive small bioactive molecule able to improve olive cultivar s yield and growth parameters even under severe drought stress conditions declaration of competing interest the
