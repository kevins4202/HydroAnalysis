feasible alternatives to produce drinking water seawater desalination is addressed as a latent alternative to solve such an issue when dealing with desalination membrane based technologies such as reverse osmosis membrane distillation pervaporation among others have been successfully proposed pervaporation pv is likely the membrane operation with the less permeation rate but providing high rejection of salts thereby membranologists are extensively working in developing new suitable membranes for pervaporation desalination therefore the goal of this review paper is to elucidate and provide a comprehensive outlook of the most recent works over the last 5 years at developing new concepts of membranes e g ultra thin mixed matrix composite and inorganic for desalination as well as

today one of the main worldwide issues regards to the scarcity of drinking water according to the experts such water scarcity is defined as the lack of enough available water resources to meet the demands of water usage for different purposes such as drinking domestic uses irrigation hydroelectricity production and industrial applications manju and sagar 2017 therefore the scarcity of water could be overcome by approaching the sustainable re use of water together with suitable approaches for treating wastewater which is in fact one of the main developments encouraged by scientists according to the diverse applications over the last 20 years see fig 1 the water shortage can be solved wastewater treatment castro muñoz et al 2018 valorization of agro food by products castro muñoz et al 2020a water treatment ursino et al 2018 seawater treatment among others indeed the treatment of seawater is one of the current worldwide scopes of research when dealing with seawater desalination membrane based technologies are also the primary tools for seawater treatments and desalination fig 1 shows strong evidence about the increasing efforts of the research community in desalinating seawater over the past 20 years displaying an overview of the publication record of using membranes for such a purpose at this point highly selective membrane technologies such as reverse osmosis ro dong et al 2015 misdan et al 2012 membrane distillation md an et al 2017 gontarek et al 2019 and pervaporation pv castro muñoz et al 2020 swenson et al 2012 have been the most explored membrane processes in the field of seawater desalination to date it is likely that ro has been the only established membrane technology for seawater desalination at large scale kim et al 2009 providing high salt rejection and productivity in terms of permeation compared to md however ro requires high energy consumption to reach the high pressures needed 5 5 to 6 8 mpa to overcome the osmotic pressure kaminski et al 2018 even though high permeable ro membranes have been successfully developed the energy consumption still remains as the main challenge since it is the primary contributor to the total cost mazlan et al 2016 hence md and pv have been considered as the other potential and viable alternatives of ro but such technologies cannot commercially compete with ro since the ro provides more permeate fluxes 30 60 kg m 2 h 1 consuming between 2 4 kwh m 3 while pv and md offer less permeation 0 05 15 and 2 30 kg m 2 h 1 respectively than ro using a bit less energy consumption e g 2 and 0 6 1 75 kwh m 3 respectively in this regard pv and md can only compete with ro by reducing the energy cost needed for the phase change of water such energy cost can be minimized by using waste heat from other processes or renewable heat resources fundamentally the overall efficiency of a selected desalination membrane process is influenced by the achievable permeation flux which is concurrently influenced by the membrane material and operating temperature kaminski et al 2018 pv is most probably the membrane technology offering the lowest permeation rate but providing high rejection of salts according to the membrane properties the only possibility of pv technology for its competition in desalination regards to the development of more water permeable membranes it is important to point out that pv has been commercialized within hybrid purification processes for the removal of water from organics castro muñoz et al 2019a van der bruggen and luis 2014 thereby membranologists are still believing and extensively working in developing new membranes with enhanced separation performance for implementing them in pervaporation desalination in 2016 wang and co workers have detailed reviewed the state of the art of pv membranes for desalination providing a compelling comparison of pv technology with conventional ro and md processes wang et al 2016a however there is a need for reviewing the current ongoing development works and advances in the field therefore our goal is to release the latest state of the art last 5 years in developing and fabricating new concepts of pv membranes for desalination applications herein a particular emphasis has been focused on the relevant results and insights moreover different points have been also covered such as the main principles and drawbacks of pv future trends needs and recommendations for new researchers 2 principles of pervaporation pv technology the guidelines for desalination and performance evaluation pervaporation is recognized as a highly selective membrane technique it has proved its ability in separating different types of multicomponent azeotropic mixtures by partial vaporization baker et al 2010 castro munoz et al 2018 according to the needs of desalination hydrophilic membranes are required since they favor the transport i e diffusion of water molecules in vapor state the water transport mechanism through this type of membranes is depicted in fig 2 i the water molecules are firstly absorbed into the selective layer of the membranes based on chemical affinity followed by ii the diffusion of the molecules in the vapor phase water vapor molecules are transported as a result of concentration gradient and finally iii the desorption of the water vapor molecules at the permeate side baker et al 2010 wijmans and baker 1995 when dealing with hydrophilic membranes different types of hydrophilic materials have been used in the preparation of pv membranes towards specific applications as listed in table 1 in practice the pervaporation performance of the membranes has been widely expressed using the separation factor β and the permeate flux j as denoted in eqs 1 and 2 1 j a m a a m t 2 β a b c a c b p e r m e a t e c a c b f e e d both parameters and their calculation can be found elsewhere r castro muñoz et al 2018a santoro et al 2017 it is well known that both parameters evaluate the performance of a membrane based on the operating process conditions including thickness driving force vacuum pressure concentration temperature among others since different studies have been obviously carried out at different conditions to make a fair comparison of the performance between different membranes is quite challenging herein a preferred way of reporting pervaporation results has been established baker et al 2010 which is based on determining the permeance πi of a given compound e g the permeance of a compound a πa in a pv membrane can be calculated as follows 3 j a π a p a f p a p where pa f and pa p correspond to the saturated vapor pressures of component a in feed and permeate side respectively in theory the permeance is a parameter independent from process conditions providing insights into the transport of certain compounds over membrane material regarding the membrane selectivity can be determined as the ratio of the permeances of compound a and b as follows 4 α a b π a π b as a preliminary conclusion from this section the use of highly hydrophilic membranes for water desalination is suggested since they preferentially transport water molecules pv needs membranes with dense structure i e non porous but asymmetric membranes i e porous structure with a dense top layer are also suggested as a potential concept of membranes to raise permeation and maintaining salt rejection also the embedding of inorganic materials with a highly hydrophilic profile such as graphene oxide uio 66 nh2 mil 53 al zeolites and defined transport structure will promote the transport of water 3 latest insights in preparing pervaporation membranes for water desalination 3 1 thin and ultra thin membranes based on the latest findings of wang and coworkers wang et al 2016a most of the pv membranes can reject up to 99 99 of salt solutes which reveal the great potential to produce ultrapure water moreover thin film composite membranes have been identified as the high permeable concept of membranes e g polyvinyl alcohol pva polyacrylonitrile pan composite cellulose sio2 pva zeolite zsm 5 and graphene oxide pan composite membranes offer high permeation rates ranged from 6 7 to 65 kg m 2 h 1 liang et al 2014 wang et al 2016a at this point to maintain such superior permeable properties without compromising the selective properties is in fact the primary challenge of scientists it is likely that the manufacturing of thinner membranes with enhanced hydrophilicity displaying less water transfer resistance is the way to reach the target according to the latest studies in the field see table 2 the polysulfone psf hollow fiber coated with the thinnest pva 100 nm had a permeate flux of 7 4 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 9 salt rejection at 70 c using a feed salt aqueous solution containing 30 000 ppm nacl chaudhri et al 2015 in principle the transport of water across dense hydrophilic membranes is governed by the diffusion of absorbed water castro muñoz et al 2019 however according to chaudhri s report their high permeation rate was due to an asymmetric structure implying a dense pva skin onto porous psf structure in this way the transport through the composite membrane could also be associated with the initial absorption of water in the hydrophilic pva thin layer followed by the diffusion of water through the bottom layer of porous psf chaudhri et al 2015 later the authors developed similar hollow fiber membranes presenting a top active pva and sio2 which possessed a layer thickness of 220nm these membranes demonstrated high permeate fluxes of 20 6 and 10 4 kg m 2 h 1 with 99 9 salt rejection at 70 c from saline feeds of 2000 and 30 000 ppm nacl respectively chaudhri et al 2018 unlike their previous study chaudhri et al 2015 the greater water permeability of the pva sio2 layer compared to the pva layer was related to the greater hydrophilic character and nanoscale homogeneity of the particles interestingly the flux tended to decrease with the increase of salt concentration due to a decrease in water vapor pressure in the feed crosslinked pva top layer and porous pan support were used for the preparation of composite pv membranes liang et al 2018 in this study 4 sulfophthalic acid was employed as a crosslinker in which its sulfonic acid groups functioned as facilitated transport carriers to water molecules xue et al 2019 in practice high water flux of 46 3 kg m 2 h 1 with a salt rejection of 99 8 at 70 c was reached when pervaporating a 35 000 ppm nacl solution importantly water permeance increased 5 3 times when the pva layer thickness decreased 95 times i e from 76 μm to 800 nm according to authors description water permeates through the cross linked pva layer by means of two mechanisms solution diffusion mechanism in which the water dissolves in the surface of the polymer layer and subsequently diffuses through the free volume of the polymer and finally desorbs in the membrane permeate side as a second mechanism tentatively called facilitate transport mechanism ii the water molecules are adsorbed to the sulfonic acid groups on the membrane surface jumping through the close sulfonic acid groups until achieving the other side of the pva polymer membrane liang et al 2018 mauritz and moore 2004 this latest transport mechanism is in agreement with the insights reported by wang et al 2016b who stated that the hydrophilicity water uptake water permeate flux and anti fouling property of the sulfonated poly styrene ethylene butylene styrene block copolymer membrane was remarkably enhanced as a function of sulfonation degree as illustrated in fig 3 it is believed that the increase in sulfonation degree the copolymer membrane displayed a decrease in dispersive but increasing polar components of the surface free energy declaring the enhancement of the polarity of the membrane wang et al 2016b most of the rejection towards various salts such as nacl kcl licl nabr nh4cl cacl2 bacl2 nano3 among others was over 99 and they were over 98 4 independently of the sulfonation degree of the membrane but the membrane with the highest sulfonation degree i e 54 1 displayed the highest water flux of about 22 8 kg m 2 h 1 at 63 c 1 wt nacl in feed solution finally it is important to point out that the crosslinked pva pan membrane designed by liang et al 2018 exhibited attractive permeate fluxes thanks to the great hydrophilicity of both polymers i e pva pan the thickness of the skin layer i e cross linked pva and the type of crosslinkers used i e 4 sulfophthalic acid nevertheless the use of different preparation procedure may allow obtaining similar permeable membranes considering the same pristine material support e g austria et al 2019 reported the preparation of pan asymmetric membranes via diffusion induced phase separation dips which released a permeation rate of 48 0 kg m 2 h 1 and rejections over 99 0 3 5 wt nacl in feed at 60 c among the thinnest membranes prepared for pervaporation desalination are the ones prepared by liu et al 2018 they were able to construct ultrathin membranes in the range of 60 nm based on 2d material like mxene which is a transition metal carbide and or nitrides the ultrathin inorganic membranes designed by liu and co workers revealed impressive water permeate flux of 85 4 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 5 salt rejection 3 5 wt nacl in feed at 65 c this relatively new 2d material discovered in 2011 possesses hydrophilic nature with a negatively charged surface similar to graphene oxide go naguib et al 2011 in theory mxene nanosheets are formed by f c ti o h together with the presence of oh and c o groups which result in the increase of interlayer spacing in the stacked mxene laminates giving molecular transport channels in addition the oxygen containing groups coffer to the mxene and its derivative membranes a hydrophilic profile which is definitely desired for water separation liu et al 2018 apparently membranes based on go having a thickness of 500 nm li et al 2019 have documented to provide half permeate flux 42 4 kg m 2 h 1 99 9 salt rejection in comparison with mxene based membranes however go based membranes are indeed 8 fold thicker than that of mxene surprisingly 30 nm layer membranes can be produced based on maleic acid covalent bridged mxene by means of a facile vacuum assisted filtration method ding et al 2020 in this approach mxenesheets were strongly fixed by the covalent linking formed by the esterification reaction between the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of maleic acid and mxene surface respectively these tailored membranes exhibited a water permeate flux over 70 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 salt rejection 3 5 wt nacl solution at 30 c the authors also proved that the esterification reaction allowed to obtain structural well defined nano channels with a size of ca 0 49nm which in fact were larger than that of the original mxene membrane 0 37nm using the functional groups i e hydroxyl epoxy carbonyl and carboxyl groups of go it is possible to confer a high hydrophilic profile to a polymeric material for instance liang and co workers fabricated thin go films on pan membranes via vacuum filtration assisted assembly method liang et al 2015 the go pan composite membranes with a go layer thickness of 100 nm exhibited high water flux of about 65 1 kg m 2 h 1 and high rejection 99 8 for the desalination of a salt aqueous solution 35 000 ppm nacl at 90 c the authors stated that such membranes can be able to provide high pv performances in treating high salinity water up to 100 000 ppm nacl from liang s study it is important to point out that the extreme water permeation i e 65 1 kg m 2 h 1 of the go pan composite membranes was totally related to the go properties it is well known that go sheets have a d spacing of ca 5 å nair et al 2012 being enough to host a monolayer of water kinetic diameter 2 68 å it has been declared that such empty spaces can form a network of pristine graphene capillaries across go facilitating the water transport even if there is still a lack of knowing the transport mechanism in go sheets some authors have schematically represented the transport of water molecules in go as depicted in fig 4 particularly nair et al have stated that go even when the mixture of water and other components e g gases and liquids was fed the water permeation rate was at least five orders of magnitude higher than that of the other components nair et al 2012 this is supported by the recent findings of castro muñoz and co workers who obtained a 75 enhancement in permeation rate mainly water of crosslinked go pva membranes compared to pristine cross linked pva membranes for ethanol dehydration i e 10 wt water in feed castro muñoz et al 2019a sun et al 2020 fabricated poly vinyl alcohol intercalated go membranes basically go based membranes intercalated and cross linked by pva and subsequently supported on cellulose microfiltration membrane were prepared using a pressure assisted filtration method such a procedure permitted the manufacture of membranes that displayed a thickness from66 to 669 nm depending on the go loading deposition thanks to the proper design of the membranes a high water permeation was obtained up to 98 kg m 2 h 1 at 85 c according to the authors the unimpeded water transport across the membranes was found due to optimal interlayer spacing and microstructure of the go based membranes containing 130 μg cm 2 go by seeking the suitable intercalated pva quantity for cross linking sun et al 2020 however the unprecedented water permeation of pv membranes over 234 kg m 2 h 1 at 75 c corresponds to the ones designed by xue et al 2020 who very recently tailored pva pan nanofiber composite membranes which posssed a thickness of 730 nm such membranes also showed a high salt rejection ca 99 7 when separating a 1 5 wt salt solution in addition to this study meng et al 2020 also reported tremendous water permeation over 143 kg m 2 h 1 at 75 c 3 5 wt nacl in feed solution which was acquired in membranes made of pva layer onto ptfe porous supports herein meng s membranes had a thicker pva layer 2 6 µm compared to xue s study it is likely that this impressive performance can be attributed to the excellent coupling of the hydrophilic pva and hydrophobic ptfe polymers through the used preparation protocol meng et al 2020 3 2 inorganic membranes nowadays inorganic membranes are the type of barriers that display high separation performance good chemical and thermal stability and importantly low fouling issues their impressive separation performance is due to the rigid structure of ceramics and their defined pore size providing superior ability in terms of molecular size and shape castro muñoz and fíla 2018 wang et al 2016a this characteristic confers to these membranes high salt rejection and mass transfer when dealing with the development of inorganic based pervaporation membranes for desalination purposes the membranes must possess small pore size e g mesoporous cobalt oxide silica membranes have successfully fabricated via a dual acid base catalyzed sol gel and interlayer free approach varying the cobalt addition between 0 35 mol elma et al 2015b in particular the membranes containing the highest amount of tricobalt tetroxide i e 35 mol displayed a highly mesoporous structure releasing water fluxes of 20 11 3 and 7 7 kg m 2 h 1 in treating salt solutions of 0 3 3 5 and 7 5 wt nacl at 60 c respectively together with salt rejection over 99 7 see table 3 the authors declared that this a result of the high pore volume mesopores formation and structural robustness of the silica network given by the presence of tricobalt tetroxide concurrently elma and co worked prepared carbonized template silica membranes by means of catalyzed sol gel method and subsequently used for desalinating different aqueous solutions elma et al 2015a e g high water fluxes together with high salt rejections over 99 5 were determined up to 8 5 and 6 6 kg m 2 h 1 at 60 c for salt solutions containing 0 3 and 7 5 wt nacl respectively interestingly the microporosity of the carbonized silica was responsible for an effective molecular sieving separation of water kinetic diameter of 2 6 å and hydrated salt ions of na 7 2 å and cl 6 6 å on the other hand the high pore volume by the mesoporosity allowed to the membranes to provide such high water fluxes at the end of this study the authors also documented that such inorganic membranes were stable over 250 h testing it is important to mention that inorganic membranes based on zeolite clinoptilolite phosphate can release comparable desalination performance since water flux of 15 kg m 2 h 1 and around 95 removal of na initial feed solution containing 1400 ppm na at 95 c has been reported an et al 2014 such ability of zeolite membranes e g naa zeolite has been recognized due to a joint size exclusion charge exclusion surface evaporation mechanism cho et al 2011 table 4 less permeable inorganic membranes in the range of 1 2 6 kg m 2 h 1 compared to previous reports sing et al reported the synthesis of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide silica membranes with excellent high salt rejection efficiency of 99 9 desalinating a solution containing 40 000 ppm nacl at 25 c singh et al 2015 starting from ethyl silicate es40 as a silica precursor wang et al 2016 prepared interlayer free silica membranes via rapid thermal processing rtp protocol at 630 c the membranes fabricated at ph 4 were found as the best for the desalination of synthetic seawater 3 5 wt nacl showing water fluxes of 17 8 kg m 2 h 1 and salt rejection over 99 at 60 c compared to wang s findings xu et al 2016 synthesized ethenylene bridged organosilica membranes providing a flux of 14 2 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 6 salt rejection at 70 c this favored water transport through this type of membranes was attributed to the addition of polarizable and rigid ethenylene bridges in the silica networks interestingly authors considered that the polar c c and si oh groups are present in plentiful amounts in the bis triethoxysilyl ethane derived silica networks in which the water molecules can primarily adsorb onto these hydrophilic elements of the networks by means of hydrogen bonding or dipole dipole interactions xu et al 2016 more recently la y codoped microporous organosilica membranes were fabricated and then proposed for desalination giving similar separation performance ca 10 3 kg m 2 h 1 salt rejection of 100 at 25 c but good stability for 200 h without any significant changes in performance zhang et al 2019 with higher permeate fluxes around 26 5 l m 2 h 1 yang and co workers also developed interlayer free hybrid carbon silica membranes for the desalination of 1 wt nacl solution at 60 c displaying acceptable salt rejection 99 5 yang et al 2017 different inorganic material like titanium dioxide tio2 was employed to prepare thin films 400 nm yacou et al 2015 herein the thin layers dip coated on commercial α al2o3 tubes were synthesized from titanium propoxide and exposed to a gentle thermal treatment to control particle and pore sizes dp 4 nm the tio2 membranes were subsequently tested for desalination three different types of solutions such as brackish 0 3 wt nacl in feed seawater 3 5 wt and brine concentrations 7 5 and 10 wt water fluxes in the range of 10 5 kg m 2 h 1 at 75 c were obtained for brackish concentrations whereas fluxes of 4 0 and 6 0 kg m 2 h 1 were reached at the highest brine concentration 10 wt such membranes also demonstrated high salt rejection 99 ability proving a stable performance for long term operation over 350 h yacou et al 2015 today specific inorganic materials have been identified for their impressive properties in solvent separations e g graphene as the most representative 2d material possesses excellent electrical mechanical and thermal properties due to its unique one atom thick structure graphene and its derivatives e g graphene oxide have become promising nano building blocks for membrane based separations and tuning the membrane properties liu et al 2015 in particular graphene oxide go displays the most suitable properties when dealing with water separation cha umpong et al 2020 go sheets are highly oxygenated possessing hydroxyl and epoxy functional groups on their basal planes in addition to this carbonyl and carboxyl groups are also located at the sheet edges singh et al 2011 however it is likely that the go stability depends on its coated layer and the chemistry of the support substrate in order to overcome this drawback xu et al 2016 employed such abundant oxygen groups of go for reacting with the amine groups of polydopamine pda and thus bind go nanosheets onto α al2o3support see fig 5 a the resulting membranes showed water permeate flux of about 48 4 kg m 2 h 1 and high ion salt rejection over 99 7 at 90 c similarly the research group also used 1 4 phenylene diisocyanate pdi as a cross linker for covalent modification of go feng et al 2016 in this way a three dimensional graphene oxide framework gof was obtained which was similarly attached to α al2o3tubesupport via using vacuum filtration as represented in fig 5b the gof membranes having 18 μm thickness provided high water flux is 11 4 kg m 2 h 1 and ion rejection of about 99 9 at 90 c for desalination of 3 5 wt seawater unfortunately this membrane concept did not offer competent permeation rates than that of go nanosheets onto α al2o3support 48 4 kg m 2 h 1 at 90 c xu et al 2016 higher permeation fluxes in gof based membranes can be acquired when using a different type of cross linker such as 1 4 cyclohyxanediamine cda qian et al 2018 due to the enhancement of d spacing and surface hydrophilicity after cda modification the gof based membrane was able to provide a high permeation rate e g 20 1 kg m 2 h 1 together with high ion rejection of 99 9 by using an aliphatic terminal diamine like 1 4 diaminobutane qian et al 2019 tuned the interlayer spacing of go and placed on the pda modified α al2o3 supports in which after testing in pv desalination 3 5 wt 90 c had similar performance water flux of 19 7 kg m 2 h 1 and ion rejection of 99 9 compared to the previous study qian et al 2018 interestingly these membranes were able to provide stable performance over 168 h high desalination performance can also be obtained using carbon molecular sieves cms according to the report provided by song et al 2016 mixed matrix cms and alumina membranes can provide water fluxes of up to 25 kg m 2 h 1 for seawater desalination 3 5 wt salt concentration at 75 c especially such membranes did not show any variation on the permeate flux when the salt concentration was raised from 0 3 1 and 3 5 wt at this point the authors declared that the concentration polarization was not significant and no variation on permeate flux could be related to the carbon structure which confers hydrophobicity contrary to hydrophilic inorganic membranes song et al 2016 on the other hand the salt rejection varied in the range of 93 99 depending on the operating temperature and salt concentration when dealing either with the fabrication of inorganic or mixed matrix membranes the use of a new class of porous materials such as metal organic frameworks mofs is also a current trend in the field of efficient membranes for desalination mofs composition can be found elsewhere cohen 2010 rangnekar et al 2015 shekhah et al 2018 typically a mof implies a porous and crystalline material comprised of inorganic secondary building units connected by organic ligands denny et al 2016 in desalination applications hydrophilic mofs such as uio 66 mil 101 cr hkust 1 are preferentially suggested for the transport of water castro munoz et al 2018 however some authors have proposed hydrophobic mofs like zeolitic imidazolate framework zif 8 on pda modified α al2o3 zhu et al 2016 in pervaporation desalination displaying the highest water flux ca 13 5 kg m 2 h 1 with 99 8 salt rejection at 100 c 3 5 wt nacl in feed zhu et al 2016 zif 8 has demonstrated great thermal and hydrothermal stability which has been proven over 7 days in the case of hydrophilic mofs the presence of polar sites is associated with the metal oxygen clusters and very non polar regions due to the organic and aromatic linkers basically water molecules easily adsorb on the hydrophilic centers in addition to this water molecules are bound by hydrogen bridges to these water nucleation sites producing small water clusters küsgens et al 2009 based on this water transport mechanism some research has been done aiming at the seawater desalination for example the amino functionalization of the hydrophilic uio 66 was performed by wan et al 2017 afterward 3 aminopropy ltriethoxysilane aptes was employed as a molecular linker for attaching the metal ions onto the α al2o3 support surface and thus carry out the nucleation and crystallization of the mof the resulting uio 66 nh2 membranes exhibited acceptable desalination performance e g the water fluxes increased from 1 5 to 12 1 kg m 2 h 1 when the temperature increased from 45 to 90 c maintaining minimal variation in the ions rejections over 99 7 for 120 h operating time wan et al 2017 thanks to the defined microporous structure of the mof with narrow pores size in the range of 0 52 0 02 nm which is ranged between the size of water molecules 0 26 nm and different type of hydrated ions such as na 0 72 nm k 0 66 nm ca2 0 82 nm mg2 0 86 nm cl 0 66 nm volkov et al 1997 high ion rejection values were expected by the mof based membranes 3 3 mixed matrix membranes one of the emerging concepts in tailoring membranes with superior performance is the mixed matrix membrane mmm by fabricating a compelling mmm the strengths of inorganic materials and polymeric ones are merged to obtain new membranes with a synergistic separation performance castro muñoz et al 2020 castro muñoz et al 2020 in fact these membranes are recognized as the next generation of membranes as elsewhere a typical mmm is generally prepared by smartly embedding any inorganic material such as metal organic frameworks zeolites silica graphene based materials among others into a polymeric matrix such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity polyimides cellulose acetate while the deposition of inorganic materials on the polymer matrix can be named as a composite membrane ursino et al 2018 the incorporation and dispersion of go into a polyimide has been performed by several authors feng et al 2017 huang and feng 2018 these generated mmms exhibited water permeate fluxes of 36 1 kg m 2 h 1 feng et al 2017 and 15 6 kg m 2 h 1 huang and feng 2018 with a salt rejection of 99 9 when separating a salt solution 3 5 wt at 90 c in fact these membranes showed similar rejection values in comparison with go pan composites liang et al 2015 however the water fluxes of the go polyimide mmms were greatly lower than the go pan composites but stable over 120 h operating time in a different approach the great pervaporation of go based mixed matrix membranes has been proven by other scientists for instance cheng et al 2017 exfoliated hydrophilic go nanosheets and subsequently deposited onto the pan nanofibrous support through crosslinked pva via vacuum filtration in this way the hydrophilic pva chains were acting as spacing bridges to guarantee the attaching of go via glutaraldehyde fig 6 illustrates the ultrathin composite ca 120 nm membranes smartly designed by cheng and co workers who reported permeate flux of 69 1 kg m 2 h 1 and relatively stable high rejection of about 99 9 during an operating time of 24 h 35 g l 1 nacl in feed at 70 c zhang et al 2018 formulated new composite pva pervaporation membranes in this study pyromellitic dianhydride pmda was proposed as a crosslinker in the manufacturing of cross linked pva coated pan membranes by using the solution casting protocol 2 µm thick pva selective layers were made and later tested for desalination of nacl solution 35 000 ppm 70 c the generated membranes revealed comparable performance e g permeate flux of 32 2 kg m 2 h 1 and nacl rejection of 99 9 compared to some cross linked pva filled with go membranes between 28 36 1 kg m 2 h 1 feng et al 2017 li et al 2017a similar to zhang s study li et al 2018 prepared cross linked pva layers using 4 sulfonylphthalic acid as a chemical cross linker such membranes exhibited impressive permeate fluxes and salt rejection of about 60 8 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 8 at 70 c respectively a composite cross linked pva onto pan support was carried out by zhang et al 2019 in this development sulfosuccinic acid was employed as a chemical cross linker which reduced the hydrophilic nature of the pva polymer due to the use of its oh groups despite this issue the membranes displayed better swelling resistance and thermal stability also the membranes demonstrated acceptable water permeation flux 27 9 kg m 2 h 1 and salt rejection 99 8 at 70 c 35 000 ppm nacl in feed where the permeation was the only affected decreased up to 11 2 kg m 2 h 1 when increasing the salt concentration of up to 100 000 ppm nacl considering a different type of filling inorganic material mofs have been also widely employed in the synthesis of mmms e g liang et al 2018 created membranes based on mil 53 al and cross linked pva which were then dip coated into pvdf hollow fiber after testing towards desalination 100 g l 1 at 80 c the composite membranes containing 30 wt mof loading displayed salt rejection as high as 99 9 while their permeate fluxes were initially in the order of 19 kg m 2 h 1 according to the authors the membranes also expressed good long term stability and suitable antifouling properties as a current trend in the field biopolymer based membranes have today emerged as promising materials in replacing the synthetic polymers castro muñoz and gonzález valdez 2019 achieving the appearance of preparing environmentally friendly membranes in this framework chitosan cs seems to be a candidate material for desalination applications since it displays a highly hydrophilic nature suitable for the transport of water molecules castro muñoz et al 2020 cs has been recently filled with go by qian et al 2018 who declared good interaction between both inorganic and organic phases as represented in fig 7 after the evaluation in desalination of such resulting biopolymer mmms filled with 1 wt go the authors confirmed excellent separation ability translated to high permeate flux and salt rejection of about 30 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 9 respectively during the desalination of 5 wt aqueous nacl solution at 81 c it is important to point out that e nacl diffusion coefficient in the mmms was lower than that of water by two orders of magnitude allowing high selectivity of the membranes x qian et al 2018 diverse class of filling materials such as nanoclays into mmms have also been studied for pervaporation desalination selim et al 2019 2020 especially lapolite is also found among nanoclays category including clinoptilolite montmorillonite bentonite laponite is recognized as a highly hydrophilic nano sized material which possesses a layered structure with 30 nm diameter and 1 nm in thickness selim et al 2019 evaluated for the first time the influence of laponite into cross linked pva by embedding only 2 wt of the material the highest water flux was obtained in the range of 58 6 kg m 2 h 1 and a salt rejection over 99 9 3 wt nacl in feed at 70 c as stated by the authors the contribution of low loading of laponite made the membranes rougher and more hydrophilic which could enhance the adsorption of water molecules onto the membrane surface very recently the same hybrid membranes filled with 7 wt laponite confirmed their interesting performance in pervaporative desalination of brine solutions at 40 c 100 000 ppm nacl which was about 31 2 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 9 for water permeation and salt rejection respectively selim et al 2020 4 commercial status of pv membranes and their bottlenecks the industry is more and more looking at membrane processes with greater attention including pv as a green technology at the end of the 90 s prof néel the pioneer of the pv performed a global analysis on pv systems reporting about 90 of pv units were commercialized by gft néel 1997 today deltamem ag company previously known as sulzer chemtech castro munoz et al 2018 has the largest installed pv plants worldwide it is known that most of the units are implemented to the dehydration of organic solvents jonquières et al 2002 the membranes used in these applications are generally composed of pva active selective layer supported on a porous pan support scott 1995 most of these commercially available pv modules relies on plate and frame and spiral wounds configurations while hollow fibers modules are only available for lab scale applications due to concentration polarization phenomenon occurring inside the fibers sepratek company located in south korea produces and commercializes hollow fibers composite membranes for pv application exploiting all the benefits stemming using this membrane geometry the hollow fibers are produced by braiding jointly polymeric fibers and metal wires to produce membranes able to withstand high pressures demonstrating also high resistance to organic solvents at high temperatures the hollow fiber modules can be likely upscaled at a commercial level in pv systems with a capacity up to 12 ton h 1 using a membrane area of 350 m2 for the dehydration of organics and jet fuel sepratek 2020 today there are also some other membrane manufacturing companies like beroplan gmbh from germany http www beroplan de and mitsui e s co ltd from japan www mes co jp which support the industrial uses of pv beroplan gmbh confirms the current use of pv units within the so called hybrid production processes aiming for the dehydration of solvents mainly isopropanol and ethanol regarding the bottleneck of pv membranes particularly when applied on a larger scale is represented by the long term stability and lifetime of the membrane in which specific polymeric membranes such as p84 and cross linked chitosan have shown a lifetime up to 140 days in dehydration applications kreiter et al 2008 liu et al 2005 however polymeric membranes still present severe swelling drawbacks at this point inorganic membranes such as naa zeolite have also released interesting insights and long term operation over 400h in dehydration of methanol ethanol and isopropanol at 120 c morigami et al 2001 in terms of long term operation of pv membranes for desalination uio 66 nh2 zif 8 tio2 la y codoped microporous organosilica membranes have displayed stable performance over 120 h wan et al 2017 7 days zhu et al 2016 350h yacou et al 2015 and 200h zhang et al 2019 respectively at industrial level the lifetime of a membrane with proper maintenance and operation is typically around 3 years koczka et al 2007 by comparing pv and azeotropic distillation for the dehydration of organics in long term testing it was demonstrated that the most suitable option is represented by the combination of both processes the hybrid process in fact leads to a decrease of total operating cost opex of about 49 with an energy saving cost up to 48 van hoof et al 2004 from the economic point of view the azeotropic distillation itself has a total cost of 130 t product the coupling of the distillation system with a pv unit using polymeric membranes allowed a reduction in the total cost up to 65 85 t product this was mainly related to a decrease in investment and maintenance costs similar conclusions were drawn by kunnakorn et al 2013 who compared the conventional azeotropic distillation with a hybrid system i e distillation followed by pv for ethanol dehydration using naa zeolite membranes the coupling of pv with azeotropic distillation not only led to a reduction of the total opex from 0 742 kg for distillation followed by three practical azeotropic distillation to 0 168 kg for the hybrid pv system but also to a more environmentally friendly process servel and co workers also concluded that pv can improve distillation in specific separation e g acetic acid water and energy gain up to 20 servel et al 2014 a techno economic analyses on pv and distillation was recently developed by andre et al 2018 for isobutanol water separation the opex for a pv unit for the 98 8 w w isobutanol scenario were about the half in comparison to distillation because of energy and electricity demand decrease even in this case the combination of both processes can be considered as the best solution since good separation efficiency and moderate costs can be achieved the pv exploitation depends on overcoming its limitations including opex energy consumption operating conditions temperature flow rate concentration recycling driving force in which the improvement of exiting materials as well as the development of new membrane materials will also contribute for the consolidation of pv membranes in different applications including water desalination finding a suitable membrane is definitely the most relevant hurdle in devising a pervaporation system therefore the major thrusts in this field must be towards developing new membranes with high flux selectivity in which most of tested membranes have met such a requirement and long term stability 5 summary conclusions and outlook this paper has reviewed the current developments over the last 5 years at obtaining high performing membranes for pervaporation desalination we have identified that pva is likely the quintessential desalination polymer due to its high hydrophilicity attributed to the plentiful hydroxyl groups and stability when incorporating filling material and cross linker to date the best desalination performances water permeation ranged between 143 234 kg m 2 h 1 have been provided by pva based thin membranes but ultra thin membranes 100nm containing 2d materials such as go and mxene have also released competitive water permeation ca 85 98 kg m 2 h 1 outperforming state of the art pv membranes compared to the last review findings found by wang and coworkers wang et al 2016a it looks like that membranologists have reached a meaningful advance in creating enhanced permeating membranes overcoming the reported permeation values 65 kg m 2 h 1 however some mmms and inorganic membranes are giving comparable performances by smartly selecting the inorganic material and preparation strategy for instance go and mxene have been recognized as the most potential additives since they facilitate the water transport followed by some other inorganic materials such as nanoclays silica mofs among others according to the experts it is quite possible that pervaporation remains a smaller scale application of molecularly selective membranes koros and zhang 2017 however the growing development of pv has led its implementation within large scale hybrid processes for the dehydration of organics e g ethanol isopropanol castro munoz et al 2018 therefore it is likely that the current need of producing drinking water will encourage the involvement of pv with other conventional established technologies such as reverse osmosis distillation for seawater desalination on the other hand considering that the low permeation rate is the main drawback of pv specific materials and membrane concepts such as ultrathin mixed matrix composite inorganic offer today the possibility of overcoming such an issue it is obvious that the membrane and module costs are the main limiting parameters considered in the feasibility of any membrane based technology thus the development of high permeable membranes can result in requiring less membrane area making the implementation of such processes more economically profitable and attractive castro muñoz et al 2020 here ultrathin membranes are likely the main candidates since they use really low amounts of inorganic organic material and importantly exhibit superior performances yuan et al 2019 throughout analyzing the current literature reports and their relevant insights in seawater desalination the future trends and recommendations for the new researchers are addressed it is likely that 2d nano sized materials such as go mxene will be explored since the current insightsagree with their impressive featuresin separating and transporting preferentially water importantly some other materials like cms do not show any concentrating polarization allowing to minimizethe flux variation in long term operation to date few works have addressed the use of real seawater nigiz 2018 using general salt aqueous solution models the evaluation in testing real seawater is needed to reveal the real performance of the membranes since seawater contains plentiful chemicals such as sulfates fluor bicarbonate chloride bromide potassium sulfur among others and microbial components which may influence in the mass transport of membranes most of the research has been done in flat sheet configuration membranes here it is recommended to explored hollow fiber since are the ones that provide high productivities due to possessing the larger effective surface area to volume ratios moreover hollow fiber membranes are less prone to fouling at large scale hollow fiber membranes are preferred as compared to the flat sheet and tubular modules due to the low fouling phenomenon provoke a longer life and the bigger area to volume ratio provides high packing densities purkait et al 2018 few authors have mentioned and addressed the swelling of membranes the authors should evaluate that property of the membranes and propose alternatives to mitigate that issue even if the cross linking and embedding of filling materials can well contribute to the stability of membranes it should be useful to evaluate the swelling after long term operation there are relatively new polymer matrix materials such as hydrophilic poly ether block amide wu et al 2018 and polymers of intrinsic microporosity pims castro muñoz et al 2017 kirk et al 2019 that have been minimally explored in the field particularly hydrophilic poly ether block amide has provided meaningful desalination performance e g water permeate flux of 1 68 kg m 2 h 1 at 65 c 200g l 1 nacl in feed wu et al 2018 in its pristine form it is suggested to the new scientists in the field to explore such polymers in the new concept of membranes such as ultrathin composite mixed matrix or blending membranes it is recommended to report the results in terms of permeance and selectivity in such a way there could be the possibility of comparing directly the intrinsic separation properties among different membranes with no influence of operating parameters according to the current needs of replacing chemically synthesized polymers biopolymers should be considered in the preparation of environmentally friendly membranes according to their low cost non toxic nature biodegradability and biocompatibility castro muñoz et al 2020 to date few biopolymers e g chitosan cellulose acetate have been explored in pervaporation desalination providing acceptable permeation and separation performances however due to the new circular economy in the european union bio based polymers could likely be explored and thus promoted as an alternative to satisfy the increasing demand of the membrane materials galiano et al 2018 unconventional low costfillers such as laponite embedded into polymer membranes such as pva are conferring high separation performance 31 58 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 9 salt rejection it is recommended the incorporation and evaluation of laponites in other types of hydrophilic polymers and biopolymers it is likely that the analysis and optimization of the energy consumption of pervaporation technology will continue being a research gap in the field since it is considered as a promising technology due to compelling desalination performance kaminski et al 2018 xie et al 2018 declaration of competing interest the author declares no conflict

17475,due to the increase in worldwide population and urbanization water scarcity is today one of the tough challenges of society to date several ongoing initiatives and strategies are aiming to find feasible alternatives to produce drinking water seawater desalination is addressed as a latent alternative to solve such an issue when dealing with desalination membrane based technologies such as reverse osmosis membrane distillation pervaporation among others have been successfully proposed pervaporation pv is likely the membrane operation with the less permeation rate but providing high rejection of salts thereby membranologists are extensively working in developing new suitable membranes for pervaporation desalination therefore the goal of this review paper is to elucidate and provide a comprehensive outlook of the most recent works over the last 5 years at developing new concepts of membranes e g ultra thin mixed matrix composite and inorganic for desalination as well as the relevant strategies in fabricating enhanced pv membranes at this point an important emphasis has been paid to the relevant insights in the field this paper also addresses some principles of pv and the main drawbacks of the technique and its membranes through reviewing the literature the future trends needs and recommendations for the new researchers are given graphical abstract image graphical

today one of the main worldwide issues regards to the scarcity of drinking water according to the experts such water scarcity is defined as the lack of enough available water resources to meet the demands of water usage for different purposes such as drinking domestic uses irrigation hydroelectricity production and industrial applications manju and sagar 2017 therefore the scarcity of water could be overcome by approaching the sustainable re use of water together with suitable approaches for treating wastewater which is in fact one of the main developments encouraged by scientists according to the diverse applications over the last 20 years see fig 1 the water shortage can be solved wastewater treatment castro muñoz et al 2018 valorization of agro food by products castro muñoz et al 2020a water treatment ursino et al 2018 seawater treatment among others indeed the treatment of seawater is one of the current worldwide scopes of research when dealing with seawater desalination membrane based technologies are also the primary tools for seawater treatments and desalination fig 1 shows strong evidence about the increasing efforts of the research community in desalinating seawater over the past 20 years displaying an overview of the publication record of using membranes for such a purpose at this point highly selective membrane technologies such as reverse osmosis ro dong et al 2015 misdan et al 2012 membrane distillation md an et al 2017 gontarek et al 2019 and pervaporation pv castro muñoz et al 2020 swenson et al 2012 have been the most explored membrane processes in the field of seawater desalination to date it is likely that ro has been the only established membrane technology for seawater desalination at large scale kim et al 2009 providing high salt rejection and productivity in terms of permeation compared to md however ro requires high energy consumption to reach the high pressures needed 5 5 to 6 8 mpa to overcome the osmotic pressure kaminski et al 2018 even though high permeable ro membranes have been successfully developed the energy consumption still remains as the main challenge since it is the primary contributor to the total cost mazlan et al 2016 hence md and pv have been considered as the other potential and viable alternatives of ro but such technologies cannot commercially compete with ro since the ro provides more permeate fluxes 30 60 kg m 2 h 1 consuming between 2 4 kwh m 3 while pv and md offer less permeation 0 05 15 and 2 30 kg m 2 h 1 respectively than ro using a bit less energy consumption e g 2 and 0 6 1 75 kwh m 3 respectively in this regard pv and md can only compete with ro by reducing the energy cost needed for the phase change of water such energy cost can be minimized by using waste heat from other processes or renewable heat resources fundamentally the overall efficiency of a selected desalination membrane process is influenced by the achievable permeation flux which is concurrently influenced by the membrane material and operating temperature kaminski et al 2018 pv is most probably the membrane technology offering the lowest permeation rate but providing high rejection of salts according to the membrane properties the only possibility of pv technology for its competition in desalination regards to the development of more water permeable membranes it is important to point out that pv has been commercialized within hybrid purification processes for the removal of water from organics castro muñoz et al 2019a van der bruggen and luis 2014 thereby membranologists are still believing and extensively working in developing new membranes with enhanced separation performance for implementing them in pervaporation desalination in 2016 wang and co workers have detailed reviewed the state of the art of pv membranes for desalination providing a compelling comparison of pv technology with conventional ro and md processes wang et al 2016a however there is a need for reviewing the current ongoing development works and advances in the field therefore our goal is to release the latest state of the art last 5 years in developing and fabricating new concepts of pv membranes for desalination applications herein a particular emphasis has been focused on the relevant results and insights moreover different points have been also covered such as the main principles and drawbacks of pv future trends needs and recommendations for new researchers 2 principles of pervaporation pv technology the guidelines for desalination and performance evaluation pervaporation is recognized as a highly selective membrane technique it has proved its ability in separating different types of multicomponent azeotropic mixtures by partial vaporization baker et al 2010 castro munoz et al 2018 according to the needs of desalination hydrophilic membranes are required since they favor the transport i e diffusion of water molecules in vapor state the water transport mechanism through this type of membranes is depicted in fig 2 i the water molecules are firstly absorbed into the selective layer of the membranes based on chemical affinity followed by ii the diffusion of the molecules in the vapor phase water vapor molecules are transported as a result of concentration gradient and finally iii the desorption of the water vapor molecules at the permeate side baker et al 2010 wijmans and baker 1995 when dealing with hydrophilic membranes different types of hydrophilic materials have been used in the preparation of pv membranes towards specific applications as listed in table 1 in practice the pervaporation performance of the membranes has been widely expressed using the separation factor β and the permeate flux j as denoted in eqs 1 and 2 1 j a m a a m t 2 β a b c a c b p e r m e a t e c a c b f e e d both parameters and their calculation can be found elsewhere r castro muñoz et al 2018a santoro et al 2017 it is well known that both parameters evaluate the performance of a membrane based on the operating process conditions including thickness driving force vacuum pressure concentration temperature among others since different studies have been obviously carried out at different conditions to make a fair comparison of the performance between different membranes is quite challenging herein a preferred way of reporting pervaporation results has been established baker et al 2010 which is based on determining the permeance πi of a given compound e g the permeance of a compound a πa in a pv membrane can be calculated as follows 3 j a π a p a f p a p where pa f and pa p correspond to the saturated vapor pressures of component a in feed and permeate side respectively in theory the permeance is a parameter independent from process conditions providing insights into the transport of certain compounds over membrane material regarding the membrane selectivity can be determined as the ratio of the permeances of compound a and b as follows 4 α a b π a π b as a preliminary conclusion from this section the use of highly hydrophilic membranes for water desalination is suggested since they preferentially transport water molecules pv needs membranes with dense structure i e non porous but asymmetric membranes i e porous structure with a dense top layer are also suggested as a potential concept of membranes to raise permeation and maintaining salt rejection also the embedding of inorganic materials with a highly hydrophilic profile such as graphene oxide uio 66 nh2 mil 53 al zeolites and defined transport structure will promote the transport of water 3 latest insights in preparing pervaporation membranes for water desalination 3 1 thin and ultra thin membranes based on the latest findings of wang and coworkers wang et al 2016a most of the pv membranes can reject up to 99 99 of salt solutes which reveal the great potential to produce ultrapure water moreover thin film composite membranes have been identified as the high permeable concept of membranes e g polyvinyl alcohol pva polyacrylonitrile pan composite cellulose sio2 pva zeolite zsm 5 and graphene oxide pan composite membranes offer high permeation rates ranged from 6 7 to 65 kg m 2 h 1 liang et al 2014 wang et al 2016a at this point to maintain such superior permeable properties without compromising the selective properties is in fact the primary challenge of scientists it is likely that the manufacturing of thinner membranes with enhanced hydrophilicity displaying less water transfer resistance is the way to reach the target according to the latest studies in the field see table 2 the polysulfone psf hollow fiber coated with the thinnest pva 100 nm had a permeate flux of 7 4 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 9 salt rejection at 70 c using a feed salt aqueous solution containing 30 000 ppm nacl chaudhri et al 2015 in principle the transport of water across dense hydrophilic membranes is governed by the diffusion of absorbed water castro muñoz et al 2019 however according to chaudhri s report their high permeation rate was due to an asymmetric structure implying a dense pva skin onto porous psf structure in this way the transport through the composite membrane could also be associated with the initial absorption of water in the hydrophilic pva thin layer followed by the diffusion of water through the bottom layer of porous psf chaudhri et al 2015 later the authors developed similar hollow fiber membranes presenting a top active pva and sio2 which possessed a layer thickness of 220nm these membranes demonstrated high permeate fluxes of 20 6 and 10 4 kg m 2 h 1 with 99 9 salt rejection at 70 c from saline feeds of 2000 and 30 000 ppm nacl respectively chaudhri et al 2018 unlike their previous study chaudhri et al 2015 the greater water permeability of the pva sio2 layer compared to the pva layer was related to the greater hydrophilic character and nanoscale homogeneity of the particles interestingly the flux tended to decrease with the increase of salt concentration due to a decrease in water vapor pressure in the feed crosslinked pva top layer and porous pan support were used for the preparation of composite pv membranes liang et al 2018 in this study 4 sulfophthalic acid was employed as a crosslinker in which its sulfonic acid groups functioned as facilitated transport carriers to water molecules xue et al 2019 in practice high water flux of 46 3 kg m 2 h 1 with a salt rejection of 99 8 at 70 c was reached when pervaporating a 35 000 ppm nacl solution importantly water permeance increased 5 3 times when the pva layer thickness decreased 95 times i e from 76 μm to 800 nm according to authors description water permeates through the cross linked pva layer by means of two mechanisms solution diffusion mechanism in which the water dissolves in the surface of the polymer layer and subsequently diffuses through the free volume of the polymer and finally desorbs in the membrane permeate side as a second mechanism tentatively called facilitate transport mechanism ii the water molecules are adsorbed to the sulfonic acid groups on the membrane surface jumping through the close sulfonic acid groups until achieving the other side of the pva polymer membrane liang et al 2018 mauritz and moore 2004 this latest transport mechanism is in agreement with the insights reported by wang et al 2016b who stated that the hydrophilicity water uptake water permeate flux and anti fouling property of the sulfonated poly styrene ethylene butylene styrene block copolymer membrane was remarkably enhanced as a function of sulfonation degree as illustrated in fig 3 it is believed that the increase in sulfonation degree the copolymer membrane displayed a decrease in dispersive but increasing polar components of the surface free energy declaring the enhancement of the polarity of the membrane wang et al 2016b most of the rejection towards various salts such as nacl kcl licl nabr nh4cl cacl2 bacl2 nano3 among others was over 99 and they were over 98 4 independently of the sulfonation degree of the membrane but the membrane with the highest sulfonation degree i e 54 1 displayed the highest water flux of about 22 8 kg m 2 h 1 at 63 c 1 wt nacl in feed solution finally it is important to point out that the crosslinked pva pan membrane designed by liang et al 2018 exhibited attractive permeate fluxes thanks to the great hydrophilicity of both polymers i e pva pan the thickness of the skin layer i e cross linked pva and the type of crosslinkers used i e 4 sulfophthalic acid nevertheless the use of different preparation procedure may allow obtaining similar permeable membranes considering the same pristine material support e g austria et al 2019 reported the preparation of pan asymmetric membranes via diffusion induced phase separation dips which released a permeation rate of 48 0 kg m 2 h 1 and rejections over 99 0 3 5 wt nacl in feed at 60 c among the thinnest membranes prepared for pervaporation desalination are the ones prepared by liu et al 2018 they were able to construct ultrathin membranes in the range of 60 nm based on 2d material like mxene which is a transition metal carbide and or nitrides the ultrathin inorganic membranes designed by liu and co workers revealed impressive water permeate flux of 85 4 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 5 salt rejection 3 5 wt nacl in feed at 65 c this relatively new 2d material discovered in 2011 possesses hydrophilic nature with a negatively charged surface similar to graphene oxide go naguib et al 2011 in theory mxene nanosheets are formed by f c ti o h together with the presence of oh and c o groups which result in the increase of interlayer spacing in the stacked mxene laminates giving molecular transport channels in addition the oxygen containing groups coffer to the mxene and its derivative membranes a hydrophilic profile which is definitely desired for water separation liu et al 2018 apparently membranes based on go having a thickness of 500 nm li et al 2019 have documented to provide half permeate flux 42 4 kg m 2 h 1 99 9 salt rejection in comparison with mxene based membranes however go based membranes are indeed 8 fold thicker than that of mxene surprisingly 30 nm layer membranes can be produced based on maleic acid covalent bridged mxene by means of a facile vacuum assisted filtration method ding et al 2020 in this approach mxenesheets were strongly fixed by the covalent linking formed by the esterification reaction between the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of maleic acid and mxene surface respectively these tailored membranes exhibited a water permeate flux over 70 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 salt rejection 3 5 wt nacl solution at 30 c the authors also proved that the esterification reaction allowed to obtain structural well defined nano channels with a size of ca 0 49nm which in fact were larger than that of the original mxene membrane 0 37nm using the functional groups i e hydroxyl epoxy carbonyl and carboxyl groups of go it is possible to confer a high hydrophilic profile to a polymeric material for instance liang and co workers fabricated thin go films on pan membranes via vacuum filtration assisted assembly method liang et al 2015 the go pan composite membranes with a go layer thickness of 100 nm exhibited high water flux of about 65 1 kg m 2 h 1 and high rejection 99 8 for the desalination of a salt aqueous solution 35 000 ppm nacl at 90 c the authors stated that such membranes can be able to provide high pv performances in treating high salinity water up to 100 000 ppm nacl from liang s study it is important to point out that the extreme water permeation i e 65 1 kg m 2 h 1 of the go pan composite membranes was totally related to the go properties it is well known that go sheets have a d spacing of ca 5 å nair et al 2012 being enough to host a monolayer of water kinetic diameter 2 68 å it has been declared that such empty spaces can form a network of pristine graphene capillaries across go facilitating the water transport even if there is still a lack of knowing the transport mechanism in go sheets some authors have schematically represented the transport of water molecules in go as depicted in fig 4 particularly nair et al have stated that go even when the mixture of water and other components e g gases and liquids was fed the water permeation rate was at least five orders of magnitude higher than that of the other components nair et al 2012 this is supported by the recent findings of castro muñoz and co workers who obtained a 75 enhancement in permeation rate mainly water of crosslinked go pva membranes compared to pristine cross linked pva membranes for ethanol dehydration i e 10 wt water in feed castro muñoz et al 2019a sun et al 2020 fabricated poly vinyl alcohol intercalated go membranes basically go based membranes intercalated and cross linked by pva and subsequently supported on cellulose microfiltration membrane were prepared using a pressure assisted filtration method such a procedure permitted the manufacture of membranes that displayed a thickness from66 to 669 nm depending on the go loading deposition thanks to the proper design of the membranes a high water permeation was obtained up to 98 kg m 2 h 1 at 85 c according to the authors the unimpeded water transport across the membranes was found due to optimal interlayer spacing and microstructure of the go based membranes containing 130 μg cm 2 go by seeking the suitable intercalated pva quantity for cross linking sun et al 2020 however the unprecedented water permeation of pv membranes over 234 kg m 2 h 1 at 75 c corresponds to the ones designed by xue et al 2020 who very recently tailored pva pan nanofiber composite membranes which posssed a thickness of 730 nm such membranes also showed a high salt rejection ca 99 7 when separating a 1 5 wt salt solution in addition to this study meng et al 2020 also reported tremendous water permeation over 143 kg m 2 h 1 at 75 c 3 5 wt nacl in feed solution which was acquired in membranes made of pva layer onto ptfe porous supports herein meng s membranes had a thicker pva layer 2 6 µm compared to xue s study it is likely that this impressive performance can be attributed to the excellent coupling of the hydrophilic pva and hydrophobic ptfe polymers through the used preparation protocol meng et al 2020 3 2 inorganic membranes nowadays inorganic membranes are the type of barriers that display high separation performance good chemical and thermal stability and importantly low fouling issues their impressive separation performance is due to the rigid structure of ceramics and their defined pore size providing superior ability in terms of molecular size and shape castro muñoz and fíla 2018 wang et al 2016a this characteristic confers to these membranes high salt rejection and mass transfer when dealing with the development of inorganic based pervaporation membranes for desalination purposes the membranes must possess small pore size e g mesoporous cobalt oxide silica membranes have successfully fabricated via a dual acid base catalyzed sol gel and interlayer free approach varying the cobalt addition between 0 35 mol elma et al 2015b in particular the membranes containing the highest amount of tricobalt tetroxide i e 35 mol displayed a highly mesoporous structure releasing water fluxes of 20 11 3 and 7 7 kg m 2 h 1 in treating salt solutions of 0 3 3 5 and 7 5 wt nacl at 60 c respectively together with salt rejection over 99 7 see table 3 the authors declared that this a result of the high pore volume mesopores formation and structural robustness of the silica network given by the presence of tricobalt tetroxide concurrently elma and co worked prepared carbonized template silica membranes by means of catalyzed sol gel method and subsequently used for desalinating different aqueous solutions elma et al 2015a e g high water fluxes together with high salt rejections over 99 5 were determined up to 8 5 and 6 6 kg m 2 h 1 at 60 c for salt solutions containing 0 3 and 7 5 wt nacl respectively interestingly the microporosity of the carbonized silica was responsible for an effective molecular sieving separation of water kinetic diameter of 2 6 å and hydrated salt ions of na 7 2 å and cl 6 6 å on the other hand the high pore volume by the mesoporosity allowed to the membranes to provide such high water fluxes at the end of this study the authors also documented that such inorganic membranes were stable over 250 h testing it is important to mention that inorganic membranes based on zeolite clinoptilolite phosphate can release comparable desalination performance since water flux of 15 kg m 2 h 1 and around 95 removal of na initial feed solution containing 1400 ppm na at 95 c has been reported an et al 2014 such ability of zeolite membranes e g naa zeolite has been recognized due to a joint size exclusion charge exclusion surface evaporation mechanism cho et al 2011 table 4 less permeable inorganic membranes in the range of 1 2 6 kg m 2 h 1 compared to previous reports sing et al reported the synthesis of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide silica membranes with excellent high salt rejection efficiency of 99 9 desalinating a solution containing 40 000 ppm nacl at 25 c singh et al 2015 starting from ethyl silicate es40 as a silica precursor wang et al 2016 prepared interlayer free silica membranes via rapid thermal processing rtp protocol at 630 c the membranes fabricated at ph 4 were found as the best for the desalination of synthetic seawater 3 5 wt nacl showing water fluxes of 17 8 kg m 2 h 1 and salt rejection over 99 at 60 c compared to wang s findings xu et al 2016 synthesized ethenylene bridged organosilica membranes providing a flux of 14 2 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 6 salt rejection at 70 c this favored water transport through this type of membranes was attributed to the addition of polarizable and rigid ethenylene bridges in the silica networks interestingly authors considered that the polar c c and si oh groups are present in plentiful amounts in the bis triethoxysilyl ethane derived silica networks in which the water molecules can primarily adsorb onto these hydrophilic elements of the networks by means of hydrogen bonding or dipole dipole interactions xu et al 2016 more recently la y codoped microporous organosilica membranes were fabricated and then proposed for desalination giving similar separation performance ca 10 3 kg m 2 h 1 salt rejection of 100 at 25 c but good stability for 200 h without any significant changes in performance zhang et al 2019 with higher permeate fluxes around 26 5 l m 2 h 1 yang and co workers also developed interlayer free hybrid carbon silica membranes for the desalination of 1 wt nacl solution at 60 c displaying acceptable salt rejection 99 5 yang et al 2017 different inorganic material like titanium dioxide tio2 was employed to prepare thin films 400 nm yacou et al 2015 herein the thin layers dip coated on commercial α al2o3 tubes were synthesized from titanium propoxide and exposed to a gentle thermal treatment to control particle and pore sizes dp 4 nm the tio2 membranes were subsequently tested for desalination three different types of solutions such as brackish 0 3 wt nacl in feed seawater 3 5 wt and brine concentrations 7 5 and 10 wt water fluxes in the range of 10 5 kg m 2 h 1 at 75 c were obtained for brackish concentrations whereas fluxes of 4 0 and 6 0 kg m 2 h 1 were reached at the highest brine concentration 10 wt such membranes also demonstrated high salt rejection 99 ability proving a stable performance for long term operation over 350 h yacou et al 2015 today specific inorganic materials have been identified for their impressive properties in solvent separations e g graphene as the most representative 2d material possesses excellent electrical mechanical and thermal properties due to its unique one atom thick structure graphene and its derivatives e g graphene oxide have become promising nano building blocks for membrane based separations and tuning the membrane properties liu et al 2015 in particular graphene oxide go displays the most suitable properties when dealing with water separation cha umpong et al 2020 go sheets are highly oxygenated possessing hydroxyl and epoxy functional groups on their basal planes in addition to this carbonyl and carboxyl groups are also located at the sheet edges singh et al 2011 however it is likely that the go stability depends on its coated layer and the chemistry of the support substrate in order to overcome this drawback xu et al 2016 employed such abundant oxygen groups of go for reacting with the amine groups of polydopamine pda and thus bind go nanosheets onto α al2o3support see fig 5 a the resulting membranes showed water permeate flux of about 48 4 kg m 2 h 1 and high ion salt rejection over 99 7 at 90 c similarly the research group also used 1 4 phenylene diisocyanate pdi as a cross linker for covalent modification of go feng et al 2016 in this way a three dimensional graphene oxide framework gof was obtained which was similarly attached to α al2o3tubesupport via using vacuum filtration as represented in fig 5b the gof membranes having 18 μm thickness provided high water flux is 11 4 kg m 2 h 1 and ion rejection of about 99 9 at 90 c for desalination of 3 5 wt seawater unfortunately this membrane concept did not offer competent permeation rates than that of go nanosheets onto α al2o3support 48 4 kg m 2 h 1 at 90 c xu et al 2016 higher permeation fluxes in gof based membranes can be acquired when using a different type of cross linker such as 1 4 cyclohyxanediamine cda qian et al 2018 due to the enhancement of d spacing and surface hydrophilicity after cda modification the gof based membrane was able to provide a high permeation rate e g 20 1 kg m 2 h 1 together with high ion rejection of 99 9 by using an aliphatic terminal diamine like 1 4 diaminobutane qian et al 2019 tuned the interlayer spacing of go and placed on the pda modified α al2o3 supports in which after testing in pv desalination 3 5 wt 90 c had similar performance water flux of 19 7 kg m 2 h 1 and ion rejection of 99 9 compared to the previous study qian et al 2018 interestingly these membranes were able to provide stable performance over 168 h high desalination performance can also be obtained using carbon molecular sieves cms according to the report provided by song et al 2016 mixed matrix cms and alumina membranes can provide water fluxes of up to 25 kg m 2 h 1 for seawater desalination 3 5 wt salt concentration at 75 c especially such membranes did not show any variation on the permeate flux when the salt concentration was raised from 0 3 1 and 3 5 wt at this point the authors declared that the concentration polarization was not significant and no variation on permeate flux could be related to the carbon structure which confers hydrophobicity contrary to hydrophilic inorganic membranes song et al 2016 on the other hand the salt rejection varied in the range of 93 99 depending on the operating temperature and salt concentration when dealing either with the fabrication of inorganic or mixed matrix membranes the use of a new class of porous materials such as metal organic frameworks mofs is also a current trend in the field of efficient membranes for desalination mofs composition can be found elsewhere cohen 2010 rangnekar et al 2015 shekhah et al 2018 typically a mof implies a porous and crystalline material comprised of inorganic secondary building units connected by organic ligands denny et al 2016 in desalination applications hydrophilic mofs such as uio 66 mil 101 cr hkust 1 are preferentially suggested for the transport of water castro munoz et al 2018 however some authors have proposed hydrophobic mofs like zeolitic imidazolate framework zif 8 on pda modified α al2o3 zhu et al 2016 in pervaporation desalination displaying the highest water flux ca 13 5 kg m 2 h 1 with 99 8 salt rejection at 100 c 3 5 wt nacl in feed zhu et al 2016 zif 8 has demonstrated great thermal and hydrothermal stability which has been proven over 7 days in the case of hydrophilic mofs the presence of polar sites is associated with the metal oxygen clusters and very non polar regions due to the organic and aromatic linkers basically water molecules easily adsorb on the hydrophilic centers in addition to this water molecules are bound by hydrogen bridges to these water nucleation sites producing small water clusters küsgens et al 2009 based on this water transport mechanism some research has been done aiming at the seawater desalination for example the amino functionalization of the hydrophilic uio 66 was performed by wan et al 2017 afterward 3 aminopropy ltriethoxysilane aptes was employed as a molecular linker for attaching the metal ions onto the α al2o3 support surface and thus carry out the nucleation and crystallization of the mof the resulting uio 66 nh2 membranes exhibited acceptable desalination performance e g the water fluxes increased from 1 5 to 12 1 kg m 2 h 1 when the temperature increased from 45 to 90 c maintaining minimal variation in the ions rejections over 99 7 for 120 h operating time wan et al 2017 thanks to the defined microporous structure of the mof with narrow pores size in the range of 0 52 0 02 nm which is ranged between the size of water molecules 0 26 nm and different type of hydrated ions such as na 0 72 nm k 0 66 nm ca2 0 82 nm mg2 0 86 nm cl 0 66 nm volkov et al 1997 high ion rejection values were expected by the mof based membranes 3 3 mixed matrix membranes one of the emerging concepts in tailoring membranes with superior performance is the mixed matrix membrane mmm by fabricating a compelling mmm the strengths of inorganic materials and polymeric ones are merged to obtain new membranes with a synergistic separation performance castro muñoz et al 2020 castro muñoz et al 2020 in fact these membranes are recognized as the next generation of membranes as elsewhere a typical mmm is generally prepared by smartly embedding any inorganic material such as metal organic frameworks zeolites silica graphene based materials among others into a polymeric matrix such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity polyimides cellulose acetate while the deposition of inorganic materials on the polymer matrix can be named as a composite membrane ursino et al 2018 the incorporation and dispersion of go into a polyimide has been performed by several authors feng et al 2017 huang and feng 2018 these generated mmms exhibited water permeate fluxes of 36 1 kg m 2 h 1 feng et al 2017 and 15 6 kg m 2 h 1 huang and feng 2018 with a salt rejection of 99 9 when separating a salt solution 3 5 wt at 90 c in fact these membranes showed similar rejection values in comparison with go pan composites liang et al 2015 however the water fluxes of the go polyimide mmms were greatly lower than the go pan composites but stable over 120 h operating time in a different approach the great pervaporation of go based mixed matrix membranes has been proven by other scientists for instance cheng et al 2017 exfoliated hydrophilic go nanosheets and subsequently deposited onto the pan nanofibrous support through crosslinked pva via vacuum filtration in this way the hydrophilic pva chains were acting as spacing bridges to guarantee the attaching of go via glutaraldehyde fig 6 illustrates the ultrathin composite ca 120 nm membranes smartly designed by cheng and co workers who reported permeate flux of 69 1 kg m 2 h 1 and relatively stable high rejection of about 99 9 during an operating time of 24 h 35 g l 1 nacl in feed at 70 c zhang et al 2018 formulated new composite pva pervaporation membranes in this study pyromellitic dianhydride pmda was proposed as a crosslinker in the manufacturing of cross linked pva coated pan membranes by using the solution casting protocol 2 µm thick pva selective layers were made and later tested for desalination of nacl solution 35 000 ppm 70 c the generated membranes revealed comparable performance e g permeate flux of 32 2 kg m 2 h 1 and nacl rejection of 99 9 compared to some cross linked pva filled with go membranes between 28 36 1 kg m 2 h 1 feng et al 2017 li et al 2017a similar to zhang s study li et al 2018 prepared cross linked pva layers using 4 sulfonylphthalic acid as a chemical cross linker such membranes exhibited impressive permeate fluxes and salt rejection of about 60 8 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 8 at 70 c respectively a composite cross linked pva onto pan support was carried out by zhang et al 2019 in this development sulfosuccinic acid was employed as a chemical cross linker which reduced the hydrophilic nature of the pva polymer due to the use of its oh groups despite this issue the membranes displayed better swelling resistance and thermal stability also the membranes demonstrated acceptable water permeation flux 27 9 kg m 2 h 1 and salt rejection 99 8 at 70 c 35 000 ppm nacl in feed where the permeation was the only affected decreased up to 11 2 kg m 2 h 1 when increasing the salt concentration of up to 100 000 ppm nacl considering a different type of filling inorganic material mofs have been also widely employed in the synthesis of mmms e g liang et al 2018 created membranes based on mil 53 al and cross linked pva which were then dip coated into pvdf hollow fiber after testing towards desalination 100 g l 1 at 80 c the composite membranes containing 30 wt mof loading displayed salt rejection as high as 99 9 while their permeate fluxes were initially in the order of 19 kg m 2 h 1 according to the authors the membranes also expressed good long term stability and suitable antifouling properties as a current trend in the field biopolymer based membranes have today emerged as promising materials in replacing the synthetic polymers castro muñoz and gonzález valdez 2019 achieving the appearance of preparing environmentally friendly membranes in this framework chitosan cs seems to be a candidate material for desalination applications since it displays a highly hydrophilic nature suitable for the transport of water molecules castro muñoz et al 2020 cs has been recently filled with go by qian et al 2018 who declared good interaction between both inorganic and organic phases as represented in fig 7 after the evaluation in desalination of such resulting biopolymer mmms filled with 1 wt go the authors confirmed excellent separation ability translated to high permeate flux and salt rejection of about 30 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 9 respectively during the desalination of 5 wt aqueous nacl solution at 81 c it is important to point out that e nacl diffusion coefficient in the mmms was lower than that of water by two orders of magnitude allowing high selectivity of the membranes x qian et al 2018 diverse class of filling materials such as nanoclays into mmms have also been studied for pervaporation desalination selim et al 2019 2020 especially lapolite is also found among nanoclays category including clinoptilolite montmorillonite bentonite laponite is recognized as a highly hydrophilic nano sized material which possesses a layered structure with 30 nm diameter and 1 nm in thickness selim et al 2019 evaluated for the first time the influence of laponite into cross linked pva by embedding only 2 wt of the material the highest water flux was obtained in the range of 58 6 kg m 2 h 1 and a salt rejection over 99 9 3 wt nacl in feed at 70 c as stated by the authors the contribution of low loading of laponite made the membranes rougher and more hydrophilic which could enhance the adsorption of water molecules onto the membrane surface very recently the same hybrid membranes filled with 7 wt laponite confirmed their interesting performance in pervaporative desalination of brine solutions at 40 c 100 000 ppm nacl which was about 31 2 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 9 for water permeation and salt rejection respectively selim et al 2020 4 commercial status of pv membranes and their bottlenecks the industry is more and more looking at membrane processes with greater attention including pv as a green technology at the end of the 90 s prof néel the pioneer of the pv performed a global analysis on pv systems reporting about 90 of pv units were commercialized by gft néel 1997 today deltamem ag company previously known as sulzer chemtech castro munoz et al 2018 has the largest installed pv plants worldwide it is known that most of the units are implemented to the dehydration of organic solvents jonquières et al 2002 the membranes used in these applications are generally composed of pva active selective layer supported on a porous pan support scott 1995 most of these commercially available pv modules relies on plate and frame and spiral wounds configurations while hollow fibers modules are only available for lab scale applications due to concentration polarization phenomenon occurring inside the fibers sepratek company located in south korea produces and commercializes hollow fibers composite membranes for pv application exploiting all the benefits stemming using this membrane geometry the hollow fibers are produced by braiding jointly polymeric fibers and metal wires to produce membranes able to withstand high pressures demonstrating also high resistance to organic solvents at high temperatures the hollow fiber modules can be likely upscaled at a commercial level in pv systems with a capacity up to 12 ton h 1 using a membrane area of 350 m2 for the dehydration of organics and jet fuel sepratek 2020 today there are also some other membrane manufacturing companies like beroplan gmbh from germany http www beroplan de and mitsui e s co ltd from japan www mes co jp which support the industrial uses of pv beroplan gmbh confirms the current use of pv units within the so called hybrid production processes aiming for the dehydration of solvents mainly isopropanol and ethanol regarding the bottleneck of pv membranes particularly when applied on a larger scale is represented by the long term stability and lifetime of the membrane in which specific polymeric membranes such as p84 and cross linked chitosan have shown a lifetime up to 140 days in dehydration applications kreiter et al 2008 liu et al 2005 however polymeric membranes still present severe swelling drawbacks at this point inorganic membranes such as naa zeolite have also released interesting insights and long term operation over 400h in dehydration of methanol ethanol and isopropanol at 120 c morigami et al 2001 in terms of long term operation of pv membranes for desalination uio 66 nh2 zif 8 tio2 la y codoped microporous organosilica membranes have displayed stable performance over 120 h wan et al 2017 7 days zhu et al 2016 350h yacou et al 2015 and 200h zhang et al 2019 respectively at industrial level the lifetime of a membrane with proper maintenance and operation is typically around 3 years koczka et al 2007 by comparing pv and azeotropic distillation for the dehydration of organics in long term testing it was demonstrated that the most suitable option is represented by the combination of both processes the hybrid process in fact leads to a decrease of total operating cost opex of about 49 with an energy saving cost up to 48 van hoof et al 2004 from the economic point of view the azeotropic distillation itself has a total cost of 130 t product the coupling of the distillation system with a pv unit using polymeric membranes allowed a reduction in the total cost up to 65 85 t product this was mainly related to a decrease in investment and maintenance costs similar conclusions were drawn by kunnakorn et al 2013 who compared the conventional azeotropic distillation with a hybrid system i e distillation followed by pv for ethanol dehydration using naa zeolite membranes the coupling of pv with azeotropic distillation not only led to a reduction of the total opex from 0 742 kg for distillation followed by three practical azeotropic distillation to 0 168 kg for the hybrid pv system but also to a more environmentally friendly process servel and co workers also concluded that pv can improve distillation in specific separation e g acetic acid water and energy gain up to 20 servel et al 2014 a techno economic analyses on pv and distillation was recently developed by andre et al 2018 for isobutanol water separation the opex for a pv unit for the 98 8 w w isobutanol scenario were about the half in comparison to distillation because of energy and electricity demand decrease even in this case the combination of both processes can be considered as the best solution since good separation efficiency and moderate costs can be achieved the pv exploitation depends on overcoming its limitations including opex energy consumption operating conditions temperature flow rate concentration recycling driving force in which the improvement of exiting materials as well as the development of new membrane materials will also contribute for the consolidation of pv membranes in different applications including water desalination finding a suitable membrane is definitely the most relevant hurdle in devising a pervaporation system therefore the major thrusts in this field must be towards developing new membranes with high flux selectivity in which most of tested membranes have met such a requirement and long term stability 5 summary conclusions and outlook this paper has reviewed the current developments over the last 5 years at obtaining high performing membranes for pervaporation desalination we have identified that pva is likely the quintessential desalination polymer due to its high hydrophilicity attributed to the plentiful hydroxyl groups and stability when incorporating filling material and cross linker to date the best desalination performances water permeation ranged between 143 234 kg m 2 h 1 have been provided by pva based thin membranes but ultra thin membranes 100nm containing 2d materials such as go and mxene have also released competitive water permeation ca 85 98 kg m 2 h 1 outperforming state of the art pv membranes compared to the last review findings found by wang and coworkers wang et al 2016a it looks like that membranologists have reached a meaningful advance in creating enhanced permeating membranes overcoming the reported permeation values 65 kg m 2 h 1 however some mmms and inorganic membranes are giving comparable performances by smartly selecting the inorganic material and preparation strategy for instance go and mxene have been recognized as the most potential additives since they facilitate the water transport followed by some other inorganic materials such as nanoclays silica mofs among others according to the experts it is quite possible that pervaporation remains a smaller scale application of molecularly selective membranes koros and zhang 2017 however the growing development of pv has led its implementation within large scale hybrid processes for the dehydration of organics e g ethanol isopropanol castro munoz et al 2018 therefore it is likely that the current need of producing drinking water will encourage the involvement of pv with other conventional established technologies such as reverse osmosis distillation for seawater desalination on the other hand considering that the low permeation rate is the main drawback of pv specific materials and membrane concepts such as ultrathin mixed matrix composite inorganic offer today the possibility of overcoming such an issue it is obvious that the membrane and module costs are the main limiting parameters considered in the feasibility of any membrane based technology thus the development of high permeable membranes can result in requiring less membrane area making the implementation of such processes more economically profitable and attractive castro muñoz et al 2020 here ultrathin membranes are likely the main candidates since they use really low amounts of inorganic organic material and importantly exhibit superior performances yuan et al 2019 throughout analyzing the current literature reports and their relevant insights in seawater desalination the future trends and recommendations for the new researchers are addressed it is likely that 2d nano sized materials such as go mxene will be explored since the current insightsagree with their impressive featuresin separating and transporting preferentially water importantly some other materials like cms do not show any concentrating polarization allowing to minimizethe flux variation in long term operation to date few works have addressed the use of real seawater nigiz 2018 using general salt aqueous solution models the evaluation in testing real seawater is needed to reveal the real performance of the membranes since seawater contains plentiful chemicals such as sulfates fluor bicarbonate chloride bromide potassium sulfur among others and microbial components which may influence in the mass transport of membranes most of the research has been done in flat sheet configuration membranes here it is recommended to explored hollow fiber since are the ones that provide high productivities due to possessing the larger effective surface area to volume ratios moreover hollow fiber membranes are less prone to fouling at large scale hollow fiber membranes are preferred as compared to the flat sheet and tubular modules due to the low fouling phenomenon provoke a longer life and the bigger area to volume ratio provides high packing densities purkait et al 2018 few authors have mentioned and addressed the swelling of membranes the authors should evaluate that property of the membranes and propose alternatives to mitigate that issue even if the cross linking and embedding of filling materials can well contribute to the stability of membranes it should be useful to evaluate the swelling after long term operation there are relatively new polymer matrix materials such as hydrophilic poly ether block amide wu et al 2018 and polymers of intrinsic microporosity pims castro muñoz et al 2017 kirk et al 2019 that have been minimally explored in the field particularly hydrophilic poly ether block amide has provided meaningful desalination performance e g water permeate flux of 1 68 kg m 2 h 1 at 65 c 200g l 1 nacl in feed wu et al 2018 in its pristine form it is suggested to the new scientists in the field to explore such polymers in the new concept of membranes such as ultrathin composite mixed matrix or blending membranes it is recommended to report the results in terms of permeance and selectivity in such a way there could be the possibility of comparing directly the intrinsic separation properties among different membranes with no influence of operating parameters according to the current needs of replacing chemically synthesized polymers biopolymers should be considered in the preparation of environmentally friendly membranes according to their low cost non toxic nature biodegradability and biocompatibility castro muñoz et al 2020 to date few biopolymers e g chitosan cellulose acetate have been explored in pervaporation desalination providing acceptable permeation and separation performances however due to the new circular economy in the european union bio based polymers could likely be explored and thus promoted as an alternative to satisfy the increasing demand of the membrane materials galiano et al 2018 unconventional low costfillers such as laponite embedded into polymer membranes such as pva are conferring high separation performance 31 58 kg m 2 h 1 and 99 9 salt rejection it is recommended the incorporation and evaluation of laponites in other types of hydrophilic polymers and biopolymers it is likely that the analysis and optimization of the energy consumption of pervaporation technology will continue being a research gap in the field since it is considered as a promising technology due to compelling desalination performance kaminski et al 2018 xie et al 2018 declaration of competing interest the author declares no conflict

abstract keywords multiple stratified environments nitrogen transformation microbial community distribution gene complementary 1 introduction nitrogen discharged into aquatic ecosystems leads to water eutrophication and the formation of disinfection by products in water treatment processes conley et al 2009 westerhoff and mash 2002 conventional nitrogen removal is highly dependent on biological

li et al 2019 in general the conventional nitrogen removal processes consume a large amount of dissolved oxygen do for nitrification and organics for denitrification deng et al 2020 thus produce high energy consumption and operating costs zhang et al 2019 furthermore the nitrogen removal capacity and processes are highly affected by ambient environment do and substrate supply hendrickx et al 2012 thereby it is crucial to explore an energy saving efficient and stable water treatment process for nitrogen removal do impacts the distributions of microbial community and then induces corresponding substrate transformations jin et al 2018 the transformational substrate in turn has a decisive influence on the distributions diversities and relative abundances of the microbial community chen et al 2019b laureni et al 2016 and therefore affects the microbial conversion pathways and gene expressions guo et al 2018 ihssen and egli 2005 for example higher do level can promote the activities of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob but inhibit the growth of anammox bacteria jiang et al 2020 the microbial conversion pathways would develop towards nitrification at high do condition lower do level can reduce the activity of aob and nob li et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 but provides supportive conditions for thaumarchaeota a typical ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa spang et al 2010 when ammonia comes into the process as electron donor at low do condition the partial nitrification anammox pna process could be achieved well for nitrogen removal li et al 2020 by associating with nob restricting process and partial nitrification pn liu et al 2019 while the anoxic or anaerobic environment could facilitate the microbial conversion pathways towards denitrification ma et al 2020 different microbial conversion pathways relating to nitrogen transformation have respective and distinctive advantages disadvantages nitrification could remove ammonia effectively but need to consume a large amount of aeration energy du et al 2020 pna could be able to occur in low do and substrate supply with no extra organic carbon required but is unstable liu et al 2019 denitrification could eliminate nitrate and total nitrogen tn but needs enough organics to be involved in the process as carbon source deng et al 2020 thus it can be seen that the successful integration of these microbial conversion pathways to complement each other might break through the traditional bondage of biological nitrogen removal process however the driven microbes aoa aob anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers of these microbial conversion pathways are prone to grow in their respective favorable environments liu et al 2017 wen et al 2017 thus it is difficulty to coexist in a single system therefore creating a multiple environment in a single system might be a key breakthrough and is promising in real engineering gravity driven membrane gdm reactor might be an available technology to create a multiple environment due to its unique advantages active microbial behaviors and slow flowing model etc chang et al 2019 however the previous upflow feeding mode in gdm chomiak et al 2014 chomiak et al 2015 huang et al 2009 kohler et al 2014 leads the bulk liquid to be homogeneous with the raw water hindering the formation of the multiple environment therefore most studies on gdm until now just focused on the role of biofilm on membrane performance such as the effects of biofilm natures e g the physical structure and biological degradation derlon et al 2014 liu et al 2020 song et al 2019 the compositions of microbial community tang et al 2018 wu et al 2017 or the predation behavior of eukaryotic derlon et al 2014 derlon et al 2012 and metazoa organisms tang et al 2018 while the function of bulk liquid has been seldom studied considering gdm features and the current gap in the previous studies of conventional nitrogen removal processes we artificially controlled the water flow configuration to create a favorable and multiple stratified environment in bulk liquid thereby tailoring that the functional microbial communities and genes distributed on different spatial and temporal regions and performed their dominant functions the process achieved high effective integration of the diverse nitrogen transformation paths a pilot scale

in mopanshan drinking water treatment plant heilongjiang province china as delineated by the schematic illustration in fig 1 the moving water baffles were installed in the reactor to regulate liquid flowing consuming do and substrate supply to produce a multiple stratified environment in bulk liquid the reactor was set three sampling points as a b and c a group of hollow fiber polyvinylidene

efficiency ranged between 88 and 99 3 results and discussions 3 1 reactor performance and environmental effects 3 1 1 contaminant removal performance in upgraded gdsm reactor the concentrations of nh4 n tn and cod in influent and effluent were monitored during the 100 days operation to evaluate contaminants removal efficacy as shown in fig 2 the influent nh4 n and tn were in the ranges of 0 53 1 84 mg l 1 and 2 79 6 36 mg l 1 respectively in first 15 days of start up operation as the organic nitrogen containing ingredients of membrane fell off into the effluent fig s1 the effluent of tn was higher than that of influent and the system did not reach a stable state the stable operational period started at 15th day the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn in the stable operational period were 94 68 2 55 and 55 16 5 53 respectively in addition the cod was also notably eliminated by 80 17 6 75 interestingly when the influent nh4 n was increased above 1 5 mg l 1 by artificially adding the prepared ammonium chloride solution during day 62 75 the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn suddenly declined to 64 49 6 65 and 33 35 4 48 while the nh4 n was below 1 5 mg l 1 the upgraded gdsm reactor maintained high efficiency removal of nh4 n and tn despite the low temperature below 10 c the high nitrogen removal capacity of upgraded gdsm reactor might be attributed to the special environmental variations due to its unique structural features which will be further discussed in the following sections 3 1 2 influence of biological environment on contaminant removal performance in order to investigate the impact of biological environment on nitrogen removal the system performance operated at different conditions were compared via intuitive and accurate excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy the influent raw water effluent i keeping bulk liquids and biofilm effluent ii discharging bulk liquids but keeping biofilm and effluent iii discharging bulk liquid and washing out biofilm were collected for eem analysis as displayed in fig 3 when the bulk liquids and biofilm both were at steady states the protein like substances peak a chen et al 2003 extracellular polymeric substances eps peak b chen et al 2003 soluble microbial products smps peak c chen et al 2003 and humic like substances peak t1 chen et al 2006 were all eliminated and only a part of fulvic like substance peak t2 chen et al 2006 remained when the bulk liquid was discharged but biofilm retained only smps peak c was eliminated completely while protein like substances peak a and eps peak b weakened on the other hand when the bulk liquid was fully discharged and biofilm was washed out the reactor almost incapacitated to contaminant removals apparently it can be inferred that the bulk liquid located in the interior of upgraded gdsm reactor may play a significant role in enhancing contaminant removals to confirm the dominant role of microbial population rather than buffer function of bulk liquids in the process of contaminant removal the experimental water was sterilized and compared with normal water the results fig s2 indicated the microbial population supported the contaminant removal capability of bulk liquids in the system more detailed discussions about the microbial population in bulk liquid will be implemented in the following sections 3 1 3 multiple stratified variations of do and substrate supply the steady and slow flowing bulk liquids in the upgraded gdsm reactor might produce a multiple stratified environment raw water three samples s a s b and s c points in the reactor interior fig 1 together with the biofilm b were monitored do toc tn cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n as the representatives of the spatial do and substrate supply variations in gdsm fig 4 the do concentrations of sample s a s b s c and b 5 03 0 071 mg l 1 2 38 0 062 mg l 1 0 86 0 047 mg l 1 and 1 27 0 068 mg l 1 varied significantly and all notably lower than that of raw water 7 15 0 081 mg l 1 with the decrease of do the concentrations of no2 n increased continuously especially in s c region no2 n 0 26 0 007 mg l 1 was higher than other regions while no3 n 0 21 0 053 mg l 1 decreased significantly a high nitrite accumulation 6 65 folds of raw water was constantly maintained in s c region producing the successful preconditions for the partial nitrification and anammox reaction chen et al 2019b laureni et al 2016 liu et al 2019 meanwhile the changes of toc cod tn and nh4 n also showed a declining trend compared to raw water hence s a s b s c and b can be classified into high oxygen high nutrition region s a low oxygen low nutrition region s b anoxic low nutrition region s c and biofilm region b depending on the do and substrate supply it can be seen that the interior environment of the upgraded gdsm reactor was inhomogeneous and presented a multiple stratified variation since the environmental variation highly affected biochemical reactions jin et al 2018 the diverse microbial behaviors might occur in reactor 3 2 multiple microbial behaviors 3 2 1 microbial populations associated with nitrogen transformations monitoring variations of the biomasses and the functional microbes in the reactor could provide a profound understanding on the microbial behaviors bacterial counts in raw water three sampling locations s a s b and s c and biofilm b were measured to compare the biomasses fig s3 the result presented that the bacteria numbers in sample s a s b s c and b exceeded that of the sample r obviously the contaminant removal by the upgraded gdsm mainly depended on the growth of microorganisms in bulk liquid and biofilm mathematically the relative relation of growth rate of microorganisms and the efficiencies for nh4 n tn and cod removals was calculated according to monod equation in text s2 in si as shown in fig s4 the high correlation coefficients r2 0 8785 for nh4 n r2 0 7859 for cod and r2 0 8488 for tn implied good fitting of the nh4 n tn and cod concentrations mg l in effluent and the growth of bulk liquid and biofilm in improved gdsm using monod nh4 n monod cod and monod tn models the results indicated that the upgraded gdsm exhibited synchronous and high efficiency for nh4 n tn and cod removals the high removal efficiencies were mainly due to both the abundant microorganisms in bulk liquid and biofilm and microbial activity in bioreactor the removal regularity was consistent with the experiment data as stated before nitrification and partial nitrification initiation related bacteria aoa aob and nob heterotrophic denitrification initiation related bacteria dnb are key nitrogen transformation populations fitzgerald et al 2015 qiu et al 2010 sims et al 2012 urakawa et al 2012 metagenomic analysis was performed to investigate the distribution characteristics of aoa aob nob and dnb for different samples there were 281347 sequences on samples at 97 similarity using uclust algorithm for clustering gomez smith et al 2015 the shannon chao1 ace and simpson estimators of samples showed that the biodiversity changed along with the environmental variations during continuous operation especially for archaea table s3 otus were carried out to assess the specific distribution characteristics of aoa aob nob and dnb fig 5 as illustrated in raw water despite the high total otus only 23 aoa otus with a mere 0 5 abundance was detected and other functional microbes also showed relatively weak abundances i e 26 aob otus 3 nob otus and 5 dnb otus remarkably sample s a showed the highest outs portions of aob 118 otus and nob 74 otus suggesting a high activity of nitrification meanwhile in sample s b and b aoa and nob played dominant roles during all functional microbes which roughly increased by 14 and 10 folds than those of raw water r also indicating the active archaea guiding nitrification process the highest dnb portion 96 otus appeared in the s c region which provided the predominant conditions of heterotrophic denitrification as the low do environment leaded competitive inhibition between heterotrophic bacteria zhang et al 2020 the number of nob 8 otus significantly suppressed in this region to support the occurrence of partial nitrification process it should be pointed out that when the loading concentration of nh4 n increased above 1 5 mg l 1 since day 62 62th 75th days aoa was inhibited significantly in s b and b samples fig s5 although the high loading concentration of nh4 n was beneficial to growing for aob seuntjens et al 2018 the growth rate of aob was slow munz et al 2012 which lead to the weak oxidation of nh4 n in environment accordingly the removal rates of nh4 n and tn in effluent dropt rapidly fig 1a and b considering above results aoa aob nob and dnb were affected significantly by the variation of biological environment and therefore altered the microbial metabolism behaviors associated with nitrogen transformations in reactor 3 2 2 spatial variation of microbial behaviors the spatial distributions in the abundance of main functional microbial communities archaea and bacteria were analyzed to confirm the selection of microbial behaviors on nitrogen transformations during the step wise change of biological environment all effective sequences of each sample were assigned to the corresponding taxonomy levels principal component analysis pca of community structures indicated that a clear distance between raw water and all other samples in the pca plots of tested archaea and bacteria existed fig 6 a which resulted from the shift of the microbial distributions detailed overviews of taxonomic assignments of archaea and bacteria fig 6b showed that 13 phyla were retrieved from each sample a significant separation of archaea occurred in the samples thaumarchaeota tremendously increased from 0 019 in raw water to 42 58 and 33 25 in sample s b and b respectively in sample s a and s c euryarchaeota roughly increased by 23 compared to that of raw water based on previous researches thaumarchaeota as a typical representative of the aoa stieglmeier et al 2014 inclined to survive under low do concentration and starvation conditions with insufficient substrate supply spang et al 2010 as evident in fig 3 the special environment of region s b and b provided a hotbed for thaumarchaeota growth especially at low ammonia and low do the growth rate of thaumarchaeota was better than other ammonia oxidizers e g heterotrophs and phytoplankton karner et al 2001 nakagawa and stahl 2013 stieglmeier et al 2014 thaumarchaeota exhibits a strong ammonia affinity as high as 200 fold than other discovered ammonia oxidizer so far walker et al 2010 therefore the nitrogen removal under low nh4 n loading in running was superior to that of high nh4 n loading as demonstrated by fig 1a and b at the bacteria level nearly all the relative abundances of bacteria declined except firmicutes in sample s c and b and proteobacteria therein as firmicutes was few proteobacteria became the sole dominant phyla it tremendously increased to 89 78 83 97 76 44 and 79 58 in sample s a s b s c and b from a relatively low 21 65 in raw water proteobacteria showed stronger competitive capacity than other microbes in our reactor as reported proteobacteria was the major phyla in hydrolysis and acidification jin et al 2018 and involved in heterotrophic denitrification and chemolithotrophic denitrification zhang et al 2020 moreover some proteobacteria could take part in nitrogen fixation wen et al 2016 the presence of proteobacteria supported a high probability of good denitrifying effect in the reactor firmicutes could hydrolyze protein and carbohydrates yi et al 2017 such microbes not only supported more nitrogen removal in reactor xu et al 2017 also provided energy for the microbial behaviors of nitrogen transformations in the reactor 3 2 3 temporal variation of microbial behaviors the temporal distributions in the abundance of main functional microbial communities archaea and bacteria were monitored to verify the effects of microbial behaviors on nitrogen transformations during the step wise change of biological environment the representative samples related to the overall phyla distributions at the beginning operated after 2 weeks 2 months and 100 days were collected and analyzed in archaea phyla distributions fig 7 a thaumarchaeota existed in samples from the first two weeks r s a s b and s c it was firstly discovered in sample b of 2 weeks and subsequently proliferated in sample b and s b a hypothesis can be proposed that thaumarchaeota was started to breed in the biofilm and gradually thrived in region s b these findings indicated that the upgraded gdsm reactor constructed an excellent breeding environment and provided a thriving space for thaumarchaeota hierarchical clustering analysis presented the relative abundance of thaumarchaeota at genus level fig 7b nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera as the genera of thaumarchaeota owned similar biological structures the cytoplasmic membranes could be surrounded by a single protein layer named nmpin which is a typically active thaumarchaeal parvulin by forming a catalytically active site hoppstock et al 2016 walker et al 2010 the specific structures supported that nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera can obtain energy by chemoautotrophy to accomplish oxidation of nh3 to no2 and assimilation of hco3 as c source through a spontaneously hydroxypropionate hydroxybutyrate cycle könneke et al 2012 the mass proliferation of nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera greatly contributed to ammonia nitrogen removal likewise the reduction of nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera during the 62 75d resulted in the decrease of cod removal as shown the relative abundance of nitrosopumilus reached to 30 45 and 24 85 in sample s b and b while presenting mere existence of 0 02 in sample r simultaneously the relative abundance of nitrososphaera increased from 0 11 in sample r to 12 71 and 10 03 in sample s b and b respectively nitrososphaera played a dominant role in ammonia oxidizing process since the second week of experiment nitrosopumilus gradually assisted nitrososphaera to sustain the ammonia oxidizing process in the reactor since the second month of the experiment fig 7 c and d showed the distinct bacteria phyla distributions and the growth patterns of the major nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria genus in temporal distributions comparatively proteobacteria increased up to 92 56 83 97 74 72 and 79 58 in sample s a s b s c and b from 21 65 in raw water for the nitrification process the ammonium oxidising genus nitrosospira seuntjens et al 2018 showed a decline trend in sample s b and b as time passing by even finally disappeared in sample b the ammonium oxidising genus nitrosomonas seuntjens et al 2018 increased in sample s c with continual running the relative abundance of nitrite oxidising genus nitrobacter was obvious higher than nitrobacter winkler et al 2015 in sample s a s b and b and hardly detected in sample s c it could be attributed that oxygen was preferential to bind the ammonium oxidising bacteria under insufficient do as nitrite oxidising bacteria had lower oxygen affinity than ammonium oxidising bacteria song et al 2018 the inhibition of nitrite oxidising bacteria supported the partial nitrification process in reactor previous studies reported that low substrate supply and anoxic condition were more beneficial for the growth of denitrification biomass guo et al 2018 as revealed in our study denitrification members including thauera rhodobacteraceae alcaligenes comamonadaceae and aliidiomarina chen et al 2016 du et al 2017 were found to be more abundant in sample s c after longer periods of operation fig 6d the relative total abundance of these denitrifying bacteria at the end of the experiment increased roughly 8 times than that at the beginning the whole bacterial community diversity was found to decline in reactor with declining temperature but denitrification species increased actually due to adapting the special environment cod and nitrite acted as the electron donor and the electron acceptor not only supported the partial nitrification and denitrification processes shen et al 2019 song et al 2018 but also guaranteed their significant removals in the reactor 3 3 functional gene expression and ecological complementation nitrogen removal depends on nitrogen cycle genes including anammox ammonia monooxygenase amoa ammonia monooxygenase nosz cytochrome cd1 containing nitrite reductase nirs copper containing nitrite reductase nirk membrane bound nitrate reductase narg periplasmic nitrate reductase napa dissimilatory nitrogen reductase nrfa hydrazine oxidoreductase hzo dinitrogenase reductase nifh hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao nitric oxidoreductase norb and nitrite oxidoreductase nxra nxrb shu et al 2016 their metabolic states have significant correlations with ecosystem functions cao et al 2019 3 3 1 quantification of nitrogen transformation genes gene shifts involved in nitrogen transformation estimated based on gene copy numbers provided more precise evidences to support the integration of nitrogen transformation for nitrogen removal the targeted genes included archaeal amoa bacterial amoa nxra nxrb and hao for partial nitrification and nitrification napa and narg for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrite dnrn nirs nirk norb nifh and nosz for denitrification and nrfa for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in the pca plots of nitrogen transformation genes fig s6 a clear distinction among sample s a s b s c and b was observed resulting from the difference of relatively abundance of the amoa aoa and denitrification genes gene copy numbers were enumerated as proxy to analyze the functional expression of genes the total bacterial 16s rrna ranged from 6 03 104 to 2 29 106 copies μl 1 at the sampling sites the ammonium conversion to nh2oh or no2 n was catalyzed by nitrifiers including ammonia monooxygenase amoa aob and amoa aoa genes feng et al 2018 as shown in fig 8 the abundance of amoa aoa gene in s b and b 30 5 19 73 copies μl 1 outnumbered that of amoa aob 0 48 0 13 copies μl 1 about 62 and 154 folds the results were accordant with above microbial community studies which was related with the nh4 oxidation gene of thaumarchaeota amoa aoa moreover the amoa aob relating to nitrosospira presented a high abundance in s a it could be attributed to the high do and sufficient nutrition supply in this region support suitable growing condition for nitrosospira the amoa aob relating to nitrosomonas was enriched in s c which guaranteed the no2 supply of anammox process as no2 was the electron acceptor in the process undertaken by anammox bacteria the gene copies of anammox hzo in s b s c and b were nearly 5 to 20 folds higher than those of raw water and s a fig 8 the result agreed with previous research in which low nitrogen strength was more favorable for the anammox existence guo et al 2018 ammonium is oxidized to dinitrogen gas using nitrite as the electron acceptor nh4 n 1 32 no2 n n2 0 26 no3 n under an anoxic or low do conditions and no organic carbon source is required in anammox process li et al 2019 the coupling of anammox amoa aoa and amoa aob was effective responsible for ammonia oxidation in upgraded gdsm reactor the hao gene was the key gene for the conversion of nh2oh to no2 n its abundance varied between 5 and 34 copies μl 1 in reactor which was nearly 2 18 folds higher than that of raw water 1 15 copies μl 1 conversion of no2 n to no3 n was catalyzed by nxra and nxrb genes which undertook the responsibility that consumed no2 n to produce no3 n in s a the nxra gene abundance ranged from 0 013 to 7 71 copies μl 1 the abundance of nxrb gene was 779 copies μl 1 in b which was roughly increased by 600 compared with that of the raw water clearly conversion of no2 n to no3 n relied on the nxra genes in s a nxra and nxrb genes in b the accumulation of no2 n had negative impacts on microbial ability shu et al 2016 however the existence of the denitrification and anammox genes was beneficial to eliminating the adverse effect via consuming no2 n thus facilitated the removal of tn notably napa and narg involved in dissimilatory nitrogen reduction were more abundant nearly 2 3 orders of magnitude in s c than other samples nirs and nirk could encode nitrite reductases with equivalent function but different structure i e a copper or a cytochrome cd1 containing enzyme kim et al 2016 thus mainly involved in the conversion of no2 n to no these genes were nearly 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher in s c and b than other samples the nrfa gene was the driven gene of conversion of no2 n and no3 n to nh4 n shu et al 2016 the nrfa gene abundance was increased in sample s b s c and b compared to sample r indicating that nrfa gene participated to provide nh4 n for anammox process additionally nosz gene which involved in the conversion of n2o to n2 displayed the maximum gene copies in sample s c compared to other 4 samples 81 58 copies μl 1 but the key gene of norb for converting no to n2o was the most abundant in sample b 55 83 copies μl 1 the copy number of nifh 188 copies μl 1 in s c showed a significant difference with other samples nifh gene can provided nh4 n substrate for anammox and amoa through encoding dinitrogenase reductase to achieve n2 fixation 3 3 2 ecological complementation of nitrogen transformation genes the integration of the genes with complementary functions holds great potential for improving nitrogen removal efficiency as displayed in table s4 the pairs of nosz nirs nirk nosz narg napa nosz nifh nirs nirk narg napa nirs nirk hzo nirs nirk hao narg napa hzo narg napa hao nxrb nxra nxrb nxrb norb nxra nxrb norb and hzo hao showed significant positive correlation their pearson correlation coefficients r all exceeded 0 9265 p 0 05 concretely four genes for denitrification and dnrn nirs nirk narg napa could provide no2 n and no for no2 which undertook the substrate for nosz gene thus it was demonstrated that nosz nirs nirk and nosz narg napa showed mutually beneficial relationship nosz gene provided n2 for nifh gene narg napa provided no2 n for nirs nirk and hzo under anoxic condition thus the pair of nosz nifh nirs nirk narg napa nirs nirk hzo and narg napa hzo showed a significantly collaborative relationship apparently nirs nirk hao narg napa hao nxrb norb nxra nxrb norb and hzo hao existed in the nitrification partial nitrification denitrification dnrn and anammox processes respectively suggesting that there was a symbiosis relationship among them dnrn and denitrifying gene were chemolithotrophic which were capable to utilize organic carbon as the source of electron donor shortly nitrogen transformations were influenced by the variation of biological environment the strenghth of substrate supply and do concentration based on gene taxonomic evidences the nitrogen transformation pathways in the reactor integrated various transformation routes according to the presence of external environment and specified nitrogen transformation route the system was divided into four functional regions a conceptual model for the potential gene interactions associated with nitrogen transformation along with water flow was presented in fig 9 in top s a region of the reactor s a due to the presence of adequate do and nutrition nitrification was the dominant pathway of nitrogen transformation which was droven by amoa aob hao and nxra drove with water further flowing into the s c region do concentration went down to a anoxic level and the substrate supply was limited nitrogen transformation route shifted toward the processes of partial nitrification anammox dnrn denitrification dnra next when liquid flowed into the s b region do concentration increased to a micro aerobic level because of low aeration and the substrate supply strength gradually declined in this area amoa aoa hao nxrb nxra narg nirk and norb achieved the nitrogen transformation routes of partial nitrification dnra dnrn denitrification and anammox processes lastly an intergation of nitrification denitrification dnra dnrn and anammox processes appeared in membrane biofilm thus an endogenous integration of various microbial conversion pathways relating to nitrogen transformation was achieved in the single system for enhancing nitrogen removal 3 4 applicability assessments the performance of upgraded gdsm was compared with reported gdm and mbr to assess the applicability of upgraded gdsm for the water treatment as shown in table s5 nh4 n tn and cod of gdm were removed at maximum levels of 18 17 and 70 depending on biofilm effect lee et al 2019 obviously the removal efficiencies of our system were significantly superior to the normal gdm due to the upgradation furthermore compared to the fluctuant removal efficiency of conventional mbr upgraded gdsm had robust performances for contaminant removals the energy consumptions were calculated to assess the economic efficiency of the upgraded gdsm the specific calculation process of energy consumptions was described in text s3 in si all of the coefficients were presented in table s6 the energy consumption of system was calculated at 0 022 kwh m3 the energy consumptions of normal mbr were ranged from 0 45 to 6 1 kwh m3 table s5 the gdm and mbr had ultra low energy consumptions of 0 18 kwh m3 and 0 040 kwh m3 although the same gravity driven modes were operated the energy consumption of the upgraded gdsm was more satisfactory evidently the upgraded gdsm is a promising membrane technology for water treatment 4 conclusions in this study an integration of various nitrogen transformation pathways was developed in a single pilot scale upgraded gdsm bioreactor which enhanced nitrogen removal from back washing water of sand filter the major conclusions and outcomes include a high level removal of nitrogen and cod was achieved in a single reactor with the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n tn and cod at 94 68 2 55 55 16 5 53 and 80 17 6 75 respectively the do and substrate supply exhibited multiple stratified variation in reactor thus affected the distributions and relative abundance of aoa aob nob and dnb these microbial communities in turn impacted the nitrogen biotransformation ability thaumarchaeota selectively populated in the low do region and biofilm resulting in higher and faster oxidation of nh4 n coexistence of partial nitritation bacteria nitrosopumilus nitrososphaera nitrosomonas and nitrobacter and denitrification bacteria thauera rhodobacteraceae alcaligenes comamonadaceae and aliidiomarina was responsible for the stability of the anammox process qpcr analysis indicated that a more diverse nitrogen transformation genes co existed in this single gdsm system achieving endogenous integration of denitrification nitrification nitrification anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to contribute to the nitrogen removal the analyses of pearson correlation coefficients revealed that the functional gene pairs of nitrogen transformation were complementary declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

gene expressions involved in the nitrogen transformations were estimated by qpcr to explore the shifts of dominant nitrogen transforming bioreactions in multiple stratified environments pearson

effectively but need to consume a large amount of aeration energy du et al 2020 pna could be able to occur in low do and substrate supply with no extra organic carbon required but is unstable liu et al 2019 denitrification could eliminate nitrate and total nitrogen tn but needs enough organics to be involved in the process as carbon source deng et al 2020 thus it can be seen that the successful integration of these microbial conversion pathways to complement each other might break through the traditional bondage of biological nitrogen removal process however the driven microbes aoa aob anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers of these microbial conversion pathways are prone to grow in their respective favorable environments liu et al 2017 wen et al 2017 thus it is difficulty to coexist in a single system therefore creating a multiple environment in a single system might be a key breakthrough and is promising in real engineering gravity driven membrane gdm reactor might be an available technology to create a multiple environment due to its unique advantages active microbial behaviors and slow flowing model etc chang et al 2019 however the previous upflow feeding mode in gdm chomiak et al 2014 chomiak et al 2015 huang et al 2009 kohler et al 2014 leads the bulk liquid to be homogeneous with the raw water hindering the formation of the multiple environment therefore most studies on gdm until now just focused on the role of biofilm on membrane performance such as the effects of biofilm natures e g the physical structure and biological degradation derlon et al 2014 liu et al 2020 song et al 2019 the compositions of microbial community tang et al 2018 wu et al 2017 or the predation behavior of eukaryotic derlon et al 2014 derlon et al 2012 and metazoa organisms tang et al 2018 while the function of bulk liquid has been seldom studied considering gdm features and the current gap in the previous studies of conventional nitrogen removal processes we artificially controlled the water flow configuration to create a favorable and multiple stratified environment in bulk liquid thereby tailoring that the functional microbial communities and genes distributed on different spatial and temporal regions and performed their dominant functions the process achieved high effective integration of the diverse nitrogen transformation paths a pilot scale upgraded gravity driven submerged membrane gdsm reactor was built up by installing water baffles to control water flow process the reactor was fed with back washing water from a sand filter and operated for 100 days in harbin mopanshan water treatment plant the removal performances of nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand cod were monitored in the whole process high throughput sequencing was conducted to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of microbial communities quantitative pcr qpcr was performed to confirm the functional gene expressions in multiple regions to elucidate the microbial conversion pathways of nitrogen removal in gdsm 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation a pilot scale upgraded gdsm reactor with a total volume of 400 l was set up in mopanshan drinking water treatment plant heilongjiang province china as delineated by the schematic illustration in fig 1 the moving water baffles were installed in the reactor to regulate liquid flowing consuming do and substrate supply to produce a multiple stratified environment in bulk liquid the reactor was set three sampling points as a b and c a group of hollow fiber polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf sino euro institute of membrane technology china membranes with an effective membrane area of 2 2 m2 and a mean pore size of 0 08 μm were vertically submerged into the bottom of reactor an air diffuser was set at the bottom of the membrane module with an intensity of air aeration at 0 025 l min 1 m 3 the hydrostatic transmembrane pressure was steadily controlled at 150 mbar through an overflow port in the feed tank the average membrane flux was approximately 4 l m 2 h 1 backwash water of sand filter was performed as the feed water and pumped into a storage tank the characteristics of feed water were summarized in table s1 in supplementary information si the experiment was conducted for 100 days and the parameters of water quality were continuously monitored the specific analysis methods of do total organic carbon toc tn cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n were described in text s1 in si 2 2 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing dna was extracted using e z n a soil dna kit omega norcross ga usa from aqueous and biofilm samples according to the instructions from the manufacturer then dna integrity was checked with gel electrophoresister analytic jena germany finally the extracted dna 6 46 19 3 ng μl 1 of archaea and bacteria were examined for yield purity and suitability by qubit 2 0 dna kit life technologies usa extracted dna of archaea was amplified by three steps shown below firstly m 349f and gu1st 1000r primer pair was used then 16s rrna gene v3 v4 region primer pair set 349f ccctacacgacgctcttccgatctn

uncalled bases with lower than 50bp were removed by ureseach 5 2 236 for the metagenomic reads both overlapping and assembly were conducted the overlapped region was obtained with permitted error ratio less than 0 1 the reads that could not be overlapped were removed from the analysis data li et al 2016 2 3 otu based bio community structure analysis to identify 16s rrna genes sequences of measured samples were screened and matched to taxonomic reference file which were clustered into operational taxonomic units otu at a cutoff of 99 sequence identity otu information was aligned with sequences using the rdp database rdp classifier 2 10 1 based on bergey s taxonomy and computed for naïve bayesian assignment algorithm analysis which was attributed to a taxonomy with a confidence

efficiency ranged between 88 and 99 3 results and discussions 3 1 reactor performance and environmental effects 3 1 1 contaminant removal performance in upgraded gdsm reactor the concentrations of nh4 n tn and cod in influent and effluent were monitored during the 100 days operation to evaluate contaminants removal efficacy as shown in fig 2 the influent nh4 n and tn were in the ranges of 0 53 1 84 mg l 1 and 2 79 6 36 mg l 1 respectively in first 15 days of start up operation as the organic nitrogen containing ingredients of membrane fell off into the effluent fig s1 the effluent of tn was higher than that of influent and the system did not reach a stable state the stable operational period started at 15th day the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn in the stable operational period were 94 68 2 55 and 55 16 5 53 respectively in addition the cod was also notably eliminated by 80 17 6 75 interestingly when the influent nh4 n was increased above 1 5 mg l 1 by artificially adding the prepared ammonium chloride solution during day 62 75 the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn suddenly declined to 64 49 6 65 and 33 35 4 48 while the nh4 n was below 1 5 mg l 1 the upgraded gdsm reactor maintained high efficiency removal of nh4 n and tn despite the low temperature below 10 c the high nitrogen removal capacity of upgraded gdsm reactor might be attributed to the special environmental variations due to its unique structural features which will be further discussed in the following sections 3 1 2 influence of biological environment on contaminant removal performance in order to investigate the impact of biological environment on nitrogen removal the system performance operated at different conditions were compared via intuitive and accurate excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy the influent raw water effluent i keeping bulk liquids and biofilm effluent ii discharging bulk liquids but keeping biofilm and effluent iii discharging bulk liquid and washing out biofilm were collected for eem analysis as displayed in fig 3 when the bulk liquids and biofilm both were at steady states the protein like substances peak a chen et al 2003 extracellular polymeric substances eps peak b chen et al 2003 soluble microbial products smps peak c chen et al 2003 and humic like substances peak t1 chen et al 2006 were all eliminated and only a part of fulvic like substance peak t2 chen et al 2006 remained when the bulk liquid was discharged but biofilm retained only smps peak c was eliminated completely while protein like substances peak a and eps peak b weakened on the other hand when the bulk liquid was fully discharged and biofilm was washed out the reactor almost incapacitated to contaminant removals apparently it can be inferred that the bulk liquid located in the interior of upgraded gdsm reactor may play a significant role in enhancing contaminant removals to confirm the dominant role of microbial population rather than buffer function of bulk liquids in the process of contaminant removal the experimental water was sterilized and compared with normal water the results fig s2 indicated the microbial population supported the contaminant removal capability of bulk liquids in the system more detailed discussions about the microbial population in bulk liquid will be implemented in the following sections 3 1 3 multiple stratified variations of do and substrate supply the steady and slow flowing bulk liquids in the upgraded gdsm reactor might produce a multiple stratified environment raw water three samples s a s b and s c points in the reactor interior fig 1 together with the biofilm b were monitored do toc tn cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n as the representatives of the spatial do and substrate supply variations in gdsm fig 4 the do concentrations of sample s a s b s c and b 5 03 0 071 mg l 1 2 38 0 062 mg l 1 0 86 0 047 mg l 1 and 1 27 0 068 mg l 1 varied significantly and all notably lower than that of raw water 7 15 0 081 mg l 1 with the decrease of do the concentrations of no2 n increased continuously especially in s c region no2 n 0 26 0 007 mg l 1 was higher than other regions while no3 n 0 21 0 053 mg l 1 decreased significantly a high nitrite accumulation 6 65 folds of raw water was constantly maintained in s c region producing the successful preconditions for the partial nitrification and anammox reaction chen et al 2019b laureni et al 2016 liu et al 2019 meanwhile the changes of toc cod tn and nh4 n also showed a declining trend compared to raw water hence s a s b s c and b can be classified into high oxygen high nutrition region s a low oxygen low nutrition region s b anoxic low nutrition region s c and biofilm region b depending on the do and substrate supply it can be seen that the interior environment of the upgraded gdsm reactor was inhomogeneous and presented a multiple stratified variation since the environmental variation highly affected biochemical reactions jin et al 2018 the diverse microbial behaviors might occur in reactor 3 2 multiple microbial behaviors 3 2 1 microbial populations associated with nitrogen transformations monitoring variations of the biomasses and the functional microbes in the reactor could provide a profound understanding on the microbial behaviors bacterial counts in raw water three sampling locations s a s b and s c and biofilm b were measured to compare the biomasses fig s3 the result presented that the bacteria numbers in sample s a s b s c and b exceeded that of the sample r obviously the contaminant removal by the upgraded gdsm mainly depended on the growth of microorganisms in bulk liquid and biofilm mathematically the relative relation of growth rate of microorganisms and the efficiencies for nh4 n tn and cod removals was calculated according to monod equation in text s2 in si as shown in fig s4 the high correlation coefficients r2 0 8785 for nh4 n r2 0 7859 for cod and r2 0 8488 for tn implied good fitting of the nh4 n tn and cod concentrations mg l in effluent and the growth of bulk liquid and biofilm in improved gdsm using monod nh4 n monod cod and monod tn models the results indicated that the upgraded gdsm exhibited synchronous and high efficiency for nh4 n tn and cod removals the high removal efficiencies were mainly due to both the abundant microorganisms in bulk liquid and biofilm and microbial activity in bioreactor the removal regularity was consistent with the experiment data as stated before nitrification and partial nitrification initiation related bacteria aoa aob and nob heterotrophic denitrification initiation related bacteria dnb are key nitrogen transformation populations fitzgerald et al 2015 qiu et al 2010 sims et al 2012 urakawa et al 2012 metagenomic analysis was performed to investigate the distribution characteristics of aoa aob nob and dnb for different samples there were 281347 sequences on samples at 97 similarity using uclust algorithm for clustering gomez smith et al 2015 the shannon chao1 ace and simpson estimators of samples showed that the biodiversity changed along with the environmental variations during continuous operation especially for archaea table s3 otus were carried out to assess the specific distribution characteristics of aoa aob nob and dnb fig 5 as illustrated in raw water despite the high total otus only 23 aoa otus with a mere 0 5 abundance was detected and other functional microbes also showed relatively weak abundances i e 26 aob otus 3 nob otus and 5 dnb otus remarkably sample s a showed the highest outs portions of aob 118 otus and nob 74 otus suggesting a high activity of nitrification meanwhile in sample s b and b aoa and nob played dominant roles during all functional microbes which roughly increased by 14 and 10 folds than those of raw water r also indicating the active archaea guiding nitrification process the highest dnb portion 96 otus appeared in the s c region which provided the predominant conditions of heterotrophic denitrification as the low do environment leaded competitive inhibition between heterotrophic bacteria zhang et al 2020 the number of nob 8 otus significantly suppressed in this region to support the occurrence of partial nitrification process it should be pointed out that when the loading concentration of nh4 n increased above 1 5 mg l 1 since day 62 62th 75th days aoa was inhibited significantly in s b and b samples fig s5 although the high loading concentration of nh4 n was beneficial to growing for aob seuntjens et al 2018 the growth rate of aob was slow munz et al 2012 which lead to the weak oxidation of nh4 n in environment accordingly the removal rates of nh4 n and tn in effluent dropt rapidly fig 1a and b considering above results aoa aob nob and dnb were affected significantly by the variation of biological environment and therefore altered the microbial metabolism behaviors associated with nitrogen transformations in reactor 3 2 2 spatial variation of microbial behaviors the spatial distributions in the abundance of main functional microbial communities archaea and bacteria were analyzed to confirm the selection of microbial behaviors on nitrogen transformations during the step wise change of biological environment all effective sequences of each sample were assigned to the corresponding taxonomy levels principal component analysis pca of community structures indicated that a clear distance between raw water and all other samples in the pca plots of tested archaea and bacteria existed fig 6 a which resulted from the shift of the microbial distributions detailed overviews of taxonomic assignments of archaea and bacteria fig 6b showed that 13 phyla were retrieved from each sample a significant separation of archaea occurred in the samples thaumarchaeota tremendously increased from 0 019 in raw water to 42 58 and 33 25 in sample s b and b respectively in sample s a and s c euryarchaeota roughly increased by 23 compared to that of raw water based on previous researches thaumarchaeota as a typical representative of the aoa stieglmeier et al 2014 inclined to survive under low do concentration and starvation conditions with insufficient substrate supply spang et al 2010 as evident in fig 3 the special environment of region s b and b provided a hotbed for thaumarchaeota growth especially at low ammonia and low do the growth rate of thaumarchaeota was better than other ammonia oxidizers e g heterotrophs and phytoplankton karner et al 2001 nakagawa and stahl 2013 stieglmeier et al 2014 thaumarchaeota exhibits a strong ammonia affinity as high as 200 fold than other discovered ammonia oxidizer so far walker et al 2010 therefore the nitrogen removal under low nh4 n loading in running was superior to that of high nh4 n loading as demonstrated by fig 1a and b at the bacteria level nearly all the relative abundances of bacteria declined except firmicutes in sample s c and b and proteobacteria therein as firmicutes was few proteobacteria became the sole dominant phyla it tremendously increased to 89 78 83 97 76 44 and 79 58 in sample s a s b s c and b from a relatively low 21 65 in raw water proteobacteria showed stronger competitive capacity than other microbes in our reactor as reported proteobacteria was the major phyla in hydrolysis and acidification jin et al 2018 and involved in heterotrophic denitrification and chemolithotrophic denitrification zhang et al 2020 moreover some proteobacteria could take part in nitrogen fixation wen et al 2016 the presence of proteobacteria supported a high probability of good denitrifying effect in the reactor firmicutes could hydrolyze protein and carbohydrates yi et al 2017 such microbes not only supported more nitrogen removal in reactor xu et al 2017 also provided energy for the microbial behaviors of nitrogen transformations in the reactor 3 2 3 temporal variation of microbial behaviors the temporal distributions in the abundance of main functional microbial communities archaea and bacteria were monitored to verify the effects of microbial behaviors on nitrogen transformations during the step wise change of biological environment the representative samples related to the overall phyla distributions at the beginning operated after 2 weeks 2 months and 100 days were collected and analyzed in archaea phyla distributions fig 7 a thaumarchaeota existed in samples from the first two weeks r s a s b and s c it was firstly discovered in sample b of 2 weeks and subsequently proliferated in sample b and s b a hypothesis can be proposed that thaumarchaeota was started to breed in the biofilm and gradually thrived in region s b these findings indicated that the upgraded gdsm reactor constructed an excellent breeding environment and provided a thriving space for thaumarchaeota hierarchical clustering analysis presented the relative abundance of thaumarchaeota at genus level fig 7b nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera as the genera of thaumarchaeota owned similar biological structures the cytoplasmic membranes could be surrounded by a single protein layer named nmpin which is a typically active thaumarchaeal parvulin by forming a catalytically active site hoppstock et al 2016 walker et al 2010 the specific structures supported that nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera can obtain energy by chemoautotrophy to accomplish oxidation of nh3 to no2 and assimilation of hco3 as c source through a spontaneously hydroxypropionate hydroxybutyrate cycle könneke et al 2012 the mass proliferation of nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera greatly contributed to ammonia nitrogen removal likewise the reduction of nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera during the 62 75d resulted in the decrease of cod removal as shown the relative abundance of nitrosopumilus reached to 30 45 and 24 85 in sample s b and b while presenting mere existence of 0 02 in sample r simultaneously the relative abundance of nitrososphaera increased from 0 11 in sample r to 12 71 and 10 03 in sample s b and b respectively nitrososphaera played a dominant role in ammonia oxidizing process since the second week of experiment nitrosopumilus gradually assisted nitrososphaera to sustain the ammonia oxidizing process in the reactor since the second month of the experiment fig 7 c and d showed the distinct bacteria phyla distributions and the growth patterns of the major nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria genus in temporal distributions comparatively proteobacteria increased up to 92 56 83 97 74 72 and 79 58 in sample s a s b s c and b from 21 65 in raw water for the nitrification process the ammonium oxidising genus nitrosospira seuntjens et al 2018 showed a decline trend in sample s b and b as time passing by even finally disappeared in sample b the ammonium oxidising genus nitrosomonas seuntjens et al 2018 increased in sample s c with continual running the relative abundance of nitrite oxidising genus nitrobacter was obvious higher than nitrobacter winkler et al 2015 in sample s a s b and b and hardly detected in sample s c it could be attributed that oxygen was preferential to bind the ammonium oxidising bacteria under insufficient do as nitrite oxidising bacteria had lower oxygen affinity than ammonium oxidising bacteria song et al 2018 the inhibition of nitrite oxidising bacteria supported the partial nitrification process in reactor previous studies reported that low substrate supply and anoxic condition were more beneficial for the growth of denitrification biomass guo et al 2018 as revealed in our study denitrification members including thauera rhodobacteraceae alcaligenes comamonadaceae and aliidiomarina chen et al 2016 du et al 2017 were found to be more abundant in sample s c after longer periods of operation fig 6d the relative total abundance of these denitrifying bacteria at the end of the experiment increased roughly 8 times than that at the beginning the whole bacterial community diversity was found to decline in reactor with declining temperature but denitrification species increased actually due to adapting the special environment cod and nitrite acted as the electron donor and the electron acceptor not only supported the partial nitrification and denitrification processes shen et al 2019 song et al 2018 but also guaranteed their significant removals in the reactor 3 3 functional gene expression and ecological complementation nitrogen removal depends on nitrogen cycle genes including anammox ammonia monooxygenase amoa ammonia monooxygenase nosz cytochrome cd1 containing nitrite reductase nirs copper containing nitrite reductase nirk membrane bound nitrate reductase narg periplasmic nitrate reductase napa dissimilatory nitrogen reductase nrfa hydrazine oxidoreductase hzo dinitrogenase reductase nifh hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao nitric oxidoreductase norb and nitrite oxidoreductase nxra nxrb shu et al 2016 their metabolic states have significant correlations with ecosystem functions cao et al 2019 3 3 1 quantification of nitrogen transformation genes gene shifts involved in nitrogen transformation estimated based on gene copy numbers provided more precise evidences to support the integration of nitrogen transformation for nitrogen removal the targeted genes included archaeal amoa bacterial amoa nxra nxrb and hao for partial nitrification and nitrification napa and narg for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrite dnrn nirs nirk norb nifh and nosz for denitrification and nrfa for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in the pca plots of nitrogen transformation genes fig s6 a clear distinction among sample s a s b s c and b was observed resulting from the difference of relatively abundance of the amoa aoa and denitrification genes gene copy numbers were enumerated as proxy to analyze the functional expression of genes the total bacterial 16s rrna ranged from 6 03 104 to 2 29 106 copies μl 1 at the sampling sites the ammonium conversion to nh2oh or no2 n was catalyzed by nitrifiers including ammonia monooxygenase amoa aob and amoa aoa genes feng et al 2018 as shown in fig 8 the abundance of amoa aoa gene in s b and b 30 5 19 73 copies μl 1 outnumbered that of amoa aob 0 48 0 13 copies μl 1 about 62 and 154 folds the results were accordant with above microbial community studies which was related with the nh4 oxidation gene of thaumarchaeota amoa aoa moreover the amoa aob relating to nitrosospira presented a high abundance in s a it could be attributed to the high do and sufficient nutrition supply in this region support suitable growing condition for nitrosospira the amoa aob relating to nitrosomonas was enriched in s c which guaranteed the no2 supply of anammox process as no2 was the electron acceptor in the process undertaken by anammox bacteria the gene copies of anammox hzo in s b s c and b were nearly 5 to 20 folds higher than those of raw water and s a fig 8 the result agreed with previous research in which low nitrogen strength was more favorable for the anammox existence guo et al 2018 ammonium is oxidized to dinitrogen gas using nitrite as the electron acceptor nh4 n 1 32 no2 n n2 0 26 no3 n under an anoxic or low do conditions and no organic carbon source is required in anammox process li et al 2019 the coupling of anammox amoa aoa and amoa aob was effective responsible for ammonia oxidation in upgraded gdsm reactor the hao gene was the key gene for the conversion of nh2oh to no2 n its abundance varied between 5 and 34 copies μl 1 in reactor which was nearly 2 18 folds higher than that of raw water 1 15 copies μl 1 conversion of no2 n to no3 n was catalyzed by nxra and nxrb genes which undertook the responsibility that consumed no2 n to produce no3 n in s a the nxra gene abundance ranged from 0 013 to 7 71 copies μl 1 the abundance of nxrb gene was 779 copies μl 1 in b which was roughly increased by 600 compared with that of the raw water clearly conversion of no2 n to no3 n relied on the nxra genes in s a nxra and nxrb genes in b the accumulation of no2 n had negative impacts on microbial ability shu et al 2016 however the existence of the denitrification and anammox genes was beneficial to eliminating the adverse effect via consuming no2 n thus facilitated the removal of tn notably napa and narg involved in dissimilatory nitrogen reduction were more abundant nearly 2 3 orders of magnitude in s c than other samples nirs and nirk could encode nitrite reductases with equivalent function but different structure i e a copper or a cytochrome cd1 containing enzyme kim et al 2016 thus mainly involved in the conversion of no2 n to no these genes were nearly 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher in s c and b than other samples the nrfa gene was the driven gene of conversion of no2 n and no3 n to nh4 n shu et al 2016 the nrfa gene abundance was increased in sample s b s c and b compared to sample r indicating that nrfa gene participated to provide nh4 n for anammox process additionally nosz gene which involved in the conversion of n2o to n2 displayed the maximum gene copies in sample s c compared to other 4 samples 81 58 copies μl 1 but the key gene of norb for converting no to n2o was the most abundant in sample b 55 83 copies μl 1 the copy number of nifh 188 copies μl 1 in s c showed a significant difference with other samples nifh gene can provided nh4 n substrate for anammox and amoa through encoding dinitrogenase reductase to achieve n2 fixation 3 3 2 ecological complementation of nitrogen transformation genes the integration of the genes with complementary functions holds great potential for improving nitrogen removal efficiency as displayed in table s4 the pairs of nosz nirs nirk nosz narg napa nosz nifh nirs nirk narg napa nirs nirk hzo nirs nirk hao narg napa hzo narg napa hao nxrb nxra nxrb nxrb norb nxra nxrb norb and hzo hao showed significant positive correlation their pearson correlation coefficients r all exceeded 0 9265 p 0 05 concretely four genes for denitrification and dnrn nirs nirk narg napa could provide no2 n and no for no2 which undertook the substrate for nosz gene thus it was demonstrated that nosz nirs nirk and nosz narg napa showed mutually beneficial relationship nosz gene provided n2 for nifh gene narg napa provided no2 n for nirs nirk and hzo under anoxic condition thus the pair of nosz nifh nirs nirk narg napa nirs nirk hzo and narg napa hzo showed a significantly collaborative relationship apparently nirs nirk hao narg napa hao nxrb norb nxra nxrb norb and hzo hao existed in the nitrification partial nitrification denitrification dnrn and anammox processes respectively suggesting that there was a symbiosis relationship among them dnrn and denitrifying gene were chemolithotrophic which were capable to utilize organic carbon as the source of electron donor shortly nitrogen transformations were influenced by the variation of biological environment the strenghth of substrate supply and do concentration based on gene taxonomic evidences the nitrogen transformation pathways in the reactor integrated various transformation routes according to the presence of external environment and specified nitrogen transformation route the system was divided into four functional regions a conceptual model for the potential gene interactions associated with nitrogen transformation along with water flow was presented in fig 9 in top s a region of the reactor s a due to the presence of adequate do and nutrition nitrification was the dominant pathway of nitrogen transformation which was droven by amoa aob hao and nxra drove with water further flowing into the s c region do concentration went down to a anoxic level and the substrate supply was limited nitrogen transformation route shifted toward the processes of partial nitrification anammox dnrn denitrification dnra next when liquid flowed into the s b region do concentration increased to a micro aerobic level because of low aeration and the substrate supply strength gradually declined in this area amoa aoa hao nxrb nxra narg nirk and norb achieved the nitrogen transformation routes of partial nitrification dnra dnrn denitrification and anammox processes lastly an intergation of nitrification denitrification dnra dnrn and anammox processes appeared in membrane biofilm thus an endogenous integration of various microbial conversion pathways relating to nitrogen transformation was achieved in the single system for enhancing nitrogen removal 3 4 applicability assessments the performance of upgraded gdsm was compared with reported gdm and mbr to assess the applicability of upgraded gdsm for the water treatment as shown in table s5 nh4 n tn and cod of gdm were removed at maximum levels of 18 17 and 70 depending on biofilm effect lee et al 2019 obviously the removal efficiencies of our system were significantly superior to the normal gdm due to the upgradation furthermore compared to the fluctuant removal efficiency of conventional mbr upgraded gdsm had robust performances for contaminant removals the energy consumptions were calculated to assess the economic efficiency of the upgraded gdsm the specific calculation process of energy consumptions was described in text s3 in si all of the coefficients were presented in table s6 the energy consumption of system was calculated at 0 022 kwh m3 the energy consumptions of normal mbr were ranged from 0 45 to 6 1 kwh m3 table s5 the gdm and mbr had ultra low energy consumptions of 0 18 kwh m3 and 0 040 kwh m3 although the same gravity driven modes were operated the energy consumption of the upgraded gdsm was more satisfactory evidently the upgraded gdsm is a promising membrane technology for water treatment 4 conclusions in this study an integration of various nitrogen transformation pathways was developed in a single pilot scale upgraded gdsm bioreactor which enhanced nitrogen removal from back washing water of sand filter the major conclusions and outcomes include a high level removal of nitrogen and cod was achieved in a single reactor with the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n tn and cod at 94 68 2 55 55 16 5 53 and 80 17 6 75 respectively the do and substrate supply exhibited multiple stratified variation in reactor thus affected the distributions and relative abundance of aoa aob nob and dnb these microbial communities in turn impacted the nitrogen biotransformation ability thaumarchaeota selectively populated in the low do region and biofilm resulting in higher and faster oxidation of nh4 n coexistence of partial nitritation bacteria nitrosopumilus nitrososphaera nitrosomonas and nitrobacter and denitrification bacteria thauera rhodobacteraceae alcaligenes comamonadaceae and aliidiomarina was responsible for the stability of the anammox process qpcr analysis indicated that a more diverse nitrogen transformation genes co existed in this single gdsm system achieving endogenous integration of denitrification nitrification nitrification anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to contribute to the nitrogen removal the analyses of pearson correlation coefficients revealed that the functional gene pairs of nitrogen transformation were complementary declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17477,in this study we report for the first time the effect of prescribed fires on the export of dissolved organic matter dom and precursors of disinfectant by products dbps from periodically every 2 3 years and seasonally i e dormant and growing burned forest fuel materials i e live vegetation woody debris and detritus litter and duff and treatability of its rainwater leachate periodically applied every 2 3 years for 40 years prescribed fires decreased total fuel load 62 10 primarily detrital mass 75 2 however functional groups i e phenolic compounds proteins carbohydrates aromatic 1 ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and lipids attached to dom of ground solid materials did not change significantly outside rainwater leaching from forest fuel materials experiments showed that the leaching capacity of dissolved organic carbon doc from burned litter samples decreased by 40 20 regardless of burning season when compared to unburned litter samples the leaching of total dissolved nitrogen tdn dissolved organic nitrogen don ammonium nh4 and reactive phosphorus po4 3 from burned materials decreased between 40 and 70 when compared to unburned materials also dom composition was affected by prescribed fire which partially consumed humic like substances based on fluorescence analyses thus periodically applied prescribed fires also resulted in a reduction of trihalomethane thm 42 23 and haloacetic acid haa 42 20 formation potentials fps while doc normalized reactivity of thm and haa fps did not change significantly additionally the leaching of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma precursors bromide ion br and selected elements k ca mg mn fe s na b and al were not significantly affected by prescribed fires finally coagulant i e alum and ferric dose

prescribed fire dom leaching and composition dbp precursors coagulation 1 introduction climate change can result in more frequent and more severe and extended droughts these conditions may increase the probability of ignition and frequency and severity of wildfires bladon et al 2014 robinne et al 2018 westerling 2016 the type and amount of surface fuels i e a mixture of live vegetation woody debris and detritus litter oi horizon and duff oe oa horizons and their properties such as moisture and chemical content impact fuel flammability dharssi 2018 also wildfires may greatly impact detrital composition coates et al 2017 majidzadeh et al 2015 wang et al 2015 which is a primary terrestrial source of dissolved organic matter dom in source waters chow et al 2009 majidzadeh et al 2015 previous studies have shown that post wildfire runoff increased surface erosion thus mobilizing sediment fire generated materials i e ash and charred nutrients i e n and p and trace elements abraham et al 2017 nyman et al 2011 rhoades et al 2019 furthermore wildfires may change dom composition and concentration of precursors of disinfection by product dbps hohner et al 2016 revchuk and suffet 2014 uzun et al 2020 wang et al 2016 consequently treatability requirements for burned watershed derived dom can be different when compared to those exported from unburned watersheds hohner et al 2016 wang et al 2015 writer et al 2014 considering the widespread use of forested catchments for potable water production bladon et al 2014 nyman et al 2011 post fire rainstorms transporting burned surface fuel leachates to source waters pose a potential concern for drinking water production forest management techniques such as prescribed fire are vital tools used to maintain open and fire resilient forest structures that reduce potentially hazardous wildfire conditions and ignitions waldrop and goodrick 2012 although wildfire hazard reduction is one of the primary motivations for prescribed fire use in forest management it is also employed for many other objectives including but not limited to the control of undesired vegetative species aesthetics restoration and maintenance of fire dependent species and ecosystems and site preparation waldrop and goodrick 2012 it is known that prescribed fires may impact forest floor properties coates et al 2020 2017 most carbon fluxes come from forest floor leaching in the form of terrestrial dom cronan 2018 which is one of the main sources of dissolved organic carbon doc and the precursors of dbps entering source waters chen et al 2019 chow et al 2009 therefore it is very important to investigate the chemical composition of burned forest materials when considering water quality in source waters furthermore the amount of dom and its composition are important to consider in conjunction with the potential presence of dbp precursors and their treatability to date most studies connecting fire events to changes in source water quality have focused predominantly on wildfires chow et al 2019 hohner et al 2017 2016 uzun et al 2020 wang et al 2015 due to the severity and widespread impact of wildfires around the globe currently only a few relevant studies have been conducted to evaluate prescribed fire effects on water quality especially in the eastern united states hahn et al 2019 previously majidzadeh et al 2015 performed laboratory burning on the foliar litter of six plant species commonly found in the southeastern united states us and evaluated the chemical content and dbp formation potential fp of these materials majidzadeh et al 2015 the results showed that the total weight of litter and chemical properties per gram of material i e lignin nitrogenous compounds and polysaccharides were decreased in burned samples because of the loss of organic matter also doc and chloroform precursor leaching in water decreased in burned materials to test the effect of prescribed fire on water quality and dbp formation tsai et al 2015 designed another study where litter and duff mixtures from unburned and burned sites forests consisting mostly of pine trees were collected and soaked in water results were similar i e lower doc and dbp for these two studies finally we reported that long term prescribed fire use may decrease doc total dissolved nitrogen tdn nh4 and the fps of regulated trihalomethanes thms four species and haloacetic acids haas five species majidzadeh et al 2019 although these relevant studies provided useful information comprehensive studies detailing the effects of dynamic events i e application of burning season deterioration of the materials under different weathering conditions on dom and dbp precursors originating from unburned vs burned forest materials are still lacking therefore the objectives of this study were to examine i fire frequency frequent and repeated prescribed burning every 2 3 years for 40 years and season dormant or growing season burns on the export of dom and selected dbp precursors regulated thms haas and emerging chloral hydrate ch n nitrosodimethylamine ndma from forest fuels ii the changes in dom molecular composition and iii the removal of dom and dbp precursors with commonly used coagulants i e alum and ferric salts from leachate waters of forest materials prescribed fire reduces potentially hazardous wildland fuel components and enhances habitat for many wildlife species waldrop and goodrick 2012 understanding how it may impact the chemistry of burned forest materials the potential export of dom and dbp precursors and their treatability may better inform forest managers and prescribed fire practitioners about the multi faceted dynamics that should be considered when utilizing prescribed fire to achieve land management objectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and prescribed fires this study was conducted at the tom yawkey wildlife center 33 23 n 79 22 w in georgetown south carolina sc us the average annual precipitation and temperature in the area were approximately 1400 mm 3 83 mm day and 18 c from 1981 2010 respectively south carolina state climatology office scsco 2010 two paired forest ecosystems primarily composed of longleaf pinus palustris miller and loblolly p taeda l pine turkey oak quercus laevis walter and sweetgum liquidambar styraciflua l coates et al 2017 2018a were located at this study site and differed in their long term management strategies unmanaged site a had not been burned or harvested from 1978 to 2014 site b had been burned every 2 3 years over that same time period the most recent burn had been performed in 2014 site b fig 1 to accomplish our research objectives composite fuel samples forest materials live vegetation woody debris detritus litter and duff ash and charred materials burned sites only were collected from the unmanaged site site a and the previously burned sites site b before additional seasonal prescribed burns were conducted in 2015 in 2015 six units 0 01 0 02 km2 each in site b were burned three units during the dormant season mar 9 11 2015 and three units during the growing season may 5 6 2015 the prescribed burns represented typical dormant and growing season ignitions implemented by the sc department of natural resources at the tom yawkey wildlife center to reduce potentially hazardous wildland fuels maintain open forest conditions and improve wildlife habitat for the red cockaded woodpecker dryobates borealis vioeillot all burns were head fires and mean flame lengths in each of the burns were approximately 0 3 1 0 m which is characteristic of low intensity low severity fires in this region coates et al 2018a fire temperatures were recorded using in situ thermocouple datalogger assemblies average peak burning temperatures ranged between 200 and 315 c coates et al 2018b 2 2 material collection and leaching experiment design sample collection frames 1 m x 1 m were placed on the ground every 50 m along a 300 m linear transect within each treatment unit fig 1 all live and dead vegetation fine woody debris 7 62 cm diameter woodall and liknes 2008 litter duff ash and charred materials when present were collected within these frames following site b prescribed burns this represented a mixture of both burned partially charred and unburned materials due to the nature of the low intensity and severity prescribed burns collected materials were oven dried at 70 c for no less than 48 hrs immediately after collection to obtain oven dry fuel mass composite fuel samples were randomly selected from each of the following treatment prescribed burning applied units for additional experiments site a unmanaged site b pre burned site b dormant season post burn site b growing season post burn one kg mixtures of collected materials from the unmanaged and burned plots were packed in aluminum screens 1 mm x 1 mm mesh size these wrapped samples were then individually placed in custom made open top aluminum trays 0 6 m x 0 6 m x 0 3 m an empty control tray was also placed in the open field with the sample trays to capture unimpeded rainwater figs 1 and s1 a weather station was located next to the trays which recorded precipitation air temperature pressure humidity and wind speed every 15 min fig 1 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 pyrolysis analysis with ground solid samples to examine the effect of prescribed fires on the chemical structure of detritus materials ground solid materials were subjected to pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms samples were oven dried for no less than 48 hrs and ground using a wiley mill 2 mm one to two mg of these materials were then inserted into quartz tubes for chemical analysis following methods described elsewhere coates et al 2017 song and peng 2010 2 3 2 leachate water collection for nearly a year when precipitation fell over the trays in the field leachate water of each tray was collected in glass carboys total volume of each carboy 23 l located underneath each tray as rain saturated the material and drained through the trays figure s1 the amount of daily precipitation and the volume of tray leachates were recorded for each rain event figures s2 and s3 the ability to hold water was not significantly different p 0 05 for each treatment where the difference was 7 in total volume collected in the trays figure s3 after leachate water collection samples were transferred into pre cleaned 1l amber bottles immediately filtered with pre burned and pre washed glass filters whatman 934 ah 0 7 µm pore sized and kept in the refrigerator at 4 c until water quality and dbp tests were conducted within one week after collection during the leachate water collection period temperatures dropped below freezing only a few times and the average temperature 19 c between jan 1 and nov 1 2016 approximated the historical 1981 2010 average temperature of 18 c for this region figure s4 several lengthy wet periods were observed but only two relatively dry periods occurred when the average precipitation was less than the historical average precipitation of 3 83 mm day mar 15 may 30 2016 1 84 mm day and oct 1 nov 30 2016 0 02 mm day except for three rainy days a total of 33 rain events producing a considerable amount of leachate water were recorded but detailed measurements were conducted for nine selected events three initial flushes jan 15 jan 23 and feb 5 three events during relatively dry periods mar 15 mar 28 and may 14 the first significant flush after a dry period may 31 one event during a relatively wet period aug 12 and an additional event following a dry period nov 14 the export of dom never reached zero and the total volume was collected in the trays therefore concentrations of selected parameters i e doc tdn dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved reactive phosphorus po4 3 for 24 unexamined rain events were approximated using linear interpolation cumulative exports were calculated using the following formula c1 x v1 c2 x v2 cn x vn where c and v were measured for nine samples or calculated for 24 samples concentrations mg l and volumes l of the samples collected during each rain event respectively the trays were open top therefore bird feces or other potential contaminants were removed in the few instances they were detected due to the nature of this field experiment it was not possible to completely exclude the impacts of these unwanted materials especially in nutrient concentrations 2 3 3 water quality dbp and water treatability tests during the

leachate water was insufficient 2 l for all water quality and dbp tests it was discarded and carboys were cleaned immediately dbp fp tests were conducted in the presence of excess oxidants for an extended contact time five days to measure the maximum formations in the samples initially ph was adjusted to 7 8 with 20 mm phosphate buffer to mimic typical finished water ph levels in drinking water treatment plants dwtps for thm haa and ch fp tests initial oxidant chlorine cl2 stock 5 6 available cl2 spiking doses were calculated by using the formula 3 x doc 7 6 x nh4 10 krasner et al 2004 after five days of reaction at room temperature 21 22 c in 125 ml amber bottles headspace free residual cl2 always 10 mg l was measured and quenched with a slightly higher dose of ascorbic acid than stoichiometrically required ndma fp tests were performed with spiking pre formed monochloramine nh2cl stock solution cl2 n 4 1 by weight prepared by the slow drop by drop at ph 9 0 addition of cl2 into the ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 solution jones et al 2012 initial nh2cl doses applied to the samples were 100 mg l after 5 days of contact time at room temperature residual oxidants always 40 mg l were measured and quenched with a slight excess amount of sodium thiosulfate than stoichiometrically required finally samples were extracted and analyzed with gc ecd and gc ms ms for thm haa and ch and ndma respectively concentrations of free and total chlorine were determined following standard method 4500 cl f apha awwa wef 2012 selected unfiltered leachate water samples were treated with alum al2 so4 318h20 and ferric chloride fecl3 before each water treatability test preliminary jar test experiments were performed at ph 6 0 0 1 a varying amount of carbonate buffer naoh and hcl were used as needed with six doses 10 15 20 30 40 and 50 mg l for alum and 5 7 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l for fecl3 of coagulant a typical enhanced coagulation practice to determine the optimal doc uv254 and turbidity removals based on the results optimum removal conditions highest removals reached with the lowest coagulant dose were selected figure s5 then additional tests i e doc and dbp fp removals were conducted with the treated waters under pre selected optimum treatment conditions and percent removal efficiencies were calculated with the following formula co ctre co x 100 where co and ctre are concentrations of raw and treated waters respectively detailed descriptions for general water quality optical properties fluorescence spectroscopy analysis of dbps sample extraction and quantification treatability tests analytical methods and minimum reporting levels mrls table s1 were presented elsewhere majidzadeh et al 2019 ruecker et al 2017 uzun et al 2020 2018 and in the supporting information si a two tailed student s t test with a significance level of 0 05 was performed to document statistically significant differences where necessary 3 results and discussion 3 1 prescribed fire alters fuel mass distribution fuel height in both the unmanaged and pre burned sites was 30 50 cm coates et al 2017 however total fuel mass kg m2 of composite fuel samples was significantly higher in the long term unmanaged site a 4 48 0 11 kg m2 p 0 05 than the frequently burned site b pre burned 1 73 0 51 kg m2 figure s6 live fuels were not detected in the samples collected after seasonal prescribed fires because they were consumed during the prescribed fires fine woody debris mass 7 62 cm diameter was similar p 0 05 for both unmanaged and managed sites regardless of the burning season fine woody debris is often quite heterogeneous across a given landscape often at a resolution as small as 0 25 m2 in frequently burned pine systems loudermilk et al 2017 often fast moving low intensity low severity surface fires may not completely consume woody debris 7 62 cm in diameter these fuel particles may only be partially charred therefore significant differences between burned and unburned forests or pre and post fire masses within burned forests may not be detected this was observed because of the burns at the tom yawkey center where incomplete combustion of woody debris resulted from the prescribed fires prescribed fires may also increase the smallest size class of woody debris 0 64 cm diameter immediately post fire due to mortality of live understory vegetation during a burn event this may have been reflected in the woody debris results for the pre fire masses in site b as well it should be noted that larger woody debris 7 62 cm diameter were not included therefore inferences about those larger fuels cannot be made as a result of this study detritus mass 3 68 0 47 kg m2 in unmanaged site a was significantly greater p 0 05 than site b 0 89 0 10 kg m2 this indicated the continuous consumption of detritus as a result of frequent prescribed fires in site b since pre burned materials were collected from site b about 1 year after 2015 the last prescribed fire 2014 higher detritus mass 0 89 0 10 kg m2 was observed compared to mass that was collected right after seasonal burns 0 20 0 05 0 52 0 11 kg m2 for dormant and growing season burns respectively this can be associated with the accumulation of litter between 2014 and 2015 and the consumption of such materials during seasonal prescribed burns consequently the combination of fuel mass changed more woody substances and less detrital materials per unit weight kg of the materials collected from burned sites these observations further support that prescribed burning consumes detritus materials changing both their mass and depth coates et al 2017 cronan et al 2015 3 1 1 prescribed fire does not alter functional groups attached dom phenolic compounds i e lignin like constituted about 76 10 higher than unmanaged samples of all burned samples regardless of management which can be related to incomplete combustion of the materials during prescribed fires coates et al 2017 in contrast to the significant decrease in detrital mass prescribed burning did not significantly change the detrital chemical functional groups proteins nitrogen compounds carbohydrates oxygen compounds and lipids aliphatic compounds figure s7 the aromatic compounds were found in higher concentrations in unmanaged samples a higher level of toluene was observed in unmanaged samples compared to burned samples coates et al 2017 previous studies reported conflicting results on the formation and fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs after burning while some researchers reported an elevated level of pah formation which survived and remained for a long period forbes et al 2006 vergnoux et al 2011a others indicated that pahs are transported into the soil quickly in only a few months post fire pah levels may return to pre fire levels kim et al 2003 in our study pahs constituted only 2 3 of the total biomass regardless of the treatment figure s7 this indicated that the effect of prescribed burning on pah formation was minimal possibly due to incomplete combustion of the detritus resulting from low intensity burning chen et al 2018 coates et al 2017 3 2 prescribed fire affects water quality carbon nitrogen and phosphorus release the average doc value was minimal 1 64 1 15 mg l for rainwater collected in control trays control water cw for litter trays doc values were 41 3 15 8 mg l 23 7 10 4 mg l 22 5 9 1 mg l and 23 5 9 4 mg l in leachates from unmanaged water uw managed pre burned water mpw post dormant season burn water dsw and post growing season burn water gsw respectively similarly as shown in fig 2 a during the initial seven samples initial flushes n 3 dry period n 3 and the first flush after dry period n 1 average doc releases from unmanaged samples 45 48 53 mg l were significantly higher p 0 05 than doc releases from other burned leachate samples 24 28 26 28 and 21 27 mg l for mpw dsw and gsw respectively after this period significantly p 0 05 lower doc concentrations were measured in all samples uw 24 mg l and others 13 17 mg l during the relatively wet period sampling aug 12 and finally the levels were similar 11 17 mg l for the last samples nov 14 regardless of management fig 2a doc leaching trends during initial flushes in relatively colder periods indicated gradually decreased leaching capacity of material for all treatments however opposite trends for the relative drier and warmer periods indicated that microbial activity may have played a role in enhanced doc export from all litters overall cumulative doc export values 16 9 gram for 400 l from unmanaged materials 8 9 gram for 380 l were significantly higher p 0 05 than the export values from managed samples fig 3 a results indicated that long term prescribed burning can decrease doc leaching capacity of forest litter majidzadeh et al 2019 2015 and burning season does not significantly p 0 05 affect this result this might be related to loss of carbon during the burning process hongve 1999 vergnoux et al 2011b and consumption of materials i e detritus that have a relatively higher potential of doc leaching zhang 2017 particularly detrital mass however it should not be forgotten that these results were obtained from burned and unburned substances and their leachates other natural factors hydrology geology soil properties erosion etc not accounted for by the tray design play a significant role in dom export during the experiment average suva254 values showed fluctuations in the control water however those were comparable for all leachate water samples 2 9 3 3 l mg m regardless of the treatment fig 2b this indicated that these prescribed fires did not likely change overall aromaticity krasner et al 1996 of the leachate water derived from the litter materials however in general higher suva254 values were observed as time progressed this indicated that the leaching rate of non aromatic compounds may have been faster than the leaching rate of aromatic compounds regardless of management strategy opposing trends were observed for samples collected after a long dry period between mar 28 and may 14 from the unmanaged leachate as indicated before this period was dry and the air temperature was relatively warm 18 c previous studies indicated that decomposition of newly generated compounds is related to charring intensity and fuel source baldock and smernik 2002 coates et al 2017 czimczik et al 2003 masiello et al 2002 thus our observations indicated that newly formed phenolic compounds and pahs in the burned samples were not significantly affected by long dry periods and continued to release from burned litters as time progressed in general no2 and no3 concentrations were governed by cw and values were mostly lower than minimum reporting levels mrls data not shown however tdn don and nh4 n concentrations were mostly higher in unmanaged leachate water than burned leachate waters ranging from 1 03 to 2 72 0 72 to 1 73 and 0 13 to 1 80 mg l respectively figs 2c s8a and s8b like doc trends the cumulative export of don and tdn were significantly higher in unmanaged samples fig 3b and c it has been shown that at temperatures of 200 500 c nitrogen volatilizes and most of the organic matter is released to the atmosphere knicker 2007 waldrop and goodrick 2012 thus decreases in nitrogen concentrations in burned litter samples can primarily be related to the volatilization of nitrogen during combustion majidzadeh et al 2015 finally the ratios of doc don in all samples were mostly comparable except for the first significant flush after a dry period may 31 fig 2d when doc don was considerably higher in burned samples this may indicate that don leaching in burned materials is more sensitive to dry conditions phosphorus leaching from burned materials was higher than leaching from unburned samples during the initial six samples fig 2e the values reached similar levels 0 4 mg l after the initial sampling was completed therefore the cumulative export of phosphorus in uw dsw and gsw samples was comparable fig 3d however lower concentrations were measured in managed mpw it has been shown that burning can cause the short term release of phosphorus which can be consumed quickly by live vegetation zhang 2017 relatively higher concentrations for post dormant and growing season burns can be associated with fresh burning and the release of po4 3 during fires however decreased po4 3 concentrations in mpw samples can be associated with consumption of freshly released po4 3 by live vegetation between the latest fire application date 2014 and the sample collection date 2015 however these results showed that continuous management with prescribed fire may decrease po4 3 concentrations significantly up to 60 by the subsequent fire initiated release and live vegetation consumption processes 3 3 prescribed fire does not affect the release of bromide and other elements the concentration of br in all leachate water samples varied over time and was mostly governed by cw for the initial four samples jan 15 and 23 feb 5 and mar 15 bromide concentration in cw was 16 µg l and in all other samples it was 22 25 µg l fig 2f following these initial samples bromide concentrations decreased sharply and most were under mrl 10 µl table s1 previously we indicated that the release of bromide from burned materials could be elevated due to high temperature combustion wang et al 2015 however in this study bromide concentrations in unmanaged and managed litter leachates were similar this showed that low intensity low severity prescribed fires are not likely to affect bromide release from litter samples it has been shown that fires can cause more trace element fluxes than other types of land use changes but the effect is element specific abraham et al 2017b potthast et al 2017 after prescribed fires some parameters electrical conductivity ec p and k recovered fast 1 year but some others ph c n ca2 and mg2 took more time for recovery in the natural environment alcañiz et al 2016 particularly high intensity fires can cause the volatilization of elements debano 1990 since high temperatures are required for this process no i e mg2 ca2 and mn debano 1990 or limited i e k and s debano and conrad 1978 effects of high intensity fires on element volatilization have been previously reported in this study during the sample collection period dissolved concentrations of elements did not show a significant difference between samples except mn for unmanaged leachate waters figure s9 in general concentrations increased during the long dry period mar 15 may 30 indicating the accumulation of these elements in the litter then during the wet rainy period may 1 nov 15 most of the accumulated elements were flushed out of the samples taken together these results showed that prescribed fires at the tom yawkey center did not affect the leaching capacity or processing of trace elements from the forest materials significantly 3 4 prescribed fire consumes terrestrial derived dom it has been shown that eem regions and fluorescence indices can provide useful information about dom fellman et al 2010 and fires can cause changes in these parameters hohner et al 2016 revchuk and suffet 2014 uzun et al 2020 despite the interference of iron reported previously hohner et al 2016 homann et al 2011 the effect of iron interference is expected to be minimal in our samples due to low levels 0 11 mg l including the effect of cw during the experiment we selected six dates jan 15 and 23 may 14 and 31 aug 12 and nov 14 representing all previously stated distinct periods and eem regions and fluorescence indices of dom in leachate waters were measured the data table 1 indicated that repeated burning every 2 3 years could decrease fluorescence intensities particularly smp and humic like doc eq calculated as percent volume of the region 100 x doc mg l in dom this supported lower doc concentrations in pre burn samples compared to unburned samples furthermore the data showed that fresh burning regardless of season can cause further decreases in all eem doc eq regions and consume particularly humic like substances right after a dry period however all eem regions of dom increased in uw and mpw samples which might be related to the combination of both biotic and abiotic factors in trays figure s10 however we cannot provide detailed information as these factors spanned beyond our research purposes a substantial reduction in all regions was observed during the wet period this pattern was obvious in all samples but particularly noticeable in uw and mpw samples indicating the decreased leaching potential of all materials finally hix indices also provided information about the dom source where hix 6 indicates terrestrial dom and hix 4 implies biological or aquatic origin kalbitz 2001 our results showed that prescribed fires can consume particularly terrestrial derived dom however none of the other fluorescence indices i e fi e2 e3 and β α were significantly affected by prescribed fires indicating that the source mostly terrestrial and molecular weight of dom in leachate waters were mostly similar regardless of management 3 5 prescribed fire does not change the reactivity of dbp precursors average thm fp haa fp and ch fp values were 61 31 and 21 µg l for cw respectively dbp fps for leachate waters were however significantly higher p 0 05 than for cw control water fp results were significantly lower p 0 05 than those of leachate water values thus to evaluate the yield of dbp precursors from litter only control water dbp fps were subtracted from other dbp fp levels results showed that thm haa and ch fps of managed samples were significantly lower and mostly overlapped with each other with lower variability p 0 05 average thm fps 2573 µg l 2223 µg l 2146 µg l haa fps 2456 µg l 2325 µg l 2262 µg l and ch fps 365 µg l 271 µg l 273 µg l in pre burned dormant season and growing season burned samples respectively than unmanaged dbp fps thm fps 1143 7281 µg l with an average of 4354 µg l haa fps 1531 7399 µg l with an average of 4108 µg l and ch fps 224 949 µg l with an average of 404 µg l fig 4 a b and c both thm and haa fp concentrations were governed by doc concentrations of the samples over time and have shown strong positive linear r2 0 7 correlations figure s11 however ch fp vs doc correlations were weak for uw and gsw and strongly positive for mpw and dsw during the experiment trichloromethane tcm constituted 98 of thms data not shown dichloroacetic dcaa and trichloroacetic acids tcaa constituted 30 35 and 61 66 figure s12a and b of haas in all samples regardless of treatment and similar trends were found with total haa fps this was related to limited br presence in the samples we also evaluated changes in doc normalized yields µg mg c of dbps results showed that the reactivity of thm average 90 103 µg mg c haa average 101 105 µg mg c and ch average 11 15 µg mg c precursors did not change significantly over time and have shown similar variations and overlap fig 4d e and f furthermore doc normalized reactivity of dcaa average 30 36 µg mg c and tcaa average 64 70 µg mg c were also comparable and did not change significantly figure s12c and d our findings further supported two previous studies in which decreases in thm formation after prescribed burning were reported majidzadeh et al 2019 2015 overall these findings showed that prescribed fire and its application season did not change the nature and behavior of dbp precursors significantly under chlorination conditions regarding thm haa and ch formation as indicated before uzun et al 2015 yang et al 2015 general water quality parameters such as doc tdn don and br are not good predictors r2 values for linear correlations 0 5 for ndma fp under chloramination conditions during the very first flush jan 15 2016 the ndma fp value in cw was 14 ng l significantly higher values were measured in unmanaged 274 ng l and managed 55 63 ng l leachate waters fig 4g as time progressed ndma fps were comparable for each sample and were governed by cw derived precursors the contribution of leachates was not significant p 0 05 these results indicated that i terrestrial derived dom do not contribute ndma precursors ii previously accumulated ndma precursors released quickly from litter materials and iii no more contribution occurred during the sample collection period due to isolated experimental conditions no external anthropogenic pollution 3 6 prescribed fire does not affect leachate treatability during the experiment 23 l of leachate waters were collected on four dates initial flushes jan 15 and 23 dry period mar 15 and first flush after dry period may 31 for unmanaged and managed samples treatability tests coagulation flocculation settling were conducted as explained in si with unfiltered leachate waters since doc concentrations were different in each sample we adjusted doc concentrations with distilled deionized water ddw to establish similar organic carbon content between samples target content was 4 0 mg l levels table 2 shows average water quality parameters after adjustment this approach enabled us to have similar coagulants to carbon ratio and to allow better comparisons in water treatability results showed that coagulant demand mg coagulant for mg removed doc for optimum doc removals was not significantly affected by fire application to reach optimal removal conditions applied coagulant doses were similar for unmanaged and managed samples alum 30 mg l and ferric 15 mg l regardless of the burning season the average doc removal for unmanaged and managed pre burned samples was similar p 0 05 52 and 57 for alum and ferric respectively however 5 10 lower doc removals were observed in seasonally burned samples fig 2a compared to uw and dsw samples this difference can be related to relatively lower fulvic acid like content table 1 in these samples similarly we evaluated the treatability of thm and haa precursors in the same waters thm fp removals were comparable for both coagulants average removal was 68 9 and 70 9 for alum and ferric respectively however 5 10 higher removals were measured for haa fps compared to thm fp removals in leachate waters regardless of burn season overall results showed that prescribed burning did not cause significant changes in the treatability of doc thm and haa precursors 4 conclusion a box model fig 5 was created to summarize the effect of prescribed fire on i the mass of forest floor materials ii water leaching of doc thm and haa precursors from unburned vs burned forest materials and iii treatability of those water leachates our cumulative results indicated that low intensity low severity prescribed fires may decrease fuel loads this reduction induced only slight changes in dom chemical functional groups associated with detritus materials continuous application of prescribed fires can decrease the leaching potential of doc tdn don and reactive phosphorus from forest materials thus lowering source water dom concentration the effect of prescribed fire may be limited to dom composition except for humic like substances which were reduced by fire in addition to these potential benefits prescribed fire is not expected to affect the release of br and trace elements k ca mg fe s na b and al from forest materials thus the formation of additional toxic brominated thms and haas and the release of undesired elements are not of concern finally periodically applied prescribed fire can reduce the export of thm and haa precursors without changing carbon normalized yields µg dbp fp mg c furthermore the removal efficiency of doc and precursors of thms and haas under similar conditions i e ph organic carbon content and coagulant dose during alum or ferric coagulation is not expected to be changed after prescribed burning therefore landowners can feel confident that low intensity low severity prescribed fires do not negatively impact forest floor chemistry water

17477,in this study we report for the first time the effect of prescribed fires on the export of dissolved organic matter dom and precursors of disinfectant by products dbps from periodically every 2 3 years and seasonally i e dormant and growing burned forest fuel materials i e live vegetation woody debris and detritus litter and duff and treatability of its rainwater leachate periodically applied every 2 3 years for 40 years prescribed fires decreased total fuel load 62 10 primarily detrital mass 75 2 however functional groups i e phenolic compounds proteins carbohydrates aromatic 1 ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and lipids attached to dom of ground solid materials did not change significantly outside rainwater leaching from forest fuel materials experiments showed that the leaching capacity of dissolved organic carbon doc from burned litter samples decreased by 40 20 regardless of burning season when compared to unburned litter samples the leaching of total dissolved nitrogen tdn dissolved organic nitrogen don ammonium nh4 and reactive phosphorus po4 3 from burned materials decreased between 40 and 70 when compared to unburned materials also dom composition was affected by prescribed fire which partially consumed humic like substances based on fluorescence analyses thus periodically applied prescribed fires also resulted in a reduction of trihalomethane thm 42 23 and haloacetic acid haa 42 20 formation potentials fps while doc normalized reactivity of thm and haa fps did not change significantly additionally the leaching of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma precursors bromide ion br and selected elements k ca mg mn fe s na b and al were not significantly affected by prescribed fires finally coagulant i e alum and ferric dose

prescribed fire dom leaching and composition dbp precursors coagulation 1 introduction climate change can result in more frequent and more severe and extended droughts these conditions may increase the probability of ignition and frequency and severity of wildfires bladon et al 2014 robinne et al 2018 westerling 2016 the type and amount of surface fuels i e a mixture of live vegetation woody debris and detritus litter oi horizon and duff oe oa horizons and their properties such as moisture and chemical content impact fuel flammability dharssi 2018 also wildfires may greatly impact detrital composition coates et al 2017 majidzadeh et al 2015 wang et al 2015 which is a primary terrestrial source of dissolved organic matter dom in source waters chow et al 2009 majidzadeh et al 2015 previous studies have shown that post wildfire runoff increased surface erosion thus mobilizing sediment fire generated materials i e ash and charred nutrients i e n and p and trace elements abraham et al 2017 nyman et al 2011 rhoades et al 2019 furthermore wildfires may change dom composition and concentration of precursors of disinfection by product dbps hohner et al 2016 revchuk and suffet 2014 uzun et al 2020 wang et al 2016 consequently treatability requirements for burned watershed derived dom can be different when compared to those exported from unburned watersheds hohner et al 2016 wang et al 2015 writer et al 2014 considering the widespread use of forested catchments for potable water production bladon et al 2014 nyman et al 2011 post fire rainstorms transporting burned surface fuel leachates to source waters pose a potential concern for drinking water production forest management techniques such as prescribed fire are vital tools used to maintain open and fire resilient forest structures that reduce potentially hazardous wildfire conditions and ignitions waldrop and goodrick 2012 although wildfire hazard reduction is one of the primary motivations for prescribed fire use in forest management it is also employed for many other objectives including but not limited to the control of undesired vegetative species aesthetics restoration and maintenance of fire dependent species and ecosystems and site preparation waldrop and goodrick 2012 it is known that prescribed fires may impact forest floor properties coates et al 2020 2017 most carbon fluxes come from forest floor leaching in the form of terrestrial dom cronan 2018 which is one of the main sources of dissolved organic carbon doc and the precursors of dbps entering source waters chen et al 2019 chow et al 2009 therefore it is very important to investigate the chemical composition of burned forest materials when considering water quality in source waters furthermore the amount of dom and its composition are important to consider in conjunction with the potential presence of dbp precursors and their treatability to date most studies connecting fire events to changes in source water quality have focused predominantly on wildfires chow et al 2019 hohner et al 2017 2016 uzun et al 2020 wang et al 2015 due to the severity and widespread impact of wildfires around the globe currently only a few relevant studies have been conducted to evaluate prescribed fire effects on water quality especially in the eastern united states hahn et al 2019 previously majidzadeh et al 2015 performed laboratory burning on the foliar litter of six plant species commonly found in the southeastern united states us and evaluated the chemical content and dbp formation potential fp of these materials majidzadeh et al 2015 the results showed that the total weight of litter and chemical properties per gram of material i e lignin nitrogenous compounds and polysaccharides were decreased in burned samples because of the loss of organic matter also doc and chloroform precursor leaching in water decreased in burned materials to test the effect of prescribed fire on water quality and dbp formation tsai et al 2015 designed another study where litter and duff mixtures from unburned and burned sites forests consisting mostly of pine trees were collected and soaked in water results were similar i e lower doc and dbp for these two studies finally we reported that long term prescribed fire use may decrease doc total dissolved nitrogen tdn nh4 and the fps of regulated trihalomethanes thms four species and haloacetic acids haas five species majidzadeh et al 2019 although these relevant studies provided useful information comprehensive studies detailing the effects of dynamic events i e application of burning season deterioration of the materials under different weathering conditions on dom and dbp precursors originating from unburned vs burned forest materials are still lacking therefore the objectives of this study were to examine i fire frequency frequent and repeated prescribed burning every 2 3 years for 40 years and season dormant or growing season burns on the export of dom and selected dbp precursors regulated thms haas and emerging chloral hydrate ch n nitrosodimethylamine ndma from forest fuels ii the changes in dom molecular composition and iii the removal of dom and dbp precursors with commonly used coagulants i e alum and ferric salts from leachate waters of forest materials prescribed fire reduces potentially hazardous wildland fuel components and enhances habitat for many wildlife species waldrop and goodrick 2012 understanding how it may impact the chemistry of burned forest materials the potential export of dom and dbp precursors and their treatability may better inform forest managers and prescribed fire practitioners about the multi faceted dynamics that should be considered when utilizing prescribed fire to achieve land management objectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and prescribed fires this study was conducted at the tom yawkey wildlife center 33 23 n 79 22 w in georgetown south carolina sc us the average annual precipitation and temperature in the area were approximately 1400 mm 3 83 mm day and 18 c from 1981 2010 respectively south carolina state climatology office scsco 2010 two paired forest ecosystems

study site and differed in their long term management strategies unmanaged site a had not been burned or harvested from 1978 to 2014 site b had been burned every 2 3 years over that same time period the most recent burn had been performed in 2014 site b fig 1 to accomplish our research objectives composite fuel samples forest materials live vegetation woody debris detritus litter and duff ash and charred materials burned sites only were collected from the unmanaged site site a and the previously burned sites site b before additional seasonal prescribed burns were conducted in 2015 in 2015 six units 0 01 0 02 km2 each in site b were burned three units during the dormant season mar 9 11 2015 and three units during the growing season may 5 6 2015 the prescribed burns represented typical dormant and growing season ignitions implemented by the sc department of natural resources at the tom yawkey wildlife center to reduce potentially hazardous wildland fuels maintain open forest conditions and improve wildlife habitat for the red cockaded woodpecker dryobates borealis vioeillot all burns were head fires and mean flame lengths in each of the burns were approximately 0 3 1 0 m which is characteristic of low intensity low severity fires in this region coates et al 2018a fire temperatures were recorded using in situ thermocouple datalogger assemblies average peak burning temperatures ranged between 200 and 315 c coates et al 2018b 2 2 material collection and leaching experiment design sample collection frames 1 m x 1 m were placed on the ground every 50 m along a 300 m linear transect within each treatment unit fig 1 all live and dead vegetation fine woody debris 7 62 cm diameter woodall and liknes 2008 litter duff ash and charred materials when present were collected within these frames following site b prescribed burns this represented a mixture of both burned partially charred and unburned materials due to the nature of the low intensity and severity prescribed burns collected materials were oven dried at 70 c for no less than 48 hrs immediately after collection to obtain oven dry fuel mass composite fuel samples were randomly selected from each of the following treatment prescribed burning applied units for additional experiments site a unmanaged site b pre burned site b dormant season post burn site b growing season post burn one kg mixtures of collected materials from the unmanaged and burned plots were packed in aluminum screens 1 mm x 1 mm mesh size these wrapped samples were then individually placed in custom made open top aluminum trays 0 6 m x 0 6 m x 0 3 m an empty control tray was also placed in the open field with the sample trays to capture unimpeded rainwater figs 1 and s1 a weather station was located next to the trays which recorded precipitation air temperature pressure humidity and wind speed every 15 min fig 1 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 pyrolysis analysis with ground solid samples to examine the effect of prescribed fires on the chemical structure of detritus materials ground solid materials were subjected to pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms samples were oven dried for no less than 48 hrs and ground using a wiley mill 2 mm one to two mg of these materials were then inserted into quartz tubes for chemical analysis following methods described elsewhere coates et al 2017 song and peng 2010 2 3 2 leachate water collection for nearly a year when precipitation fell over the trays in the field leachate water of each tray was collected in glass carboys total volume of each carboy 23 l located underneath each tray as rain saturated the material and drained through the trays figure s1 the amount of daily precipitation and the volume of tray leachates were recorded for each rain event figures s2 and s3 the ability to hold water was not significantly different p 0 05 for each treatment where the difference was 7 in total volume collected in the trays figure s3 after leachate water collection samples were transferred into pre cleaned 1l amber bottles immediately filtered with pre burned and pre washed glass filters whatman 934 ah 0 7 µm pore sized and kept in the refrigerator at 4 c until water quality and dbp tests were conducted within one week after collection during the leachate water collection period temperatures dropped below freezing only a few times and the average temperature 19 c between jan 1 and nov 1 2016 approximated the historical 1981 2010 average temperature of 18 c for this region figure s4 several lengthy wet periods were observed but only two relatively dry periods occurred when the average precipitation was less than the historical average precipitation of 3 83 mm day mar 15 may 30 2016 1 84 mm day and oct 1 nov 30 2016 0 02 mm day except for three rainy days a total of 33 rain events producing a considerable amount of leachate water were recorded but detailed measurements were conducted for nine selected events three initial flushes jan 15 jan 23 and feb 5 three events during relatively dry periods mar 15 mar 28 and may 14 the first significant flush after a dry period may 31 one event during a relatively wet period aug 12 and an additional event following a dry period nov 14 the export of dom never reached zero and the total volume was collected in the trays therefore concentrations of selected parameters i e doc tdn dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved reactive phosphorus po4 3 for 24 unexamined rain events were approximated using linear interpolation cumulative exports were calculated using the following formula c1 x v1 c2 x v2 cn x vn where c and v were measured for nine samples or calculated for 24 samples concentrations mg l and volumes l of the samples collected during each rain event respectively the trays were open top therefore bird feces or other potential contaminants were removed in the few instances they were detected due to the nature of this field experiment it was not possible to completely exclude the impacts of these unwanted materials especially in nutrient concentrations 2 3 3 water quality dbp and water treatability tests during the

leachate water was insufficient 2 l for all water quality and dbp tests it was discarded and carboys were cleaned immediately dbp fp tests were conducted in the presence of excess oxidants for an extended contact time five days to measure the maximum formations in the samples initially ph was adjusted to 7 8 with 20 mm phosphate buffer to mimic typical finished water ph levels in drinking water treatment plants dwtps for thm haa and ch fp tests initial oxidant chlorine cl2 stock 5 6 available cl2 spiking doses were calculated by using the formula 3 x doc 7 6 x nh4 10 krasner et al 2004 after five days of reaction at room temperature 21 22 c in 125 ml amber bottles headspace free residual cl2 always 10 mg l was measured and quenched with a slightly higher dose of ascorbic acid than stoichiometrically required ndma fp tests were performed with spiking pre formed monochloramine nh2cl stock solution cl2 n 4 1 by weight prepared by the slow drop by drop at ph 9 0 addition of cl2 into the ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 solution jones et al 2012 initial nh2cl doses applied to the samples were 100 mg l after 5 days of contact time at room temperature residual oxidants always 40 mg l were measured and quenched with a slight excess amount of sodium thiosulfate than stoichiometrically required finally samples were extracted and analyzed with gc ecd and gc ms ms for thm haa and ch and ndma respectively concentrations of free and total chlorine were determined following standard method 4500 cl f apha awwa wef 2012 selected unfiltered leachate water samples were treated with alum al2 so4 318h20 and ferric chloride fecl3 before each water treatability test preliminary jar test experiments were performed at ph 6 0 0 1 a varying amount of carbonate buffer naoh and hcl were used

turbidity removals based on the results optimum removal conditions highest removals reached with the lowest coagulant dose were selected figure s5 then additional tests i e doc and dbp fp removals were conducted with the treated waters under pre selected optimum treatment conditions and percent removal efficiencies were calculated with the following formula co ctre co x 100 where co and ctre are concentrations of raw and treated waters respectively detailed descriptions for general water quality optical properties fluorescence spectroscopy analysis of dbps sample extraction and quantification treatability tests analytical methods and minimum reporting levels mrls table s1 were presented elsewhere majidzadeh et al 2019 ruecker et al 2017 uzun et al 2020 2018 and in the supporting information si a two tailed student s t test with a significance level of 0 05 was performed to document statistically significant differences where necessary 3 results and discussion 3 1 prescribed fire alters fuel mass distribution fuel height in both the unmanaged and pre burned sites was 30 50 cm coates et al 2017 however total fuel mass kg m2 of composite fuel samples was significantly higher in the long term unmanaged site a 4 48 0 11 kg m2 p 0 05 than the frequently burned site b pre burned 1 73 0 51 kg m2 figure s6 live fuels were not detected in the samples collected after seasonal prescribed fires because they were consumed during the prescribed fires fine woody debris mass 7 62 cm diameter was similar p 0 05 for both unmanaged and managed sites regardless of the burning season fine woody debris is often quite heterogeneous across a given landscape often at a resolution as small as 0 25 m2 in frequently burned pine systems loudermilk et al 2017 often fast moving low intensity low severity surface fires may not completely consume woody debris 7 62 cm in diameter these fuel particles may only be partially charred therefore significant differences between burned and unburned forests or pre and post fire masses within burned forests may not be detected this was observed because of the burns at the tom yawkey center where incomplete combustion of woody debris resulted from the prescribed fires prescribed fires may also increase the smallest size class of woody debris 0 64 cm diameter immediately post fire due to mortality of live understory vegetation during a burn event this may have been reflected in the woody debris results for the pre fire masses in site b as well it should be noted that larger woody debris 7 62 cm diameter were not included therefore inferences about those larger fuels cannot be made as a result of this study detritus mass 3 68 0 47 kg m2 in unmanaged site a was significantly greater p 0 05 than site b 0 89 0 10 kg m2 this indicated the continuous consumption of detritus as a result of frequent prescribed fires in site b since pre burned materials were collected from site b about 1 year after 2015 the last prescribed fire 2014 higher detritus mass 0 89 0 10 kg m2 was observed compared to mass that was collected right after seasonal burns 0 20 0 05 0 52 0 11 kg m2 for dormant and growing season burns respectively this can be associated with the accumulation of litter between 2014 and 2015 and the consumption of such materials during seasonal prescribed burns consequently the combination of fuel mass changed more woody substances and less detrital materials per unit weight kg of the materials collected from burned sites these observations further support that prescribed burning consumes detritus materials changing both their mass and depth coates et al 2017 cronan et al 2015 3 1 1 prescribed fire does not alter functional groups attached dom phenolic compounds i e lignin like constituted about 76 10 higher than unmanaged samples of all burned samples regardless of management which can be related to incomplete combustion of the materials during prescribed fires coates et al 2017 in contrast to the significant decrease in detrital mass prescribed burning did not significantly change the detrital chemical functional groups proteins nitrogen compounds carbohydrates oxygen compounds and lipids aliphatic compounds figure s7 the aromatic compounds were found in higher concentrations in unmanaged samples a higher level of toluene was observed in unmanaged samples compared to burned samples coates et al 2017 previous studies reported conflicting results on the formation and fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs after burning while some researchers reported an elevated level of pah formation which survived and remained for a long period forbes et al 2006 vergnoux et al 2011a others indicated that pahs are transported into the soil quickly in only a few months post fire pah levels may return to pre fire levels kim et al 2003 in our study pahs constituted only 2 3 of the total biomass regardless of the treatment figure s7 this indicated that the effect of prescribed burning on pah formation was minimal possibly due to incomplete combustion of the detritus resulting from low intensity burning chen et al 2018 coates et al 2017 3 2 prescribed fire affects water quality carbon nitrogen and phosphorus release the average doc value was minimal 1 64 1 15 mg l for rainwater collected in control trays control water cw for litter trays doc values were 41 3 15 8 mg l 23 7 10 4 mg l 22 5 9 1 mg l and 23 5 9 4 mg l in leachates from unmanaged water uw managed pre burned water mpw post dormant season burn water dsw and post growing season burn water gsw respectively similarly as shown in fig 2 a during the initial seven samples initial flushes n 3 dry period n 3 and the first flush after dry period n 1 average doc releases from unmanaged samples 45 48 53 mg l were significantly higher p 0 05 than doc releases from other burned leachate samples 24 28 26 28 and 21 27 mg l for mpw dsw and gsw respectively after this period significantly p 0 05 lower doc concentrations were measured in all samples uw 24 mg l and others 13 17 mg l during the relatively wet period sampling aug 12 and finally the levels were similar 11 17 mg l for the last samples nov 14 regardless of management fig 2a doc leaching trends during initial flushes in relatively colder periods indicated gradually decreased leaching capacity of material for all treatments however opposite trends for the relative drier and warmer periods indicated that microbial activity may have played a role in enhanced doc export from all litters overall cumulative doc export values 16 9 gram for 400 l from unmanaged materials 8 9 gram for 380 l were significantly higher p 0 05 than the export values from managed samples fig 3 a results indicated that long term prescribed burning can decrease doc leaching capacity of forest litter majidzadeh et al 2019 2015 and burning season does not significantly p 0 05 affect this result this might be related to loss of carbon during the burning process hongve 1999 vergnoux et al 2011b and consumption of materials i e detritus that have a relatively higher potential of doc leaching zhang 2017 particularly detrital mass however it should not be forgotten that these results were obtained from burned and unburned substances and their leachates other natural factors hydrology geology soil properties erosion etc not accounted for by the tray design play a significant role in dom export during the experiment average suva254 values showed fluctuations in the control water however those were comparable for all leachate water samples 2 9 3 3 l mg m regardless of the treatment fig 2b this indicated that these prescribed fires did not likely change overall aromaticity krasner et al 1996 of the leachate water derived from the litter materials however in general higher suva254 values were observed as time progressed this indicated that the leaching rate of non aromatic compounds may have been faster than the leaching rate of aromatic compounds regardless of management strategy opposing trends were observed for samples collected after a long dry period between mar 28 and may 14 from the unmanaged leachate as indicated before this period was dry and the air temperature was relatively warm 18 c previous studies indicated that decomposition of newly generated compounds is related to charring intensity and fuel source baldock and smernik 2002 coates et al 2017 czimczik et al 2003 masiello et al 2002 thus our observations indicated that newly formed phenolic compounds and pahs in the burned samples were not significantly affected by long dry periods and continued to release from burned litters as time progressed in general no2 and no3 concentrations were governed by cw and values were mostly lower than minimum reporting levels mrls data not shown however tdn don and nh4 n concentrations were mostly higher in unmanaged leachate water than burned leachate waters ranging from 1 03 to 2 72 0 72 to 1 73 and 0 13 to 1 80 mg l respectively figs 2c s8a and s8b like doc trends the cumulative export of don and tdn were significantly higher in unmanaged samples fig 3b and c it has been shown that at temperatures of 200 500 c nitrogen volatilizes and most of the organic matter is released to the atmosphere knicker 2007 waldrop and goodrick 2012 thus decreases in nitrogen concentrations in burned litter samples can primarily be related to the volatilization of nitrogen during combustion majidzadeh et al 2015 finally the ratios of doc don in all samples were mostly comparable except for the first significant flush after a dry period may 31 fig 2d when doc don was considerably higher in burned samples this may indicate that don leaching in burned materials is more sensitive to dry conditions phosphorus leaching from burned materials was higher than leaching from unburned samples during the initial six samples fig 2e the values reached similar levels 0 4 mg l after the initial sampling was completed therefore the cumulative export of phosphorus in uw dsw and gsw samples was comparable fig 3d however lower concentrations were measured in managed mpw it has been shown that burning can cause the short term release of phosphorus which can be consumed quickly by live vegetation zhang 2017 relatively higher concentrations for post dormant and growing season burns can be associated with fresh burning and the release of po4 3 during fires however decreased po4 3 concentrations in mpw samples can be associated with consumption of freshly released po4 3 by live vegetation between the latest fire application date 2014 and the sample collection date 2015 however these results showed that continuous management with prescribed fire may decrease po4 3 concentrations significantly up to 60 by the subsequent fire initiated release and live vegetation consumption processes 3 3 prescribed fire does not affect the release of bromide and other elements the concentration of br in all leachate water samples varied over time and was mostly governed by cw for the initial four samples jan 15 and 23 feb 5 and mar 15 bromide concentration in cw was 16 µg l and in all other samples it was 22 25 µg l fig 2f following these initial samples bromide concentrations decreased sharply and most were under mrl 10 µl table s1 previously we indicated that the release of bromide from burned materials could be elevated due to high temperature combustion wang et al 2015 however in this study bromide concentrations in unmanaged and managed litter leachates were similar this showed that low intensity low severity prescribed fires are not likely to affect bromide release from litter samples it has been shown that fires can cause more trace element fluxes than other types of land use changes but the effect is element specific abraham et al 2017b potthast et al 2017 after prescribed fires some parameters electrical conductivity ec p and k recovered fast 1 year but some others ph c n ca2 and mg2 took more time for recovery in the natural environment alcañiz et al 2016 particularly high intensity fires can cause the volatilization of elements debano 1990 since high temperatures are required for this process no i e mg2 ca2 and mn debano 1990 or limited i e k and s debano and conrad 1978 effects of high intensity fires on element volatilization have been previously reported in this study during the sample collection period dissolved concentrations of elements did not show a significant difference between samples except mn for unmanaged leachate waters figure s9 in general concentrations increased during the long dry period mar 15 may 30 indicating the accumulation of these elements in the litter then during the wet rainy period may 1 nov 15 most of the accumulated elements were flushed out of the samples taken together these results showed that prescribed fires at the tom yawkey center did not affect the leaching capacity or processing of trace elements from the forest materials significantly 3 4 prescribed fire consumes terrestrial derived dom it has been shown that eem regions and fluorescence indices can provide useful information about dom fellman et al 2010 and fires can cause changes in these parameters hohner et al 2016 revchuk and suffet 2014 uzun et al 2020 despite the interference of iron reported previously hohner et al 2016 homann et al 2011 the effect of iron interference is expected to be minimal in our samples due to low levels 0 11 mg l including the effect of cw during the experiment we selected six dates jan 15 and 23 may 14 and 31 aug 12 and nov 14 representing all previously stated distinct periods and eem regions and fluorescence indices of dom in leachate waters were measured the data table 1 indicated that repeated burning every 2 3 years could decrease fluorescence intensities particularly smp and humic like doc eq calculated as percent volume of the region 100 x doc mg l in dom this supported lower doc concentrations in pre burn samples compared to unburned samples furthermore the data showed that fresh burning regardless of season can cause further decreases in all eem doc eq regions and consume particularly humic like substances right after a dry period however all eem regions of dom increased in uw and mpw samples which might be related to the combination of both biotic and abiotic factors in trays figure s10 however we cannot provide detailed information as these factors spanned beyond our research purposes a substantial reduction in all regions was observed during the wet period this pattern was obvious in all samples but particularly noticeable in uw and mpw samples indicating the decreased leaching potential of all materials finally hix indices also provided information about the dom source where hix 6 indicates terrestrial dom and hix 4 implies biological or aquatic origin kalbitz 2001 our results showed that prescribed fires can consume particularly terrestrial derived dom however none of the other fluorescence indices i e fi e2 e3 and β α were significantly affected by prescribed fires indicating that the source mostly terrestrial and molecular weight of dom in leachate waters were mostly similar regardless of management 3 5 prescribed fire does not change the reactivity of dbp precursors average thm fp haa fp and ch fp values were 61 31 and 21 µg l for cw respectively dbp fps for leachate waters were however significantly higher p 0 05 than for cw control water fp results were significantly lower p 0 05 than those of leachate water values thus to evaluate the yield of dbp precursors from litter only control water dbp fps were subtracted from other dbp fp levels results showed that thm haa and ch fps of managed samples were significantly lower and mostly overlapped with each other with lower variability p 0 05 average thm fps 2573 µg l 2223 µg l 2146 µg l haa fps 2456 µg l 2325 µg l 2262 µg l and ch fps 365 µg l 271 µg l 273 µg l in pre burned dormant season and growing season burned samples respectively than unmanaged dbp fps thm fps 1143 7281 µg l with an average of 4354 µg l haa fps 1531 7399 µg l with an average of 4108 µg l and ch fps 224 949 µg l with an average of 404 µg l fig 4 a b and c both thm and haa fp concentrations were governed by doc concentrations of the samples over time and have shown strong positive linear r2 0 7 correlations figure s11 however ch fp vs doc correlations were weak for uw and gsw and strongly positive for mpw and dsw during the experiment trichloromethane tcm constituted 98 of thms data not shown dichloroacetic dcaa and trichloroacetic acids tcaa constituted 30 35 and 61 66 figure s12a and b of haas in all samples regardless of treatment and similar trends were found with total haa fps this was related to limited br presence in the samples we also evaluated changes in doc normalized yields µg mg c of dbps results showed that the reactivity of thm average 90 103 µg mg c haa average 101 105 µg mg c and ch average 11 15 µg mg c precursors did not change significantly over time and have shown similar variations and overlap fig 4d e and f furthermore doc normalized reactivity of dcaa average 30 36 µg mg c and tcaa average 64 70 µg mg c were also comparable and did not change significantly figure s12c and d our findings further supported two previous studies in which decreases in thm formation after prescribed burning were reported majidzadeh et al 2019 2015 overall these findings showed that prescribed fire and its application season did not change the nature and behavior of dbp precursors significantly under chlorination conditions regarding thm haa and ch formation as indicated before uzun et al 2015 yang et al 2015 general water quality parameters such as doc tdn don and br are not good predictors r2 values for linear correlations 0 5 for ndma fp under chloramination conditions during the very first flush jan 15 2016 the ndma fp value in cw was 14 ng l significantly higher values were measured in unmanaged 274 ng l and managed 55 63 ng l leachate waters fig 4g as time progressed ndma fps were comparable for each sample and were governed by cw derived precursors the contribution of leachates was not significant p 0 05 these results indicated that i terrestrial derived dom do not contribute ndma precursors ii previously accumulated ndma precursors released quickly from litter materials and iii no more contribution occurred during the sample collection period due to isolated experimental conditions no external anthropogenic pollution 3 6 prescribed fire does not affect leachate treatability during the experiment 23 l of leachate waters were collected on four dates initial flushes jan 15 and 23 dry period mar 15 and first flush after dry period may 31 for unmanaged and managed samples treatability tests coagulation flocculation settling were conducted as explained in si with unfiltered leachate waters since doc concentrations were different in each sample we adjusted doc concentrations with distilled deionized water ddw to establish similar organic carbon content between samples target content was 4 0 mg l levels table 2 shows average water quality parameters after adjustment this approach enabled us to have similar coagulants to carbon ratio and to allow better comparisons in water treatability results showed that coagulant demand mg coagulant for mg removed doc for optimum doc removals was not significantly affected by fire application to reach optimal removal conditions applied coagulant doses were similar for unmanaged and managed samples alum 30 mg l and ferric 15 mg l regardless of the burning season the average doc removal for unmanaged and managed pre burned samples was similar p 0 05 52 and 57 for alum and ferric respectively however 5 10 lower doc removals were observed in seasonally burned samples fig 2a compared to uw and dsw samples this difference can be related to relatively lower fulvic acid like content table 1 in these samples similarly we evaluated the treatability of thm and haa precursors in the same waters thm fp removals were comparable for both coagulants average removal was 68 9 and 70 9 for alum and ferric respectively however 5 10 higher removals were measured for haa fps compared to thm fp removals in leachate waters regardless of burn season overall results showed that prescribed burning did not cause significant changes in the treatability of doc thm and haa precursors 4 conclusion a box model fig 5 was created to summarize the effect of prescribed fire on i the mass of forest floor materials ii water leaching of doc thm and haa precursors from unburned vs burned forest materials and iii treatability of those water leachates our cumulative results indicated that low intensity low severity prescribed fires may decrease fuel loads this reduction induced only slight changes in dom chemical functional groups associated with detritus materials continuous application of prescribed fires can decrease the leaching potential of doc tdn don and reactive phosphorus from forest materials thus lowering source water dom concentration the effect of prescribed fire may be limited to dom composition except for humic like substances which were reduced by fire in addition to these potential benefits prescribed fire is not expected to affect the release of br and trace elements k ca mg fe s na b and al from forest materials thus the formation of additional toxic brominated thms and haas and the release of undesired elements are not of concern finally periodically applied prescribed fire can reduce the export of thm and haa precursors without changing carbon normalized yields µg dbp fp mg c furthermore the removal efficiency of doc and precursors of thms and haas under similar conditions i e ph organic carbon content and coagulant dose during alum or ferric coagulation is not expected to be changed after prescribed burning therefore landowners can feel confident that low intensity low severity prescribed fires do not negatively impact forest floor chemistry water quality or water treatability the results would be further enhanced by conducting similar studies in different locations that contain different vegetation and site factors i e hydrology geology soil

17478,figuring out the comprehensive metabolic mechanism of chloramphenicol cap is critical to improving cap removal in the bioremediation process in this study cap biodegradation by six consortia and isolated sphingomonas sp cl5 1 were systematically investigated using the combination of high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry second generation and third generation sequencing technologies the cap degrading capability of six consortia was enhanced while cap mineralization rate declined after long term enrichment the microbial community structures of six consortia were all simplified with 69 82 decline in species richness after continuous passages for one year the core genera of consortia cl and ch included sphingomonas cupriavidus burkholderia chryseobacterium and pigmentiphaga which accounted for over 98 of the total population sphingomonas was discovered as a new cap degrader that could subsist on cap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy sources sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was able to completely remove 120 mg l cap within 48 hours with a mineralization rate of 50 4 the presence of acetate or nitrite could inhibit cap metabolization by strain cl5 1 four cap metabolic pathways were constructed including modification of the c3 hydroxyl group of cap via acetylation oxidization dehydration and the bond cleavage between c1 and c2 c3 hydroxyl group dehydration and c1 c2 bond cleavage were first reported regarding to cap biotransformation strain cl5 1 played a core role in the consortia and was responsible for c3 hydroxyl oxidation c3 dehydration and c1 c2 bond cleavage genomic information of strain cl5 1 revealed the further mineralization pathways of downstream product p nitrobenzoic acid via ortho and meta cleavage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chloramphenicol biodegradation sphingomonas genomics metabolic pathway 1 introduction as global antibiotic consumption increasing with years the environmental problems caused by antibiotics abuse are highly concerned nowadays chloramphenicol cap derived from streptomyces venezuelae is the first economically produced synthetic antibiotic ehrlich et al 1947 because of its broad spectrum antibacterial property and effective therapeutic action on typhoid it came into medical and veterinary practices widely in the world however researchers found that cap had negative side effects including aplastic anemia and genotoxic carcinogenicity thus many countries have banned cap from medical treatment and food production hanekamp et al 2015 regardless of the adverse effects of cap some developing countries are still in mass production and consumption of cap because of its low cost the residues of cap are frequently detected in various ecological environments especially in domestic sewage hospital effluent and aquaculture and livestock wastewater which become the environmental hotspots of antibiotics grenni et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 tran et al 2018 kimosop et al 2016 according to the recent surveys the concentration of cap ranges from minimum quantifiable level to 2430 ng l in influent and minimum quantifiable level to 1050 ng l in the effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps in asia tran et al 2018 it has been confirmed that biotreatments such as membrane bioreactor and conventional activated sludge processes could effectively and stably remove cap residues in wastewater in wwtps tran et al 2016 peng et al 2006 as a broad spectrum antimicrobial drug cap exerts deleterious effects on bacteria by binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome leading to the suppression of protein synthesis mosa et al 2015 which decreases its bioavailability the process of domestication usually can enhance the biotreatment performance of the activated sludge on cap removal in wwtps several studies have reported the cap reduction by enriched consortia an efficient cap degrading consortium was enriched by ma et al 2019 from activated sludge which could remove 50 mg l cap within 24 h besides some cap utilizing bacteria were isolated including clostridium acetobutylicum o brien et al 1971 streptomyces sp 3022a malik et al 1971 streptomyces venezuelae isp5230 mosher et al 1990 haemophilus influenzae rd kw20 smith et al 2007 escherichia fergusonii i 10 chl xin et al 2012 and geobacter metallireducens gs 15 xu et al 2019 research on exploring the aerobic microbial biotransformation of cap can be traced back to the 1950s egami et al 1951 found that the crude enzyme extracted from streptococcus hcemolyticus could reduce the nitro group of cap recently nfsb nitroreductase was identified to be responsible for transforming cap to amino cap in strain h influenza nfsb which was an emerging cap resistance mechanism for bacteria crofts et al 2019 the hydrolysis on amido bond of cap catalyzed by chloramphenicol acetate esterase is another common cap transformation mechanism which has been reported in previous studies xin et al 2012 tao et al 2012 tao et al 2011 mosher et al 1990 malik et al 1971 the gene estdl136 encoding cap acetate esterase was identified from soil metagenome data and e coli carrying this gene was capable of catalyzing cap into p nitrophenylserinol tao et al 2012 besides cap acetyltransferase can modify the 1 or 3 hydroxyl group of cap by acetylation reaction which is also a common resistance mechanism for bacteria huang et al 2017 sorg et al 2016 however how the product chloramphenicol 3 acetate acap is further utilized by bacteria is still unclear to our knowledge the published studies mainly focused on the first step of cap biotransformation under aerobic conditions and there are still lots of research gaps on the further metabolic pathways of intermediate metabolites such as acap p nitrophenylserinol and p nitrobenzoic acid pnb thus more efforts should be made to reconstruct the comprehensive cap degrading pathway under aerobic conditions in the previous study we enriched six cap degrading consortia from activated sludge under different culture conditions zhang et al 2020 in this study cap degrading capability and taxonomic structures were further assessed after one more year of serial passage culture using the same enrichment medium in addition a strain with a powerful capability of cap biodegradation was isolated and the complete genome of the isolated strain was successfully obtained by the combination of the third generation oxford nanopore and second generation illumina sequencing technologies besides the biotransformation properties of cap by the isolated strain under different nutritional conditions were investigated the biodegradation products were identified using the ultra high resolution mass spectrometer to establish a comprehensive biodegradation pathway of cap according to these findings we attempted to decipher that 1 whether there is a novel cap degrader in the enriched cap degrading consortia and what is the role it plays in the microbial community 2 whether there are novel cap biodegradation pathways in microbes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

initial concentrations of the carbon and nitrogen sources were 6 10 mm and 0 56 mm which was within the common range of nutrition contents applied for bacterial cultivation billet et al 2019 cao et al 2019 deng et al 2016 liu et al 2016 besides we also investigated the utilization of cap products including acap pnb and dca by cl consortium and cl5 1 isolate the initial concentration of acap pnb and dca was 50 100 and 100 mg l respectively the experimental process was as follows the cells of cl5 1 isolate from mineral salt agar plate were firstly inoculated into m2 medium containing 120 mg l cap and 1 g l sodium pyruvate after about 3 day cultivation the cells were then harvested for the subsequent inoculation and cap biodegradation experiments as for the enriched consortia the continuous passage cells were harvested for inoculation the cells were collected by centrifugation at 10000 g for 5 min and were further purified by resuspension in 20 ml culture medium solution this washing process was repeated two times then the purified cells were finally re suspended and inoculated into the corresponding mineral salt media for cap biodegradation the inoculum volume of consortia was 5 after inoculation the optical density of the cl5 1 at 600 nm od600 was about 0 03 all of the cultures were incubated at 25 c with120 rpm shaking the biomass of pure culture was indicated by od600

of orthologous groups cog and gene ontology go terms by eggnog mapper v2 huerta cepas et al 2019 carbohydrate active enzymes cazymes in the genome were classified by the dbcan meta server http bcb unl edu dbcan2 blast php this genome was assigned to the genus of sphingomonas by the taxonomic classification of gtdb tk v1 0 2 chaumeil et al 2019 to further ascertain the taxonomic position of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 we compared the average amino acid identity aai and the average nucleotide identity ani similarity between sphingomonas sp cl5 1 and 347 genomes belonging to the genus sphingomonas downloaded from the ncbi genome database comparem v0 0 23 https github com dparks1134 comparem and pyani v0 2 10 https github com widdowquinn pyani were used to calculate the aai and ani values respectively finally one genome from each species of genus sphingomonas and 4 unclassified sphingomonas genomes were selected for the analysis of the phylogenetic lineage of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 the marker genes of the genomes were inferred from checkm v1 1 2 based on 120 lineage specific marker genes parks et al 2015 the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed based on the marker genes using the maximum likelihood tree building method chaumeil et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 cap biodegrading capability and taxonomic structures of enriched consortia 3 1 1 cap biodegrading capacity of consortia after long term continuous passages the tested consortia were initially enriched from activated sludge in our lab and proved to be capable of degrading cap within 5 9 days zhang et al 2020 further assessment of the cap biodegradation capability of these six consortia after continuous passages for one more year was conducted in this study as shown in fig 1 cap of 120 mg l was reduced almost entirely in 44 h by consortia cl clg ch and chg by contrast consortia cls and chs took 96 h and 72 h for the complete elimination of 120 mg l cap our previous study demonstrated that consortium cl exhibited the strongest biodegradation capacity and required 120 h to completely degrade cap at 120 mg l zhang et al 2020 thus the cap biodegrading efficiency of the consortia was significantly enhanced through long term domestication student s t test p 0 001 however the mineralization rate of enriched bacterial consortia markedly decreased after long term domestication student s t test p 0 05 the mineralization rate of cap reached about 90 by consortia ch and cl in the previous study zhang et al 2020 while it decreased to be less than 80 after long term enrichment in the current study fig 1 the possible reasons regarding to the changes in cap biodegradation efficiency and mineralization after long term enrichment might be related to the variations in the microbial community compositions therefore the taxonomic structures of the six enriched consortia were investigated in subsequent subsection 3 1 2 3 1 2 the taxonomic structures and shared otus of consortia after long term enrichment compared to the previous study zhang et al 2020 the microbial community structures of six consortia were all simplified and the species richness declined about 69 82 at the otu operational taxonomic unit level after continuous passages for one year for instance the number of otus in consortium cl decreased from 175 to 32 student s t test p 0 001 after the long term continuous passages zhang et al 2020 other consortia clg cls ch chg and chs only contained 39 50 33 38 and 32 otus respectively in the present study fig s1a the simplification of the microbial community structure may be an important reason for the decrease in mineralization rates of cap currently ma et al 2019 also assessed the variations in biodegrading capacity and microbial community structure of a cap degrading consortium after about 2 years of continuous passages contrary to our results they found biodegradation efficiency of the acclimated consortium kept stable and the core genera compositions and abundances between the first and 152nd generations were at a similar level in the present study there were 11 shared otus among these six consortia and they were assigned to be sphingomonas cupriavidus chryseobacterium burkholderia pigmentiphaga burkholderia bosea dongia and pseudomonas at the genus level fig s1a and s1b it should be pointed out that two of 11 shared otus could only be assigned to the family level i e chitinophagaceae and enterobacteriaceae fig s1b the core genera of consortia cl and ch included sphingomonas cupriavidus burkholderia chryseobacterium and pigmentiphaga and they accounted for more than 98 of the total population fig s1b sphingomonas was the most dominant genus in these two consortia and it was also at high abundance in the other four consortia the average relative abundances of sphingomonas during the 3 day cultivation period were 69 7 17 4 16 7 70 3 19 1 and 4 4 in the consortia cl clg cls ch chg and chs respectively fig 2 moreover the relative abundance of sphingomonas was considerably increased on the 3rd day during cap biodegradation in all of the six consortia fig 2 for instance the proportion of sphingomonas increased from 5 0 to 38 9 after 3 days of cultivation in consortia cls student s t test p 0 001 these clues strongly suggested that sphingomonas might be the most crucial member of the consortium with the function of cap biodegradation sphingomonas belongs to family sphingomonadaceae this result was consistent with the previous study that another genus of family sphingomonadaceae sphingobium was also found to be the most dominant with the relative abundance over 63 in a cap degrading consortium but the pure culture was not obtained ma et al 2019 thus isolation of sphingomonas pure culture was further conducted to verify the above hypothesis 3 2 the cap biodegrading capability of the isolated strain cl5 1 a pure culture cl5 1 belonging to sphingomonas with the ability to utilize cap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy sources was successfully isolated from the consortium cl in this study it was a gram negative bacterium presenting rod shaped diameter 0 4 0 5 µm length 0 8 1 3 µm characterized by the scanning electron microscopy fig s2 to the best of our knowledge previous studies indicated that cap degraders mainly included genus clostridium streptomyces haemophilus escherichia geobacter and sphingobium ma et al 2020 xu et al 2019 xin et al 2012 smith et al 2007 mosher et al 1990 o brien et al 1971 malik et al 1971 it was the first time to directly confirm that genus sphingomonas could subsist on cap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy sources and this finding dramatically expanded our knowledge boundaries on the cap biodegradation microbes to gain a comprehensive insight into its biodegradation properties the cap biodegrading capacity and growth characteristics of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 under various nutrient conditions were assessed as follows 3 2 1 cap at high concentration inhibited cap biodegradation and the growth of strain cl5 1 the biodegrading capability of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was investigated at initial cap concentrations of 60 360 mg l as depicted in fig 3 a sphingomonas sp cl5 1 could completely remove 60 mg l and 120 mg l cap within 36 h and 48 h respectively the initial cap concentration of more than 240 mg l could markedly hamper the growth of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 and result in a low biodegradation efficiency 24 0 within 240 h in the previous study consortium cl had the ability of complete degradation of 500 mg l cap zhang et al 2020 exhibiting higher substrate tolerance than the isolated strain the inhibition effect of substrates at high concentrations on antibiotic utilizing strain has been widely observed cao et al 2019 found that the lag phase of sulfamethazine biodegradation by paenarthrobacter sp a01 was significantly extended when sulfamethazine concentrations increased from 10 to 500 mg l as a broad spectrum antibiotic cap exerts potent inhibition of protein synthesis in bacteria which determines its poor bioavailability for bacteria when the dose of cap is beyond the tolerable range of sphingomonas sp cl 5 1 it could not detoxify cap in time and thus resulting in growth inhibition however the microbial members in the consortium could collaborate to enhance the ability to detoxify cap that is why the mixed culture possesses a wider tolerable range than the pure culture the cooperative relationships between members of the microbial community in substrate degradation have been elaborated by previous studies for instance yu et al 2019 reported that the mixed culture of sphingonomas sp and pseudomonas sp strains could enhance bisphenol a removal compared to pure culture sphingonomas sp alone these results revealed the superiority of the microbial community over the individual bacterium regarding to biotransformation of organic pollutants remarkably the concentration of cap in domestic sewage hospital effluent antibiotic production wastewater aquaculture wastewater and livestock wastewater are commonly lower than 120 mg l level grenni et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 tran et al 2018 kimosop et al 2016 which could not pose inhibitory effect on sphingomonas sp cl5 1 therefore sphingomonas sp cl5 1 still exhibits promising cap biodegradation capability for wastewater treatment or other bioremediation circumstances 3 2 2 acetate inhibited cap biodegradation and the growth of strain cl5 1 glucose pyruvate and acetate were added at 6 10 mm as co substrate to assess the influences of different carbon source types on cap biodegradation efficiency by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 as shown in fig 3b cap removal efficiency at 36 h reached about 78 6 and 95 3 with co substrate of glucose and pyruvate respectively which were significantly higher than the removal efficiency of 67 2 with cap as the sole carbon source student s t test p 0 05 this result indicated that glucose and pyruvate could enhance cap biodegrading efficiency meanwhile the biomass increased exponentially in the presence of pyruvate after 12 h indicating supplementation of the medium with pyruvate could significantly shorten time to exponential growth student s t test p 0 001 in the case of glucose as co substrate sphingomonas sp cl5 1 started to grow at an exponential rate until 36 h cultivation which was similar to the condition of cap as the sole carbon source fig 3b however cap biodegradation was markedly hindered that only 22 8 and 70 5 cap was degraded after 36 h and 240 h cultivation with the presence of 6 10 mm acetate respectively student s t test p 0 001 fig 3b this observation suggested that acetate markedly inhibited the cap reduction meanwhile a minor increase in the biomass indicated that the growth of the strain was also inhibited by acetate this may be an important reason for consortia cls and chs supplied with acetate as the co substrate had significantly lower cap biodegradation efficiency than the other four consortia fig 1 the growth inhibitory effect of acetate on bacteria has been widely reported especially on gram negative bacilli pinhal et al 2019 roe et al 2002 it was confirmed that supplementation in macilvaine s minimal medium with 8 mm acetate could reduce the specific growth rate of e coli frag1 by 50 roe et al 2002 the toxicity of acetate on bacterial growth is multifactorial it is widely accepted that acetate can stir up systemic effects such as the perturbation of the anion component of the cell and the uncoupling effect of organic acids pinhal et al 2019 roe et al 2002 besides it has been testified that acetate at high concentrations can perturb methionine biosynthesis in the cell giving rise to the accumulation of the toxic intermediate of homocysteine roe et al 2002 obviously acetate is unsuitable to be a co substrate for cap biodegrading consortium enrichment or pure culture cultivation though it is widely used as the supplementary carbon source for enhancement of biological wastewater treatment in wwtps 3 2 3 nitrite inhibited cap biodegradation and the growth of strain cl5 1 the effect of inorganic nitrogen sources including ammonia nh4 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 on cap biodegradation efficiency was also investigated in the current study the concentration of nitrogen was set to 0 56 mm to support the growth of bacteria cap removal efficiency and growth of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 would not be influenced in the basic mineral medium with nh4 or no3 source compared with cap as the sole nitrogen source fig 3c student s t test p 0 05 while adding no2 to the medium the cap removal and growth of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was markedly suppressed student s t test p 0 001 and the final removal efficiency of cap at 240 h declined to about 75 fig 3c the mineralization rate was less than 25 in the presence of no2 which was only about half of that observed in the medium with nh4 no3 or cap as the sole nitrogen source fig 3d apparently the presence of no2 could not only hamper the reduction of cap but also probably suppress the metabolism of some intermediate metabolites resulting in a low utilization rate of carbon in cap the inhibition of no2 on contaminant removal and bacterial growth has also been reported in the process of biological wastewater treatment liu et al 2018 hrenović et al 2007 weon et al 2002 rowe et al 1979 hrenović et al 2007 found that nitrite ranging from 0 07 to 7 25 mm could interfere with the reproduction phosphate release and uptake rates of the phosphorus accumulating organism i e acinetobacter junii exerting negative impacts on the performance of the enhanced biological phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment systems rowe et al 1979 explained that the inhibitory effect of no2 on aerobic bacteria growth was mainly via deactivating iron containing enzymes or cytochrome oxidases which led to the disturbance of cellular respiration to sum up nitrite at 0 56 mm could exert a significantly adverse effect on cap biodegradation performance and the growth of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 3 3 genomic features and functional characteristics of the isolated strain cl5 1 through the assembly of the oxford nanopore sequencing data and error correction by illumina sequencing data a complete genome of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was obtained this genome consisted of a circular chromosome with a length of 4 441 086 bp and a circular plasmid with a length of 126 708 bp the gc contents of the chromosome and the plasmid were 67 1 and 62 6 respectively as depicted in the genomic circle plot of fig 4 a there were 4 272 cds coding sequences 51 trna and 6 rrna 2 copies in 5s 16s and 23s rrna in this genome via taxonomic classification based on the genome taxonomy database gtdb the genome of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was classified to be sphingomonas at the genus level to acquire its accurate taxonomy the whole genome of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was compared with 347 genomes belonging to genus sphingomonas downloaded from the ncbi genome database via aai average amino acid identity and ani average nucleotide identity similarity sphingomonas sp cl5 1 possessed the highest similarity with the genome of s sp 67 36 with the aai of 93 1 and the ani of 93 0 supplementary information file 2 the aai or ani similarities with other genomes were all less than 90 it appeared that sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was not homologous to any existing species in ncbi that is it may be a new species of sphingomonas as demonstrated in fig s3 the most closely related species of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 is s sp 67 36 followed by s sp 3p27f8 and s sp 66 10 they are clustered into a new clade distinct from the known species in genus sphingomonas this result supports the viewpoint that sphingomonas sp cl5 1 is probably a new species of genus sphingomonas sphingomonas distributes across various ecological systems from harsh to microbe growth friendly environments such as aqueous and terrestrial habitats plant root and leaf systems and even organism s skin or intestine li et al 2020 douterelo et al 2018 asaf et al 2020 duan et al 2020 the species of this genus are generally capable of utilizing wide ranging carbohydrates such as glucose lactose galactose mannose arabinose melibiose trehalose fucose sucrose xylose and some polysaccharides and even could grow and survive in the oligotrophic environment asaf et al 2020 as shown in fig s4a there are a total of 86 carbohydrate active enzymes distributed in the genome of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 the high diversity of cazymes in sphingomonas sp cl5 1 suggests its extensive carbohydrate utilization potential more importantly it has been lauded for its preemptive role in environmental remediation asaf et al 2020 a vast variety of strains belonging to sphingomonas have a robust ability to remove various contaminants such as 1 4 dioxane and hexachlorocyclohexane asaf et al 2020 miao et al 2020 qiao et al 2020 in especial they are well known as efficient degraders for catabolizing a variety of aromatic compounds and contain a large number of gene clusters involved in aromatic compound metabolism burroughs et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 perruchon et al 2017 kegg annotation results also demonstrated the versatility of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 in the catabolism of various substrates as depicted in fig s4b numerous proteins participated in biotransformation pathways of aromatics such as tyrosine metabolism phenylalanine metabolism tryptophan metabolism and benzoate metabolism meanwhile two gene clusters participating in the downstream biodegradation of aromatics via ortho and meta cleavage modes were identified fig 4b and fig 4c it is well known that cap contains an aromatic group through integrating the genomic information and the identified products a comprehensive biodegradation pathway of cap by consortia and pure culture cl5 1 was proposed subsequently which would expand the knowledge of cap biotransformation besides the detailed results of cazyme fig s4a cog fig s5 and go fig s6 annotation of this genome was described and discussed in the supplementary information file 1 text s2 3 4 the reconstruction of a novel cap biodegradation pathway 3 4 1 the identification of biodegradation products the biodegradation products of cap obtained from all the six consortia and pure culture cl5 1 were identified in the present study in order to detect more intermediate metabolites of cap cap biodegradation was also conducted in the pbs culture system because the microbial activities were low under this condition the main biodegradation products were determined by comparing the chromatograms of biodegradation samples with control samples ck fig s7 the proposed structure and chromatogram information of main products are listed in supplementary information file 3 the peak representing pd 364 appeared at the retention time rt 11 6 min and exhibited relatively high signal intensities in consortium samples but no significant signal in pure culture cl5 1 samples pd 364 showed a 43 da mass shift compared to cap with the same fragment ions of cap m z 321 0060 194 0466 and 152 0360 and thus was proposed to be acap chloramphenicol 3 acetate i e the acetylation product of cap the position of the acetyl group was more likely to bind to the oh group at the c3 location huang et al 2017 sorg et al 2016 pd 304 observed at m z 302 9959 was assumed to be the dehydrated form of cap because of the mass differential of 18 da between cap and pd 304 loss of 18 da and 137 da was observed for the dominant fragments of m z 302 9959 indicating the loss of an h2o molecule and nitrobenzyl group c7h6no2 h respectively it was reported that the loss of oh h is commonly observed in aromatic compounds where a methyl group is ortho to a nitro group in esi mode amildon ricardo et al 2018 pd 302 was assumed to be the oxidized product of pd 304 that the hydroxyl group in c1 location was converted to the ketone group pd 320 and pd 336 were assumed to be oxidized products of cap whose hydroxyl group in c3 location was converted to aldehyde and carboxyl group respectively it has been hypothesized that cap could be biodegraded by oxidation on the hydroxyl group at c3 location lingens et al 1966 despite no available standard reference to further confirm the products the matching chromatogram information of pd 320 and pd 336 during biodegradation of cap can somehow support this metabolic pathway the peak cluster m z at 170 172 174 of pd 171 had relative abundances at a ratio of 9 6 1 suggesting the presence of two chlorine atoms in the molecule pd 171 was thus assumed to be 2 2 dichloro n 2 hydroxyethyl acetamide c4h7no2cl2 dca was observed with predominant fragments at m z 126 9359 and 82 9461 at rt 1 7 min with significant isotope peaks of two chlorine atoms pnb was detected at rt 4 7 min and the observed predominant fragments were at m z 160 0140 122 0241 and 92 0263 it should be noted that the identification of pnb and dca was further confirmed using reference standards pd 153 was assumed to be 4 nitrobenzyl alcohol because it featured with fragment ions at m z 122 0241 and 92 0263 which represented nitrobenzene structure detata et al 2013 pnb and dca were reported in previous studies as primary intermediate metabolites of cap biodegradation ma et al 2019 xin et al 2012 mosher et al 1990 malik et al 1971 mosher et al 1990 found that dca pnb and pd 153 were the downstream products of cap biodegradation by streptomyces lividans there were other products e g pd 286a pd 286b pd 272 and pd 314 that were detected and were likely to be azo compounds supplementary information file 3 the color of the medium turned to light yellow and then faded away with extended cultivation time fig s8 boer et al 1983 found that 4 4 azoxydibenzoic acid possible structure for pd 286a was a degradation product of cap in eye drops 4 4 azoxydibenzoic acid was also detected as a secondary metabolite from fungus entomophthora virulenta claydon et al 1978 still there is a great uncertainty to their structures due to the relatively dispersed and low intensities of their fragment ions the generation of azo compounds from cap by bacteria has not been reported before it is worthwhile to verify their presence and figure out their biotransformation mechanism in the future study to sum up 11 products including pd 314 pd 304 pd 302 pd 286a pd 286b pd 272a pd 272b pd 270 pd 258 pd 171 and pd 169 are first discovered during the biotransformation process of cap in this study supplementary information file 3 which suggests that there is probably a novel cap biodegradation pathway in the tested consortia and pure culture notably the structure of these products still requires further confirmation via other multiple analysis methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance 3 4 2 the quantification of biodegradation products the quantification and the semi quantification of the main biodegradation products were conducted in the culture medium the concentration dynamics of acap pnb and dca during cap biodegradation by six consortia and pure culture were shown in fig s9 and s10 the semi quantification of other biodegradation products based on the changes in the corresponding peak area in chromatogram was also shown in fig s9 and s10 the concentrations of most products followed the trend that they increased first and then decayed to be undetectable about 2 58 mg l acap was produced at 52 h in the consortia cls while the accumulation of acap in other samples was less significant fig s9a pnb was also detected during biodegradation by all samples and its maximum accumulation level ranged from 0 14 to 4 67 mg l fig s9b and s10a the concentrations of acap and pnb were undetectable 0 002 mg l after 120 h biodegradation in comparison the accumulation of dca was more considerable than acap and pnb fig s9c and s10b about 41 8 and 46 4 mg l of dca were detected after 44 h cap biodegradation by consortia clg and chg respectively utilizing of dca by consortia clg and chg was too slow that there was about 31 9 and 43 1 mg l of dca remained in the medium after 120 h cultivation however complete biodegradation of dca was achieved by consortia cls after an accumulation of dca of 18 5 mg l at 72 h thus varied abilities utilizing metabolites were presented in different consortia which can be attributed to the differences of their microbial community structures on the other hand it was found that some biodegradation products such as pd 286a pd 272a and pd 270 could not be further decomposed by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 fig s10 however these products could not be detected in the mineral salt medium during cap degradation by consortia suggesting some members of consortia may rapidly decompose these products to be undetectable while they were produced in the enrichment medium there was no significant accumulation of products in the medium after 120 h cultivation for consortia cl and ch which explained the high mineralization rate of cap by the consortia the improved utilization of biodegradation products by consortia could contribute to the enhanced mineralization of cap than the pure culture this is a common phenomenon for the organic compound biodegradation by microbes for instance the mixed culture of arthrobacter sp d2 and pimelobacter sp lg209 could remove around 54 toc of sulfadiazine while arthrobacter sp d2 alone could only achieve toc removal of 24 which presented a more powerful capability of the mixed culture than the pure culture regarding to sulfadiazine mineralization the specific reason is that the metabolite 2 aminopyrimidine could only be further mineralized by the coexistence of these two bacteria deng et al 2018 these results revealed the superiority of the microbial community over the individual bacterium in the reduction of some intermediate metabolites which may be hazardous during organic pollutant biodegradation 3 4 3 influences of nitrogen source on biodegradation products produced by strain cl5 1 the influence of different nitrogen sources on the main biodegradation product formation by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was investigated when there were no additional nitrogen sources except cap the dca concentration peaked at 24 0 mg l at around 48 h and no significant further utilization by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 afterward fig s10b the presence of no2 seemed to slow down the accumulation of dca and caused postponed peaking time to 84 h in the case of pnb the addition of nh4 or no3 had no significant influence on the production of pnb compared to cultivation without additional nitrogen sources fig s10a it should be noted that the accumulation of pnb was enhanced with the presence of no2 maximal value of 3 33 mg l and about 0 69 mg l pnb remained after 240 h biodegradation whereas pnb stayed below 0 25 mg l during biodegradation with no additional nitrogen sources a similar tendency was observed in other intermediates such as pd 336 and pd 302 fig s10c and s10d no2 significantly inhibited the utilization of pd 302 and pd 336 by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 and caused dramatically accumulation in the medium compared to other nitrogen sources besides the addition of no2 reduced the production of some intermediates such as pd 286a pd 272a and pd 270 which probably was on account of the inhibitory action on the decomposition of the upstream intermediates like pd 302 and pd 336 fig s10 this suggested that no2 not only affected the biodegradation of cap by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 fig 3c but also the further utilization of the cap intermediate metabolites 3 4 4 proposed cap biodegradation pathways based on the identified products and their formation patterns during the biodegradation process four biodegradation pathways including two novel pathways that had not been reported before were proposed in parallel fig 5 apparently cap biodegradation was mainly via modification on the hydroxyl group in the c3 location cap was transformed into acap by acetylation at the hydroxyl group in the c3 location pathway a it was reported that the product of cap acetylation loses its ability to bind to the 50s ribosomal subunit of bacterial 70s ribosomes huang et al 2017 thereby acetylation of cap contributed to the reduction of toxic stress of cap on the population of the microbial communities sorg et al 2016 commonly the acetylation of cap is a reversible reaction in microbe tao et al 2012 tao et al 2011 thus we supposed that acap was reversed to cap and was further transformed to pnb p nitrobenzoic acid and dca 2 2 dichloroacetic acid the results of the product identification of acap supported the above supposition as shown in fig s11 consortium cl and strain cl5 1 could produce cap pd 336 pnb and dca when utilized acap as the sole carbon source thus acap was ultimately converted to cap via deacetylation by members like sphingomonas sp cl5 1 in the consortia and cap was further mineralized by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 through pathways b c and d oxidation of the hydroxyl group to aldehyde and carboxyl group occurred at c3 location leading to the formation of pd 320 and pd 336 pathway b furthermore cap could be transformed into pd 304 after dehydration at c3 location pathway c and then further oxidation on the hydroxyl group in c1 location caused the production of pd 302 this pathway is reported for the first time regarding to the biodegradation of cap in the present study further work providing stronger support to verify this pathway is still required in the future the acetylation dehydration and oxidation of the hydroxyl group in c3 location played essential roles in cap biodegradation apart from the reaction on the hydroxyl group in c3 location direct cleavage of the bond between c1 and c2 could be possible and leads to the release of pd 171 and pnb pathway d it is a novel bond breaking reaction that occurs during cap biodegradation these four pathways occur simultaneously and further degradation of the main intermediates can result in nitrobenzene compounds e g pnb and pd 153 and dca meanwhile nitrobenzene compounds were completed metabolized during biodegradation the downstream pathway of pnb biodegradation and mineralization was depicted according to the results of genomic functional annotation of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 fig s12 briefly catalyzed by the corresponding enzymes of the nitroreductase nfnb or nitrobenzene nitroreductase nbza pnb was transformed to protocatechuate pca then underwent ring ortho and meta cleavage and further mineralization two key gene clusters of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 participating in the biodegradation of pnb were identified as shown in fig 4 it is noteworthy that though the genomic information of cl5 1 suggested that pnb could be further mineralized via ortho and meta cleavage nevertheless we did not detect any related products probably because of the rapid production and decomposition of these products or the limitation of our detection methods further study needs to be conducted to confirm the above prediction 3 4 5 the role played by strain cl5 1 in cap biodegradation process it s noteworthy that the acetylation of cap pathway a didn t occur during the biodegradation process by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 because no acap was detected during the cultivation of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 the fact that no cap acetyltransferases was found in the genome of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 further provided the genotype evidence to verify the above biodegradation performance though this strain lacked the ability of cap acetylation it still took an active role in the downstream degradation of acap in the consortia it could utilize acap as the sole carbon source and completely degrade 50 mg l acap within 132 h fig s13a the core role played by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 regarding to cap metabolism in the consortium mainly includes biodegradation pathways b c and d sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was responsible for the initial modification of c3 hydroxyl and breakdown of c1 and c2 of cap producing pd 336 pd 302 pnb and dca the metabolites produced by this strain could feed other microbial members in the consortium especially some products such as dca pd 270 pd 272a and pd 286a which were produced abundantly but hardly utilized by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 could support other members to grow and reproduce this speculation could be well verified by the following result that is dca was completely biodegraded after 120 h in the consortia cl cls ch and chs fig s9c while remained as high as 21 4 mg l after 240 h in sphingomonas sp cl5 1 fig s10b besides the biodegradable capability of consortium cl and strain cl5 1 on 100 mg l pnb and dca as the sole carbon source were evaluated respectively pnb and dca were rapidly degraded to undetectable levels by the consortium within 24 h fig s13b and c in contrast strain cl5 1 took 216 h to completely degrade 100 mg l pnb while did not exhibit the ability to utilize dca as the sole carbon source fig s13b and c these results further confirmed that pnb and dca produced from cap by strain cl5 1 were the main substances for other members in the consortium to thrive and reproduce meanwhile compared to the pure culture the consortium presented a better mineralization performance on cap without harmful products e g dca and pnb accumulation in the medium this feature makes the consortium more suitable for the application of biological treatment of cap polluted wastewater the interactions between this core strain and other microbial members of consortia still need further exploration of their genomic and metabolic information in the future study 4 conclusions the present study provided new insights into the cap metabolic mechanism by consortia and pure culture after long term enrichment the cap biodegrading efficiency of the consortia was enhanced while the cap mineralization rate decreased slightly sphingomonas was the shared dominant genus among these six consortia furthermore a pure culture cl5 1 belonging to genus sphingomonas with the cap biodegradation capability was isolated and the phylogenetic analysis indicated it was a novel species of genus sphingomonas strain cl5 1 could degrade 120 mg l cap completely in 48 h with a final mineralization rate of 50 4 this was the first time to directly confirm that genus sphingomonas could subsist on cap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy sources and this finding dramatically expanded our knowledge boundaries on the cap biodegradation microbe it should be noted that 6 10 mm acetate or 0 56 mm nitrite would markedly inhibit the biodegradation of cap by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 eleven new metabolites were identified via hplc qtof ms analysis and four biodegradation pathways including acetylation oxidization and dehydration of c3 hydroxy of cap as well as the bond cleavage between c1 and c2 were proposed in the present study among which the latter two are novel metabolic pathways that have not been reported previously sphingomonas sp cl5 1 exerted crucial function via c3 hydroxyl oxidation c3 dehydration and c1 c2 bond cleavage of cap in the consortium declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17478,figuring out the comprehensive metabolic mechanism of chloramphenicol cap is critical to improving cap removal in the bioremediation process in this study cap biodegradation by six consortia and isolated sphingomonas sp cl5 1 were systematically investigated using the combination of high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry second generation and third generation sequencing technologies the cap degrading capability of six consortia was enhanced while cap mineralization rate declined after long term enrichment the microbial community structures of six consortia were all simplified with 69 82 decline in species richness after continuous passages for one year the core genera of consortia cl and ch included sphingomonas cupriavidus burkholderia chryseobacterium and pigmentiphaga which accounted for over 98 of the total population sphingomonas was discovered as a new cap degrader that could subsist on cap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy sources sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was able to completely remove 120 mg l cap within 48 hours with a mineralization rate of 50 4 the presence of acetate or nitrite could inhibit cap metabolization by strain cl5 1 four cap metabolic pathways were constructed including modification of the c3 hydroxyl group of cap via acetylation oxidization dehydration and the bond cleavage between c1 and c2 c3 hydroxyl group dehydration and c1 c2 bond cleavage were first reported regarding to cap biotransformation strain cl5 1 played a core role in the consortia and was responsible for c3 hydroxyl oxidation c3 dehydration and c1 c2 bond cleavage genomic information of strain cl5 1 revealed the further mineralization pathways of downstream product p nitrobenzoic acid via ortho and meta cleavage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chloramphenicol biodegradation sphingomonas genomics metabolic pathway 1 introduction as global antibiotic consumption increasing with years the environmental problems caused by antibiotics abuse are highly concerned nowadays chloramphenicol cap derived from streptomyces venezuelae is the first economically produced synthetic antibiotic ehrlich et al 1947 because of its broad spectrum antibacterial property and effective therapeutic action on typhoid it came into medical and veterinary practices widely in the world however researchers found that cap had negative side effects including aplastic anemia and genotoxic carcinogenicity thus many countries have banned cap from medical treatment and food production hanekamp et al 2015 regardless of the adverse effects of cap some developing countries are still in mass production and consumption of cap because of its low cost the residues of cap are frequently detected in various ecological environments especially in domestic sewage hospital effluent and aquaculture and livestock wastewater which become the environmental hotspots of antibiotics grenni et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 tran et al 2018 kimosop et al 2016 according to the recent surveys the concentration of cap ranges from minimum quantifiable level to 2430 ng l in influent and minimum quantifiable level to 1050 ng l in the effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps in asia tran et al 2018 it has been confirmed that biotreatments such as membrane bioreactor and conventional activated sludge processes could effectively and stably remove cap residues in wastewater in wwtps tran et al 2016 peng et al 2006 as a broad spectrum antimicrobial drug cap exerts deleterious effects on bacteria by binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome leading to the suppression of protein synthesis mosa et al 2015 which decreases its bioavailability the process of domestication usually can enhance the biotreatment performance of the activated sludge on cap removal in wwtps several studies have reported the cap reduction by enriched consortia an efficient cap degrading consortium was enriched by ma et al 2019 from activated sludge which could remove 50 mg l cap within 24 h besides some cap utilizing bacteria were isolated including clostridium acetobutylicum o brien et al 1971 streptomyces sp 3022a malik et al 1971 streptomyces venezuelae isp5230 mosher et al 1990 haemophilus influenzae rd kw20 smith et al 2007 escherichia fergusonii i 10 chl xin et al 2012 and geobacter metallireducens gs 15 xu et al 2019 research on exploring the aerobic microbial biotransformation of cap can be traced back to the 1950s egami et al 1951 found that the crude enzyme extracted from streptococcus hcemolyticus could reduce the nitro group of cap recently nfsb nitroreductase was identified to be responsible for transforming cap to amino cap in strain h influenza nfsb which was an emerging cap resistance mechanism for bacteria crofts et al 2019 the hydrolysis on amido bond of cap catalyzed by chloramphenicol acetate esterase is another common cap transformation mechanism which has been reported in previous studies xin et al 2012 tao et al 2012 tao et al 2011 mosher et al 1990 malik et al 1971 the gene estdl136 encoding cap acetate esterase was identified from soil metagenome data and e coli carrying this gene was capable of catalyzing cap into p nitrophenylserinol tao et al 2012 besides cap acetyltransferase can modify the 1 or 3 hydroxyl group of cap by acetylation reaction which is also a common resistance mechanism for bacteria huang et al 2017 sorg et al 2016 however how the product chloramphenicol 3 acetate acap is further utilized by bacteria is still unclear to our knowledge the published studies mainly focused on the first step of cap biotransformation under aerobic conditions and there are still lots of research gaps on the further metabolic pathways of intermediate metabolites such as acap p nitrophenylserinol and p nitrobenzoic acid pnb thus more efforts should be made to reconstruct the comprehensive cap degrading pathway under aerobic conditions in the previous study we enriched six cap degrading consortia from activated sludge under different culture conditions zhang et al 2020 in this study cap degrading capability and taxonomic structures were further assessed after one more year of serial passage culture using the same enrichment medium in addition a strain with a powerful capability of cap biodegradation was isolated and the complete genome of the isolated strain was successfully obtained by the combination of the third generation oxford nanopore and second generation illumina sequencing technologies besides the biotransformation properties of cap by the isolated strain under different nutritional conditions were investigated the biodegradation products were identified using the ultra high resolution mass spectrometer to establish a comprehensive biodegradation pathway of cap according to these findings we attempted to decipher that 1 whether there is a novel cap degrader in the enriched cap degrading consortia and what is the role it plays in the microbial community 2 whether there are novel cap biodegradation pathways in microbes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

scientific ltd beijing china 2 2 cap degrading consortia enrichment and strain isolation basic mineral salt media m1 ph 6 9 and m2 ph 6 0 with different na2hpo4 kh2po4 ratios were used to enrich consortia from activated sludge the compositions of culture media were listed in table s1 consortia enriched in m1 and m2 with the presence of the 120 mg l cap as sole substrate were denoted as ch and cl respectively consortia enriched in m1 and m2 with co substrates of 120 mg l cap and 1 g l glucose were denoted as chg and clg respectively consortia enriched in m1 and m2 with 120 mg l cap and 1 g l sodium acetate as co substrates were denoted as chs and cls respectively the concentration of cap was set to be as high as 120 mg l in order to enrich consortia with the ability to degrade cap at a wide range concentration in high efficiency the detailed enrichment process was described in our previous study zhang et al 2020 the consortia were maintained in continual cultures for one year from then on the continuous passage of enriched consortia was conducted under the following conditions one passage per week 5 incubating volume 5 ml inoculum into 100 ml fresh enrichment media containing 120 mg cap and 1 g l corresponding co substrate incubation at 25 c and 120 rpm shaking a pure culture cl5 1 with the ability of cap biodegradation was isolated from consortia cl via the spread plate method using cap as the sole carbon source the micromorphology of the isolation was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss supra 55 carl zeiss germany according to our previously published method cao et al 2019 2 3 biodegradation capability assessment of cap and its products after 12 months of serial cultivation with one passage per week the cap biodegradation capability of these six consortia in the corresponding enrichment medium was assessed the impacts of cap concentrations 60 120 240 and 360 mg l and additional nutritional sources including carbon sources glucose sodium acetate and sodium pyruvate and nitrogen sources ammonium chloride potassium nitrate and potassium nitrite on the cap biodegradation by cl5 1 isolate were investigated in mineral salt medium m2 the initial concentrations of the carbon and nitrogen sources were 6 10 mm and 0 56 mm which was within the common range of nutrition contents applied for bacterial cultivation billet et al 2019 cao et al 2019 deng et al 2016 liu et al 2016 besides we also investigated the utilization of cap products including acap pnb and dca by cl consortium and cl5 1 isolate the initial concentration of acap pnb and dca was 50 100 and 100 mg l respectively the experimental process was as follows the cells of cl5 1 isolate from mineral salt agar plate were firstly inoculated into m2 medium containing 120 mg l cap and 1 g l sodium pyruvate after about 3 day cultivation the cells were then harvested for the subsequent inoculation and cap biodegradation experiments as for the enriched consortia the continuous passage cells were harvested for inoculation the cells were collected by centrifugation at 10000 g for 5 min and were further purified by resuspension in 20 ml culture medium solution this washing process was repeated two times then the purified cells were finally re suspended and inoculated into the corresponding mineral salt media for cap biodegradation the inoculum volume of consortia was 5

concentration and sequenced on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa with 300 bp paired end sequencing strategy in majorbio shanghai china the sequencing data were deposited to ncbi sra with a bioproject accession number of prjna612984 to obtain a complete genome of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 genomic dna was sequenced on promethion oxford nanopore technologies ont oxford uk using sqk

github com rrwick filtlong with a minimum length threshold of 500 bp and a minimum mean quality threshold of 7 0 the filtered reads were assembled using flye v2 6 kolmogorov et al 2019 the draft

of orthologous groups cog and gene ontology go terms by eggnog mapper v2 huerta cepas et al 2019 carbohydrate active enzymes cazymes in the genome were classified by the dbcan meta server http bcb unl edu dbcan2 blast php this genome was assigned to the genus of sphingomonas by the taxonomic classification of gtdb tk v1 0 2 chaumeil et al 2019 to further ascertain the taxonomic position of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 we compared the average amino acid identity aai and the average nucleotide identity ani similarity between sphingomonas sp cl5 1 and 347 genomes belonging to the genus sphingomonas downloaded from the ncbi genome database comparem v0 0 23 https github com dparks1134 comparem and pyani v0 2 10 https github com widdowquinn pyani were used to calculate the aai and ani values respectively finally one genome from each species of genus sphingomonas and 4 unclassified sphingomonas genomes were selected for the analysis of the phylogenetic lineage of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 the marker genes of the genomes were inferred from checkm v1 1 2 based on 120 lineage specific marker genes parks et al 2015 the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed based on the marker genes using the maximum likelihood tree building method chaumeil et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 cap biodegrading capability and taxonomic structures of enriched consortia 3 1 1 cap biodegrading capacity of consortia after long term continuous passages the tested consortia were initially enriched from activated sludge in our lab and proved to be capable of degrading cap within 5 9 days zhang et al 2020 further assessment of the cap biodegradation capability of these six consortia after continuous passages for one more year was conducted in this study as shown in fig 1 cap of 120 mg l was reduced almost entirely in 44 h by consortia cl clg ch and chg by contrast consortia cls and chs took 96 h and 72 h for the complete elimination of 120 mg l cap our previous study demonstrated that consortium cl exhibited the strongest biodegradation capacity and required 120 h to completely degrade cap at 120 mg l zhang et al 2020 thus the cap biodegrading efficiency of the consortia was significantly enhanced through long term domestication student s t test p 0 001 however the mineralization rate of enriched bacterial consortia markedly decreased after long term domestication student s t test p 0 05 the mineralization rate of cap reached about 90 by consortia ch and cl in the previous study zhang et al 2020 while it decreased to be less than 80 after long term enrichment in the current study fig 1 the possible reasons regarding to the changes in cap biodegradation efficiency and mineralization after long term enrichment might be related to the variations in the microbial community compositions therefore the taxonomic structures of the six enriched consortia were investigated in subsequent subsection 3 1 2 3 1 2 the taxonomic structures and shared otus of consortia after long term enrichment compared to the previous study zhang et al 2020 the microbial community structures of six consortia were all simplified and the species richness declined about 69 82 at the otu operational taxonomic unit level after continuous passages for one year for instance the number of otus in consortium cl decreased from 175 to 32 student s t test p 0 001 after the long term continuous passages zhang et al 2020 other consortia clg cls ch chg and chs only contained 39 50 33 38 and 32 otus respectively in the present study fig s1a the simplification of the microbial community structure may be an important reason for the decrease in mineralization rates of cap currently ma et al 2019 also assessed the variations in biodegrading capacity and microbial community structure of a cap degrading consortium after about 2 years of continuous passages contrary to our results they found biodegradation efficiency of the acclimated consortium kept stable and the core genera compositions and abundances between the first and 152nd generations were at a similar level in the present study there were 11 shared otus among these six consortia and they were assigned to be sphingomonas cupriavidus chryseobacterium burkholderia pigmentiphaga burkholderia bosea dongia and pseudomonas at the genus level fig s1a and s1b it should be pointed out that two of 11 shared otus could only be assigned to the family level i e chitinophagaceae and enterobacteriaceae fig s1b the core genera of consortia cl and ch included sphingomonas cupriavidus burkholderia chryseobacterium and pigmentiphaga and they accounted for more than 98 of the total population fig s1b sphingomonas was the most dominant genus in these two consortia and it was also at high abundance in the other four consortia the average relative abundances of sphingomonas during the 3 day cultivation period were 69 7 17 4 16 7 70 3 19 1 and 4 4 in the consortia cl clg cls ch chg and chs respectively fig 2 moreover the relative abundance of sphingomonas was considerably increased on the 3rd day during cap biodegradation in all of the six consortia fig 2 for instance the proportion of sphingomonas increased from 5 0 to 38 9 after 3 days of cultivation in consortia cls student s t test p 0 001 these clues strongly suggested that sphingomonas might be the most crucial member of the consortium with the function of cap biodegradation sphingomonas belongs to family sphingomonadaceae this result was consistent with the previous study that another genus of family sphingomonadaceae sphingobium was also found to be the most dominant with the relative abundance over 63 in a cap degrading consortium but the pure culture was not obtained ma et al 2019 thus isolation of sphingomonas pure culture was further conducted to verify the above hypothesis 3 2 the cap biodegrading capability of the isolated strain cl5 1 a pure culture cl5 1 belonging to sphingomonas with the ability to utilize cap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy sources was successfully isolated from the consortium cl in this study it was a gram negative bacterium presenting rod shaped diameter 0 4 0 5 µm length 0 8 1 3 µm characterized by the scanning electron microscopy fig s2 to the best of our knowledge previous studies indicated that cap degraders mainly included genus clostridium streptomyces haemophilus escherichia geobacter and sphingobium ma et al 2020 xu et al 2019 xin et al 2012 smith et al 2007 mosher et al 1990 o brien et al 1971 malik et al 1971 it was the first time to directly confirm that genus sphingomonas could subsist on cap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy sources and this finding dramatically expanded our knowledge boundaries on the cap biodegradation microbes to gain a comprehensive insight into its biodegradation properties the cap biodegrading capacity and growth characteristics of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 under various nutrient conditions were assessed as follows 3 2 1 cap at high concentration inhibited cap biodegradation and the growth of strain cl5 1 the biodegrading capability of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was investigated at initial cap concentrations of 60 360 mg l as depicted in fig 3 a sphingomonas sp cl5 1 could completely remove 60 mg l and 120 mg l cap within 36 h and 48 h respectively the initial cap concentration of more than 240 mg l could markedly hamper the growth of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 and result in a low biodegradation efficiency 24 0 within 240 h in the previous study consortium cl had the ability of complete degradation of 500 mg l cap zhang et al 2020 exhibiting higher substrate tolerance than the isolated strain the inhibition effect of substrates at high concentrations on antibiotic utilizing strain has been widely observed cao et al 2019 found that the lag phase of sulfamethazine biodegradation by paenarthrobacter sp a01 was significantly extended when sulfamethazine concentrations increased from 10 to 500 mg l as a broad spectrum antibiotic cap exerts potent inhibition of protein synthesis in bacteria which determines its poor bioavailability for bacteria when the dose of cap is beyond the tolerable range of sphingomonas sp cl 5 1 it could not detoxify cap in time and thus resulting in growth inhibition however the microbial members in the consortium could collaborate to enhance the ability to detoxify cap that is why the mixed culture possesses a wider tolerable range than the pure culture the cooperative relationships between members of the microbial community in substrate degradation have been elaborated by previous studies for instance yu et al 2019 reported that the mixed culture of sphingonomas sp and pseudomonas sp strains could enhance bisphenol a removal compared to pure culture sphingonomas sp alone these results revealed the superiority of the microbial community over the individual bacterium regarding to biotransformation of organic pollutants remarkably the concentration of cap in domestic sewage hospital effluent antibiotic production wastewater aquaculture wastewater and livestock wastewater are commonly lower than 120 mg l level grenni et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 tran et al 2018 kimosop et al 2016 which could not pose inhibitory effect on sphingomonas sp cl5 1 therefore sphingomonas sp cl5 1 still exhibits promising cap biodegradation capability for wastewater treatment or other bioremediation circumstances 3 2 2 acetate inhibited cap biodegradation and the growth of strain cl5 1 glucose pyruvate and acetate were added at 6 10 mm as co substrate to assess the influences of different carbon source types on cap biodegradation efficiency by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 as shown in fig 3b cap removal efficiency at 36 h reached about 78 6 and 95 3 with co substrate of glucose and pyruvate respectively which were significantly higher than the removal efficiency of 67 2 with cap as the sole carbon source student s t test p 0 05 this result indicated that glucose and pyruvate could enhance cap biodegrading efficiency meanwhile the biomass increased exponentially in the presence of pyruvate after 12 h indicating supplementation of the medium with pyruvate could significantly shorten time to exponential growth student s t test p 0 001 in the case of glucose as co substrate sphingomonas sp cl5 1 started to grow at an exponential rate until 36 h cultivation which was similar to the condition of cap as the sole carbon source fig 3b however cap biodegradation was markedly hindered that only 22 8 and 70 5 cap was degraded after 36 h and 240 h cultivation with the presence of 6 10 mm acetate respectively student s t test p 0 001 fig 3b this observation suggested that acetate markedly inhibited the cap reduction meanwhile a minor increase in the biomass indicated that the growth of the strain was also inhibited by acetate this may be an important reason for consortia cls and chs supplied with acetate as the co substrate had significantly lower cap biodegradation efficiency than the other four consortia fig 1 the growth inhibitory effect of acetate on bacteria has been widely reported especially on gram negative bacilli pinhal et al 2019 roe et al 2002 it was confirmed that supplementation in macilvaine s minimal medium with 8 mm acetate could reduce the specific growth rate of e coli frag1 by 50 roe et al 2002 the toxicity of acetate on bacterial growth is multifactorial it is widely accepted that acetate can stir up systemic effects such as the perturbation of the anion component of the cell and the uncoupling effect of organic acids pinhal et al 2019 roe et al 2002 besides it has been testified that acetate at high concentrations can perturb methionine biosynthesis in the cell giving rise to the accumulation of the toxic intermediate of homocysteine roe et al 2002 obviously acetate is unsuitable to be a co substrate for cap biodegrading consortium enrichment or pure culture cultivation though it is widely used as the supplementary carbon source for enhancement of biological wastewater treatment in wwtps 3 2 3 nitrite inhibited cap biodegradation and the growth of strain cl5 1 the effect of inorganic nitrogen sources including ammonia nh4 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 on cap biodegradation efficiency was also investigated in the current study the concentration of nitrogen was set to 0 56 mm to support the growth of bacteria cap removal efficiency and growth of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 would not be influenced in the basic mineral medium with nh4 or no3 source compared with cap as the sole nitrogen source fig 3c student s t test p 0 05 while adding no2 to the medium the cap removal and growth of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was markedly suppressed student s t test p 0 001 and the final removal efficiency of cap at 240 h declined to about 75 fig 3c the mineralization rate was less than 25 in the presence of no2 which was only about half of that observed in the medium with nh4 no3 or cap as the sole nitrogen source fig 3d apparently the presence of no2 could not only hamper the reduction of cap but also probably suppress the metabolism of some intermediate metabolites resulting in a low utilization rate of carbon in cap the inhibition of no2 on contaminant removal and bacterial growth has also been reported in the process of biological wastewater treatment liu et al 2018 hrenović et al 2007 weon et al 2002 rowe et al 1979 hrenović et al 2007 found that nitrite ranging from 0 07 to 7 25 mm could interfere with the reproduction phosphate release and uptake rates of the phosphorus accumulating organism i e acinetobacter junii exerting negative impacts on the performance of the enhanced biological phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment systems rowe et al 1979 explained that the inhibitory effect of no2 on aerobic bacteria growth was mainly via deactivating iron containing enzymes or cytochrome oxidases which led to the disturbance of cellular respiration to sum up nitrite at 0 56 mm could exert a significantly adverse effect on cap biodegradation performance and the growth of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 3 3 genomic features and functional characteristics of the isolated strain cl5 1 through the assembly of the oxford nanopore sequencing data and error correction by illumina sequencing data a complete genome of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was obtained this genome consisted of a circular chromosome with a length of 4 441 086 bp and a circular plasmid with a length of 126 708 bp the gc contents of the chromosome and the plasmid were 67 1 and 62 6 respectively as depicted in the genomic circle plot of fig 4 a there were 4 272 cds coding sequences 51 trna and 6 rrna 2 copies in 5s 16s and 23s rrna in this genome via taxonomic classification based on the genome taxonomy database gtdb the genome of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was classified to be sphingomonas at the genus level to acquire its accurate taxonomy the whole genome of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was compared with 347 genomes belonging to genus sphingomonas downloaded from the ncbi genome database via aai average amino acid identity and ani average nucleotide identity similarity sphingomonas sp cl5 1 possessed the highest similarity with the genome of s sp 67 36 with the aai of 93 1 and the ani of 93 0 supplementary information file 2 the aai or ani similarities with other genomes were all less than 90 it appeared that sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was not homologous to any existing species in ncbi that is it may be a new species of sphingomonas as demonstrated in fig s3 the most closely related species of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 is s sp 67 36 followed by s sp 3p27f8 and s sp 66 10 they are clustered into a new clade distinct from the known species in genus sphingomonas this result supports the viewpoint that sphingomonas sp cl5 1 is probably a new species of genus sphingomonas sphingomonas distributes across various ecological systems from harsh to microbe growth friendly environments such as aqueous and terrestrial habitats plant root and leaf systems and even organism s skin or intestine li et al 2020 douterelo et al 2018 asaf et al 2020 duan et al 2020 the species of this genus are generally capable of utilizing wide ranging carbohydrates such as glucose lactose galactose mannose arabinose melibiose trehalose fucose sucrose xylose and some polysaccharides and even could grow and survive in the oligotrophic environment asaf et al 2020 as shown in fig s4a there are a total of 86 carbohydrate active enzymes distributed in the genome of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 the high diversity of cazymes in sphingomonas sp cl5 1 suggests its extensive carbohydrate utilization potential more importantly it has been lauded for its preemptive role in environmental remediation asaf et al 2020 a vast variety of strains belonging to sphingomonas have a robust ability to remove various contaminants such as 1 4 dioxane and hexachlorocyclohexane asaf et al 2020 miao et al 2020 qiao et al 2020 in especial they are well known as efficient degraders for catabolizing a variety of aromatic compounds and contain a large number of gene clusters involved in aromatic compound metabolism burroughs et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 perruchon et al 2017 kegg annotation results also demonstrated the versatility of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 in the catabolism of various substrates as depicted in fig s4b numerous proteins participated in biotransformation pathways of aromatics such as tyrosine metabolism phenylalanine metabolism tryptophan metabolism and benzoate metabolism meanwhile two gene clusters participating in the downstream biodegradation of aromatics via ortho and meta cleavage modes were identified fig 4b and fig 4c it is well known that cap contains an aromatic group through integrating the genomic information and the identified products a comprehensive biodegradation pathway of cap by consortia and pure culture cl5 1 was proposed subsequently which would expand the knowledge of cap biotransformation besides the detailed results of cazyme fig s4a cog fig s5 and go fig s6 annotation of this genome was described and discussed in the supplementary information file 1 text s2 3 4 the reconstruction of a novel cap biodegradation pathway 3 4 1 the identification of biodegradation products the biodegradation products of cap obtained from all the six consortia and pure culture cl5 1 were identified in the present study in order to detect more intermediate metabolites of cap cap biodegradation was also conducted in the pbs culture system because the microbial activities were low under this condition the main biodegradation products were determined by comparing the chromatograms of biodegradation samples with control samples ck fig s7 the proposed structure and chromatogram information of main products are listed in supplementary information file 3 the peak representing pd 364 appeared at the retention time rt 11 6 min and exhibited relatively high signal intensities in consortium samples but no significant signal in pure culture cl5 1 samples pd 364 showed a 43 da mass shift compared to cap with the same fragment ions of cap m z 321 0060 194 0466 and 152 0360 and thus was proposed to be acap chloramphenicol 3 acetate i e the acetylation product of cap the position of the acetyl group was more likely to bind to the oh group at the c3 location huang et al 2017 sorg et al 2016 pd 304 observed at m z 302 9959 was assumed to be the dehydrated form of cap because of the mass differential of 18 da between cap and pd 304 loss of 18 da and 137 da was observed for the dominant fragments of m z 302 9959 indicating the loss of an h2o molecule and nitrobenzyl group c7h6no2 h respectively it was reported that the loss of oh h is commonly observed in aromatic compounds where a methyl group is ortho to a nitro group in esi mode amildon ricardo et al 2018 pd 302 was assumed to be the oxidized product of pd 304 that the hydroxyl group in c1 location was converted to the ketone group pd 320 and pd 336 were assumed to be oxidized products of cap whose hydroxyl group in c3 location was converted to aldehyde and carboxyl group respectively it has been hypothesized that cap could be biodegraded by oxidation on the hydroxyl group at c3 location lingens et al 1966 despite no available standard reference to further confirm the products the matching chromatogram information of pd 320 and pd 336 during biodegradation of cap can somehow support this metabolic pathway the peak cluster m z at 170 172 174 of pd 171 had relative abundances at a ratio of 9 6 1 suggesting the presence of two chlorine atoms in the molecule pd 171 was thus assumed to be 2 2 dichloro n 2 hydroxyethyl acetamide c4h7no2cl2 dca was observed with predominant fragments at m z 126 9359 and 82 9461 at rt 1 7 min with significant isotope peaks of two chlorine atoms pnb was detected at rt 4 7 min and the observed predominant fragments were at m z 160 0140 122 0241 and 92 0263 it should be noted that the identification of pnb and dca was further confirmed using reference standards pd 153 was assumed to be 4 nitrobenzyl alcohol because it featured with fragment ions at m z 122 0241 and 92 0263 which represented nitrobenzene structure detata et al 2013 pnb and dca were reported in previous studies as primary intermediate metabolites of cap biodegradation ma et al 2019 xin et al 2012 mosher et al 1990 malik et al 1971 mosher et al 1990 found that dca pnb and pd 153 were the downstream products of cap biodegradation by streptomyces lividans there were other products e g pd 286a pd 286b pd 272 and pd 314 that were detected and were likely to be azo compounds supplementary information file 3 the color of the medium turned to light yellow and then faded away with extended cultivation time fig s8 boer et al 1983 found that 4 4 azoxydibenzoic acid possible structure for pd 286a was a degradation product of cap in eye drops 4 4 azoxydibenzoic acid was also detected as a secondary metabolite from fungus entomophthora virulenta claydon et al 1978 still there is a great uncertainty to their structures due to the relatively dispersed and low intensities of their fragment ions the generation of azo compounds from cap by bacteria has not been reported before it is worthwhile to verify their presence and figure out their biotransformation mechanism in the future study to sum up 11 products including pd 314 pd 304 pd 302 pd 286a pd 286b pd 272a pd 272b pd 270 pd 258 pd 171 and pd 169 are first discovered during the biotransformation process of cap in this study supplementary information file 3 which suggests that there is probably a novel cap biodegradation pathway in the tested consortia and pure culture notably the structure of these products still requires further confirmation via other multiple analysis methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance 3 4 2 the quantification of biodegradation products the quantification and the semi quantification of the main biodegradation products were conducted in the culture medium the concentration dynamics of acap pnb and dca during cap biodegradation by six consortia and pure culture were shown in fig s9 and s10 the semi quantification of other biodegradation products based on the changes in the corresponding peak area in chromatogram was also shown in fig s9 and s10 the concentrations of most products followed the trend that they increased first and then decayed to be undetectable about 2 58 mg l acap was produced at 52 h in the consortia cls while the accumulation of acap in other samples was less significant fig s9a pnb was also detected during biodegradation by all samples and its maximum accumulation level ranged from 0 14 to 4 67 mg l fig s9b and s10a the concentrations of acap and pnb were undetectable 0 002 mg l after 120 h biodegradation in comparison the accumulation of dca was more considerable than acap and pnb fig s9c and s10b about 41 8 and 46 4 mg l of dca were detected after 44 h cap biodegradation by consortia clg and chg respectively utilizing of dca by consortia clg and chg was too slow that there was about 31 9 and 43 1 mg l of dca remained in the medium after 120 h cultivation however complete biodegradation of dca was achieved by consortia cls after an accumulation of dca of 18 5 mg l at 72 h thus varied abilities utilizing metabolites were presented in different consortia which can be attributed to the differences of their microbial community structures on the other hand it was found that some biodegradation products such as pd 286a pd 272a and pd 270 could not be further decomposed by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 fig s10 however these products could not be detected in the mineral salt medium during cap degradation by consortia suggesting some members of consortia may rapidly decompose these products to be undetectable while they were produced in the enrichment medium there was no significant accumulation of products in the medium after 120 h cultivation for consortia cl and ch which explained the high mineralization rate of cap by the consortia the improved utilization of biodegradation products by consortia could contribute to the enhanced mineralization of cap than the pure culture this is a common phenomenon for the organic compound biodegradation by microbes for instance the mixed culture of arthrobacter sp d2 and pimelobacter sp lg209 could remove around 54 toc of sulfadiazine while arthrobacter sp d2 alone could only achieve toc removal of 24 which presented a more powerful capability of the mixed culture than the pure culture regarding to sulfadiazine mineralization the specific reason is that the metabolite 2 aminopyrimidine could only be further mineralized by the coexistence of these two bacteria deng et al 2018 these results revealed the superiority of the microbial community over the individual bacterium in the reduction of some intermediate metabolites which may be hazardous during organic pollutant biodegradation 3 4 3 influences of nitrogen source on biodegradation products produced by strain cl5 1 the influence of different nitrogen sources on the main biodegradation product formation by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was investigated when there were no additional nitrogen sources except cap the dca concentration peaked at 24 0 mg l at around 48 h and no significant further utilization by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 afterward fig s10b the presence of no2 seemed to slow down the accumulation of dca and caused postponed peaking time to 84 h in the case of pnb the addition of nh4 or no3 had no significant influence on the production of pnb compared to cultivation without additional nitrogen sources fig s10a it should be noted that the accumulation of pnb was enhanced with the presence of no2 maximal value of 3 33 mg l and about 0 69 mg l pnb remained after 240 h biodegradation whereas pnb stayed below 0 25 mg l during biodegradation with no additional nitrogen sources a similar tendency was observed in other intermediates such as pd 336 and pd 302 fig s10c and s10d no2 significantly inhibited the utilization of pd 302 and pd 336 by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 and caused dramatically accumulation in the medium compared to other nitrogen sources besides the addition of no2 reduced the production of some intermediates such as pd 286a pd 272a and pd 270 which probably was on account of the inhibitory action on the decomposition of the upstream intermediates like pd 302 and pd 336 fig s10 this suggested that no2 not only affected the biodegradation of cap by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 fig 3c but also the further utilization of the cap intermediate metabolites 3 4 4 proposed cap biodegradation pathways based on the identified products and their formation patterns during the biodegradation process four biodegradation pathways including two novel pathways that had not been reported before were proposed in parallel fig 5 apparently cap biodegradation was mainly via modification on the hydroxyl group in the c3 location cap was transformed into acap by acetylation at the hydroxyl group in the c3 location pathway a it was reported that the product of cap acetylation loses its ability to bind to the 50s ribosomal subunit of bacterial 70s ribosomes huang et al 2017 thereby acetylation of cap contributed to the reduction of toxic stress of cap on the population of the microbial communities sorg et al 2016 commonly the acetylation of cap is a reversible reaction in microbe tao et al 2012 tao et al 2011 thus we supposed that acap was reversed to cap and was further transformed to pnb p nitrobenzoic acid and dca 2 2 dichloroacetic acid the results of the product identification of acap supported the above supposition as shown in fig s11 consortium cl and strain cl5 1 could produce cap pd 336 pnb and dca when utilized acap as the sole carbon source thus acap was ultimately converted to cap via deacetylation by members like sphingomonas sp cl5 1 in the consortia and cap was further mineralized by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 through pathways b c and d oxidation of the hydroxyl group to aldehyde and carboxyl group occurred at c3 location leading to the formation of pd 320 and pd 336 pathway b furthermore cap could be transformed into pd 304 after dehydration at c3 location pathway c and then further oxidation on the hydroxyl group in c1 location caused the production of pd 302 this pathway is reported for the first time regarding to the biodegradation of cap in the present study further work providing stronger support to verify this pathway is still required in the future the acetylation dehydration and oxidation of the hydroxyl group in c3 location played essential roles in cap biodegradation apart from the reaction on the hydroxyl group in c3 location direct cleavage of the bond between c1 and c2 could be possible and leads to the release of pd 171 and pnb pathway d it is a novel bond breaking reaction that occurs during cap biodegradation these four pathways occur simultaneously and further degradation of the main intermediates can result in nitrobenzene compounds e g pnb and pd 153 and dca meanwhile nitrobenzene compounds were completed metabolized during biodegradation the downstream pathway of pnb biodegradation and mineralization was depicted according to the results of genomic functional annotation of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 fig s12 briefly catalyzed by the corresponding enzymes of the nitroreductase nfnb or nitrobenzene nitroreductase nbza pnb was transformed to protocatechuate pca then underwent ring ortho and meta cleavage and further mineralization two key gene clusters of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 participating in the biodegradation of pnb were identified as shown in fig 4 it is noteworthy that though the genomic information of cl5 1 suggested that pnb could be further mineralized via ortho and meta cleavage nevertheless we did not detect any related products probably because of the rapid production and decomposition of these products or the limitation of our detection methods further study needs to be conducted to confirm the above prediction 3 4 5 the role played by strain cl5 1 in cap biodegradation process it s noteworthy that the acetylation of cap pathway a didn t occur during the biodegradation process by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 because no acap was detected during the cultivation of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 the fact that no cap acetyltransferases was found in the genome of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 further provided the genotype evidence to verify the above biodegradation performance though this strain lacked the ability of cap acetylation it still took an active role in the downstream degradation of acap in the consortia it could utilize acap as the sole carbon source and completely degrade 50 mg l acap within 132 h fig s13a the core role played by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 regarding to cap metabolism in the consortium mainly includes biodegradation pathways b c and d sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was responsible for the initial modification of c3 hydroxyl and breakdown of c1 and c2 of cap producing pd 336 pd 302 pnb and dca the metabolites produced by this strain could feed other microbial members in the consortium especially some products such as dca pd 270 pd 272a and pd 286a which were produced abundantly but hardly utilized by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 could support other members to grow and reproduce this speculation could be well verified by the following result that is dca was completely biodegraded after 120 h in the consortia cl cls ch and chs fig s9c while remained as high as 21 4 mg l after 240 h in sphingomonas sp cl5 1 fig s10b besides the biodegradable capability of consortium cl and strain cl5 1 on 100 mg l pnb and dca as the sole carbon source were evaluated respectively pnb and dca were rapidly degraded to undetectable levels by the consortium within 24 h fig s13b and c in contrast strain cl5 1 took 216 h to completely degrade 100 mg l pnb while did not exhibit the ability to utilize dca as the sole carbon source fig s13b and c these results further confirmed that pnb and dca produced from cap by strain cl5 1 were the main substances for other members in the consortium to thrive and reproduce meanwhile compared to the pure culture the consortium presented a better mineralization performance on cap without harmful products e g dca and pnb accumulation in the medium this feature makes the consortium more suitable for the application of biological treatment of cap polluted wastewater the interactions between this core strain and other microbial members of consortia still need further exploration of their genomic and metabolic information in the future study 4 conclusions the present study provided new insights into the cap metabolic mechanism by consortia and pure culture after long term enrichment the cap biodegrading efficiency of the consortia was enhanced while the cap mineralization rate decreased slightly sphingomonas was the shared dominant genus among these six consortia furthermore a pure culture cl5 1 belonging to genus sphingomonas with the cap biodegradation capability was isolated and the phylogenetic analysis indicated it was a novel species of genus sphingomonas strain cl5 1 could degrade 120 mg l cap completely in 48 h with a final mineralization rate of 50 4 this was the first time to directly confirm that genus sphingomonas could subsist on cap as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy sources and this finding dramatically expanded our knowledge boundaries on the cap biodegradation microbe it should be noted that 6 10 mm acetate or 0 56 mm nitrite would markedly inhibit the biodegradation of cap by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 eleven new metabolites were identified via hplc qtof ms analysis and four biodegradation pathways including acetylation oxidization and dehydration of c3 hydroxy of cap as well as the bond cleavage between c1 and c2 were proposed in the present study among which the latter two are novel metabolic pathways that have not been reported previously sphingomonas sp cl5 1 exerted crucial function via c3 hydroxyl oxidation c3 dehydration and

17479,this study evaluates the predictive capacity of the meta asm model a new integrated metabolic activated sludge model in describing the long term performance of a full scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr system that suffers from inconsistent performance in order to elucidate the causes of ebpr upsets and troubleshoot the process accordingly the meta asm model was tested as an operational diagnostic tool in a 1336 day long term dynamic simulation while its performance was compared with the asm inctrl model a version based on the barker dold model overall the predictions obtained with the meta asm without changing default parameters were more reliable and effective at describing the active biomass of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and the dynamics of their storage polymers the primary causes of the ebpr upsets were the high aerobic hydraulic retention times hrts and low organic loading rates olrs of the plant which led to periods of starvation the impact of these factors on ebpr performance were only identified with the meta asm model furthermore the first signs of process upsets were predicted by variations in the aerobic pao maintenance rates suggesting that the meta asm model has potential to provide an early warning of process upset the simulation of a new viable operational strategy indicated that troubleshooting the process could be achieved by reducing the aerated volume by switching off air in the first half of the aeration tank in this new strategy the meta asm model predicted a simultaneous improvement in the biological phosphorus p and nitrogen n removal due to the enhancement of the hydrolysis and fermentation of the mixed liquor sludge in the new unaerated zone which increased the availability of volatile fatty acids vfas for paos this study demonstrates that the meta asm model is a powerful operational diagnostic tool for ebpr systems capable of predicting and mitigating upsets optimising performance and

particulate unbiodegradable organics 1 introduction enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in activated sludge systems is a widely applied process at wastewater treatment plants wwtps that economically and sustainably removes anthropogenic phosphorus p to prevent undesirable eutrophication in receiving waters and potentially increases p recovery from sludge in downstream processes yang et al 2017 compared to chemical p removal less sludge is produced and ebpr significantly reduces chemical and sludge disposal costs the effectiveness of this process relies on the activity of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos which grow under alternating anaerobic and aerobic or anoxic conditions it is known that ebpr plants with various configurations are able to achieve low p effluent levels below 1 g p m 3 for long periods of time however several studies have reported that many of these ebpr facilities suffer from inconsistent performance due to the occurrence of unpredictable upsets that can lead to temporary or even irreversible ebpr loss barnard et al 2012 barnard and abraham 2006 barnard and steichen 2006 bushee et al 2019 gu et al 2008 neethling 2006 oehmen et al 2007 rieger et al 2001 examples of factors commonly reported as primary causes of ebpr upsets include i influent load dynamics e g periods of limited availability of readily biodegradable chemical oxygen demand rbcod and nutrients ii inhibition of fermentation due to presence of nitrate nitrite or oxygen in anaerobic zones iii competition for substrate in anaerobic zones e g between paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos or with other denitrifiers if nitrate or nitrite are present iv individual or combined effect of selected operational conditions and environmental factors e g high influent soluble rbcodinf ptot inf ratio carbon composition high dissolved oxygen do excessive return activated sludge ras recycle rates long hydraulic retention times hrts in aerobic tanks and secondary clarifiers high environmental temperatures overdosing of metals etc mitigating a process upset break through of phosphate po4 3 p in effluent is difficult because the trigger for an upset typically happens 1 2 days before elevated p levels are detectable in the effluent therefore in response to an upset event ebpr facilities often fall back to chemical p precipitation to meet effluent limits bushee et al 2019 as most upsets are unpredictable due to lack of readily available data or the data available for process diagnosis and decision making are of insufficient quality chemicals are often added constantly and in excess as a corrective measure increasing chemical dosage directly and negatively impact ebpr performance due to limited availability of phosphorus consequently the operational costs of these ebpr facilities increase chemical and sludge disposal costs and the potential to recover p from sludge is reduced in fact only a few parameters useful for process diagnosis are routinely measured through grab or composite samples of influent and effluent whereas monitoring of biological tanks is usually limited to upset events schauer et al 2018 this is too late to link root cause and effect due to the very dynamic nature of the ebpr process increasingly stringent regulations for p removal less than 0 1 g m 3 in some regions bunce et al 2018 oleszkiewicz and barnard 2006 have forced wwtps with conventional ebpr configurations to i develop novel strategies to maintain a more stable and consistent long term ebpr operation and ii develop early warning operational diagnostic tools for ebpr processes to support decision making in view of plant upsets emerging strategies to improve ebpr stability consist of modifying conventional ebpr configurations by other alternatives that enhance sludge fermentation to overcome the issue of low availability of rbcod in the influent barnard et al 2017 some examples described in the literature include upgrading conventional ebpr configurations with one of the following processes barnard et al 2012 2017 barnard and abraham 2006 sedlak 1991 tooker et al 2016 wang et al 2019 i fermentation of primary sludge ii side stream fermentation of ras iii mainstream mixed liquor fermentation by either switching off air in a small fraction of a plug flow aeration tank or by switching off a mixer in an anaerobic zone and iv control of external carbon dosage based on measurements of po4 3 p in the effluent or in the anaerobic reactor potential early warning operational diagnostic tools are still under investigation and their use in practice is still very limited only a few examples can be found in the literature which include the use of i online po4 3 p analysers and po4 3 p uptake respirometers placed at strategic locations to assess the po4 3 p uptake rate capacity of the mixed liquor sludge as an indirect measurement of the amount of poly β hydroxyalkanoates pha stored in the biomass bushee et al 2019 schauer et al 2018 and ii predictive models santos et al 2020 varga et al 2018 the latter has been suggested to be a promising tool as it potentially describes in detail the microbial and chemical transformations of different ebpr scenarios and predicts long term ebpr performance however previous studies have not yet investigated if this is indeed the case the meta asm an integrated metabolic activated sludge model was described in a previous publication santos et al 2020 as a powerful tool to predict ebpr process behaviour since it reduces calibration efforts needed for ebpr processes this model improved various shortcomings of the existing ebpr models by incorporating the effect of operational conditions on the pao gao competition the capability of paos and gaos to denitrify metabolic shifts as a function of storage polymer concentrations as well as the role of these polymers in endogenous processes and a better description of the fermentation process although its effectiveness compared to existing models was successfully demonstrated by describing 34 different data sets from enriched and full scale sludge its performance in a long term dynamic simulation of a full scale ebpr system was still required to be demonstrated along with its utility as a diagnostic tool to predict ebpr upsets therefore two models the meta asm santos et al 2020 and the asm inctrl model inctrl solutions canada are tested in this study as operational diagnostic tools to predict ebpr instability in a long term operation of a full scale three stage phoredox a2 o activated sludge system these models were chosen because the former was identified previously as a predictive model and the latter is based on the barker dold model barker and dold 1997 which is still one of the most widely used ebpr models in engineering and implemented in most commercial software available this work focusses on evaluating whether the structure of these biokinetic models and respective default parameters are capable of providing an early warning of process upsets and a reliable response over a long term dynamic simulation furthermore process troubleshooting is also performed with the most predictive model in order to offer viable strategies to improve the performance of the wwtp under study 2 material and methods 2 1 objectives for the wwtp the boavista wwtp is located on the algarve coast where the flux of population to this region increases in summer due to the typical portuguese and european vacation period the objectives for the wwtp are to understand the causes of the inconsistent ebpr performance and to develop low cost mitigation solutions applicable within the boundaries of the existing infrastructure available at the plant improving biological p removal to less than 1 g p m 3 without the need for chemical dosing are priorities 2 2 wwtp description the boavista wwtp was designed to serve 33 180 population equivalents and has a capacity of 6843 m3 d 1 the biological treatment stage is an a2 o activated sludge process designed with two parallel lanes to remove biochemical oxygen demand bod nitrogen n and p biologically currently only one lane is working because the maximum influent flow measured during the high season is about half of the maximum capacity fig 1 shows a simplified scheme of the boavista wwtp where only one lane is represented in the biological treatment the preliminary treatment is composed of screening units and processes for the removal of grit grease and oil this plant has no primary treatment and therefore raw influent wastewater inf and reject water rw recycled from the sludge line after flow qinf rw measurement are directly fed into a plug flow tank this tank is sequentially divided into anaerobic ran anoxic rax and aerobic rox tanks the anaerobic and anoxic tanks are physically divided by walls into 2 stirred cells in series aeration is achieved through 312 fine bubble membrane diffusers distributed equally in two grids placed at 0 5 m from the floor of the aerobic tank the do is controlled within the range of 0 42 1 0 g o2 m 3 see do profile in figure a 1 appendix a nitrate and nitrite produced in the aerobic tank are recycled to the first anoxic cell rax1 with a fixed flow qrox rax1 chemical p precipitation with a 43 w w solution of fe2 so4 3 is applied at the outlet of the aerobic tank whenever the effluent levels of total phosphorus ptot are observed by operators above 3 g p m 3 through lab measurements see fig 4 b part of the activated sludge settled in the secondary clarifier is returned to the first anaerobic cell via the ras with a recycle ratio proportional to the influent flow qras qinf 1 37 0 34 waste activated sludge was is concentrated in a thickener the thickened was tw is dewatered by two centrifuges and transported from the wwtp the rw recovered from the thickening and dewatering process are recycled to the preliminary treatment 2 3 data collection analysis and reconciliation plant data recorded from 2nd january 2012 to 30th august 2015 were collected analysed and reconciled table a 1 see appendix a summarises the input and performance data used in this study and table 1 contains the physical dimensions of each process unit fig 2 3 4 a 4 b and 4 c show the dynamics and average values of the influent codtot inf ntot inf and ptot inf loads hrts of the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks sludge retention time srt metal dosage and temperature in the aerobic tank respectively the influent loading of the plant varies according to the typical pattern of population influx in the region where the highest mass loads were commonly obtained in warmer months high season from may to october and the lowest mass loads were commonly obtained in cooler months low season from november to april these loading dynamics have been impacting the operational conditions of the plant srt and hrt of the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks and affecting the resulting ebpr performance fig 4 b shows that metal dosing increased significantly in the high seasons suggesting that this ebpr plant suffers from inconsistent performance the variations of ph in the influent 7 46 0 21 and effluent 7 59 0 29 were very low faults were detected and removed in the input and performance data by following the recommendations of the iwa guidelines for using activated sludge models rieger et al 2012 briefly outliers and gross errors were detected and removed after 1 visualisation of data flows concentrations and mass loads in time series plots 2 analysis

model setup two plant models differing only in the biokinetic models chosen to simulate the ebpr dynamics of the boavista wwtp were set up in simba ifak germany according to the flow scheme depicted in fig 1 the biokinetic models meta asm santos et al 2020 and asm inctrl inctrl solutions canada were chosen for this study and extended with the simple chemical precipitation model of asm2d henze et al 1999 the meta asm is a novel integrated metabolic activated sludge model capable of predicting ebpr performance with a robust single set of default parameters santos et al 2020 and was developed to overcome various shortcomings of existing ebpr models readers are referred to santos et al 2020 for a more detailed description of the meta asm model briefly this model incorporates the effect of operational conditions on the competition between paos and gaos and their capability to denitrify the metabolic shifts of paos gaos as a function of storage polymer concentrations the role of storage polymers in endogenous processes and a more detailed description of the fermentation process the asm inctrl model inctrl solutions canada is a version based on the barker dold model barker and dold 1997 which differs from the original in the description of the following processes denitrification of ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos and paos as well as nitrification were modelled in two steps and the endogenous processes of ohos ammonia oxidizing organisms aoos and nitrite oxidizing organisms noos were modelled as a function of the electron acceptors this version was chosen because the barker dold model is still one of the most widely used ebpr models in practice and most commercial software available has these modifications implemented in their updated barker dold models the two chemical precipitation processes of asm2d henze et al 1999 were incorporated in both models to describe the effect of chemical p removal in the plant under study note that many studies have recently developed new precipitation models barat et al 2011 kazadi mbamba et al 2015 solon et al 2017 but their integration into the selected biokinetic models was considered beyond the scope of this study each plant model was built as follows the anaerobic and anoxic cells were modelled as a single continuous stirred tank reactor cstr and the aerobic tank was split evenly into two cstrs each one with one grid containing 156 fine bubble membrane diffusers the secondary clarifier was modelled as an ideal separator with volume sludge blanket and clear water zone where the tss of the effluent was determined as a fraction var1 of the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of the aerobic tank in addition the biokinetic models were also activated at the top and bottom layers of the clarifier to describe the commonly observed biological reactions the thickener was modelled as a point clarifier model where tss of the reject water was determined as a fraction var2 of tss of the thickened was the fractions var1 and var2 were defined based on the average values determined in the period under study var1 0 154 100 and var2 7 060 100 the dewatering centrifuge was modelled by setting the final sludge tss concentration and the efficiency of sludge removal from fluid flow with their average measured values of 162 256 kg m3 and 0 97 respectively influent models were configured to convert the influent daily average values of qinf codtot inf ntot inf ptot inf and inorganic suspended solids issinf into state variables of the biokinetic models under study see section 2 5 the qras qwas and qtw were set to the daily average flows measured see table 1 furthermore a typical do profile ranging from 0 42 to 1 00 g o2 m 3 was used to control aeration see figure a 1 in appendix a and the daily dosage of fe oh 3 was estimated based on the monthly consumption of the 43 fe2 so4 3 solution see fig 4 b 2 5 influent characterisation and definition of initial conditions a week long sampling campaign from 15th to 22nd june 2015 was performed at the influent and effluent see sampling locations nr 1 and 8 respectively in fig 1 this campaign aimed to collect additional data needed to complete the fractionation of the influent during the period under study and to develop influent models capable of converting measurements into model state variables the recommendations of the iwa guidelines for using activated sludge models rieger et al 2012 were followed to build the influent models table b1 see appendix b summarises the average values of the parameters measured over the period under study as well as the result of their conversion into state variables of meta asm and asm inctrl models as recommended by the iwa guidelines the cod mass balance was closed by defining the slowly biodegradable substrate xb fraction based on bod measurements fixing the ordinary heterotrophic organisms xoho fraction with a typical value 0 13 and calculating the particulate unbiodegradable organics xu fraction with the remaining cod difference the mass balances of ptot ntot tss and vss were closed with absolute percent errors of less than 2 while the mass balances of bod5 tot and bod5 filt were closed with absolute percent errors of 13 and 3 9 respectively the initial concentrations of the particulate variables in both plant models were defined with the values obtained after a 1336 day steady state simulation and a 300 day dynamic simulation 2 6 simulation studies 2 6 1 model evaluation and prediction of ebpr upsets a 1336 day long term dynamic simulation was performed using the two plant models described in section 2 4 without changing any default parameters in the biokinetic models the processes of po4 3 p precipitation and redissolution of asm2d were deactivated and activated to evaluate the combined effect of chemical and biological p removal in the plant under study see appendix c note that the original kinetic rates of these processes were reduced ten times to prevent the fast precipitation of po4 3 p in the aerobic tank as performed by ingildsen et al 2006 the predictive power of the models was quantified by calculating the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse of the po4 3 p ran2 ptot eff mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss rox and codtot rox when the chemical precipitation processes were activated see section 3 1 the capability of these two models to predict the causes for the ebpr upsets observed in the boavista wwtp was also assessed in this simulation see section 3 2 2 6 2 mitigation of ebpr upsets the mitigation of the identified ebpr upsets was performed by reducing the aerated volume this operational strategy was designed with the aim of using existing infrastructure to improve biological p removal to less than 1 g p m 3 without the need for chemical dosing in order to compare the impact of this operational strategy with the historical operation simulated in section 2 6 1 the same input data and approach for the definition of initial model concentrations described in sections 2 3 and 2 5 respectively were used note that only the outputs from september 2014 to august 2015 were shown in section 3 3 to facilitate the comparison of each operational strategy during periods with relatively high pao activity the plant model setup described in section 2 4 using the meta asm as a biokinetic model was modified as follows the existing aerobic tank with hrts of 73 h 12 h and 40 h 9 h in the low and high seasons was split evenly into two cstrs in series one unaerated and the other aerated due to the fact that the first grid of 156 air diffusors can be turned off this modification reduced the previous hrts to 36 h 6 h low season and 20 h 4 h high season in each new unaerated and aerated zone respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation a model is considered predictive and robust when it is capable to describe in detail the microbial and chemical transformations with minimal adjustment to parameters these features were assessed in this study by performing a 1336 day long term dynamic simulation with the two plant models without changing any stoichiometric and kinetic default parameters in the selected biokinetic models the goal was to determine the capacity of each model to predict the ebpr behaviour independently of a calibration procedure it should be noted that the default parameters of the meta asm model were calibrated and validated in previous work based on 34 datasets originating from other studies santos et al 2020 this work represents the first study investigating the capacity of the meta asm model to describe the long term performance at a full scale ebpr plant the impact of the chemical precipitation processes on the predictions of po4 3 p ran2 and ptot eff by each biokinetic model was first evaluated by deactivating and activating these processes figure c 1 in appendix c shows that the predictions of ptot eff improved in both models when the chemical processes were activated while the predictions of po4 3 p ran2 only improved in the meta asm model these simulations show that the high doses of fe2 so4 3 that were added at the outlet of the aerobic tank were recirculated by the ras to the anaerobic zone the meta asm model predicted that the actual contribution of chemical precipitation to the overall p removal averaged 43 11 at the boavista wwtp table 2 shows the average observed and simulated po4 3 p ran2 ptot eff codtot rox and mlvss rox by the meta asm and asm inctrl models in the period under study with the chemical precipitation processes activated as well as the respective maes and rmses the performance of the meta asm model showed significant improvement with respect to the description of each variable although the asm inctrl model reasonably described the ptot eff it poorly described the po4 3 p ran2 codtot rox and mlvss rox these results may suggest that this model fails to describe the active biomass and storage polymer concentrations as will be discussed in section 3 2 in fact santos et al 2020 showed that the barker dold model failed to describe the anaerobic po4 3 p release in wwtps where the glycogen pools in the cells were exhausted the evaluation of the predictive power of both biokinetic models in the boavista wwtp shows that the meta asm model provided a more reliable response over a long term dynamic simulation highlighting that its biokinetic structure and default parameters were more robust than that of the asm inctrl model to describe the biological p removal in the plant under study 3 2 prediction of ebpr upsets the boavista wwtp suffered from inconsistent ebpr performance fig 4 b shows that this plant regularly relies on chemical p precipitation to meet effluent limits the high temperatures observed in high seasons see fig 4 c and the rapid increase of influent loads observed in the transition from low to high seasons see fig 2 accompanied by the decrease of the hrts in the biological tanks see fig 3 appears to each have an impact on the microbial dynamics and ebpr performance due to the combined influence of these factors the reasons for ebpr deterioration in high seasons were not clear with potential reasons including the growth of gaos the metabolic shifts as a function of storage polymer concentrations and the role of these polymers in endogenous processes thus both plant models were used to elucidate the causes for the ebpr upsets observed in the boavista wwtp and the combined impact of all individual factors on the overall process fig 5 a shows that the predicted percentage of paos and gaos per total active biomass averaged 0 8 1 0 and 0 5 0 1 in the low season and 1 5 1 5 and 0 4 0 1 in the high season with the meta asm model respectively different predictions were obtained with the asm inctrl model where paos averaged 16 0 5 8 and 23 0 3 5 in the low and high season fig 5 b respectively however the predictions obtained with the meta asm are in the same range as the microbial characterisation performed by lanham et al 2013 on this plant using quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridisation qfish the authors observed that the percentages of accumulibacter paos and competibacter lineage plus defluviicoccus vanus gaos were 3 2 and 0 3 respectively in addition the observed percentage of accumulibacter paos and predicted by the meta asm model are also within the range of values observed in other microbial characterisation studies at full scale ebpr plants stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 wu et al 2019 these results suggest that the asm inctrl model overpredicts the activity of paos several studies lopez vazquez et al 2009a 2009b panswad et al 2003 ren et al 2011 whang and park 2006 have shown that high temperatures can be detrimental to ebpr due to the fact that gaos have kinetic advantages over paos at high temperatures however the model predictions demonstrated that gaos had a residual impact at the boavista wwtp even in summer where temperatures were above 28 c this might suggest that other operational conditions are exerting a higher selective pressure in favour of paos than the high temperature exerts in favour of gaos as reported in some studies and elucidated further with the meta asm model qiu et al 2019 shen et al 2017 fig 5 also demonstrates that the activity of paos increased in the high seasons and decreased in the low seasons after 550 days which correlates with the oscillations described in the influent loading hrt temperature and anaerobic po4 3 p release depicted in fig 2 3 4 and c 1 b see appendix c respectively paos grew more after 550 days because the average srts in the low and high seasons were respectively 6 and 3 days lower than that of the first 550 days suggesting that the srts after day 550 were more beneficial to sustain ebpr in the boavista wwtp see table d 1 in appendix d figure d 1 see appendix d shows that the preferred pathways for the origin of reducing power in the anaerobic metabolism of paos were the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle for the uptake of acetate and butyrate and the conversion of propionyl coa to acetyl coa for the uptake of propionate and valerate the use of these pathways by paos is common in full scale ebpr plants with low influent volatile fatty acid vfa concentrations and long aerobic retention times cokro et al 2017 lanham et al 2013 zhou et al 2009 in this plant the estimated vfa concentration in the influent and the aerobic hrt averaged 20 5 g cod m 3 and 73 12 h in the low season and 26 4 g cod m 3 and 40 9 h in the high season respectively which led to a low replenishment of the glycogen pools in paos and to a limited reducing power for the conversion of vfas to pha via the glycolysis pathway in these situations paos tend to shift their metabolism to alternative pathways as survival strategy that favours the competition of paos over gaos santos et al 2020 since the origin of reducing power and energy in the latter comes essentially from the glycolysis pathway oehmen et al 2010 the meta asm model is the only ebpr model capable of describing this metabolic shift and elucidating that this competitive advantage of paos may also contribute to the reduction of the ebpr efficiency because in both alternative pathways more po4 3 p is released and less pha is produced under anaerobic conditions santos et al 2020 this means that less pha is available for the removal of po4 3 p under anoxic and aerobic conditions in addition the simulation of the paos endogenous rates in the aerobic tank with the meta asm shows that the maintenance rate on pha increased with the concentration of paos while the maintenance rate on polyphosphate increased when the pha rate decreased see fig 6 a the application of the meta asm suggests that paos are depleting their pha pools which limits simultaneously their growth production of polyphosphate and po4 3 p uptake and maintenance on pha as a survival strategy to the high aerobic hrts and low organic loading rate olr conditions especially observed in the transition from high to low seasons paos consume stored polyphosphate as a source of energy prior to decay in fact the meta asm predictions showed that the increase of the maintenance rate on polyphosphate is accompanied with the increase of ptot ff concentrations as demonstrated in fig 6 a the same conclusions cannot be drawn with the simulation of the endogenous rates with the asm inctrl see fig 6 b this model explains the increase of ptot ff concentrations with the simultaneous reduction of the aerobic decay of pao and lysis of releasable stored polyphosphate pplo which happens due to the simultaneous decrease of paos active biomass and pplo respectively occurring when no more pha is available for their growth and production of polyphosphate and po4 3 p uptake however this correlation was only established with the information obtained with the meta asm model by itself the asm inctrl model fig 6 b did not show any clear correlation between the increase of ptot ff concentrations and the reduction of pao endogenous rates furthermore the mechanisms described by the asm inctrl are not supported by previous experimental evidence carvalheira et al 2014b lanham et al 2014 liu et al 2017 lu et al 2007 vargas et al 2013 since paos appear to deplete their pha and polyphosphate storage polymers prior to decay as well as glycogen when it is available both models described that nitrate and nitrite were recirculated to the anaerobic zone through the ras however table d 2 see appendix d shows that there is no correlation between this factor and paos activity while the vfainf loading rates and the aerobic hrts correlated positively and negatively respectively with the vfa uptake rates by paos in the anaerobic tank pao loads in the aerobic tank and pao maintenance rates on pha in the aerobic and anoxic zones respectively thus the impact of the vfainf loading rate and the aerobic hrt were identified to be the primary operational factors that should be adjusted to augment p removal performance since the aerobic hrt is more readily adjustable and does not imply additional cost to the process operation further attention was focussed on this parameter figure d 2 see appendix d demonstrates that the meta asm can be used as an operational diagnostic tool capable of providing 10 days of early warning of process upsets by predicting the variations in aerobic pao maintenance rates as shown the maintenance on pha began to decrease at 992 days when the ptot eff concentration in the aerobic tank was still below 1 g p m 3 this maintenance rate reached minimum values at 1007 days while the maintenance rate on polyphosphate and the concentration of ptot eff reached maximum values as the maintenance rate on pha increased again 1007 days meaning that pha is available for pao growth and production of polyphosphate and po4 3 p uptake the maintenance rate on polyphosphate and the ptot eff concentration decreased interestingly bushee et al 2019 were also capable of providing about 10 days of early warning of process upsets by using information obtained from online po4 3 p analysers placed at the end of the anaerobic zone and the middle of the aerobic zone and a po4 3 p uptake respirometer placed at the end of the anaerobic zone the authors concluded that the system was moving toward instability when the po4 3 p uptake rate capacity of the mixed liquor sludge decreased similarly they correlated the occurrence of an upset with the reduction of the amount of pha stored in the biomass this study demonstrates the causes associated with high aerobic hrts and low olrs were only possible to be identified with the application of the meta asm model this model predicted that in this plant more po4 3 p and less pha is produced per vfa uptake under anaerobic conditions and that paos are depleting their pha pools and consuming polyphosphate as a survival strategy under aerobic conditions therefore the meta asm model is a more powerful operational diagnostic tool to predict ebpr instability allowing the development of mitigation strategies for the upsets identified in this plant 3 3 mitigation of ebpr upsets the operational strategy of reducing the aerated volume described in section 2 6 2 hereafter referred to as new strategy was specifically designed to reduce the observed consumption of polyphosphate caused by high aerobic hrts the aim was to assess a strategy applicable within the boundaries of the existing infrastructure available at the plant that improves biological p removal to less than 1 g p m 3 without the need for chemical dosing the impact of this new strategy was compared with the historical operation simulated in section 2 6 1 referred to as the regular strategy using the same influent characteristics and dynamics fig 7 a compares the ptot eff predictions obtained in each simulated strategy it can be observed that low ptot eff concentrations 0 3 0 1 g p m 3 were continuously reached in the new strategy without the need for chemical dosing in addition fig 7 b shows that the new strategy also improved the removal of n 5 7 1 9 g ntot eff m 3 compared to the 16 7 3 2 g ntot eff m 3 predicted in the regular strategy the reasons for the simultaneous improvement of p and n removal in the new strategy were elucidated with the meta asm model switching off air in the first half of the existing aerobic tank created an unaerated zone with an average hrt of 36 h and 20 h in the low and high seasons fig 8 a and b show that alternating anoxic and anaerobic conditions were created in this zone leading to the production of vfas through fermentation with an average rate of 17 5 g cod m 3 d 1 paos were able to consume 41 6 of these vfas while the remaining fraction was consumed by denitrifying ohos the uptake of vfas by paos in the additional unaerated zone corresponded to 11 4 of the vfas consumed in the existing anaerobic tank ran2 these conditions increased the average percentage of paos per total active biomass from 2 1 to 13 1 see fig 8 c and increased the average total pha at the aerobic tank outlet from 2 0 g cod m 3 to 5 7 g cod m 3 see fig 8 d in the regular and new strategy respectively reducing the risk of paos depleting their pha pools under aerobic conditions and consuming polyphosphate in fact the alternating anoxic and anaerobic conditions in the unaerated zone maintained the pha pools in paos constant the meta asm model predicted that only an average of 0 4 g cod m 3 and 0 6 g p m 3 were consumed and released during this period respectively which means that paos had enough pha storage to remove all po4 3 p in the aerated zone the removal of n was improved due to increased activity of denitrifying paos in the anoxic tank since the activity of denitrifying ohos remained similar to that of the base scenario see fig 8 e and f respectively the results obtained in the new strategy are also in line with those reported in sedlak 1991 where biological p removal was successfully achieved and maintained below 0 6 g p m 3 over a period of three years at the reedy creek plant in florida when aeration was switched off in the first half of the first pass of a plug flow nitrifying plant similarly n removal was also improved with this modification this study showed that prolonged aeration can lead to ineffective p removal due to maintenance processes of paos that result in the aerobic release of p while the potential for this aerobic p release is not widely reported at full scale lab scale studies have suggested this where carvalheira et al 2014a have previously described this mechanism after prolonged aeration brdjanovic et al 1998 have also suggested stability issues in ebpr with excessive aeration due to other mechanisms more commonly reported is secondary p release by paos when electron acceptors like oxygen are not present barnard 1984 the results of this study imply that prolonged aeration can lead to aerobic p release which negatively impacts p effluent levels in full scale ebpr plants overall the implementation of the new strategy compared to the regular strategy has the potential to save 35 85 ton fe2 so4 3 year 5 95 k year this value was estimated based on the amount of chemicals added to the process from september 2014 to august 2015 in order to comply with legislation limits moreover the new strategy would also be likely to decrease the total aeration demand of the wwtp 4 conclusions this study evaluates the capacity of the meta asm model to describe the long term performance of a full scale a2 o activated sludge system and to be used as an operational diagnostic tool for plant upsets its performance was compared with an updated version of the barker dold model without changing default parameters overall the meta asm provided a better description of paos active biomass and storage polymers and was a more powerful operational diagnostic tool the high aerobic hrts and the low olrs of the plant were only identified as the primary causes of the ebpr upsets because the meta asm predicted that i the activity of gaos was residual ii paos used alternative metabolic pathways to glycogen leading to higher po4 3 p release and less pha produced iii paos were depleting their pha pools and consuming polyphosphate as a survival strategy under aerobic conditions the ebpr upsets were mitigated by switching off air in the first half of the aeration tank in this scenario the meta asm model predicted a simultaneous improvement in the biological p and n removal due to the enhancement of the hydrolysis and fermentation of the mixed liquor sludge in the created unaerated zone the model predicted that paos were able to consume 41 6 of the vfas produced which favoured their growth and activity under anoxic and aerobic conditions

17479,this study evaluates the predictive capacity of the meta asm model a new integrated metabolic activated sludge model in describing the long term performance of a full scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr system that suffers from inconsistent performance in order to elucidate the causes of ebpr upsets and troubleshoot the process accordingly the meta asm model was tested as an operational diagnostic tool in a 1336 day long term dynamic simulation while its performance was compared with the asm inctrl model a version based on the barker dold model overall the predictions obtained with the meta asm without changing default parameters were more reliable and effective at describing the active biomass of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and the dynamics of their storage polymers the primary causes of the ebpr upsets were the high aerobic hydraulic retention times hrts and low organic loading rates olrs of the plant which led to periods of starvation the impact of these factors on ebpr performance were only identified with the meta asm model furthermore the first signs of process upsets were predicted by variations in the aerobic pao maintenance rates suggesting that the meta asm model has potential to provide an early warning of process upset the simulation of a new viable operational strategy indicated that troubleshooting the process could be achieved by reducing the aerated volume by switching off air in the first half of the aeration tank in this new strategy the meta asm model predicted a simultaneous improvement in the biological phosphorus p and nitrogen n removal due to the enhancement of the hydrolysis and fermentation of the mixed liquor sludge in the new unaerated zone which increased the availability of volatile fatty acids vfas for paos this study demonstrates that the meta asm model is a powerful operational diagnostic tool for ebpr systems capable of predicting and mitigating upsets optimising performance and

particulate unbiodegradable organics 1 introduction enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in activated sludge systems is a widely applied process at wastewater treatment plants wwtps that economically and sustainably removes anthropogenic phosphorus p to prevent undesirable eutrophication in receiving waters and potentially increases p recovery from sludge in downstream processes yang et al 2017 compared to chemical p removal less sludge is produced and ebpr significantly reduces chemical and sludge disposal costs the effectiveness of this process relies on the activity of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos which grow under alternating anaerobic and aerobic or anoxic conditions it is known that ebpr plants with various configurations are able to achieve low p effluent levels below 1 g p m 3 for long periods of time however several studies have reported that many of these ebpr facilities suffer from inconsistent performance due to the occurrence of unpredictable upsets that can lead to temporary or even irreversible ebpr loss barnard et al 2012 barnard and abraham 2006 barnard and steichen 2006 bushee et al 2019 gu et al 2008 neethling 2006 oehmen et al 2007 rieger et al 2001 examples of factors commonly reported as primary causes of ebpr upsets include i influent load dynamics e g periods of limited availability of readily biodegradable chemical oxygen demand rbcod and nutrients ii inhibition of fermentation due to presence of nitrate nitrite or oxygen in anaerobic zones iii competition for substrate in anaerobic zones e g between paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos or with other denitrifiers if nitrate or nitrite are present iv individual or combined effect of selected operational conditions and environmental factors e g high influent soluble rbcodinf ptot inf ratio carbon composition high dissolved oxygen do excessive return activated sludge ras recycle rates long hydraulic retention times hrts in aerobic tanks and secondary clarifiers high environmental temperatures overdosing of metals etc mitigating a process upset break through of phosphate po4 3 p in effluent is difficult because the trigger for an upset typically happens 1 2 days before elevated p levels are detectable in the effluent therefore in response to an upset event ebpr facilities often fall back to chemical p precipitation to meet effluent limits bushee et al 2019 as most upsets are unpredictable due to lack of readily available data or the data available for process diagnosis and decision making are of insufficient quality chemicals are often added constantly and in excess as a corrective measure increasing chemical dosage directly and negatively impact ebpr performance due to limited availability of phosphorus consequently the operational costs of these ebpr facilities increase chemical and sludge disposal costs and the potential to recover p from sludge is reduced in fact only a few parameters useful for process diagnosis are routinely measured through grab or composite samples of influent and effluent whereas monitoring of biological tanks is usually limited to upset events schauer et al 2018 this is too late to link root cause and effect due to the very dynamic nature of the ebpr process increasingly stringent regulations for p removal less than 0 1 g m 3 in some regions bunce et al 2018 oleszkiewicz and barnard 2006 have forced wwtps with conventional ebpr configurations to i develop novel strategies to maintain a more stable and consistent long term ebpr operation and ii develop early warning operational diagnostic tools for ebpr processes to support decision making in view of plant upsets emerging strategies to improve ebpr stability consist of modifying conventional ebpr configurations by other alternatives that enhance sludge fermentation to overcome the issue of low availability of rbcod in the influent barnard et al 2017 some examples described in the literature include upgrading conventional ebpr configurations with one of the following processes barnard et al 2012 2017 barnard and abraham 2006 sedlak 1991 tooker et al 2016 wang et al 2019 i fermentation of primary sludge ii side stream fermentation of ras iii mainstream mixed liquor fermentation by either switching off air in a small fraction of a plug flow aeration tank or by switching off a mixer in an anaerobic zone and iv control of external carbon dosage based on measurements of po4 3 p in the effluent or in the anaerobic reactor potential early warning operational diagnostic tools are still under investigation and their use in practice is still very limited only a few examples can be found in the literature which include the use of i online po4 3 p analysers and po4 3 p uptake respirometers placed at strategic locations to assess the po4 3 p uptake rate capacity of the mixed liquor sludge as an indirect measurement of the amount of poly β hydroxyalkanoates pha stored in the biomass bushee et al 2019 schauer et al 2018 and ii predictive models santos et al 2020 varga et al 2018 the latter has been suggested to be a promising tool as it potentially describes in detail the microbial and chemical transformations of different ebpr scenarios and predicts long term ebpr performance however previous studies have not yet investigated if this is indeed the case the meta asm an integrated metabolic activated sludge model was described in a previous publication santos et al 2020 as a powerful tool to predict ebpr process behaviour since it reduces calibration efforts needed for ebpr processes this model improved various shortcomings of the existing ebpr models by incorporating the effect of operational conditions on the pao gao competition the capability of paos and gaos to denitrify metabolic shifts as a function of storage polymer concentrations as well as the role of these polymers in endogenous processes and a better description of the fermentation process although its effectiveness compared to existing models was successfully demonstrated by describing 34 different data sets from enriched and full scale sludge its performance in a long term dynamic simulation of a full scale ebpr system was still required to be demonstrated along with its utility as a diagnostic tool to predict ebpr upsets therefore two models the meta asm santos et al 2020 and the asm inctrl model inctrl solutions canada are tested in this study as operational diagnostic tools to predict ebpr instability in a long term operation of a full scale three stage phoredox a2 o activated sludge system these models were chosen because the former was identified previously as a predictive model and the latter is based on the barker dold model barker and dold 1997 which is still one of the most widely used ebpr models in engineering and implemented in most commercial software available this work focusses on evaluating whether the structure of these biokinetic models and respective default parameters are capable of providing an early warning of process upsets and a reliable response over a long term dynamic simulation furthermore process troubleshooting is also performed with the most predictive model in order to offer viable strategies to improve the performance of the wwtp under study 2 material and methods 2 1 objectives for the wwtp the boavista wwtp is located on the algarve coast where the flux of population to this region increases in summer due to the typical portuguese and european vacation period the objectives for the wwtp are to understand the causes of the inconsistent ebpr performance and to develop low cost mitigation solutions applicable within the boundaries of the existing infrastructure available at the plant improving biological p removal to less than 1 g p m 3 without the need for chemical dosing are priorities 2 2 wwtp description the boavista wwtp was designed to serve 33 180 population equivalents and has a capacity of 6843 m3 d 1 the biological treatment stage is an a2 o activated sludge process designed with two parallel lanes to remove biochemical oxygen demand bod nitrogen n and p biologically currently only one lane is working because the maximum influent flow measured during the high season is about half of the maximum capacity fig 1 shows a simplified scheme of the boavista wwtp where only one lane is represented in the biological treatment the preliminary treatment is composed of screening units and processes for the removal of grit grease and oil this plant has no primary treatment and therefore raw influent wastewater inf and reject water rw recycled from the sludge line after flow qinf rw measurement are directly fed into a plug flow tank this tank is sequentially divided into anaerobic ran anoxic rax and aerobic rox tanks the anaerobic and anoxic tanks are physically divided by walls into 2 stirred cells in series aeration is achieved through 312 fine bubble membrane diffusers distributed equally in two grids placed at 0 5 m from the floor of the aerobic tank the do is controlled within the range of 0 42 1 0 g o2 m 3 see do profile in figure a 1 appendix a nitrate and nitrite produced in the aerobic tank are recycled to the first anoxic cell rax1 with a fixed flow qrox rax1 chemical p precipitation with a 43 w w solution of fe2 so4 3 is applied at the outlet of the aerobic tank whenever the effluent levels of total phosphorus ptot are observed by operators above 3 g p m 3 through lab measurements see fig 4 b part of the activated sludge settled in the secondary clarifier is returned to the first anaerobic cell via the ras with a recycle ratio proportional to the influent flow qras qinf 1 37 0 34 waste activated sludge was is concentrated in a thickener the thickened was tw is dewatered by two centrifuges and transported from the wwtp the rw recovered from the thickening and dewatering process are recycled to the preliminary treatment 2 3 data collection analysis and reconciliation plant data recorded from 2nd january 2012 to 30th august 2015 were collected analysed and reconciled table a 1 see appendix a summarises the input and performance data used in this study and table 1 contains the physical dimensions of each process unit fig 2 3 4 a 4 b and 4 c show the dynamics and average values of the influent codtot inf ntot inf and ptot inf loads hrts of the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks sludge retention time srt metal dosage and temperature in the aerobic tank respectively the influent loading of the plant varies according to the typical pattern of population influx in the region where the highest mass loads were commonly obtained in warmer months high season from may to october and the lowest mass loads were commonly obtained in cooler months low season from november to april these loading dynamics have been impacting the operational conditions of the plant srt and hrt of the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks and affecting the resulting ebpr performance fig 4 b shows that metal dosing increased significantly in the high seasons suggesting that this ebpr plant suffers from inconsistent performance the variations of ph in the influent 7 46 0 21 and effluent 7 59 0 29 were very low faults were detected and removed in the input and performance data by following the recommendations of the iwa guidelines for using activated sludge models rieger et al 2012 briefly outliers and gross errors were detected and removed after 1 visualisation of data flows concentrations and mass loads in time series plots 2 analysis

model setup two plant models differing only in the biokinetic models chosen to simulate the ebpr dynamics of the boavista wwtp were set up in simba ifak germany according to the flow scheme depicted in fig 1 the biokinetic models meta asm santos et al 2020 and asm inctrl inctrl solutions canada were chosen for this study and extended with the simple chemical precipitation model of asm2d henze et al 1999 the meta asm is a novel integrated metabolic activated sludge model capable of predicting ebpr performance with a robust single set of default parameters santos et al 2020 and was developed to overcome various shortcomings of existing ebpr models readers are referred to santos et al 2020 for a more detailed description of the meta asm model briefly this model incorporates the effect of operational conditions on the competition between paos and gaos and their capability to denitrify the metabolic shifts of paos gaos as a function of storage polymer concentrations the role of storage polymers in endogenous processes and a more detailed description of the fermentation process the asm inctrl model inctrl solutions canada is a version based on the barker dold model barker and dold 1997 which differs from the original in the description of the following processes denitrification of ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos and paos as well as nitrification were modelled in two steps and the endogenous processes of ohos ammonia oxidizing organisms aoos and nitrite oxidizing organisms noos were modelled as a function of the electron acceptors this version was chosen because the barker dold model is still one of the most widely used ebpr models in practice and most commercial software available has these modifications implemented in their updated barker dold models the two chemical precipitation processes of asm2d henze et al 1999 were incorporated in both models to describe the effect of chemical p removal in the plant under study note that many studies have recently developed new precipitation models barat et al 2011 kazadi mbamba et al 2015 solon et al 2017 but their integration into the selected biokinetic models was considered beyond the scope of this study each plant model was built as follows the anaerobic and anoxic cells were modelled as a single continuous stirred tank reactor cstr and the aerobic tank was split evenly into two cstrs each one with one grid containing 156 fine bubble membrane diffusers the secondary clarifier was modelled as an ideal separator with volume sludge blanket and clear water zone where the tss of the effluent was determined as a fraction var1 of the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of the aerobic tank in addition the biokinetic models were also activated at the top and bottom layers of the clarifier to describe the commonly observed biological reactions the thickener was modelled as a point clarifier model where tss of the reject water was determined as a fraction var2 of tss of the thickened was the fractions var1 and var2 were defined based on the average values determined in the period under study var1 0 154 100 and var2 7 060 100 the dewatering centrifuge was modelled by setting the final sludge tss concentration and the efficiency of sludge removal from fluid flow with their average measured values of 162 256 kg m3 and 0 97 respectively influent models were configured to convert the influent daily average values of qinf codtot inf ntot inf ptot inf and inorganic suspended solids issinf into state variables of the biokinetic models under study see section 2 5 the qras qwas and qtw were set to the daily average flows measured see table 1 furthermore a typical do profile ranging from 0 42 to 1 00 g o2 m 3 was used to control aeration see figure a 1 in appendix a and the daily dosage of fe oh 3 was estimated based on the monthly consumption of the 43 fe2 so4 3 solution see fig 4 b 2 5 influent characterisation and definition of initial conditions a week long sampling campaign from 15th to 22nd june 2015 was performed at the influent and effluent see sampling locations nr 1 and 8 respectively in fig 1 this campaign aimed to collect additional data needed to complete the fractionation of the influent during the period under study and to develop influent models capable of converting measurements into model state variables the recommendations of the iwa guidelines for using activated sludge models rieger et al 2012 were followed to build the influent models table b1 see appendix b summarises the average values of the parameters measured over the period under study as well as the result of their conversion into state variables of meta asm and asm inctrl models as recommended by the iwa guidelines the cod mass balance was closed by defining the slowly biodegradable substrate xb fraction based on bod measurements fixing the ordinary heterotrophic organisms xoho fraction with a typical value 0 13 and calculating the particulate unbiodegradable organics xu fraction with the remaining cod difference the mass balances of ptot ntot tss and vss were closed with absolute percent errors of less than 2 while the mass balances of bod5 tot and bod5 filt were closed with absolute percent errors of 13 and 3 9 respectively the initial concentrations of the particulate variables in both plant models were defined with the values obtained after a 1336 day steady state simulation and a 300 day dynamic simulation 2 6 simulation studies 2 6 1 model evaluation and prediction of ebpr upsets a 1336 day long term dynamic simulation was performed using the two plant models described in section 2 4 without changing any default parameters in the biokinetic models the processes of po4 3 p precipitation and redissolution of asm2d were deactivated and activated to evaluate the combined effect of chemical and biological p removal in the plant under study see appendix c note that the original kinetic rates of these processes were reduced ten times to prevent the fast precipitation of po4 3 p in the aerobic tank as performed by ingildsen et al 2006 the predictive power of the models was quantified by calculating the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse of the po4 3 p ran2 ptot eff mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss rox and codtot rox when the chemical precipitation processes were activated see section 3 1 the capability of these two models to predict the causes for the ebpr upsets observed in the boavista wwtp was also assessed in this simulation see section 3 2 2 6 2 mitigation of ebpr upsets the mitigation of the identified ebpr upsets was performed by reducing the aerated volume this operational strategy was designed with the aim of using existing infrastructure to improve biological p removal to less than 1 g p m 3 without the need for chemical dosing in order to compare the impact of this operational strategy with the historical operation simulated in section 2 6 1 the same input data and approach for the definition of initial model concentrations described in sections 2 3 and 2 5 respectively were used note that only the outputs from september 2014 to august 2015 were shown in section 3 3 to facilitate the comparison of each operational strategy during periods with relatively high pao activity the plant model setup described in section 2 4 using the meta asm as a biokinetic model was modified as follows the existing aerobic tank with hrts of 73 h 12 h and 40 h 9 h in the low and high seasons was split evenly into two cstrs in series one unaerated and the other aerated due to the fact that the first grid of 156 air diffusors can be turned off this modification reduced the previous hrts to 36 h 6 h low season and 20 h 4 h high season in each new unaerated and aerated zone respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation a model is considered predictive and robust when it is capable to describe in detail the microbial and chemical transformations with minimal adjustment to parameters these features were assessed in this study by performing a 1336 day long term dynamic simulation with the two plant models without changing any stoichiometric and kinetic default parameters in the selected biokinetic models the goal was to determine the capacity of each model to predict the ebpr behaviour independently of a calibration procedure it should be noted that the default parameters of the meta asm model were calibrated and validated in previous work based on 34 datasets originating from other studies santos et al 2020 this work represents the first study investigating the capacity of the meta asm model to describe the long term performance at a full scale ebpr plant the impact of the chemical precipitation processes on the predictions of po4 3 p ran2 and ptot eff by each biokinetic model was first evaluated by deactivating and activating these processes figure c 1 in appendix c shows that the predictions of ptot eff improved in both models when the chemical processes were activated while the predictions of po4 3 p ran2 only improved in the meta asm model these simulations show that the high doses of fe2 so4 3 that were added at the outlet of the aerobic tank were recirculated by the ras to the anaerobic zone the meta asm model predicted that the actual contribution of chemical precipitation to the overall p removal averaged 43 11 at the boavista wwtp table 2 shows the average observed and simulated po4 3 p ran2 ptot eff codtot rox and mlvss rox by the meta asm and asm inctrl models in the period under study with the chemical precipitation processes activated as well as the respective maes and rmses the performance of the meta asm model showed significant improvement with respect to the description of each variable although the asm inctrl model reasonably described the ptot eff it poorly described the po4 3 p ran2 codtot rox and mlvss rox these results may suggest that this model fails to describe the active biomass and storage polymer concentrations as will be discussed in section 3 2 in fact santos et al 2020 showed that the barker dold model failed to describe the anaerobic po4 3 p release in wwtps where the glycogen pools in the cells were exhausted the evaluation of the predictive power of both biokinetic models in the boavista wwtp shows that the meta asm model provided a more reliable response over a long term dynamic simulation highlighting that its biokinetic structure and default parameters were more robust than that of the asm inctrl model to describe the biological p removal in the plant under study 3 2 prediction of ebpr upsets the boavista wwtp suffered from inconsistent ebpr performance fig 4 b shows that this plant regularly relies on chemical p precipitation to meet effluent limits the high temperatures observed in high seasons see fig 4 c and the rapid increase of influent loads observed in the transition from low to high seasons see fig 2 accompanied by the decrease of the hrts in the biological tanks see fig 3 appears to each have an impact on the microbial dynamics and ebpr performance due to the combined influence of these factors the reasons for ebpr deterioration in high seasons were not clear with potential reasons including the growth of gaos the metabolic shifts as a function of storage polymer concentrations and the role of these polymers in endogenous processes thus both plant models were used to elucidate the causes for the ebpr upsets observed in the boavista wwtp and the combined impact of all individual factors on the overall process fig 5 a shows that the predicted percentage of paos and gaos per total active biomass averaged 0 8 1 0 and 0 5 0 1 in the low season and 1 5 1 5 and 0 4 0 1 in the high season with the meta asm model respectively different predictions were obtained with the asm inctrl model where paos averaged 16 0 5 8 and 23 0 3 5 in the low and high season fig 5 b respectively however the predictions obtained with the meta asm are in the same range as the microbial characterisation performed by lanham et al 2013 on this plant using quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridisation qfish the authors observed that the percentages of accumulibacter paos and competibacter lineage plus defluviicoccus vanus gaos were 3 2 and 0 3 respectively in addition the observed percentage of accumulibacter paos and predicted by the meta asm model are also within the range of values observed in other microbial characterisation studies at full scale ebpr plants stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 wu et al 2019 these results suggest that the asm inctrl model overpredicts the activity of paos several studies lopez vazquez et al 2009a 2009b panswad et al 2003 ren et al 2011 whang and park 2006 have shown that high temperatures can be detrimental to ebpr due to the fact that gaos have kinetic advantages over paos at high temperatures however the model predictions demonstrated that gaos had a residual impact at the boavista wwtp even in summer where temperatures were above 28 c this might suggest that other operational conditions are exerting a higher selective pressure in favour of paos than the high temperature exerts in favour of gaos as reported in some studies and elucidated further with the meta asm model qiu et al 2019 shen et al 2017 fig 5 also demonstrates that the activity of paos increased in the high seasons and decreased in the low seasons after 550 days which correlates with the oscillations described in the influent loading hrt temperature and anaerobic po4 3 p release depicted in fig 2 3 4 and c 1 b see appendix c respectively paos grew more after 550 days because the average srts in the low and high seasons were respectively 6 and 3 days lower than that of the first 550 days suggesting that the srts after day 550 were more beneficial to sustain ebpr in the boavista wwtp see table d 1 in appendix d figure d 1 see appendix d shows that the preferred pathways for the origin of reducing power in the anaerobic metabolism of paos were the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle for the uptake of acetate and butyrate and the conversion of propionyl coa to acetyl coa for the uptake of propionate and valerate the use of these pathways by paos is common in full scale ebpr plants with low influent volatile fatty acid vfa concentrations and long aerobic retention times cokro et al 2017 lanham et al 2013 zhou et al 2009 in this plant the estimated vfa concentration in the influent and the aerobic hrt averaged 20 5 g cod m 3 and 73 12 h in the low season and 26 4 g cod m 3 and 40 9 h in the high season respectively which led to a low replenishment of the glycogen pools in paos and to a limited reducing power for the conversion of vfas to pha via the glycolysis pathway in these situations paos tend to shift their metabolism to alternative pathways as survival strategy that favours the competition of paos over gaos santos et al 2020 since the origin of reducing power and energy in the latter comes essentially from the glycolysis pathway oehmen et al 2010 the meta asm model is the only ebpr model capable of describing this metabolic shift and elucidating that this competitive advantage of paos may also contribute to the reduction of the ebpr efficiency because in both alternative pathways more po4 3 p is released and less pha is produced under anaerobic conditions santos et al 2020 this means that less pha is available for the removal of po4 3 p under anoxic and aerobic conditions in addition the simulation of the paos endogenous rates in the aerobic tank with the meta asm shows that the maintenance rate on pha increased with the concentration of paos while the maintenance rate on polyphosphate increased when the pha rate decreased see fig 6 a the application of the meta asm suggests that paos are depleting their pha pools which limits simultaneously their growth production of polyphosphate and po4 3 p uptake and maintenance on pha as a survival strategy to the high aerobic hrts and low organic loading rate olr conditions especially observed in the transition from high to low seasons paos consume stored polyphosphate as a source of energy prior to decay in fact the meta asm predictions showed that the increase of the maintenance rate on polyphosphate is accompanied with the increase of ptot ff concentrations as demonstrated in fig 6 a the same conclusions cannot be drawn with the simulation of the endogenous rates with the asm inctrl see fig 6 b this model explains the increase of ptot ff concentrations with the simultaneous reduction of the aerobic decay of pao and lysis of releasable stored polyphosphate pplo which happens due to the simultaneous decrease of paos active biomass and pplo respectively occurring when no more pha is available for their growth and production of polyphosphate and po4 3 p uptake however this correlation was only established with the information obtained with the meta asm model by itself the asm inctrl model fig 6 b did not show any clear correlation between the increase of ptot ff concentrations and the reduction of pao endogenous rates furthermore the mechanisms described by the asm inctrl are not supported by previous experimental evidence carvalheira et al 2014b lanham et al 2014 liu et al 2017 lu et al 2007 vargas et al 2013 since paos appear to deplete their pha and polyphosphate storage polymers prior to decay as well as glycogen when it is available both models described that nitrate and nitrite were recirculated to the anaerobic zone through the ras however table d 2 see appendix d shows that there is no correlation between this factor and paos activity while the vfainf loading rates and the aerobic hrts correlated positively and negatively respectively with the vfa uptake rates by paos in the anaerobic tank pao loads in the aerobic tank and pao maintenance rates on pha in the aerobic and anoxic zones respectively thus the impact of the vfainf loading rate and the aerobic hrt were identified to be the primary operational factors that should be adjusted to augment p removal performance since the aerobic hrt is more readily adjustable and does not imply additional cost to the process operation further attention was focussed on this parameter figure d 2 see appendix d demonstrates that the meta asm can be used as an operational diagnostic tool capable of providing 10 days of early warning of process upsets by predicting the variations in aerobic pao maintenance rates as shown the maintenance on pha began to decrease at 992 days when the ptot eff concentration in the aerobic tank was still below 1 g p m 3 this maintenance rate reached minimum values at 1007 days while the maintenance rate on polyphosphate and the concentration of ptot eff reached maximum values as the maintenance rate on pha increased again 1007 days meaning that pha is available for pao growth and production of polyphosphate and po4 3 p uptake the maintenance rate on polyphosphate and the ptot eff concentration decreased interestingly bushee et al 2019 were also capable of providing about 10 days of early warning of process upsets by using information obtained from online po4 3 p analysers placed at the end of the anaerobic zone and the middle of the aerobic zone and a po4 3 p uptake respirometer placed at the end of the anaerobic zone the authors concluded that the system was moving toward instability when the po4 3 p uptake rate capacity of the mixed liquor sludge decreased similarly they correlated the occurrence of an upset with the reduction of the amount of pha stored in the biomass this study demonstrates the causes associated with high aerobic hrts and low olrs were only possible to be identified with the application of the meta asm model this model predicted that in this plant more po4 3 p and less pha is produced per vfa uptake under anaerobic conditions and that paos are depleting their pha pools and consuming polyphosphate as a survival strategy under aerobic conditions therefore the meta asm model is a more powerful operational diagnostic tool to predict ebpr instability allowing the development of mitigation strategies for the upsets identified in this plant 3 3 mitigation of ebpr upsets the operational strategy of reducing the aerated volume described in section 2 6 2 hereafter referred to as new strategy was specifically designed to reduce the observed consumption of polyphosphate caused by high aerobic hrts the aim was to assess a strategy applicable within the boundaries of the existing infrastructure available at the plant that improves biological p removal to less than 1 g p m 3 without the need for chemical dosing the impact of this new strategy was compared with the historical operation simulated in section 2 6 1 referred to as the regular strategy using the same influent characteristics and dynamics fig 7 a compares the ptot eff predictions obtained in each simulated strategy it can be observed that low ptot eff concentrations 0 3 0 1 g p m 3 were continuously reached in the new strategy without the need for chemical dosing in addition fig 7 b shows that the new strategy also improved the removal of n 5 7 1 9 g ntot eff m 3 compared to the 16 7 3 2 g ntot eff m 3 predicted in the regular strategy the reasons for the simultaneous improvement of p and n removal in the new strategy were elucidated with the meta asm model switching off air in the first half of the existing aerobic tank created an unaerated zone with an average hrt of 36 h and 20 h in the low and high seasons fig 8 a and b show that alternating anoxic and anaerobic conditions were created in this zone leading to the production of vfas through fermentation with an average rate of 17 5 g cod m 3 d 1 paos were able to consume 41 6 of these vfas while the remaining fraction was consumed by denitrifying ohos the uptake of vfas by paos in the additional unaerated zone corresponded to 11 4 of the vfas consumed in the existing anaerobic tank ran2 these conditions increased the average percentage of paos per total active biomass from 2 1 to 13 1 see fig 8 c and increased the average total pha at the aerobic tank outlet from 2 0 g cod m 3 to 5 7 g cod m 3 see fig 8 d in the regular and new strategy respectively reducing the risk of paos depleting their pha pools under aerobic conditions and consuming polyphosphate in fact the alternating anoxic and anaerobic conditions in the unaerated zone maintained the pha pools in paos constant the meta asm model predicted that only an average of 0 4 g cod m 3 and 0 6 g p m 3 were consumed and released during this period respectively which means that paos had enough pha storage to remove all po4 3 p in the aerated zone the removal of n was improved due to increased activity of denitrifying paos in the anoxic tank since the activity of denitrifying ohos remained similar to that of the base scenario see fig 8 e and f respectively the results obtained in the new strategy are also in line with those reported in sedlak 1991 where biological p removal was successfully achieved and maintained below 0 6 g p m 3 over a period of three years at the reedy creek plant in florida when aeration was switched off in the first half of the first pass of a plug flow nitrifying plant similarly n removal was also improved with this modification this study showed that prolonged aeration can lead to ineffective p removal due to maintenance processes of paos that result in the aerobic release of p while the potential for this aerobic p release is not widely reported at full scale lab scale studies have suggested this where carvalheira et al 2014a have previously described this mechanism after prolonged aeration brdjanovic et al 1998 have also suggested stability issues in ebpr with excessive aeration due to other mechanisms more commonly reported is secondary p release by paos when electron acceptors like oxygen are not present barnard 1984 the results of this study imply that prolonged aeration can lead to aerobic p release which negatively impacts p effluent levels in full scale ebpr plants overall the implementation of the new strategy compared to the regular strategy has the potential to save 35 85 ton fe2 so4 3 year 5 95 k year this value was estimated based on the amount of chemicals added to the process from september 2014 to august 2015 in order to comply with legislation limits moreover the new strategy would also be likely to decrease the total aeration demand of the wwtp 4 conclusions this study evaluates the capacity of the meta asm model to describe the long term performance of a full scale a2 o activated sludge system and to be used as an operational diagnostic tool for plant upsets its performance was compared with an updated version of the barker dold model without changing default parameters overall the meta asm provided a better description of paos active biomass and storage polymers and was a more powerful operational diagnostic tool the high aerobic hrts and the low olrs of the plant were only identified as the primary causes of the ebpr upsets because the meta asm predicted that i the activity of gaos was residual ii paos used alternative metabolic pathways to glycogen leading to higher po4 3 p release and less pha produced iii paos were depleting their pha pools and consuming polyphosphate as a survival strategy under aerobic conditions the ebpr upsets were mitigated by switching off air in the first half of the aeration tank in this scenario the meta asm model predicted a simultaneous improvement in the biological p and n removal due to the enhancement of the hydrolysis and fermentation of the mixed liquor sludge in the created unaerated zone the model predicted that paos were able to consume 41 6 of the vfas produced which favoured their growth and activity under anoxic and aerobic conditions
