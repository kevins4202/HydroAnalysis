spatiotemporal distributions of meteorological variables and physical parameters denoted within a region to reveal the characteristics affecting the water cycle of watersheds however the current methods developed for spatially divided regions into computational units fail to consider the physical meaning and impact of climate change in montane altitudinal zones mazs which significantly affects alpine watersheds this study proposes a method for assigning the computational units of alpine dhms according to one period maz that explicitly account for physical meaning and climate change new hydrological insights for the region the benefits of the proposed altitudinal discretization method are verified by applying it to construct a dhm based on the water and energy transfer processes in large river basins wep l models the results obtained using the wep l swat model and the new regional division method denoted as the wep c model that applies the proposed altitudinal discretization method are compared the results demonstrate that the simulation accuracy of the daily and monthly streamflows and daily soil moisture from the alpine watershed is improved by the use of the proposed altitudinal discretization method which provide guidance for further dhm development and can be applied to other hydrological models keywords hydrological computational units montane altitudinal zones climate change alpine watersheds qinghai tibet plateau 1 introduction climate change has altered the spatiotemporal distribution of the global water cycle back et al 2013 immerzeel et al 2010 in this regard the qinghai tibet plateau qtp which has an average elevation greater than 4000 m is particularly sensitive to climate change cao and qin 2006 moreover the unique topography of the qtp which includes widely distributed glaciers snow cover lakes and permafrost renders its study particularly challenging wu et al 2010 you et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 this issue has been increasingly addressed in recent years by evaluating the water cycle evolution using distributed hydrological models dhms which combine the spatiotemporal distributions of meteorological variables and regional physical parameters to reveal characteristics affecting watershed water cycle yang et al 2019 dhms work through coupling model structure and parameters to simulate the physical property formed by rainfall runoff in the watershed anand et al 2018 wu et al 2017 the parameters are used to describe the effect of the model input the flow parameters describe water permeability thermal properties and water scarcity effects of the pad surface on the simulation input sellami et al 2016 shin and choi 2018 the confluence parameters describe the topography roughness and water distribution on the model input cheng et al 2019 the structure reflects the physical relationship between the model inputs parameters and model outputs the parameters have a clear physical meaning only when the structure of the basin hydrological model is correct and thus the quantification may be reasonable and accurate wang et al 2020 however the accuracy of dhms relies largely on the availability of data reflecting the meteorological and physical conditions of a region which is particularly problematic for evaluating the complex water cycle processes of the qtp owing to its widely variable topography vast landscape and rugged conditions liu et al 2018 wang and xue 2013 the aforementioned issue can potentially be addressed by considering the computational unit eric et al 2013 saran et al 2010 which is the minimum unit in the calculation of hydrological models and is needed to generalize the parameters in the hydrological unit jia et al 2005 wang and xue 2013 grids are suitable for small and medium sized watersheds jia et al 2001 whereas other computational units such as the hydrologic response unit hru are suitable for larger watersheds ning et al 2015 the hrus divide regions spatially based on similarities between the areas of a region such as soil and land use mengistu et al 2019 osei et al 2019 and has been demonstrated to adequately represent the spatial heterogeneity of factors affecting water cycle processes in the horizontal direction anand et al 2018 muhammad et al 2019 however generally there regional division methods only consider static conditions based on historical data under the influence of climate change qtp vegetation is dynamic zhang et al 2006 this has a significant impact on the modeling results because the qtp is in a state of warming and humidification cao and qin 2006 and the montane altitudinal zones mazs are constantly changing zhou and wang 2000 therefore some hydrological models may fail to consider the physical meaning and impact of climate change on the assignment of computational units which should be considered in regional division methods mazs include vegetation types that change alternately as the elevation increases and is an effective manifestation of complex systems affected by natural factors such as regional water cycles climate topography and geology xu et al 2008 which determine the distribution of vegetation in the qtp ni et al 2019 wang et al 2009 the unique geographical nature of the qtp results in an abundance of mazs hu et al 2008 pan et al 2012 the complex terrain results in considerable spatial differentiation and vertical vegetation zoning su et al 2019 walter 1981 noticed that the rate of vertical zone change in mountainous climates was greater than that in the plains horizontally by a factor of 1000 in recent years the qtp has been more objectively and quantitatively divided into mazs using mathematical methods peng et al 2012 employed the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to divide qtp forest zones into four basic vegetation types from low to high elevation based on bidirectional indicator species analysis and classification zhang et al 2006 collected global maz data to construct a digital maz database this database was employed by gong et al 2010 fang et al 2011 and yao et al 2015 to study the influence of mazs on the the qtp tree line the results indicated that maximum precipitation zones occur in the higher mountainous areas of the qtp particularly on windward slopes which determine the tree line elevation wang et al 2017 moreover the changes in tree line and snowline elevations have been shown to disturb water cycle processes such as precipitation evaporation and runoff gaire et al 2014 salzer et al 2014 harsch et al 2009 collected global tree line data to test the hypothesis that climate change would accelerate the rise in tree line elevation however it was found that only half of the tree line elevations have increased significantly over the past 100 years whereas the remaining tree line elevations have remained relatively stable due to low temperatures similar conditions were also found in the qtp yao et al 2015 therefore the extent of changes in the mazs characterizing the qtp over the years should be evaluated mazs can serve as a basis for constructing reasonably accurate dhms under climate change conditions the main methods for dividing regions spatially into mazs include field investigation expert experience and remote sensing zhang et al 2006 among these remote sensing has become the most commonly used method ustin and gamon 2010 the classification of mazs based on remote sensing imagery is mainly conducted by combining the spatial structure spectral brightness and other information of each pixel in different bands of an image according to specific rules and processes and then dividing each pixel into different categories jacquemoud et al 2009 ustin and gamon 2010 pixel classification is mainly performed using machine learning approaches which include supervised and unsupervised classification mountrakis et al 2011 the supervised classification process requires that several pixels pertaining to known classifications be selected as training samples for each category preset in the remote sensing image dataset and the training samples must accurately represent the spectral features of each category ma et al 2017 afterward the trained classification network is employed to divide unknown pixels into their most likely categories foody and mathur 2004 mountrakis et al 2011 water and energy transfer processes in large river basins wep l models are a type of dhm that incorporates physical parameters that can be measured or calculated jia et al 2001 2006 the wep l divides the modeled region spatially into subwatersheds to reflect the spatial variability of the hydrological watershed process and also establishes the topological relationships between subwatersheds jia et al 2006 therefore subwatershed with similar elevations are divided into several computational units peng et al 2013 accordingly the wep l model is an ideal subject for studying the effects of maz assignment on modeled hydrological cycles however the computational units divided in the wep l model only consider elevation therefore there may be some errors in the parameters of such computational units the benefits of the proposed altitudinal discretization method are verified by applying it to construct the wep l model for the nagqu river watershed nrw in the qtp as a case study to consider the physical meaning and impact of climate change in mazs we proposed a method for assigning the computational units of alpine dhms according to mazs that explicitly account for climate change the main purpose of this study is as follows a extract multi period mazs in the nrw based on satellite imagery b compare the results obtained using the wep l swat model and the new regional division method denoted as the wep c model that applies the proposed altitudinal discretization method and c compare the results using one period maz and multi period mazs 2 methods 2 1 case study and data sources the nu salween river upstream 91 10 96 33 e 30 24 n 32 44 n generally denoted as the nagqu river originates in ando county at the southern foot of tanggula mountain in the qtp feng et al 2010 weng et al 2020 the nrw is illustrated in fig 1 along with the meteorological and hydrological stations in the region the length of the nagqu river is 818 km with a watershed area of 74 043 km2 and an average elevation of 4761 m the average annual air temperature in the nrw from 1970 to 2019 was 0 1 c with an average maximum daily temperature of 30 6 c and an average minimum daily temperature of 41 2 c the average annual precipitation in the watershed from 1970 to 2019 was 550 mm 80 of which was concentrated from june to september due to the complex topography and climate conditions nrw generates a wide variety of mazs lei et al 2012 liu 2017 found that the relative volume of glacial ice and permanent snow pack in the nrw decreased from 2 67 in 1980 to 1 35 in 2014 grassland decreased by 1817 7 km2 from 1980 to 2014 table s1 in addition no large scale reservoirs abstractions or irrigation projects have been implemented in the region and therefore the water circulation process of the watershed is natural which makes it ideal for studying the influence of mazs on hydrological cycles the data pertaining to the nrw employed in the modeling are listed in table 1 these data include a digital elevation model dem spatially distributed land use data for 1980 1995 2005 2010 and 2014 soil thickness and types for 2000 daily precipitation air temperature wind speed relative humidity and duration of sunshine obtained from 1970 to 2019 at 12 meteorological stations due to the large watershed area we resampled the dem and land use data to 1 km to ensure computational efficiency 2 2 model structure for the vertical model structure the computational units are divided into vegetation canopy building intercept surface depression storage aerated zone transition zone and groundwater layers from top to bottom jia et al 2006 to reflect the change in soil moisture from the surface to the deep layer the influence of soil depth on the evaporation of bare soil and the transpiration of vegetation roots the soil zone is further divided into surface middle and bottom layers potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the penman monteith formula soil moisture movement is set to distinguish between heavy rain and non storm rain by setting rainfall intensity thresholds the green ampt model is used to calculate the hourly streamflow and the richards equation is simulated daily for the plane model structure the sub watershed was divided into several mazs the land use types in each maz were obtained based on the land use data and the land use types in mazs were minimized to reflect the uneven distribution of land use in the unit the land use type was further divided into five types vegetation bare land irrigated farmland non irrigated farmland water area and impervious area the regional water and heat fluxes were weighted by area to obtain the maz water and heat fluxes slope convergence and river convergence were calculated based on the top to bottom relationship using the one dimensional motion wave method groundwater movement was calculated from the mountain and plains with water exchange 2 2 1 slope and river confluence the model slope and the discharge convergence process were simulated using the motion wave equation jia et al 2006 the calculation equation is as follows 1 a t q x q l 2 s f s 0 3 q a n r 2 3 s 0 1 2 where q is the slope or channel flow m3 s a is the cross sectional area m2 q l is the unit discharge m3 s s f is the friction slope s 0 is the slope r is the hydraulic radius m and n is the manning roughness coefficient 2 2 2 surface infiltration the infiltration process in the model was simulated using the green ampt model under the condition of stable precipitation intensity the initial soil infiltration intensity is usually large and the amount of infiltration depends on the precipitation intensity however the infiltration intensity decreases as the infiltration capacity increases wang et al 2009 when the precipitation intensity equals the infiltration intensity the surface water accumulation and infiltration intensity are determined by soil moisture and cumulative infiltration 2 3 altitudinal discretization method 2 3 1 vegetation classification according to montane altitudinal zones the key to this method for assigning hydrological computational units is to obtain effective mazs fan and he 2015 found that the break point of streamflow due to climate change in the nrw occurred in the late 1990s centered around 1997 in the model the mazs extracted from remote sensing images captured in 1984 average from 1970 to 1997 and 2009 average from 1998 to 2019 were used for conducting streamflow simulations before and after 1997 respectively the mazs in the nrw were extracted based on pertinent us landsat satellite imagery https search earthdata nasa gov search which included 10 images obtained monthly by a landsat 5 satellite in 1984 and 10 images obtained by a landsat 7 satellite every month in 2009 first the geometric deformation and radiation deformation in the images were corrected by image preprocessing such as radiometric calibration atmospheric correction and geometric correction ma et al 2017 according to the spatial distribution data of nrw vegetation types in the 1980s chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn data aspx dataid 122 the image pixels were classified into a total of 7 mazs which included the alpine snow alpine desert steppe alpine meadow peak shrub meadow alpine vegetation cultivated vegetation and cold temperate evergreen coniferous forest zones supervised classification envi 5 2 was performed using the maximum likelihood method in conjunction with visual interpretation and field survey information and remote sensing images in the green near infrared and mid infrared bands were synthesized into false color remote sensing images liang et al 2017 finally block smoothing was used in post classification processing to make the vegetation classification smoother and improve the classification effect the vegetation in mazs undergoes significant seasonal variation the model classifies vegetation types into seven categories types 1 7 for model parameter assignment as such the initial values of the physical parameters reflecting vegetation in the model are assigned monthly the vegetation fractional coverage v f c is calculated monthly according to the multi year average monthly ndvi of the watershed from remote sensing as follows liu et al 2019 4 v f c i n d v i i n d v i s o i l n d v i v e g n d v i s o i l where v f c i and n d v i i are the initial vfc and ndvi values in the i th month respectively and n d v i s o i l and n d v i v e g are the n d v i values of areas reflecting bare soil and complete vegetation coverage conditions respectively 2 3 2 hydrological computational unit assignment the assignment of hydrological computational units is divided into the following five steps 1 the watershed is divided into several subwatershed areas based on the watershed area while the horton strahler shreve and pfafstetter method is commonly used for this purpose jia et al 2001 the present study applied the strahler method based on a dem jia et al 2006 as illustrated in fig 2 a 2 the watershed is divided into multi period mazs according to extant vegetation as illustrated in fig 2 b this was performed using existing datasets remote sensing imagery and field surveys 3 the subwatersheds and multi period mazs are intersected using the arcgis intersect module which means the intersection of the subwatersheds and the mazs are used as the computational units of a watershed each computational unit has a unique soil type soil thickness and land use they are derived from the soil type soil thickness and land use derived from the corresponding data that account for the largest percentage of the computational unit the processing result is taken as the computational unit as illustrated in fig 2 c herein the mazs differ because of factors like climate change and therefore the computational units also differ by maz 4 the computational units in the subwatershed are re encoded based on their average elevation to facilitate the transfer of parameters from high elevation computational units to low elevation computational units within the subwatershed finally the streamflows are transferred to the exit point of the watershed at subwatershed q1 within maz q1 fig 2 c 5 different computational units will be given different climate land use and soil parameters before simulation therefore when the computational units change the parameters of the computational units in the model change accordingly 2 4 model evaluation method we compared the modeling results of the wep c swat and wep l models according to the following procedure because the wep l and wep c model structures are the same they can be used to compare parameter influence on the model the model comparison process was as follows 1 considering the streamflow of the dasa and jiayuqiao hydrological stations as the regulating targets a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the model parameters the parameters of the wep l model were first optimized with respect to the quantitative performance metrics and the modeling results were recorded then these parameters are applied directly to the wep c model and the modeling results were recorded this is referred to as the wep l c model 2 the wep c model parameters were optimized with respect to the quantitative performance metrics there parameters were then applied directly to the wep l model and the modeling results were recorded this is referred to as the wep c l model 3 the modeling accuracies of the wep l wep l c wep c and wep c l models were compared according to the quantitative performance metrics model verification was conducted according to the observed streamflow at the dasa 1983 1995 and jiayuqiao hydrological stations 1980 2008 and soil moisture at dasa hydrological station in conjunction with the modeled values using quantitative indexes including the nash efficiency coefficient correlation coefficient and model uncertainty table 2 gao et al 2018 yang et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 the model calibration period covered 1983 1990 for modeling the streamflow recorded by dasa hydrological station whereas 1991 1995 was adopted as the model verification period in addition 1980 2001 was adopted as the model calibration period for modeling the streamflow recorded by the jiayuqiao hydrological station and 2002 2008 was adopted as the model verification period the model uncertainty indexe is defined as follows 5 r u l 95 q o q o 6 r d q o l 5 q o where r u and r d are the respective upper and lower limits of the uncertain confidence interval respectively l 5 and l 95 are the respective uncertainties of the 5 and 95 confidence intervals respectively and q o is the observed data 3 results 3 1 division of vegetation zones the mazs extracted from satellite imagery of the nrw captured in 1984 and 2009 are presented in fig 3 a b and table s2 respectively here 780 computational units were obtained in 1984 and 1103 computational units were obtained in 2009 based on the classification of mazs the remote sensing results extracted from images obtained in 1984 are consistent with the 1980s spatial distribution data of chinese vegetation types extracted over 1 km2 grids by the chinese academy of sciences to a similarity of 80 31 in addition the nrw was divided into 199 subwatersheds and the results are presented in fig 3 c the vfcs in the subwatersheds are presented in table 3 3 2 model verification 3 2 1 streamflow calibration the minimum and maximum allowable values for the range of each parameter were determined based on regional qtp characteristics the parameters of wep l swat and wep c were determined using genetic algorithm table s3 because the observed streamflow at the dasa hydrological station was in the maz in 1984 to verify whether the effect of multi period mazs is better we compare the effect of simulation using multi period mazs and one period maz from the jiayuqiao hydrological station table 4 the annual average discharge simulated by maz in 1984 was 763 m3 s which is 1 2 lower than in the wep c model and the nash coefficient was 0 02 lower than that of the wep c model the annual average discharge simulated by maz in 2009 was 791 m3 s which is 2 5 higher than that of the wep c model and the nash coefficient was 0 02 lower than that of the wep c model the simulation results of the one period maz and multi period mazs were not significantly different and the nash coefficient was very close considering the complexity and operability of the model preparation process multi period mazs cannot improve the simulation accuracy compared with one period maz simulation results fig 4 presents the monthly and daily observed streamflow red point and streamflow simulated using the wep l model black line swat model orange line and wep c model gray filled area for the dasa and jiayuqiao hydrological stations in the daily streamflow simulation fig 4b the simulation accuracy of the wep c model was significantly higher than that of the wep l and swat models the quantitative accuracy indices for the calibration and verification of the three different models are listed in table 4 we note that the average discharge was underestimated by the wep l model 83 1 of observed streamflows the swat model was good for the simulation of average discharge 97 1 of observed streamflows however but the simulation for discharge in winter was evidently higher the wep c model provided a better estimate 94 6 of observed streamflows and obtained equal or greater nash and r2 values of all the models during the calibration and verification periods we also note that adopting the optimized parameters for the wep l model in the wep c model the wep l c model achieved the next highest simulated result in contrast adopting the optimized parameters for the wep c model in the wep l model the wep c l model achieved the worst modeling performance this is due to the use of suboptimal parameters in the wep l model which can degrade its modeling performance these results demonstrate that the modeling performance of the wep c model is better than that of the wep l model even when employing suboptimal parameter settings however the wep l model underestimated the streamflow to some extent during the calibration period and streamflow distribution in the swat model was flattened within the year higher discharge in winter and lower runoff in summer furthermore the streamflow of the wep l and swat models at both stations was underestimated to some extent during the verification period due to the increasing streamflow trend in the watershed 3 2 2 soil moisture calibration from the daily soil moisture simulation results of typical subwatersheds table 5 and fig 5 the simulation results of the wep l model swat model and wep c model had evident differences the wep l model simulates low soil moisture and poor simulation results the swat model simulation fluctuates significantly with precipitation the soil moisture simulation results of the wep c model were basically consistent with the fluctuation in observed soil moisture there was a certain lag in simulating soil moisture movement however the model simulation results were generally good overall the soil moisture simulation results of the wep c model can characterize the soil moisture changes in different layers of the watershed 3 3 impact of uncertainty on maximum streamflows the streamflow of the nrw in summer fluctuates significantly and the runoff in winter is relatively stable yang et al 2020 the influence of the spatial structure of the model on the uncertainty of maximum streamflow was investigated according to the monthly maximum runoff fig 6 presents the observed results open circles and the results simulated using the wep l swat and wep c models filled circles respectively the upper and lower limits of uncertainty based on the observed streamflow and the uncertainty of the model simulation is judged according to whether the model simulated streamflow falls within the uncertainty interval we note that the difference between the monthly maximum streamflow obtained from the swat and wep l models and the observed values increases with increasing frequency therefore the uncertainty in the spatial structure of the model increases with increasing maximum monthly streamflow however the difference between the monthly maximum streamflow obtained from the wep c model and the observed values does not change significantly with increasing frequency herein the monthly maximum streamflow obtained from the wep c model remains close to the observed values even when the frequency is large these results demonstrate that the uncertainty in the results obtained from the wep c model is less than the uncertainty in the results obtained from the swat and wep l models 4 discussion because the swat model can only input one period of land use only the differences between the wep l model and wep c model are discussed herein the generalized distribution of land use in the two models is listed in table 6 the generalized land use in the wep c model is close to the land use data whereas the wep l model produced bias in the generalization process the watershed hydrological model parameters are essentially physical quantities that reflect the input of the underlying surface to the model and are necessarily closely related to the characteristics of the underlying surface of the basin the impact of land use change on streamflow is essentially the process of precipitation redistribution under the combined effect of various factors in different underlying surfaces forests improved the infiltration performance of the surface interface and most surface runoff was converted into underground streamflow through the surface layer therefore the soil moisture simulated by the wep c model in fig 5 is higher than that of the wep l model under the condition that the climatic data in the model remain unchanged forests had higher evapotranspiration and interception capacity and hence the fluctuation in daily streamflow is smaller therefore the flood season streamflow simulated by the wep c model in fig 4 b is more stable than the wep l model the uncertainty of the wep c model is less than that of the wep l model fig 6 which indicates that this method can effectively reduce the problem of equifinality when it is applied to the qtp areas the maz in the wep c model which is mainly based on vegetation growth provides a spatial basis for refining hydrological processes and spatial analyses based on smaller scales thereby making the physical meaning of a dhm more explicit the simulation results of one period maz and multi period mazs in the model have little difference which may be due to the fact that multi period mazs are more suitable for areas where the maz changes more drastically considering the complexity and operability of the model preparation process one period maz simulation results can meet the requirements of model simulation 5 conclusion this study proposed a method for assigning the computational units of alpine dhms according to multi period mazs the benefits of the proposed altitudinal discretization method were verified by applying it to construct a model for the nrw in the qtp the mazs in the nrw were mainly extracted based on satellite imagery with pixels classified using maximum likelihood supervised classification considering the complexity and operability of the model preparation process one period maz simulation results can meet the requirements of model simulation the results obtained using the wep l and swat models employing conventional regional division and the new regional division method denoted as the wep c model that applies the method were compared and the simulation accuracy of the streamflow and soil moisture in the alpine watershed were demonstrated to be improved according to quantitative indexes by the use of the proposed altitudinal discretization method overall the streamflow and soil moisture verification results demonstrate that the established wep c model can effectively describe the macroscopic water circulation process in the alpine region considered compared with the conventional model the improved model better captures surface hydrological processes in the upstream and downstream sites of the nrw indicating that the new regional division method more realistically models the vertical hydrological processes in this alpine region accordingly we can conclude that the proposed altitudinal discretization method supports the development of dhms and can be further applied to other hydrological models data availability statement the data that support the findings of

climate change alpine watersheds qinghai tibet plateau 1 introduction climate change has altered the spatiotemporal distribution of the global water cycle back et al 2013 immerzeel et al 2010 in this regard the qinghai tibet plateau qtp which has an average elevation greater than 4000 m is particularly sensitive to climate change cao and qin 2006 moreover the unique topography of the qtp which includes widely distributed glaciers snow cover lakes and permafrost renders its study particularly challenging wu et al 2010 you et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 this issue has been increasingly addressed in recent years by evaluating the water cycle evolution using distributed hydrological models dhms which combine the spatiotemporal distributions of meteorological variables and regional physical parameters to reveal characteristics affecting watershed water cycle yang et al 2019 dhms work through coupling model structure and parameters to simulate the physical property formed by rainfall runoff in the watershed anand et al 2018 wu et al 2017 the parameters are used to describe the effect of the model input the flow parameters describe water permeability thermal properties and water scarcity effects of the pad surface on the simulation input sellami et al 2016 shin and choi 2018 the confluence parameters describe the topography roughness and water distribution on the model input cheng et al 2019 the structure reflects the physical relationship between the model inputs parameters and model outputs the parameters have a clear physical meaning only when the structure of the basin hydrological model is correct and thus the quantification may be reasonable and accurate wang et al 2020 however the accuracy of dhms relies largely on the availability of data reflecting the meteorological and physical conditions of a region which is particularly problematic for evaluating the complex water cycle processes of the qtp owing to its widely variable topography vast landscape and rugged conditions liu et al 2018 wang and xue 2013 the aforementioned issue can potentially be addressed by considering the computational unit eric et al 2013 saran et al 2010 which is the minimum unit in the calculation of hydrological models and is needed to generalize the parameters in the hydrological unit jia et al 2005 wang and xue 2013 grids are suitable for small and medium sized watersheds jia et al 2001 whereas other computational units such as the hydrologic response unit hru are suitable for larger watersheds ning et al 2015 the hrus divide regions spatially based on

that maximum precipitation zones occur in the higher mountainous areas of the qtp particularly on windward slopes which determine the tree line elevation wang et al 2017 moreover the changes in tree line and snowline elevations have been shown to disturb water cycle processes such as precipitation evaporation and runoff gaire et al 2014 salzer et al 2014 harsch et al 2009 collected global tree line data to test the hypothesis that climate change would accelerate the rise in tree line elevation however it was found that only half of the tree line elevations have increased significantly over the past 100 years whereas the remaining tree line elevations have remained relatively stable due to low temperatures similar conditions were also found in the qtp yao et al 2015 therefore the extent of changes in the mazs characterizing the qtp over the years should be evaluated mazs can serve as a basis for constructing reasonably accurate dhms under climate change conditions the main methods for dividing regions spatially into mazs include field investigation expert experience and remote sensing zhang et al 2006 among these remote sensing has become the most commonly used method ustin and gamon 2010 the classification of mazs based on remote sensing imagery is mainly conducted by combining the spatial structure spectral brightness and other information of each pixel in different bands of an image according to specific rules and processes and then dividing each pixel into different categories jacquemoud et al 2009 ustin and gamon 2010 pixel classification is mainly performed using machine learning approaches which include supervised and unsupervised classification mountrakis et al 2011 the supervised classification process requires that several pixels pertaining to known classifications be selected as training samples for each category preset in the remote sensing image dataset and the training samples must accurately represent the spectral features of each category ma et al 2017 afterward the trained classification network is employed to divide unknown pixels into their most likely categories foody and mathur 2004 mountrakis et al 2011 water and energy transfer processes in large river basins wep l models are a type of dhm that incorporates physical parameters that can be measured or calculated jia et al 2001 2006 the wep l divides the modeled region spatially into subwatersheds to reflect the spatial variability of the hydrological watershed process and also establishes the topological relationships between subwatersheds jia et al 2006 therefore subwatershed with similar elevations are divided into several computational units peng et al 2013 accordingly the wep l model is an ideal subject for studying the effects of maz assignment on modeled hydrological cycles however the computational units divided in the wep l model only consider elevation therefore there may be some errors in the parameters of such computational units the benefits of the proposed altitudinal discretization method are verified by applying it to construct the wep l model for the nagqu river watershed nrw in the qtp as a case study to consider the physical meaning and impact of climate change in mazs we proposed a method for assigning the computational units of alpine dhms according to mazs that explicitly account for climate change the main purpose of this study is as follows a extract multi period mazs in the nrw based on satellite imagery b compare the results obtained using the wep l swat model and the new regional division method denoted as the wep c model that applies the proposed altitudinal discretization method and c compare the results using one period maz and multi period mazs 2 methods 2 1 case study and data sources the nu salween river upstream 91 10 96 33 e 30 24 n 32 44 n generally denoted as the nagqu river originates in ando county at the southern foot of tanggula mountain in the qtp feng et al 2010 weng et al 2020 the nrw is illustrated in fig 1 along with the meteorological and hydrological stations in the region the length of the nagqu river is 818 km with a watershed area of 74 043 km2 and an average elevation of 4761 m the average annual air temperature in the nrw from 1970 to 2019 was 0 1 c with an average maximum daily temperature of 30 6 c and an average minimum daily temperature of 41 2 c the average annual precipitation in the watershed from 1970 to 2019 was 550 mm 80 of which was concentrated from june to september due to the complex topography and climate conditions nrw generates a wide variety of mazs lei et al 2012 liu 2017 found that the relative volume of glacial ice and permanent snow pack in the nrw decreased from 2 67 in 1980 to 1 35 in 2014 grassland decreased by 1817 7 km2 from 1980 to 2014 table s1 in addition no large scale reservoirs abstractions or irrigation projects have been implemented in the region and therefore the water circulation process of the watershed is natural which makes it ideal for studying the influence of mazs on hydrological cycles the data pertaining to the nrw employed in the modeling are listed in table 1 these data include a digital elevation model dem spatially distributed land use data for 1980 1995 2005 2010 and 2014 soil thickness and types for 2000 daily precipitation air temperature wind speed relative humidity and duration of sunshine obtained from 1970 to 2019 at 12 meteorological stations due to the large watershed area we resampled the dem and land use data to 1 km to ensure computational efficiency 2 2 model structure for the vertical model structure the computational units are divided into vegetation canopy building intercept surface depression storage aerated zone transition zone and groundwater layers from top to bottom jia et al 2006 to reflect the change in soil moisture from the surface to the deep layer the influence of soil depth on the evaporation of bare soil and the transpiration of vegetation roots the soil zone is further divided into surface middle and bottom layers potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the penman monteith formula soil moisture movement is set to distinguish between heavy rain and non storm rain by setting rainfall intensity thresholds the green ampt model is used to calculate the hourly streamflow and the richards equation is simulated daily for the plane model structure the sub watershed was divided into several mazs the land use types in each maz were obtained based on the land use data and the land use types in mazs were minimized to reflect the uneven distribution of land use in the unit the land use type was further divided into five types vegetation bare land irrigated farmland non irrigated farmland water area and impervious area the regional water and heat fluxes were weighted by area to obtain the maz water and heat fluxes slope convergence and river convergence were calculated based on the top to bottom relationship using the one dimensional motion wave method groundwater movement was calculated from the mountain and plains with water exchange 2 2 1 slope and river confluence the model slope and the discharge convergence process were simulated using the motion wave equation jia et al 2006 the calculation equation is as follows 1 a t q x q l 2 s f s 0 3 q a n r 2 3 s 0 1 2 where q is the slope or channel flow m3 s a is the cross sectional area m2 q l is the unit discharge m3 s s f is the friction slope s 0 is the slope r is the hydraulic radius m and n is the manning roughness coefficient 2 2 2 surface infiltration the infiltration process in the model was simulated using the green ampt model under the condition of stable precipitation intensity the initial soil infiltration intensity is usually large and the amount of infiltration depends on the precipitation intensity however the infiltration intensity decreases as the infiltration capacity increases wang et al 2009 when the precipitation intensity equals the infiltration intensity the surface water accumulation and infiltration intensity are determined by soil moisture and cumulative infiltration 2 3 altitudinal discretization method 2 3 1 vegetation classification according to montane altitudinal zones the key to this method for assigning hydrological computational units is to obtain effective mazs fan and he 2015 found that the break point of streamflow due to climate change in the nrw occurred in the late 1990s centered around 1997 in the model the mazs extracted from remote sensing images captured in 1984 average from 1970 to 1997 and 2009 average from 1998 to 2019 were used for conducting streamflow simulations before and after 1997 respectively the mazs in the nrw were extracted based on pertinent us landsat satellite imagery https search earthdata nasa gov search which included 10 images obtained monthly by a landsat 5 satellite in 1984 and 10 images obtained by a landsat 7 satellite every month in 2009 first the geometric deformation and radiation deformation in the images were corrected by image preprocessing such as radiometric calibration atmospheric correction and geometric correction ma et al 2017 according to the spatial distribution data of nrw vegetation types in the 1980s chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn data aspx dataid 122 the image pixels were classified into a total of 7 mazs which included the alpine snow alpine desert steppe alpine meadow peak shrub meadow alpine vegetation cultivated vegetation and cold temperate evergreen coniferous forest zones supervised classification envi 5 2 was performed using the maximum likelihood method in conjunction with visual interpretation and field survey information and remote sensing images in the green near infrared and mid infrared bands were synthesized into false color remote sensing images liang et al 2017 finally block smoothing was used in post classification processing to make the vegetation classification smoother and improve the classification effect the vegetation in mazs undergoes significant seasonal variation the model classifies vegetation types into seven categories types 1 7 for model parameter assignment as such the initial values of the physical parameters reflecting vegetation in the model are assigned monthly the vegetation fractional coverage v f c is calculated monthly according to the multi year average monthly ndvi of the watershed from remote sensing as follows liu et al 2019 4 v f c i n d v i i n d v i s o i l n d v i v e g n d v i s o i l where v f c i and n d v i i are the initial vfc and ndvi values in the i th month respectively and n d v i s o i l and n d v i v e g are the n d v i values of areas reflecting bare soil and complete vegetation coverage conditions respectively 2 3 2 hydrological computational unit assignment the assignment of hydrological computational units is divided into the following five steps 1 the watershed is divided into several subwatershed areas based on the watershed area while the horton strahler shreve and pfafstetter method is commonly used for this purpose jia et al 2001 the present study applied the strahler method based on a dem jia et al 2006 as illustrated in fig 2 a 2 the watershed is divided into multi period mazs according to extant vegetation as illustrated in fig 2 b this was performed using existing datasets remote sensing imagery and field surveys 3 the subwatersheds and multi period mazs are intersected using the arcgis intersect module which means the intersection of the subwatersheds and the mazs are used as the computational units of a watershed each computational unit has a unique soil type soil thickness and land use they are derived from the soil type soil thickness and land use derived from the corresponding data that account for the largest percentage of the computational unit the processing result is taken as the computational unit as illustrated in fig 2 c herein the mazs differ because of factors like climate change and therefore the computational units also differ by maz 4 the computational units in the subwatershed are re encoded based on their average elevation to facilitate the transfer of parameters from high elevation computational units to low elevation computational units within the subwatershed finally the streamflows are transferred to the exit point of the watershed at subwatershed q1 within maz q1 fig 2 c 5 different computational units will be given different climate land use and soil parameters before simulation therefore when the computational units change the parameters of the computational units in the model change accordingly 2 4 model evaluation method we compared the modeling results of the wep c swat and wep l models according to the following procedure because the wep l and wep c model structures are the same they can be used to compare parameter influence on the model the model comparison process was as follows 1 considering the streamflow of the dasa and jiayuqiao hydrological stations as the regulating targets a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the model parameters the parameters of the wep l model were first optimized with respect to the quantitative performance metrics and the modeling results were recorded then these parameters are applied directly to the wep c model and the modeling results were recorded this is referred to as the wep l c model 2 the wep c model parameters were optimized with respect to the quantitative performance metrics there parameters were then applied directly to the wep l model and the modeling results were recorded this is referred to as the wep c l model 3 the modeling accuracies of the wep l wep l c wep c and wep c l models were compared according to the quantitative performance metrics model verification was conducted according to the observed streamflow at the dasa 1983 1995 and jiayuqiao hydrological stations 1980 2008 and soil moisture at dasa hydrological station in conjunction with the modeled values using quantitative indexes including the nash efficiency coefficient correlation coefficient and model uncertainty table 2 gao et al 2018 yang et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 the model calibration period covered 1983 1990 for modeling the streamflow recorded by dasa hydrological station whereas 1991 1995 was adopted as the model verification period in addition 1980 2001 was adopted as the model calibration period for modeling the streamflow recorded by the jiayuqiao hydrological station and 2002 2008 was adopted as the model verification period the model uncertainty indexe is defined as follows 5 r u l 95 q o q o 6 r d q o l 5 q o where r u and r d are the respective upper and lower limits of the uncertain confidence interval respectively l 5 and l 95 are the respective uncertainties of the 5 and 95 confidence intervals respectively and q o is the observed data 3 results 3 1 division of vegetation zones the mazs extracted from satellite imagery of the nrw captured in 1984 and 2009 are presented in fig 3 a b and table s2 respectively here 780 computational units were obtained in 1984 and 1103 computational units were obtained in 2009 based on the classification of mazs the remote sensing results extracted from images obtained in 1984 are consistent with the 1980s spatial distribution data of chinese vegetation types extracted over 1 km2 grids by the chinese academy of sciences to a similarity of 80 31 in addition the nrw was divided into 199 subwatersheds and the results are presented in fig 3 c the vfcs in the subwatersheds are presented in table 3 3 2 model verification 3 2 1 streamflow calibration the minimum and maximum allowable values for the range of each parameter were determined based on regional qtp characteristics the parameters of wep l swat and wep c were determined using genetic algorithm table s3 because the observed streamflow at the dasa hydrological station was in the maz in 1984 to verify whether the effect of multi period mazs is better we compare the effect of simulation using multi period mazs and one period maz from the jiayuqiao hydrological station table 4 the annual average discharge simulated by maz in 1984 was 763 m3 s which is 1 2 lower than in the wep c model and the nash coefficient was 0 02 lower than that of the wep c model the annual average discharge simulated by maz in 2009 was 791 m3 s which is 2 5 higher than that of the wep c model and the nash coefficient was 0 02 lower than that of the wep c model the simulation results of the one period maz and multi period mazs were not significantly different and the nash coefficient was very close considering the complexity and operability of the model preparation process multi period mazs cannot improve the simulation accuracy compared with one period maz simulation results fig 4 presents the monthly and daily observed streamflow red point and streamflow simulated using the wep l model black line swat model orange line and wep c model gray filled area for the dasa and jiayuqiao hydrological stations in the daily streamflow simulation fig 4b the simulation accuracy of the wep c model was significantly higher than that of the wep l and swat models the quantitative accuracy indices for the calibration and verification of the three different models are listed in table 4 we note that the average discharge was underestimated by the wep l model 83 1 of observed streamflows the swat model was good for the simulation of average discharge 97 1 of observed streamflows however but the simulation for discharge in winter was evidently higher the wep c model provided a better estimate 94 6 of observed streamflows and obtained equal or greater nash and r2 values of all the models during the calibration and verification periods we also note that adopting the optimized parameters for the wep l model in the wep c model the wep l c model achieved the next highest simulated result in contrast adopting the optimized parameters for the wep c model in the wep l model the wep c l model achieved the worst modeling performance this is due to the use of suboptimal parameters in the wep l model which can degrade its modeling performance these results demonstrate that the modeling performance of the wep c model is better than that of the wep l model even when employing suboptimal parameter settings however the wep l model underestimated the streamflow to some extent during the calibration period and streamflow distribution in the swat model was flattened within the year higher discharge in winter and lower runoff in summer furthermore the streamflow of the wep l and swat models at both stations was underestimated to some extent during the verification period due to the increasing streamflow trend in the watershed 3 2 2 soil moisture calibration from the daily soil moisture simulation results of typical subwatersheds table 5 and fig 5 the simulation results of the wep l model swat model and wep c model had evident differences the wep l model simulates low soil moisture and poor simulation results the swat model simulation fluctuates significantly with precipitation the soil moisture simulation results of the wep c model were basically consistent with the fluctuation in observed soil moisture there was a certain lag in simulating soil moisture movement however the model simulation results were generally good overall the soil moisture simulation results of the wep c model can characterize the soil moisture changes in different layers of the watershed 3 3 impact of uncertainty on maximum streamflows the streamflow of the nrw in summer fluctuates significantly and the runoff in winter is relatively stable yang et al 2020 the influence of the spatial structure of the model on the uncertainty of maximum streamflow was investigated according to the monthly maximum runoff fig 6 presents the observed results open circles and the results simulated using the wep l swat and wep c models filled circles respectively the upper and lower limits of uncertainty based on the observed streamflow and the uncertainty of the model simulation is judged according to whether the model simulated streamflow falls within the uncertainty interval we note that the difference between the monthly maximum streamflow obtained from the swat and wep l models and the observed values increases with increasing frequency therefore the uncertainty in the spatial structure of the model increases with increasing maximum monthly streamflow however the difference between the monthly maximum streamflow obtained from the wep c model and the observed values does not change significantly with increasing frequency herein the monthly maximum streamflow obtained from the wep c model remains close to the observed values even when the frequency is large these results demonstrate that the uncertainty in the results obtained from the wep c model is less than the uncertainty in the results obtained from the swat and wep l models 4 discussion because the swat model can only input one period of land use only the differences between the wep l model and wep c model are discussed herein the generalized distribution of land use in the two models is listed in table 6 the generalized land use in the wep c model is close to the land use data whereas the wep l model produced bias in the generalization process the watershed hydrological model parameters are essentially physical quantities that reflect the input of the underlying surface to the model and are necessarily closely related to the characteristics of the underlying surface of the basin the impact of land use change on streamflow is essentially the process of precipitation redistribution under the combined effect of various factors in different underlying surfaces forests improved the infiltration performance of the surface interface and most surface runoff was converted into underground streamflow through the surface layer therefore the soil moisture simulated by the wep c model in fig 5 is higher than that of the wep l model under the condition that the climatic data in the model remain unchanged forests had higher evapotranspiration and interception capacity and hence the fluctuation in daily streamflow is smaller therefore the flood season streamflow simulated by the wep c model in fig 4 b is more stable than the wep l model the uncertainty of the wep c model is less than that of the wep l model fig 6 which indicates that this method can effectively reduce the problem of equifinality when it is applied to the qtp areas the maz in the wep c model which is mainly based on vegetation growth provides a spatial basis for refining hydrological processes and spatial analyses based on smaller scales thereby making the physical meaning of a dhm more explicit the simulation results of one period maz and multi period mazs in the model have little difference which may be due to the fact that multi period mazs are more suitable for areas where the maz changes more drastically considering the complexity and operability of the model preparation process one period maz simulation results can meet the requirements of model simulation 5 conclusion this study proposed a method for assigning the computational units of alpine dhms according to multi period mazs the benefits of the proposed altitudinal discretization method were verified by applying it to construct a model for the nrw in the qtp the mazs in the nrw were mainly extracted based on satellite imagery with pixels classified using maximum likelihood supervised classification considering the complexity and operability of the model preparation process one period maz simulation results can meet the requirements of model simulation the results obtained using the wep l and swat models employing conventional regional division and the new regional division method denoted as the wep c model that applies the method were compared and the simulation accuracy of the streamflow and soil moisture in the alpine watershed were demonstrated to be improved according to quantitative indexes by the use of the proposed altitudinal discretization method overall the streamflow and soil moisture verification results demonstrate that the established wep c model can effectively describe the macroscopic water circulation process in the alpine region considered compared with the conventional model the improved model better captures surface hydrological processes in the upstream and downstream sites of the nrw indicating that the new regional division method more realistically models the vertical hydrological processes in this alpine region accordingly we can conclude that the proposed altitudinal discretization method supports the development of dhms and can be further applied to other hydrological models data availability statement the data that support the findings of

8316,study region the nyando river basin in western kenya it is part of the lake victoria basin study focus as a first step towards numerical modeling complementary datasets from different periods have been used to develop a conceptual hydrogeological model for this geologically complex basin the study focused on characterizing the physical and process structures data from geological reports and geo electrical survey reports were used to establish aquifer extents timeline comparison and interpolation of groundwater levels and hydrochemical data analysis were used to define groundwater flow characteristics new hydrological insights for the region a highland and a kano plains groundwater system exist and are separated by the faults at the nandi and kendu escarpments the groundwater divide between nyando and nyamasaria rivers flowing through the kano plains is indistinct suggesting that their lowland groundwater system is the same kano plains has a shallow and deep groundwater system both occurring in highly heterogeneous and aquifers the bedrock here occurs at 250 m below ground level generally the groundwater flow is topography driven towards lake victoria but it is not clear whether it discharges here rainfall has minimal effect on long term groundwater variability because groundwater levels do not change significantly over time steady state groundwater flow occurs in the plains keywords data scarcity hydrochemistry conceptual model faults kano plains nyando basin 1 introduction the ever increasing importance of groundwater for human and ecological uses is a motivation to study groundwater systems and hydrogeologists use groundwater and more recently groundwater surface water gw sw interaction modeling this study forms the basis for a gw sw study of the nyando river basin besides its importance for agriculture and domestic water uses the river basin has interactive riverine lacustrine and wetland ecosystems khisa et al 2013 some past studies of the nyando river basin have focused on surface water hydrology aspects khisa et al 2013 have shown that the rainfall here is bimodal and generally follows the lake victoria basin s typical water year further there is a positive correlation between rainfall and river discharge rongoei et al 2013 state that basin hydrology is a significant driver of change for the nyando wetland which occurs near the river mouth at the winam gulf of lake victoria fig 1 water levels in the wetland are variable and may go up to 0 8 m above ground rongoei et al 2014 in the seasonally flooded areas the levels may go up to 0 2 m during the dry periods the water sources for the wetland include groundwater lake backflow during floods direct rainfall overland flow and inflow from rivers raburu et al 2012 indicating an extensive gw sw interaction from their study olang and fürst 2011 have reported significant deforestation at the river source which has reportedly caused a 30 increase in peak river flows in the upper reaches and 20 increase in the lower reaches of the nyando river the higher peaks are due to the relatively high bare land percentage upstream where the deforestation occurs kano plains is an expansive flat terrain in the eastern part of the kavirondo rift valley a failed arm of the eastern rift valley shackleton 1948 dwars heederik and verhey dhv 1988 it is sandwiched between the nandi and kendu escarpments in the lower reaches of the nyando river basin the nyamasaria river also flows through these plains and topographical and landuse data indicate a connection with the nyando river basin for example the miriu river fig 1 connects the okana ombeyi and nyando wetlands and the latter straddles both river basins some rivulets flow across the river basins at the nyando wetland further landuse analysis by khisa et al 2013 shows that the river nyando has been migrating southwards and at about 1950 it was flowing within the now nyamasaria river basin further evidence for the migration is provided by millman 1973 who has suggested that the nyando and nyamasaria rivers were once part of the same river sharing a common outflow at nam thoe swamp despite these most of the surface water hydrology and related studies have looked at the nyando as a separate system e g ongwenyi et al 1993 gathenya et al 2011 olang and fürst 2011 and taye et al 2011 in their integrated flood management for nyando river basin study ministry of water and irrigation mwi water resources management authority wrma and japan international cooperation agency jica 2009 studied both rivers together and were able to show that their floodwaters overlap they have described the middle reaches of the rivers as steep and occurring in narrow gorges while in the lower reaches this changes to very flat and wide river channels nyilitya et al 2020 undertook a hydrogeochemical study focusing on nitrogen contamination covering the entire kano plains the above studies show that surface water hydrology and related data like climate weather river flow land use land cover have been scientifically and extensively analyzed there has however been a minimum focus on the hydrogeological aspects according to knbs 2019 the population of the kano plains density here is moderate with an average of 550 persons km2 groundwater from springs shallow wells and boreholes is considered a safe and critical source for domestic water supply and accounts for about 40 of all water used in the area dhv 1988 proper groundwater management is therefore needed quite often hydrogeological models are tools that guide decision makers on safe groundwater abstraction thresholds developing a conceptual model is the first step when undertaking hydrogeological studies it includes developing i the conceptual physical structure i e the vertical and horizontal extents of the system the hydrostratigraphic units hsu including their extents and the compartmentalization of the groundwater and ii the conceptual process structure which includes characterization of the groundwater flow and time variant boundary conditions anderson et al 2015 enemark et al 2019 the process becomes challenging when requisite data is lacking and in geologically complex groundwater systems babad et al 2020 have explained that these are typical challenges in many groundwater studies and that creative and site specific approaches are needed to achieve reliable hydrogeological conceptual models as suggested by bredehoeft 2005 hydrogeologists can solve this problem by a collecting as much data as possible and b using complementary data collection techniques based on previous studies the conceptualization of complex and faulted hydrogeological systems with limited data requires complementary approaches that combine geophysical hydrogeochemical environmental and artificial tracers for example burghof et al 2018 developed a hydrogeological conceptual wetland model for a data scare kilombero valley in tanzania using a mixture of hydrogeological hydrochemical and tracer based assessment techniques girmay et al 2015 conceptualized the groundwater flow including delineation of recharge and discharge zones for the complex mekelle paleozoic mesozoic sedimentary outlier in northern ethiopia using environmental isotopes and dissolved ions walraevens et al 2015 used a detailed hydrochemical analysis approach and were able to infer the sources of salinity and contamination of the coastal quaternary aquifer in dar el salaam tanzania kebede et al 2008 determined the groundwater flow dynamics of a very complex ethiopian rift volcanic aquifers where these data are lacking hydrogeologists can also apply a simplification of groundwater conceptual models for example when modeling the influence of water abstractions on the water levels for the data scarce and hydrogeologically complex lake naivasha in kenya hogeboom et al 2015 simplified the conceptual model to a one layer system still they recommended using environmental isotopes and multi models approach as methods that would lead to a better understanding the nyando river basin has a highlands section at the river source and a lowland section at the kano plains fig 1 and there exists a recharge zone at the faults located at the escarpments dhv 1988 as a result researchers can study the highlands and lowland systems separately the current study focuses on the hydrogeology of the kano plains and the highlands groundwater flow has been taken as a recharge boundary at the faults the kano plains has fragmented datasets of geological hydrogeological sections hydrogeochemical and groundwater levels dhv 1988 through their geophysical surveys were able to define hydrofacies in the kano plains but the extent of the hsu s is still not known some feasible lateral extent boundaries like the impermeable rocks at the nandi and kendu escarpments fig 1 are apparent there are also faults on the floor of the kano plains dhv 1988 these should be used as groundwater flow boundaries with caution because according to bense et al 2003 rajabpour et al 2016 they can have a sealing effect or they can be barriers to horizontal groundwater flow the occurrence of a groundwater divide below the nyando nyamasaria river surface water divide is not documented such a divide would occur if the groundwater flow were topography driven but this is also unknown besides the groundwater divide location is affected by factors such as pumping grannemann et al 2000 and should be adequately characterized further groundwater divides for deep groundwater systems may occur away from surface water divides grannemann et al 2000 de smedt 2014 funkhouser 2014 from millman 1973 there is a deposition of detritus in the kano plains by the south flowing streams from the nandi escarpment this has caused a change in the ground elevation change and consequently the surface water divide the lake victoria nyando and nyamasaria rivers and the entire stream network fig 1 are other hydraulically controlled boundaries in the study area and researchers should quantify their effect on the groundwater flow these are expected to respond to hydraulic stresses anderson et al 2015 and should be analyzed for stability and conceptualized as either steady state or transient boundaries this study aims to develop a conceptual hydrogeological model of the kano plains by aggregating the existing and current fragmented datasets we have used remotely sensed products historical data from geological reports and geophysical investigation survey reports to characterize the topography geology and aquifers under the hydrological stresses we have used a combination of historical and recent groundwater level datasets the effect of rainfall patterns on the groundwater levels has also been assessed where a combination of remotely sensed and observed rainfall measurements has been used 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nyando river basin fig 1 is part of the eastern part of the lake victoria basin in western kenya the nyando and nyamasaria rivers flow through the low lying kano plains 1135 1300 m asl and experience floods

the uncertainty regarding the groundwater divide s location and existence the study area includes the nyamasaria river basin 2 1 1 drainage network the elevation data fig 1 was obtained from the 30 m

archive center lp daac located at the u s geological survey usgs centre for earth resources observation and science eros http lpdaac usgs gov compared with the global positioning system benchmarks the aster gdem is 17 01 m and has a root mean square rms of 8 68 m the upper reaches of the nyando river occur at 75 109 km from the river mouth and with 1 45 slope the middle reaches at 45 75 km with a slope of 1 160 and the lower reaches to occur at 0 45 km with a slope of 1 700 1600 mwi et al 2009 the headwaters are in the highlands while the low lying kano plains dominate the downstream sections there is an altitude drop of about 500 m between the highlands and the plains the nyando river s confluence with the largest ainamutua river and the second largest tributary pararget river is in the middle reaches in the kano plains the nyando wetland is further downstream at the river mouth where smaller tributaries the awach kano nyaidho and asawo rivers join the river during flood events the nyando wetland and lake victoria become a single water body and the nyando river flows into the wetland after the floodwaters recede and during dry periods the river flows directly into lake victoria at the winam gulf mwi et al 2009 a network of rivulets flowing directly into the wetland also exist in addition to the nyando wetland the okana ombeyi and nam thoe wetlands occur nearby and according to khisa and unlenbrook 2011 they are connected from fig 1 the streams connect these wetlands because of this and the fact the floodwaters from all rivers overlap mwi et al 2009 there is a high likelihood of interactions within the wetland and surface water bodies in the kano plains the nyamasaria river flows through the kano plains into the nam thoe wetland before draining into lake victoria other rivers occurring in the nyamasaria river basin are the oroba ombeyi luanda and miriu rivers 2 1 2 geological setting a prominent geologic and topographic feature and the focus of this study is the kano plains it is of great hydrogeological importance and occurs towards the river mouth in the winam gulf of lake victoria it is in the eastern part of the kavirondo rift valley a failed arm of the east african rift valley it has been described in detail by shackleton 1948 and reported widely e g dhv 1988 though not definitive the formation is believed to have started with the peneplanation during the jurassic early cretaceous and the end of the paleogene the precambrian granites underlying the northwest of winam northeast of muhoroni and the southern part of nyakach divisions fig 2 are from this period formation of depressions started during a stage of crustal stretching and thinning in the lower miocene of the tertiary period and is believed to have resulted in the creation of a shallow basin and consequently shallow extensive lakes on the sub miocene surface it is not until the late pliocene to the early pleistocene when the major deformation i e faulting and uplifting occurred according to shackleton 1948 the uplifting was more pronounced near the border with the east african rift valley to the west of the tinderet mountains formed from volcanic eruptions during the lower miocene during this period the kavirondo rift valley floor remained level and lake victoria started in the depression resulting from uplifted edges of the east african rift valley and the western rift valley major fault lines i e the kendu and nandi fault also formed during this time forming the basis for deposition of pleistocene and recent sediments in the valley other major east west and north south faults cross within the floor of the kavirondo rift valley dhv 1988 and create a complex faulted sub surface precambrian granites in the nyabondo plateau south of the nyakach division are overlain by tertiary volcanics phonolites and phonolitic lavas associated with deposition on the peneplanes after the fissure eruptions arising as a result of movement along the fault lines other tertiary phonolites phonolitic lavas basaltic lavas and tuffs occur in the eastern part of the nyando and muhoroni divisions pleistocene sediments underlie most of the kano plains according to shackleton 1948 lake victoria occupied most of the kano plans in early times and most pleistocene deposits in the upper part of nyakach and northern and eastern arts of nyando divisions are of lacustrine origin for example large granitic gravel deposits within the kendu fault vicinity dhv 1988 are believed to originate from lake victoria s beach deposits during the pleistocene period these sediments are very thick and resulted from the deposition of eroded sediments from neighboring landmasses boreholes with varying depths e g 150 m in winam division and 250 m in nyando division have exposed a variable sequence of mudstone sandstone siltstone limestone gravel and claystone dhv 1988 the deposition took place mainly during the pluvial periods which alternated with phases of inter pluvial periods faulting continued throughout the pleistocene period largely affecting the stratigraphy some recent deposits covering the pleistocene deposits include alluvial fans at the foot of the escarpments and constitute a significant occurrence in the muhoroni division other recent deposits i e alluvial flats and alluvial clays are either of fluvial or lacustrine origin dhv 1988 after the end of the pleistocene period lake victoria occupied a large part of the eastern kavirondo rift valley leading to the lake alluvium deposition after the lake receded deposition of rivers alluvium occurred as rivers meandered across the old lake bottom black cotton soils are the most common in the kano plains however the phonolites and granites have a thin lateritic ironstone capping and white to grey kaolinites respectively table 1 summarizes the stratigraphy of the kano plains 2 1 3 rainfall the nyando river basin has a general sub humid climate with semi arid characteristics at the nyando wetland taye et al 2011 raburu et al 2012 the inter tropical convergence zone ictz controls the bi modal annual rainfall patterns with long rains occurring in march may mam the occurrence of the short rains is not definitive some studies have reported the months of october december ond while it is september november son in others raburu et al 2012 khisa et al 2013 moreover in the eastern highlands of the catchment i e the tinderet mountain and the mau escarpments a subdued peak occurs in july september jas months khisa et al 2013 the small jas peak is a characteristic of the lake victoria basin and has also been reported elsewhere e g in the nzoia river basin kizza et al 2011 the most significant rainfall events e g the widely reported uhuru floods of 1961 1964 have been associated with large scale climate systems e g the el nino southern oscillation enso and the indian ocean dipole iod mugume et al 2016 there is a strong correlation between rainfall and altitude raburu et al 2012 the highlands annual average rainfall is 1700 1800 mm while it is 600 1100 mm in the plains 2 2 methodological flow chart this study brings together several fragmented datasets to generate a hydrogeological conceptual model of the kano plains fig 3 below gives a summary of the available datasets and their application 2 3 datasets 2 3 1 geological maps topographical maps and dem major geological features major faults and global stratigraphy are found in geological reports for the study area binge 1962 huddleston 1952 jennings 1964 1971 walsh 1969 and williams 1991 from the department of mines and geology of kenya the elevation data are from the remotely sensed dem http lpdaac usgs gov and topographical maps available at the survey of kenya 2 3 2 hydrogeological sections hand drilling survey data geochemical data and groundwater levels dhv 1988 higher resolution subsurface geology of the low lying kano plains was obtained from historical hydrogeological sections generated from geoelectrical reports for kisumu district from the water resources survey and survey training program under the rural water supply and sanitation program for the nyanza province dhv 1988 this geological survey was done from 1982 to 1987 within the four administrative divisions fig 4 yielding four datasets for winam nyando muhoroni and nyakach divisions dhv 1988 the result was a dataset of vertical extents of aquifers and the fault locations the groundwater sources of the kano plains include a shallow wells screened in the unconfined aquifer in the recent deposits b boreholes screened in the deep aquifer in the pleistocene sediments and c springs during the dhv 1988 study an inventory of every groundwater point in kano plains fig 7 was taken from 1986 to 1987 and one time water table level measurements are available some hydrochemical data were also collected during this time electrical conductivity ec and ph are available in 663 wells 121 springs and 19 boreholes other hydrochemical parameters alkalinity hardness as caco3 cations f e 2 m n 2 n h 4 a n d a n i o n s c l f a n d n o 3 are available in 114 shallow wells 32 springs and 13 boreholes fig 5 further one time water table measurements and well yields were collected during a hand drilling survey from 1982 to 1987 fig 7 a typical hydrogeological cross section from the kendu escarpments to the nyando wetland fig 6 indicates that there are highlands and a kano plains groundwater system separated by a fault zone that acts as a barrier to horizontal groundwater flow and thus channeling the water vertically into the deep aquifer in the kano plains the north tabriz fault in iran exhibits similar behavior rajabpour et al 2016 although dhv 1988 reports an aquitard separating the top and bottom aquifers in nyakach division hydrogeological sections from elsewhere in the kano plains depict a highly heterogeneous aquifer composed of silts and clays followed by the pleistocene aquifers the latter is similarly heterogeneous and is a conglomerate of pleistocene sandstones siltstones limestones gravels and clay stones a shallow water table exists in the top aquifer and semiconfined conditions in the bottom aquifer the top aquifer is recharged by rainfall while the bottom is mainly recharged by highlands groundwater at the fault zones and to a small extent by vertical groundwater flow from the leaky top aquifer dhv 1988 2 3 3 groundwater levels wrma ecolive project and 2016 2018 data campaign there are historical hourly water table measurements from the nyando wetland taken in 2010 2012 within the framework of the ecolive project van dam et al 2011 at points l01 l02 l03 l04 and r04 fig 7 further one hour automatic measurements were taken within the framework of this study in well s4 fig 7 from 2016 to 2017 using 10 meter td and cera divers van essen instruments in delft netherlands onetime water table measurements were also taken in the framework of this study in wells s1 s8 and monthly measurements in wells s1 s2 s4 s5 and s7 fig 7 for the deep aquifer continuous measurements of the groundwater levels do not exist however one time measurements are taken during borehole completion and stored by the water resources management authority wrma of kenya and contain the depth to aquifers the thickness of yielding aquifers phreatic level potentiometric levels and well yield fig 14 shows the distribution of the boreholes in kano plains 2 3 4 lake water levels the lake levels were obtained from the database for hydrological time series over inland water dahiti schwatke et al 2015 schwatke et al 2015 assessed the accuracy of the data for south and north america and reported a root mean square error rmse value of 4 36 cm 2 3 5 rainfall kmd ecolive project and chirps observed daily rainfall for the nyando river basin is available for select stations ahero irrigation and koru bible college from 1980 date there are also daily rainfall observations at three stations done in the 2011 2014 period fig 8 a at three stations 1 average of the wetland stations p1 to p7 located next to lake victoria at the nyando wetland 2 ahero irrigation p9 at the kano plains and 3 mbogo valley p11 at the western slopes of the mau complex these rainfall stations are shown in fig 1 however a long term continuous observed daily rainfall dataset for the nyando highlands does not exist this data is crucial since surface water seeps through the faults into the kano plains groundwater system the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps rainfall funk et al 2014 was used to estimate daily highlands rainfall and in part to complement the available daily rainfall from dinku et al 2018 a correlation coefficient cc for chirps rainfall data with ground observations is 0 65 for 10 day rainfall and 0 83 for monthly rainfall and the bias is 1 10 and 1 13 respectively for kenya funk et al 2015 and cattani et al 2018 have shown that chirps rainfall performs well when used for trend analysis and is therefore adequate for our intended use the monthly rainfall in 2011 and observed and chirps for the nyando river basin are shown in fig 8 apart from march and august the trends are similar for observed and chirps rainfall products there is a difference in the chirps rainfall quantities for 2011 and 2017 but the annual trends are identical and follow the typical patterns for the october september meteorological year for the upper nile basin chirps rainfall is estimated using an algorithm that utilizes rainfall estimates from satellite data and averages of ground observations dinku et al 2018 further the resolution of chirps rainfall is 0 05 while ground observations are taken at a point these are some of the causes of the considerable difference in the ground observations and chiprs rainfalls fig 8 2 4 methods 2 4 1 aquifer extents the location of the escarpments at the nandi and kendu fault zone was determined from a slope map calculated from the dem as the zone with the highest slope within the 1300 m contour line the major faults at the escarpments act as barriers to horizontal groundwater flow and are a suitable horizontal boundary their location was extracted from the geological reports other faults occurring in the kano plains in the kavirondo valley were obtained from both the dhv and geological reports further fault locations from the dhv reports were used for validation the vertical aquifer extents were extracted from the high resolution hydrogeological sections and hand drilling surveys by dhv 1988 a major limitation is the lack of detailed geophysical data for the highlands and thus the hydrogeological characterization was limited to the kano plains a transverse hydrogeological cross section of the entire kano plains was developed by joining the short hydrogeological sections location of hydraulic groundwater flow boundaries e g rivers nyando and nyamasaria and the other small rivers and the lake victoria were extracted from the topographical maps 2 4 2 temporal groundwater variability to assess the long term variation of the shallow groundwater tables all available measurements from the hand drilling survey 1982 1987 groundwater inventory survey 1986 1987 and recent datasets from 2010 2012 current data campaigns 2016 2018 were used only depth to groundwater is available and the water table level was calculated as ground elevation m depth to the water table m according to dhv 1988 the shallow water table occurs within the recent deposits with an average thickness range of 0 m 40 m the deeper depths are next to the escarpments and shallow ones next to lake victoria analyzing the water table fluctuation over the years was done by clustering one time groundwater measurements a wells cluster was made of wells that are sufficiently close 0 5 km and taken in different years fig 7 cluster details are presented in table 2 although the water table measurements were taken in different years the difference within clusters is minimal and we assume them to represent average groundwater levels these levels are conservative values since the change in groundwater levels is controlled by other factors like abstraction and recharge analysis of annual variation was done based on monthly measurements taken in 2016 2017 at the nyando midlands the effect of rainfall on the shallow groundwater was done by comparing the daily levels with rainfall patterns a comparison of groundwater levels with the meteorological seasons in the water year for the nyando river basin jf dry mam wet jjas dry and ond wet was done for the monthly water table measurements the groundwater levels were also compared to both observed and chirps rainfall since lake victoria is a massive water whose levels within the year are not very variable it may affect the kano plains groundwater variability and due to this a comparison between the lake levels dahiti and the water table was made this analysis was not done on the bottom aquifer since a continuous time series does not exist 2 4 3 spatial groundwater variability a ground elevation water table level correlation analysis was done to determine whether topography influenced the spatial water table distribution linear interpolation was applied to all water table measurements to generate a water table map a similar approach was used for the deep aquifer but with the wrma dataset only a comparison between ground elevation and the potentiometric levels for all wells shows a strong correlation with topography there is no trend with borehole depth or their drilling date according to dhv 1988 the pleistocene layers are heterogeneous and comprised of different materials clayey silt silty sand and sandy gravel mudstones limestones sandstones in various sequences an aquitard between the layers does not exist causing the lack of significant vertical trends a ground elevation water table level correlation analysis was also done to determine whether the deep groundwater flow was also topography driven finally interpolating all the one time measurements in the deep aquifer produced a potentiometric map 2 4 4 hydrochemical analyses within the framework of a water supply program dhv 1988 analyzed the hydrogeochemical data focusing on the effect of drinking water quality in this study we have used this data to assess groundwater flow dynamics the hydrochemical data from shallow wells springs and boreholes were compared to establish connectivity a map of electrical conductivity ec for the shallow groundwater was generated from the spatially representative data 3 results and discussion 3 1 aquifer extents analysis of topographical and geological provided an understanding of the various spatial boundary conditions faults escarpments rivers lake victoria and shallow bedrock at the foot of the mau and tinderet mountains the kano plains extent is shown in fig 7 the lateral boundary to the north and south was selected to coincide with the fault lines at the foot of the escarpments since these are barriers to horizontal groundwater flow the boundary has been validated using fault locations measured from the high resolution geophysical survey data from dhv 1988 and occurs within the 1300 m contour line figs 4 and 7 this elevation was adopted for the rest of the plains in addition to defining a recharge boundary condition at the fault zones an impermeable boundary is also probable since the tertiary volcanics and the underlying precambrian granites here are impermeable even though fractures would be expected to occur in such an area with historical volcanic activity an approximately 8 km wide shallow bedrock runs from lake victoria to the foot of the mau and tinderet mountains elsewhere this bedrock was not detected at levels below 300 m the rivers flow in part on and across faults and river water may infiltrate into the groundwater system through them at the slopes of the mau complex and tinderet mountain the boundary coincides with the 1300 m contour line this eastern boundary can be impermeable because it is characterized by near surface tertiary volcanics dhv 1988 a constant head boundary lake victoria is expected to occur to the west the vertical boundaries of the hydrofacies are presented in the hydrogeological profile fig 9 across the kano plains from the nandi and kendu faults as the faulting and tilting continued during the pleistocene sections i and iii were uplifted while ii and iv were downthrown in general there is a shallow highly heterogeneous aquifer embedded within an indistinct aquitard there is an upper pleistocene followed by a lower pleistocene layer and both are notably deformed at the faults according to dhv 1988 they are highly heterogeneous and cannot be explicitly distinguished especially in the downthrown sections a distinct feature is the occurrence of the sandy gravelly lower pleistocene layer in section iii these are believed to be of lacustrine origin lake victoria was originally expansive and covered most of kano plains in the past causing the deposition of lake sediments when uplifting occurred these sediments were pushed upwards similar deposits are reported at deeper levels in the downthrown sections dhv 1988 geophysical data from muhoroni division show that at about 250 m below ground level sandy gravels and gravelly sands may occur as deposition continued the finer pleistocene sediments first filled the depressions in the downthrown sections and the deformation at the faults indicates that faulting continued throughout the period 3 2 aquifer properties ker et al 1980 reports the transmissivity in the pleistocene deposits to range from 60 100 m 2 d a y in the finer sediments the transmissivity is 30 m 2 d a y dhv 1988 highest borehole yields are reported in the nyando 816 m 3 d a y and muhoroni 430 m 3 d a y divisions these boreholes are situated in the north down thrown section dominated by sandy silty upper pleistocene layer 20 m 150 m followed by a sandy gravelly lower pleistocene layer the lowest borehole yields 100 m 3 d a y occur in the winam and nyakach divisions these occur close to lake victoria and the lacustrine deposits forming the pleistocene layers are dominated by sandy silts and silty sands based on the classification by freeze and cherry 1979 typical values of hydraulic conductivity for these pleistocene layers may vary from 10 10 10 2 m s ker et al 1980 estimate the range of storage coefficient from 5 10 5 5 10 5 the upper layer is from recent deposits and is similarly heterogeneous it comprises a discontinuous layer of colluvium talus scree and gravels next to the foot of the escarpments to sands silts and clays next to lake victoria the hydraulic conductivity ranges from 10 10 10 2 m s can be expected the well yields are lower than in the pleistocene layers and ranges from 24 120 m 3 d a y emphasizing that the top layer is less conductive 3 3 temporal groundwater variability generally the water table levels at the nyando wetland fig 10 are highest at the beginning and end of the year compared with the observed rainfall in 2011 fig 8a water table levels are lowest in the middle of the year in july and during this time the rainfall is also deficient apart from this the water table and the measured rainfall during the rest of 2011 do not correspond on the other hand the chirps rainfall fig 8b and the shallow water table variation follow lake victoria s typical rainfall trend that is reported by kizza et al 2011 lake victoria has a notable influence on the groundwater levels in the nyando wetland than does rainfall the daily time series for the nyando midlands fig 11 shows higher temporal variability with peaks at close intervals and narrow hydrographs there is an immediate increase in water table levels after a rainfall event in 4 rainy clusters fig 12 also the chirps rainfall used for this analysis may not always capture the actual rainfall the water table levels appear to respond strongly to rainfall observed in mbogo valley in the highlands however rainfall water table relations are complex since there is concurrent influence by other hydrological and hydrogeological aspects like permeability and evapotranspiration gaalen et al 2012 the monthly time series fig 11 is highly attenuated the water table levels are high in october followed by a steady decrease until february after which there is a water level increase with a major peak at the beginning of june like in the wetland water levels the trend is similar to the rainfall trend in a water year for the lake victoria basin the monthly time series show high water levels during the mam period in general 3 3 1 spatial groundwater variability 3 3 1 1 shallow water table the groundwater flow is topography driven and is towards lake victoria fig 13 the r2 value for ground elevation vs water elevation is 0 99 there is a groundwater divide a zone of high hydraulic heads where the groundwater contours face the downstream in the downstream sections of nyando and nyamasaria river basins at water levels up to 1160 m asl this is lacking in the upstream furthermore the water table and the surface water divides appear in the same zone over a short stretch within the 1148 1160 m hydraulic head zone dhv 1988 developed a similar flow regime where the highest levels occurred in the north east and the highest gradients at the nandi and kendu escarpments in most parts the rivers gain groundwater since water table contours point upstream when they intersect with rivers the faults at the floor of the kano plains may have a sealing effect in the shallow aquifer since there are no drastic changes in hydraulic gradients at their locations the aquifer is mainly silty with a few observations of sands and gravels occurring in the upstream most of the observed yields lie within 0 3000 l hour according to ascott et al 2019 well yields are affected by the aquifer s hydraulic properties pump intake depth and characteristics of the main inflow horizons in this unconfined aquifer the wells screened in aquifers with coarser materials have higher yields in general 3 3 1 2 potentiometric level the deep groundwater flow is also topography driven and generally flows towards lake victoria fig 14 a calculated r2 for ground elevation vs water level elevation is 0 97 the groundwater flows towards a low water pressure zone close to the lake victoria shores where there is a high density of boreholes also this zone is underlain by a dense fault network there could be a vertical flow of groundwater into the possibly fractured bedrock a groundwater divide occurs at water levels between 1115 1144 m the surface water divide appears to the left and the two do not coincide the faults that divide the kano plains into three longitudinal segments do not appear to affect the water flow since the hydraulic gradients here do not vary significantly the water contour orientation at the intersection with rivers does not indicate the connection of this aquifer with the river the yields are higher than those in the top aquifer with most reported values greater than 18000 l h the deeper aquifer has coarser materials in general 3 4 hydrochemistry the highest ec value 10 707 mmho cm is from shallow groundwater however the waters here are generally slightly saline since the reported values range is10 2110 mmho cm the high values occur close to lake victoria fig 5 before the nyando and nam thoe wetlands this finding is similar to ec maps from dhv 1988 that showed high ec values occurring in this region however the current analysis reveals compartmentalized high ec zones the shallow recent swamp clays in the swamps may impede cations and anions rich groundwater from discharging into lake victoria making the zone a sink for minerals the faults network in this zone divides the region into blocks and compartmentalized groundwater flow could occur a viable conclusion is that the groundwater here is not connected to lake victoria which according to mwirigi et al 2006 is non saline however seepage of the saline groundwater would have an insignificant effect than other freshwater inflows i e rainfall and rivers and would not change the lake s chemical properties measurement in ec for the deep groundwater is limited to kano plains northern and middle sections fig 5 the range of measured values is 200 2000 mmho cm the values fall within the same range as that of the overlying shallow groundwater since measurements are not available in the other regions it is impossible to assess whether compartmentalization also occurs it is therefore not possible to deduce connectivity between the two groundwater systems using ec the spring water is non saline since their ec values range from 23 1140 mmho cm and most of the measurements are below 300 mmho cm the springs are found at high altitudes outside of the kano plains and the groundwater recharge from rainfall may cause this dilution some statics for the other chemical data available are shown in table 3 the chlorides are also a measure of salinity and follow the same trend as the ec in the shallow groundwater the highest values are reported in the high ec zones in shallow groundwater apart from alkalinity hardness m n 2 which follows a similar trend the other parameters do not show any trend the highest alkalinity for the springs is observed in the east at the slopes of tinderet mountain and in the south in the nyabondo plateau high fluoride values are observed at the slopes of the tinderet mountain while high chloride observations are observed in the kendu escarpment there is no trend in the hardness levels while n h 4 a n d n o 3 are highest at the north to the west of the nandi escarpment the tinderet mountains and the kendu escarpments appear to be the primary sources of cations and anions in the kano plains the main rock types are basalts tuff and granites besides the water flows through sandstones alluvial sands silts and clays and these are rich in most naturally occurring minerals like iron manganese and carbonates limestones have also been reported in the pleistocene sediments in the northern part of nyakach and the high ec values are recorded here 3 5 groundwater abstraction and recharge the highest estimated groundwater recharge from rainfall is in the muhoroni division 101 m m y e a r attributed to higher rainfall and the recent coarse deposits the recharge for nyando winam and nyakach divisions is 24 0 a n d 25 m m y e a r dhv 1988 the area weighted average recharge for the entire kano plains is 33 m m y e a r 3 8 10 7 m 3 y e a r there is also recharge at kendu fault is estimated at 2 3 10 6 m 3 y e a r the estimate for the recharge at the nandi fault is not yet known based on the distribution of shallow wells a distributed abstraction scenario prevails in the top aquifer dhv 1988 estimates a total abstraction of 2 9 10 6 m 3 y e a r with the winam division being the most abstracted region taking 90 most boreholes are in muhoroni and nyakach divisions and the abstraction estimate from the deep aquifer is 2 6 10 5 m 3 y e a r current estimates can be calculated by using population forecasting and assuming a similar proportion of the population uses groundwater and multiply by 30 l the daily per capita consumption in rural africa 4 the hydrogeological conceptual model based on available data the hydrogeological conceptual model is proposed fig 15 it shows the highland and a lowland kano plains groundwater system separated at the base of the escarpments by faults which are barriers to groundwater flow the lowland system has an unconfined and semi confined aquifer the top is a heterogeneous discontinuous layer from recent deposits the aquifer materials here include alluvium river alluvium sand gravel stones colluvium and talus scree embedded within an aquitard the bottom aquifer is also heterogeneous and composed of upper and lower pleistocene layers with varying sequences of silty sand clayey sand sandy gravel gravel clayey silt mudstone limestone a shallow bedrock bound within faults runs along the kano plains dividing the aquifer system into three longitudinal segments the nyando river together with other small rivers flow from the highlands and cut through kano plains before draining into the nyando wetland and or into the lake victoria highlands groundwater that seeps through the fault zone is the primary source of recharge into the deep aquifer the unconfined aquifer is mainly rainfed 5 conclusions the physical and process conceptual structures have been evaluated for the nyando river basin several key aspects have been defined based on available geological hydrogeological hydrological hydrochemical and meteorological data 1 the nandi and kendu faults at the escarpments are the spatial boundary between the highlands and kano plains groundwater system and the two can be studied separately 2 since there is an indistinct groundwater divide between nyando and nyamasaria river basins in the lowlands it is advisable to include the entire kano plains when undertaking hydrogeological studies in the plains otherwise the characterization of the groundwater divide should be done 3 the groundwater in the kano plains is topography driven and the general flow is towards lake victoria on the contrary hydrochemical analysis shows that the groundwater may not be discharged into the lake the groundwater connectivity with lake victoria is therefore not definitive and further studies are needed 4 rainfall has a more significant influence on short term water table variability but a minimum effect in the long term as a result for regional scale studies a steady state flow state can be assumed since groundwater levels do not vary significantly over time however in studies that require quantification within small time steps a transient approach is appropriate since the groundwater levels at the nyando basin midlands levels show significant short term variability 5 the well yields in the bottom aquifer are higher due to the coarser pleistocene deposits and are dependent on the characteristics of the main inflow horizons the transmissivity ranges from 30 m 2 d a y in the fine sediments to 60 100 m 2 d a y in the coarse zones 6 the study contradicts the previous perception that the kano plains is overexploited since the groundwater recharge exceeds annual abstraction by order of magnitude authorship

8316,study region the nyando river basin in western kenya it is part of the lake victoria basin study focus as a first step towards numerical modeling complementary datasets from different periods have been used to develop a conceptual hydrogeological model for this geologically complex basin the study focused on characterizing the physical and process structures data from geological reports and geo electrical survey reports were used to establish aquifer extents timeline comparison and interpolation of groundwater levels and hydrochemical data analysis were used to define groundwater flow characteristics new hydrological insights for the region a highland and a kano plains groundwater system exist and are separated by the faults at the nandi and kendu escarpments the groundwater divide between nyando and nyamasaria rivers flowing through the kano plains is indistinct suggesting that their lowland groundwater system is the same kano plains has a shallow and deep groundwater system both occurring in highly heterogeneous and aquifers the bedrock here occurs at 250 m below ground level generally the groundwater flow is topography driven towards lake victoria but it is not clear whether it discharges here rainfall has minimal effect on long term groundwater variability because groundwater levels do not change significantly over time steady state groundwater flow occurs in the plains keywords data scarcity hydrochemistry conceptual model faults kano plains nyando basin 1 introduction the ever increasing importance of groundwater for human and ecological uses is a motivation to study groundwater systems and hydrogeologists use groundwater and more recently groundwater surface water gw sw interaction modeling this study forms the basis for a gw sw study of the nyando river basin besides its importance for agriculture and domestic water uses the river basin has interactive riverine lacustrine and wetland ecosystems khisa et al 2013 some past studies of the nyando river basin have focused on surface water hydrology aspects khisa et al 2013 have shown that the rainfall here is bimodal and generally follows the lake victoria basin s typical water year further there is a positive correlation between rainfall and river discharge rongoei et al 2013 state that basin hydrology is a significant driver of change for the nyando wetland which occurs near the river mouth at the winam gulf of lake victoria fig 1 water levels in the wetland are variable and may go up to 0 8 m above ground rongoei et al 2014 in the seasonally flooded areas the levels may go up to 0 2 m during the dry periods the water sources for the wetland include groundwater lake backflow during floods direct rainfall overland flow and inflow from rivers raburu et al 2012 indicating an extensive gw sw interaction from their study olang and fürst 2011 have reported significant deforestation at the river source which has reportedly caused a 30 increase in peak river flows in the upper reaches and 20 increase in the lower reaches of the nyando river the higher peaks are due to the relatively high bare land percentage upstream where the deforestation occurs kano plains is an expansive flat terrain in the eastern part of the kavirondo rift valley a failed arm of the eastern rift valley shackleton 1948 dwars heederik and verhey dhv 1988 it is sandwiched between the nandi and kendu escarpments in the lower reaches of the nyando river basin the nyamasaria river also flows through these plains and topographical and landuse data indicate a connection with the nyando river basin for example the miriu river fig 1 connects the okana ombeyi and nyando wetlands and the latter straddles both river basins some rivulets flow across the river basins at the nyando wetland further landuse analysis by khisa et al 2013 shows that the river nyando has been migrating southwards and at about 1950 it was flowing within the now nyamasaria river basin further evidence for the migration is provided by millman 1973 who has suggested that the nyando and nyamasaria rivers were once part of the same river sharing a common outflow at nam thoe swamp despite these most of the surface water hydrology and related studies have looked at the nyando as a separate system e g ongwenyi et al 1993 gathenya et al 2011 olang and fürst 2011 and taye et al 2011 in their integrated flood management for nyando river basin study ministry of water and irrigation mwi water resources management authority wrma and japan international cooperation agency jica 2009 studied both rivers together and were able to show that their floodwaters overlap they have described the middle reaches of the rivers as steep and occurring in narrow gorges while in the lower reaches this changes to very flat and wide river channels nyilitya et al 2020 undertook a hydrogeochemical study focusing on nitrogen contamination covering the entire kano plains the above studies show that surface water hydrology and related data like climate weather river flow land use land cover have been scientifically and extensively analyzed there has however been a minimum focus on the hydrogeological aspects according to knbs 2019 the population of the kano plains density here is moderate with an average of 550 persons km2 groundwater from springs shallow wells and boreholes is considered a safe and critical source for domestic water supply and accounts for about 40 of all water used in the area dhv 1988 proper groundwater management is therefore needed quite often hydrogeological models are tools that guide decision makers on safe groundwater abstraction thresholds developing a conceptual model is the first step when undertaking hydrogeological studies it includes developing i the conceptual physical structure i e the vertical and horizontal extents of the system the hydrostratigraphic units hsu including their extents and the compartmentalization of the groundwater and ii the conceptual process structure which includes characterization of the groundwater flow and time variant boundary conditions anderson et al 2015 enemark et al 2019 the process becomes challenging when requisite data is lacking and in geologically complex groundwater systems babad et al 2020 have explained that these are typical challenges in many groundwater studies and that creative and site specific approaches are needed to achieve reliable hydrogeological conceptual models as suggested by bredehoeft 2005 hydrogeologists can solve this problem by a collecting as much data as possible and b using complementary data collection techniques based on previous studies the conceptualization of complex and faulted hydrogeological systems with limited data requires complementary approaches that combine geophysical hydrogeochemical environmental and artificial tracers for example burghof et al 2018 developed a hydrogeological conceptual wetland model for a data scare kilombero valley in tanzania using a mixture of hydrogeological hydrochemical and tracer based assessment techniques girmay et al 2015 conceptualized the groundwater flow including delineation of recharge and discharge zones for the complex mekelle paleozoic mesozoic sedimentary outlier in northern ethiopia using environmental isotopes and dissolved ions walraevens et al 2015 used a detailed hydrochemical analysis approach and were able to infer the sources of salinity and contamination of the coastal quaternary aquifer in dar el salaam tanzania kebede et al 2008 determined the groundwater flow dynamics of a very complex ethiopian rift volcanic aquifers where these data are lacking hydrogeologists can also apply a simplification of groundwater conceptual models for example when modeling the influence of water abstractions on the water levels for the data scarce and hydrogeologically complex lake naivasha in kenya hogeboom et al 2015 simplified the conceptual model to a one layer system still they recommended using environmental isotopes and multi models approach as methods that would lead to a better understanding the nyando river basin has a highlands section at the river source and a lowland section at the kano plains fig 1 and there exists a recharge zone at the faults located at the escarpments dhv 1988 as a result researchers can study the highlands and lowland systems separately the current study focuses on the hydrogeology of the kano plains and the highlands groundwater flow has been taken as a recharge boundary at the faults the kano plains has fragmented datasets of geological hydrogeological sections hydrogeochemical and groundwater levels dhv 1988 through their geophysical surveys were able to define hydrofacies in the kano plains but the extent of the hsu s is still not known some feasible lateral extent boundaries like the impermeable rocks at the nandi and kendu escarpments fig 1 are apparent there are also faults on the floor of the kano plains dhv 1988 these should be used as groundwater flow boundaries with caution because according to bense et al 2003 rajabpour et al 2016 they can have a sealing effect or they can be barriers to horizontal groundwater flow the occurrence of a groundwater divide below the nyando nyamasaria river surface water divide is not documented such a divide would occur if the groundwater flow were topography driven but this is also unknown besides the groundwater divide location is affected by factors such as pumping grannemann et al 2000 and should be adequately characterized further groundwater divides for deep groundwater systems may occur away from surface water divides grannemann et al 2000 de smedt 2014 funkhouser 2014 from millman 1973 there is a deposition of detritus in the kano plains by the south flowing streams from the nandi escarpment this has caused a change in the ground elevation change and consequently the surface water divide the lake victoria nyando and nyamasaria rivers and the entire stream network fig 1 are other hydraulically controlled boundaries in the study area and researchers should quantify their effect on the groundwater flow these are expected to respond to hydraulic stresses anderson et al 2015 and should be analyzed for stability and conceptualized as either steady state or transient boundaries this study aims to develop a conceptual hydrogeological model of the kano plains by aggregating the existing and current fragmented datasets we have used remotely sensed products historical data from geological reports and geophysical investigation survey reports to characterize the topography geology and aquifers under the hydrological stresses we have used a combination of historical and recent groundwater level datasets the effect of rainfall patterns on the groundwater levels has also been assessed where a combination of remotely sensed and observed rainfall measurements has been used 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nyando river basin fig 1 is part of the eastern part of the lake victoria basin in western kenya the nyando and nyamasaria rivers flow through the low lying kano plains 1135 1300 m asl and experience floods annually the lake levels follow a decadal cyclic pattern and the average maximum and minimum for 40 years from 1970 by is 1135 2 1136 05 and 1134 17 m asl respectively okotto okotto et al 2018 due to the uncertainty regarding the groundwater divide s location and existence the study area includes the nyamasaria river basin 2 1 1 drainage network the elevation data fig 1 was obtained from the 30 m resolution advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem version 2 these data are distributed by the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac located at the u s geological survey usgs centre for earth resources observation and science eros http lpdaac usgs gov compared with the global positioning system benchmarks the aster gdem is 17 01 m and has a root mean square rms of 8 68 m the upper reaches of the nyando river occur at 75 109 km from the river mouth and with 1 45 slope the middle reaches at 45 75 km with a slope of 1 160 and the lower reaches to occur at 0 45 km with a slope of 1 700 1600 mwi et al 2009 the headwaters are in the highlands while the low lying kano plains dominate the downstream sections there is an altitude drop of about 500 m between the highlands and the plains the nyando river s confluence with the largest ainamutua river and the second largest tributary pararget river is in the middle reaches in the kano plains the nyando wetland is further downstream at the river mouth where smaller tributaries the awach kano nyaidho and asawo rivers join the river during flood events the nyando wetland and lake victoria become a single water body and the nyando river flows into the wetland after the floodwaters recede and during dry periods the river flows directly into lake victoria at the winam gulf mwi et al 2009 a network of rivulets flowing directly into the wetland also exist in addition to the nyando wetland the okana ombeyi and nam thoe wetlands occur nearby and according to khisa and unlenbrook 2011 they are connected from fig 1 the streams connect these wetlands because of this and the fact the floodwaters from all rivers overlap mwi et al 2009 there is a high likelihood of interactions within the wetland and surface water bodies in the kano plains the nyamasaria river flows through the kano plains into the nam thoe wetland before draining into lake victoria other rivers occurring in the nyamasaria river basin are the oroba ombeyi luanda and miriu rivers 2 1 2 geological setting a prominent geologic and topographic feature and the focus of this study is the kano plains it is of great hydrogeological importance and occurs towards the river mouth in the winam gulf of lake victoria it is in the eastern part of the kavirondo rift valley a failed arm of the east african rift valley it has been described in detail by shackleton 1948 and reported widely e g dhv 1988 though not definitive the formation is believed to have started with the peneplanation during the jurassic early cretaceous and the end of the paleogene the precambrian granites underlying the northwest of winam northeast of muhoroni and the southern part of nyakach divisions fig 2 are from this period formation of depressions started during a stage of crustal stretching and thinning in the lower miocene of the tertiary period and is believed to have resulted in the creation of a shallow basin and consequently shallow extensive lakes on the sub miocene surface it is not until the late pliocene to the early pleistocene when the major deformation i e faulting and uplifting occurred according to shackleton 1948 the uplifting was more pronounced near the border with the east african rift valley to the west of the tinderet mountains formed from volcanic eruptions during the lower miocene during this period the kavirondo rift valley floor remained level and lake victoria started in the depression resulting from uplifted edges of the east african rift valley and the western rift valley major fault lines i e the kendu and nandi fault also formed during this time forming the basis for deposition of pleistocene and recent sediments in the valley other major east west and north south faults cross within the floor of the kavirondo rift valley dhv 1988 and create a complex faulted sub surface precambrian granites in the nyabondo plateau south of the nyakach division are overlain by tertiary volcanics phonolites and phonolitic lavas associated with deposition on the peneplanes after the fissure eruptions arising as a result of movement along the fault lines other tertiary phonolites phonolitic lavas basaltic lavas and tuffs occur in the eastern part of the nyando and muhoroni divisions pleistocene sediments underlie most of the kano plains according to shackleton 1948 lake victoria occupied most of the kano plans in early times and most pleistocene deposits in the upper part of nyakach and northern and eastern arts of nyando divisions are of lacustrine origin for example large granitic gravel deposits within the kendu fault vicinity dhv 1988 are believed to originate from lake victoria s beach deposits during the pleistocene period these sediments are very thick and resulted from the deposition of eroded sediments from neighboring landmasses boreholes with varying depths e g 150 m in winam division and 250 m in nyando division have exposed a variable sequence of mudstone sandstone siltstone limestone gravel and claystone dhv 1988 the deposition took place mainly during the pluvial periods which alternated with phases of inter pluvial periods faulting continued throughout the pleistocene period largely affecting the stratigraphy some recent deposits covering the pleistocene deposits include alluvial fans at the foot of the escarpments and constitute a significant occurrence in the muhoroni division other recent deposits i e alluvial flats and alluvial clays are either of fluvial or lacustrine origin dhv 1988 after the end of the pleistocene period lake victoria occupied a large part of the eastern kavirondo rift valley leading to the lake alluvium deposition after the lake receded deposition of rivers alluvium occurred as rivers meandered across the old lake bottom black cotton soils are the most common in the kano plains however the phonolites and granites have a thin lateritic ironstone capping and white to grey kaolinites respectively table 1 summarizes the stratigraphy of the kano plains 2 1 3 rainfall the nyando river basin has a general sub humid climate with semi arid characteristics at the nyando wetland taye et al 2011 raburu et al 2012 the inter tropical convergence zone ictz controls the bi modal annual rainfall patterns with long rains occurring in march may mam the occurrence of the short rains is not definitive some studies have reported the months of october december ond while it is september november son in others raburu et al 2012 khisa et al 2013 moreover in the eastern highlands of the catchment i e the tinderet mountain and the mau escarpments a subdued peak occurs in july september jas months khisa et al 2013 the small jas peak is a characteristic of the lake victoria basin and has also been reported elsewhere e g in the nzoia river basin kizza et al 2011 the most significant rainfall events e g the widely reported uhuru floods of 1961 1964 have been associated with large scale climate systems e g the el nino southern oscillation enso and the indian ocean dipole iod mugume et al 2016 there is a strong correlation between rainfall and altitude raburu et al 2012 the highlands annual average rainfall is 1700 1800 mm while it is 600 1100 mm in the plains 2 2 methodological flow chart this study brings together several fragmented datasets to generate a hydrogeological conceptual model of the kano plains fig 3 below gives a summary of the available datasets and their application 2 3 datasets 2 3 1 geological maps topographical maps and dem major geological features major faults and global stratigraphy are found in geological reports for the study area binge 1962 huddleston 1952 jennings 1964 1971 walsh 1969 and williams 1991 from the department of mines and geology of kenya the elevation data are from the remotely sensed dem http lpdaac usgs gov and topographical maps available at the survey of kenya 2 3 2 hydrogeological sections hand drilling survey data geochemical data and groundwater levels dhv 1988 higher resolution subsurface geology of the low lying kano plains was obtained from historical hydrogeological sections generated from geoelectrical reports for kisumu district from the water resources survey and survey training program under the rural water supply and sanitation program for the nyanza province dhv 1988 this geological survey was done from 1982 to 1987 within the four administrative divisions fig 4 yielding four datasets for winam nyando muhoroni and nyakach divisions dhv 1988 the result was a dataset of vertical extents of aquifers and the fault locations the groundwater sources of the kano plains include a shallow wells screened in the unconfined aquifer in the recent deposits b boreholes screened in the deep aquifer in the pleistocene sediments and c springs during the dhv 1988 study an inventory of every groundwater point in kano plains fig 7 was taken from 1986 to 1987 and one time water table level measurements are available some hydrochemical data were also collected during this time electrical conductivity ec and ph are available in 663 wells 121 springs and 19 boreholes other hydrochemical parameters alkalinity hardness as caco3 cations f e 2 m n 2 n h 4 a n d a n i o n s c l f a n d n o 3 are available in 114 shallow wells 32 springs and 13 boreholes fig 5 further one time water table measurements and well yields were collected during a hand drilling survey from 1982 to 1987 fig 7 a typical hydrogeological cross section from the kendu escarpments to the nyando wetland fig 6 indicates that there are highlands and a kano plains groundwater system separated by a fault zone that acts as a barrier to horizontal groundwater flow and thus channeling the water vertically into the deep aquifer in the kano plains the north tabriz fault in iran exhibits similar behavior rajabpour et al 2016 although dhv 1988 reports an aquitard separating the top and bottom aquifers in nyakach division hydrogeological sections from elsewhere in the kano plains depict a highly heterogeneous aquifer composed of silts and clays followed by the pleistocene aquifers the latter is similarly heterogeneous and is a conglomerate of pleistocene sandstones siltstones limestones gravels and clay stones a shallow water table exists in the top aquifer and semiconfined conditions in the bottom aquifer the top aquifer is recharged by rainfall while the bottom is mainly recharged by highlands groundwater at the fault zones and to a small extent by vertical groundwater flow from the leaky top aquifer dhv 1988 2 3 3 groundwater levels wrma ecolive project and 2016 2018 data campaign there are historical hourly water table measurements from the nyando wetland taken in 2010 2012 within the framework of the ecolive project van dam et al 2011 at points l01 l02 l03 l04 and r04 fig 7 further one hour automatic measurements were taken within the framework of this study in well s4 fig 7 from 2016 to 2017 using 10 meter td and cera divers van essen instruments in delft netherlands onetime water table measurements were also taken in the framework of this study in wells s1 s8 and monthly measurements in wells s1 s2 s4 s5 and s7 fig 7 for the deep aquifer continuous measurements of the groundwater levels do not exist however one time measurements are taken during borehole completion and stored by the water resources management authority wrma of kenya and contain the depth to aquifers the thickness of yielding aquifers phreatic level potentiometric levels and well yield fig 14 shows the distribution of the boreholes in kano plains 2 3 4 lake water levels the lake levels were obtained from the database for hydrological time series over inland water dahiti schwatke et al 2015 schwatke et al 2015 assessed the accuracy of the data for south and north america and reported a root mean square error rmse value of 4 36 cm 2 3 5 rainfall kmd ecolive project and chirps observed daily rainfall for the nyando river basin is available for select stations ahero irrigation and koru bible college from 1980 date there are also daily rainfall observations at three stations done in the 2011 2014 period fig 8 a at three stations 1 average of the wetland stations p1 to p7 located next to lake victoria at the nyando wetland 2 ahero irrigation p9 at the kano plains and 3 mbogo valley p11 at the western slopes of the mau complex these rainfall stations are shown in fig 1 however a long term continuous observed daily rainfall dataset for the nyando highlands does not exist this data is crucial since surface water seeps through the faults into the kano plains groundwater system the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps rainfall funk et al 2014 was used to estimate daily highlands rainfall and in part to complement the available daily rainfall from dinku et al 2018 a correlation coefficient cc for chirps rainfall data with ground observations is 0 65 for 10 day rainfall and 0 83 for monthly rainfall and the bias is 1 10 and 1 13 respectively for kenya funk et al 2015 and cattani et al 2018 have shown that chirps rainfall performs well when used for trend analysis and is therefore adequate for our intended use the monthly rainfall in 2011 and observed and chirps for the nyando river basin are shown in fig 8 apart from march and august the trends are similar for observed and chirps rainfall products there is a difference in the chirps rainfall quantities for 2011 and 2017 but the annual trends are identical and follow the typical patterns for the october september meteorological year for the upper nile basin chirps rainfall is estimated using an algorithm that utilizes rainfall estimates from satellite data and averages of ground observations dinku et al 2018 further the resolution of chirps rainfall is 0 05 while ground observations are taken at a point these are some of the causes of the considerable difference in the ground observations and chiprs rainfalls fig 8 2 4 methods 2 4 1 aquifer extents the location of the escarpments at the nandi and kendu fault zone was determined from a slope map calculated from the dem as the zone with the highest slope within the 1300 m contour line the major faults at the escarpments act as barriers to horizontal groundwater flow and are a suitable horizontal boundary their location was extracted from the geological reports other faults occurring in the kano plains in the kavirondo valley were obtained from both the dhv and geological reports further fault locations from the dhv reports were used for validation the vertical aquifer extents were extracted from the high resolution hydrogeological sections and hand drilling surveys by dhv 1988 a major limitation is the lack of detailed geophysical data for the highlands and thus the hydrogeological characterization was limited to the kano plains a transverse hydrogeological cross section of the entire kano plains was developed by joining the short hydrogeological sections location of hydraulic groundwater flow boundaries e g rivers nyando and nyamasaria and the other small rivers and the lake victoria were extracted from the topographical maps 2 4 2 temporal groundwater variability to assess the long term variation of the shallow groundwater tables all available measurements from the hand drilling survey 1982 1987 groundwater inventory survey 1986 1987 and recent datasets from 2010 2012 current data campaigns 2016 2018 were used only depth to groundwater is available and the water table level was calculated as ground elevation m depth to the water table m according to dhv 1988 the shallow water table occurs within the recent deposits with an average thickness range of 0 m 40 m the deeper depths are next to the escarpments and shallow ones next to lake victoria analyzing the water table fluctuation over the years was done by clustering one time groundwater measurements a wells cluster was made of wells that are sufficiently close 0 5 km and taken in different years fig 7 cluster details are presented in table 2 although the water table measurements were taken in different years the difference within clusters is minimal and we assume them to represent average groundwater levels these levels are conservative values since the change in groundwater levels is controlled by other factors like abstraction and recharge analysis of annual variation was done based on monthly measurements taken in 2016 2017 at the nyando midlands the effect of rainfall on the shallow groundwater was done by comparing the daily levels with rainfall patterns a comparison of groundwater levels with the meteorological seasons in the water year for the nyando river basin jf dry mam wet jjas dry and ond wet was done for the monthly water table measurements the groundwater levels were also compared to both observed and chirps rainfall since lake victoria is a massive water whose levels within the year are not very variable it may affect the kano plains groundwater variability and due to this a comparison between the lake levels dahiti and the water table was made this analysis was not done on the bottom aquifer since a continuous time series does not exist 2 4 3 spatial groundwater variability a ground elevation water table level correlation analysis was done to determine whether topography influenced the spatial water table distribution linear interpolation was applied to all water table measurements to generate a water table map a similar approach was used for the deep aquifer but with the wrma dataset only a comparison between ground elevation and the potentiometric levels for all wells shows a strong correlation with topography there is no trend with borehole depth or their drilling date according to dhv 1988 the pleistocene layers are heterogeneous and comprised of different materials clayey silt silty sand and sandy gravel mudstones limestones sandstones in various sequences an aquitard between the layers does not exist causing the lack of significant vertical trends a ground elevation water table level correlation analysis was also done to determine whether the deep groundwater flow was also topography driven finally interpolating all the one time measurements in the deep aquifer produced a potentiometric map 2 4 4 hydrochemical analyses within the framework of a water supply program dhv 1988 analyzed the hydrogeochemical data focusing on the effect of drinking water quality in this study we have used this data to assess groundwater flow dynamics the hydrochemical data from shallow wells springs and boreholes were compared to establish connectivity a map of electrical conductivity ec for the shallow groundwater was generated from the spatially representative data 3 results and discussion 3 1 aquifer extents analysis of topographical and geological provided an understanding of the various spatial boundary conditions faults escarpments rivers lake victoria and shallow bedrock at the foot of the mau and tinderet mountains the kano plains extent is shown in fig 7 the lateral boundary to the north and south was selected to coincide with the fault lines at the foot of the escarpments since these are barriers to horizontal groundwater flow the boundary has been validated using fault locations measured from the high resolution geophysical survey data from dhv 1988 and occurs within the 1300 m contour line figs 4 and 7 this elevation was adopted for the rest of the plains in addition to defining a recharge boundary condition at the fault zones an impermeable boundary is also probable since the tertiary volcanics and the underlying precambrian granites here are impermeable even though fractures would be expected to occur in such an area with historical volcanic activity an approximately 8 km wide shallow bedrock runs from lake victoria to the foot of the mau and tinderet mountains elsewhere this bedrock was not detected at levels below 300 m the rivers flow in part on and across faults and river water may infiltrate into the groundwater system through them at the slopes of the mau complex and tinderet mountain the boundary coincides with the 1300 m contour line this eastern boundary can be impermeable because it is characterized by near surface tertiary volcanics dhv 1988 a constant head boundary lake victoria is expected to occur to the west the vertical boundaries of the hydrofacies are presented in the hydrogeological profile fig 9 across the kano plains from the nandi and kendu faults as the faulting and tilting continued during the pleistocene sections i and iii were uplifted while ii and iv were downthrown in general there is a shallow highly heterogeneous aquifer embedded within an indistinct aquitard there is an upper pleistocene followed by a lower pleistocene layer and both are notably deformed at the faults according to dhv 1988 they are highly heterogeneous and cannot be explicitly distinguished especially in the downthrown sections a distinct feature is the occurrence of the sandy gravelly lower pleistocene layer in section iii these are believed to be of lacustrine origin lake victoria was originally expansive and covered most of kano plains in the past causing the deposition of lake sediments when uplifting occurred these sediments were pushed upwards similar deposits are reported at deeper levels in the downthrown sections dhv 1988 geophysical data from muhoroni division show that at about 250 m below ground level sandy gravels and gravelly sands may occur as deposition continued the finer pleistocene sediments first filled the depressions in the downthrown sections and the deformation at the faults indicates that faulting continued throughout the period 3 2 aquifer properties ker et al 1980 reports the transmissivity in the pleistocene deposits to range from 60 100 m 2 d a y in the finer sediments the transmissivity is 30 m 2 d a y dhv 1988 highest borehole yields are reported in the nyando 816 m 3 d a y and muhoroni 430 m 3 d a y divisions these boreholes are situated in the north down thrown section dominated by sandy silty upper pleistocene layer 20 m 150 m followed by a sandy gravelly lower pleistocene layer the lowest borehole yields 100 m 3 d a y occur in the winam and nyakach divisions these occur close to lake victoria and the lacustrine deposits forming the pleistocene layers are dominated by sandy silts and silty sands based on the classification by freeze and cherry 1979 typical values of hydraulic conductivity for these pleistocene layers may vary from 10 10 10 2 m s ker et al 1980 estimate the range of storage coefficient from 5 10 5 5 10 5 the upper layer is from recent deposits and is similarly heterogeneous it comprises a discontinuous layer of colluvium talus scree and gravels next to the foot of the escarpments to sands silts and clays next to lake victoria the hydraulic conductivity ranges from 10 10 10 2 m s can be expected the well yields are lower than in the pleistocene layers and ranges from 24 120 m 3 d a y emphasizing that the top layer is less conductive 3 3 temporal groundwater variability generally the water table levels at the nyando wetland fig 10 are highest at the beginning and end of the year compared with the observed rainfall in 2011 fig 8a water table levels are lowest in the middle of the year in july and during this time the rainfall is also deficient apart from this the water table and the measured rainfall during the rest of 2011 do not correspond on the other hand the chirps rainfall fig 8b and the shallow water table variation follow lake victoria s typical rainfall trend that is reported by kizza et al 2011 lake victoria has a notable influence on the groundwater levels in the nyando wetland than does rainfall the daily time series for the nyando midlands fig 11 shows higher temporal variability with peaks at close intervals and narrow hydrographs there is an immediate increase in water table levels after a rainfall event in 4 rainy clusters fig 12 also the chirps rainfall used for this analysis may not always capture the actual rainfall the water table levels appear to respond strongly to rainfall observed in mbogo valley in the highlands however rainfall water table relations are complex since there is concurrent influence by other hydrological and hydrogeological aspects like permeability and evapotranspiration gaalen et al 2012 the monthly time series fig 11 is highly attenuated the water table levels are high in october followed by a steady decrease until february after which there is a water level increase with a major peak at the beginning of june like in the wetland water levels the trend is similar to the rainfall trend in a water year for the lake victoria basin the monthly time series show high water levels during the mam period in general 3 3 1 spatial groundwater variability 3 3 1 1 shallow water table the groundwater flow is topography driven and is towards lake victoria fig 13 the r2 value for ground elevation vs water elevation is 0 99 there is a groundwater divide a zone of high hydraulic heads where the groundwater contours face the downstream in the downstream sections of nyando and nyamasaria river basins at water levels up to 1160 m asl this is lacking in the upstream furthermore the water table and the surface water divides appear in the same zone over a short stretch within the 1148 1160 m hydraulic head zone dhv 1988 developed a similar flow regime where the highest levels occurred in the north east and the highest gradients at the nandi and kendu escarpments in most parts the rivers gain groundwater since water table contours point upstream when they intersect with rivers the faults at the floor of the kano plains may have a sealing effect in the shallow aquifer since there are no drastic changes in hydraulic gradients at their locations the aquifer is mainly silty with a few observations of sands and gravels occurring in the upstream most of the observed yields lie within 0 3000 l hour according to ascott et al 2019 well yields are affected by the aquifer s hydraulic properties pump intake depth and characteristics of the main inflow horizons in this unconfined aquifer the wells screened in aquifers with coarser materials have higher yields in general 3 3 1 2 potentiometric level the deep groundwater flow is also topography driven and generally flows towards lake victoria fig 14 a calculated r2 for ground elevation vs water level elevation is 0 97 the groundwater flows towards a low water pressure zone close to the lake victoria shores where there is a high density of boreholes also this zone is underlain by a dense fault network there could be a vertical flow of groundwater into the possibly fractured bedrock a groundwater divide occurs at water levels between 1115 1144 m the surface water divide appears to the left and the two do not coincide the faults that divide the kano plains into three longitudinal segments do not appear to affect the water flow since the hydraulic gradients here do not vary significantly the water contour orientation at the intersection with rivers does not indicate the connection of this aquifer with the river the yields are higher than those in the top aquifer with most reported values greater than 18000 l h the deeper aquifer has coarser materials in general 3 4 hydrochemistry the highest ec value 10 707 mmho cm is from shallow groundwater however the waters here are generally slightly saline since the reported values range is10 2110 mmho cm the high values occur close to lake victoria fig 5 before the nyando and nam thoe wetlands this finding is similar to ec maps from dhv 1988 that showed high ec values occurring in this region however the current analysis reveals compartmentalized high ec zones the shallow recent swamp clays in the swamps may impede cations and anions rich groundwater from discharging into lake victoria making the zone a sink for minerals the faults network in this zone divides the region into blocks and compartmentalized groundwater flow could occur a viable conclusion is that the groundwater here is not connected to lake victoria which according to mwirigi et al 2006 is non saline however seepage of the saline groundwater would have an insignificant effect than other freshwater inflows i e rainfall and rivers and would not change the lake s chemical properties measurement in ec for the deep groundwater is limited to kano plains northern and middle sections fig 5 the range of measured values is 200 2000 mmho cm the values fall within the same range as that of the overlying shallow groundwater since measurements are not available in the other regions it is impossible to assess whether compartmentalization also occurs it is therefore not possible to deduce connectivity between the two groundwater systems using ec the spring water is non saline since their ec values range from 23 1140 mmho cm and most of the measurements are below 300 mmho cm the springs are found at high altitudes outside of the kano plains and the groundwater recharge from rainfall may cause this dilution some statics for the other chemical data available are shown in table 3 the chlorides are also a measure of salinity and follow the same trend as the ec in the shallow groundwater the highest values are reported in the high ec zones in shallow groundwater apart from alkalinity hardness m n 2 which follows a similar trend the other parameters do not show any trend the highest alkalinity for the springs is observed in the east at the slopes of tinderet mountain and in the south in the nyabondo plateau high fluoride values are observed at the slopes of the tinderet mountain while high chloride observations are observed in the kendu escarpment there is no trend in the hardness levels while n h 4 a n d n o 3 are highest at the north to the west of the nandi escarpment the tinderet mountains and the kendu escarpments appear to be the primary sources of cations and anions in the kano plains the main rock types are basalts tuff and granites besides the water flows through sandstones alluvial sands silts and clays and these are rich in most naturally occurring minerals like iron manganese and carbonates limestones have also been reported in the pleistocene sediments in the northern part of nyakach and the high ec values are recorded here 3 5 groundwater abstraction and recharge the highest estimated groundwater recharge from rainfall is in the muhoroni division 101 m m y e a r attributed to higher rainfall and the recent coarse deposits the recharge for nyando winam and nyakach divisions is 24 0 a n d 25 m m y e a r dhv 1988 the area weighted average recharge for the entire kano plains is 33 m m y e a r 3 8 10 7 m 3 y e a r there is also recharge at kendu fault is estimated at 2 3 10 6 m 3 y e a r the estimate for the recharge at the nandi fault is not yet known based on the distribution of shallow wells a distributed abstraction scenario prevails in the top aquifer dhv 1988 estimates a total abstraction of 2 9 10 6 m 3 y e a r with the winam division being the most abstracted region taking 90 most boreholes are in muhoroni and nyakach divisions and the abstraction estimate from the deep aquifer is 2 6 10 5 m 3 y e a r current estimates can be calculated by using population forecasting and assuming a similar proportion of the population uses groundwater and multiply by 30 l the daily per capita consumption in rural africa 4 the hydrogeological conceptual model based on available data the hydrogeological conceptual model is proposed fig 15 it shows the highland and a lowland kano plains groundwater system separated at the base of the escarpments by faults which are barriers to groundwater flow the lowland system has an unconfined and semi confined aquifer the top is a heterogeneous discontinuous layer from recent deposits the aquifer materials here include alluvium river alluvium sand gravel stones colluvium and talus scree embedded within an aquitard the bottom aquifer is also heterogeneous and composed of upper and lower pleistocene layers with varying sequences of silty sand clayey sand sandy gravel gravel clayey silt mudstone limestone a shallow bedrock bound within faults runs along the kano plains dividing the aquifer system into three longitudinal segments the nyando river together with other small rivers flow from the highlands and cut through kano plains before draining into the nyando wetland and or into the lake victoria highlands groundwater that seeps through the fault zone is the primary source of recharge into the deep aquifer the unconfined aquifer is mainly rainfed 5 conclusions the physical and process conceptual structures have been evaluated for the nyando river basin several key aspects have been defined based on available geological hydrogeological hydrological hydrochemical and meteorological data 1 the nandi and kendu faults at the escarpments are the spatial boundary between the highlands and kano plains groundwater system and the two can be studied separately 2 since there is an indistinct groundwater divide between nyando and nyamasaria river basins in the lowlands it is advisable to include the entire kano plains when undertaking hydrogeological studies in the plains otherwise the characterization of the groundwater divide should be done 3 the groundwater in the kano plains is topography driven and the general flow is towards lake victoria on the contrary hydrochemical analysis shows that the groundwater may not be discharged into the lake the groundwater connectivity with lake victoria is therefore not definitive and further studies are needed 4 rainfall has a more significant influence on short term water table variability but a minimum effect in the long term as a result for regional scale studies a steady state flow state can be assumed since groundwater levels do not vary significantly over time however in studies that require quantification within small time steps a transient approach is appropriate since the groundwater levels at the nyando basin midlands levels show significant short term variability 5 the well yields in the bottom aquifer are higher due to the coarser pleistocene deposits and are dependent on the characteristics of the main inflow horizons the transmissivity ranges from 30 m 2 d a y in the fine sediments to 60 100 m 2 d a y in the coarse zones 6 the study contradicts the previous perception that the kano plains is overexploited since the groundwater recharge exceeds annual abstraction by order of magnitude authorship

8317,1 study region the unconfined wairau aquifer in the marlborough district of new zealand is almost exclusively recharged by the wairau river and serves as the major resource for drinking water and irrigation in the region a declining trend in aquifer levels and low land spring flows has been observed for the past decades 2 study focus the aim of this study is to identify and analyse natural and anthropogenic factors controlling the hydrological regime of the wairau aquifer concurrent trends in the long term water balance components for the wairau catchment and in low flow statistics as well as the correlation between hydro meteorological drivers and the interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo index were investigated the impact of river morphology changes on river recharge rates was studied using a previously developed groundwater flow model 3 new hydrological insights for the region our study found that long term trends in declining catchment scale precipitation are superimposed on climate oscillation and a strong annual variability jointly these processes have resulted in lower than average river flows increased low flow periods and consequently in lower rates of aquifer recharge river engineering caused erosion of the braided river morphology leading to a possibly permanent loss of aquifer storage groundwater abstraction is not accurately known which is a limitation of this study this additional information and adaptation strategies are required for sustainable management of the groundwater resources keywords groundwater modelling river groundwater interactions climate change groundwater management river erosion hydrological regime change 1 introduction the demand on water resources for food production drinking water supply and energy generation as well as for industrial processes is increasing worldwide many aquifer systems in new zealand have already reached their sustainable yield limits nzier 2014 mfe 2017a any additional pressure on these systems such as changes in the hydrological regime can trigger the need to restrict the use of the available water resources with potential major economic consequences to stakeholders natural as well as human induced shifts in hydro climatic conditions are the major contributor for changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources e g stagl and hattermann 2015 pumo et al 2016 yu et al 2018 pichura et al 2020 other anthropogenic factors that can lead to a long term change in the hydrological regime of river aquifer systems are river training for flood protection land use changes water storage and diversion hydroelectric power generation water abstraction for irrigation and sediment management the contributing factors for changes in the hydrological regime are often manifold and difficult to identify but disentangling these factors is important for water resources management to i make predictions of future states of the hydrological system ii to identify factors that can be controlled to mitigate adverse impacts of hydrological change and iii to quantify the mitigation potential for different management scenarios consequently research on factors influencing the hydrological regime of river systems increasingly attracts the attention of scientific investigations according to the web of science database over 1000 scientific papers have dealt with the topic hydrologic al regime in the past five years as of dec 2019 with 145 articles bearing the keyword in the title a large proportion of the studies investigated the reasons for changes in the hydrological regime of rivers a majority analysed climate change impacts often using a combination of global climate model projections local downscaling and hydrological modelling e g von gunten et al 2016v kour et al 2016 another factor is the impact of large scale landuse changes such as deforestation zhang et al 2017 river management particularly the construction of reservoirs has a significant impact on the hydrological regime of river systems song et al 2018 wang et al 2018 other studies investigated the impact of hydrological change e g the impact on the vegetation of floodplains kwak et al 2017 sediment transport pfeiffer and finnegan 2018 water quality du et al 2018 biodiversity rolls et al 2018 and others the rather elaborate investigation of the reasons for hydrological change with hydrological system models is typically preceded by a statistical analysis of hydrometerological data to detect trends or break points in the time series a summary of the most commonly used statistical methods can be found in khaliq et al 2009 this study investigates the hydrological regime of the braided wairau river in new zealand and the unconfined wairau aquifer which is primarily recharged by river water it is motivated by an observed decrease of groundwater levels and spring flows during the past decades these trends are of concern for the marlborough district council mdc who manages the water resources and aims to protect the flow of groundwater fed springs the mdc initiated several investigations to understand the reasons of the observed trends the analysis of tritium δ18o radon and temperature in river water and groundwater showed that the unconfined wairau aquifer consists of relatively young water that originates from the wairau river stewart 2008 close 2014 morgenstern et al 2019 but the processes and controls of the interaction between the river and the aquifer were still poorly understood consequently the mdc extended its monitoring network based on the additional information wilson and wöhling 2015 found that the wairau river is potentially perched above the regional water table in the recharge sector another key finding was that the hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer are relatively complex and the unconfined aquifer appears to be highly stratified the structure of the aquifer was reviewed by wilson 2016 and the resulting hydrogeological model was incorporated in a detailed surface water groundwater flow model developed by wöhling et al 2018 the main purpose of the numerical model modflow was to better understand the river recharge mechanisms it integrates multiple data types as well as hard and soft data and reproduces the data well computed groundwater age distributions of spring flows mean age 1 year are also consistent with independent measurements the study revealed that net exchange flows are positive during all flow conditions i e recharging the aquifer and vary within a narrow band of approximately 5 12 m³ s most of the time recharge rates drop exponentially during base flow conditions when the active channel area is reduced while the model provided new insights into the mechanisms of river groundwater exchange it was not specifically targeted at finding the reasons for the observed trends in groundwater levels and spring flows this study attempts to address this knowledge gap by identifying dominant natural and anthropogenic factors controlling the hydrological regime of the wairau river and the unconfined wairau aquifer these factors are most likely not unique to the wairau river catchment since other mainly east coast rivers of new zealand exhibit a similar hydrology and morphology seasonal changes in the groundwater resource are best considered in terms of available storage components most of the water storage within the aquifer is made of a permanently saturated zone which is not discharged on an annual basis although this water provides the vital function of preserving the aquifer in a heathy state so that environmental flows the natural outputs of the groundwater system are sustained in contrast the live or dynamic storage is the upper part of the aquifer which experiences seasonal fluctuations of the water table due to lower recharge during the summer months the controls to maintain environmental flows within acceptable limits are the management of groundwater abstraction by pumping and of dynamic storage levels a range of natural and anthropogenic factors that potentially can cause the observed trends are listed in fig 1 they can be grouped by decreasing river and or land surface recharge rates increasing groundwater abstraction and increasing aquifer drainage rates particular emphasis is placed on the various factors leading to decreased river recharge as the unconfined wairau plain aquifer is mainly recharged by wairau river water wöhling et al 2018 this is a characteristic common to many braided rivers in new zealand e g dravid and brown 1997 white et al 2001 larned et al 2008 rupp et al 2008 white et al 2012 unique to this study is the combination of a comprehensive targeted monitoring program with a detailed numerical process model for a hypothesis driven analysis of potential factors responsible for hydrological change in the coupled surface water groundwater system the study is a major extension of earlier work published by wöhling 2019 in german results yield insights into the controlling factors and potential management options to mitigate the impact of current and future hydrological change in new zealand s braided river systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area at about 170 km length the wairau river is the largest river in marlborough and ranks 16th by length of all new zealand rivers it originates in the pristine spenser mountains at an altitude of above 2000 m a s l follows the southern boundary of the red hill and richmond ranges in a mainly eastward direction and then flows along the northern boundary of the wairau plain approximately 27 km before meeting the pacific ocean at cloudy bay fig 2 the total area of the wairau river catchment is 3430 km² mean annual precipitation p varies significantly with 650 mm a near the coast and more than 2500 mm a in the mountains to the west and north the runoff regime is very dynamic with a mean flow of 100 m³ s a median flow of 60 m³ s and annual mean peak flow of 1950 m³ s river flows are gauged at barnetts bank fig 2 a site slightly upstream of the old gauging station at the state highway 1 bridge both locations are not affected by tidal effects in the western part of the wairau plain the river is perched up to several meters above the regional groundwater table and river water is percolating through the braided gravel bed into the underlying wairau aquifer wilson and wöhling 2015 the extremely high conductive gravels of the rapaura gravels are 20 30 m thick are mostly unconfined and become confined in the east by a wedge of fine textured marine sediments of the dillons point formation consequently groundwater is re emerging as low land springs at the land surface boundary along the edge of the confining unit and the wairau river also becomes hydraulically connected to the local water table as the confining sediments are approached the aquifer becomes increasingly artesian towards the coast in response to the thickening of the dillons point formation confining sediments underneath the holocene gravels of the rapaura formation lies the speargrass formation which is orders of magnitude less permeable and thus considered to be a confining unit for more details of the geology of the wairau plain please refer to brown 1981 raiber et al 2012 and wilson 2016 several synoptic differential gauging campaigns have been conducted since the 1970s at various sections of the wairau river along the wairau plain due to the difficulties of gauging flow in braided rivers the campaigns were conducted mainly at low flow conditions when the river was confined mainly to a single braid the gaugings revealed a consistent net loss of about 7 8 m³ s to the wairau aquifer c f fig 2 in wöhling et al 2018 much of the recharge is re emerging at the low land springs and as return flow to the river as the aquifer becomes confined by the holocene marine sediments of the dillons point formation towards the coast the largest spring is spring creek with an annual average flow of 4 m³ s at the gauging site fig 2 the wairau plain aquifer hosts groundwater resources that are of regional importance for the blenheim region since all municipal water supplies are sourced from groundwater and groundwater is also used to irrigate marlborough s vineyards new zealand s largest wine growing region the water resources are managed by the marlborough district council mdc who maintains a comprehensive hydrological monitoring program that includes real time observations of groundwater levels on the plain as well as stage flow gauging at the wairau river some of its tributaries and springs including spring creek two key groundwater monitoring sites are the wells p3009 at wratts road and well p3821 at conders fig 2 the proposed marlborough environment plan mep 2016 includes restrictions on groundwater abstractors in most aquifer management sectors when groundwater levels fall below a certain elevation in these wells fig 3 a and 3b show the observed groundwater levels for well p3009 1996 2017 and for well p3821 2002 2016 linear regression indicates a decreasing trend in both wells the trend appears to be stronger at the upper western part of the wairau plain well p3821 despite a shorter record compared to the eastern part well p3009 where the groundwater is closer to the surface the seasonal interannual variance is large for both of the key wells and also other monitoring wells on the wairau plain this could mask the trends to some degree but statistical tests do confirm the trend to be significant mann kendall test h 1 p 0 similar observations could be made for spring creek flows fig 3d which are closely related to upgradient groundwater levels on the other hand there is a much lower not significant trend in groundwater levels in the confined aquifer exemplarily depicted for the well p1733 fig 3c at the wairau bar fig 2 this demonstrates that the spring flows are predominantly influenced by the trends in the unconfined aquifer while the confined aquifer remains largely unchanged the mdc has initiated several investigations to identify the reasons for the trends in the unconfined aquifer levels and spring flows and to develop solutions for sustainable management of the aquifer 2 2 surface water groundwater flow model part of these investigations was the development of a detailed numerical flow model modflow nwt for the wairau plain aquifer and the interaction between the braided river and groundwater flow the model was described in detail by wöhling et al 2018 and is therefore only summarized here the model domain encompasses an area of 85 km² and ranges from downstream of the confluence of the waihopai river in the west to the wairau river gauging site close to the state highway 1 sh1 in the east fig 2 the wairau river forms the boundary in the north and the southern boundary is an imaginary line perpendicular to the groundwater head isolines along the ruakanakana creek the base of the model domain is formed by the low permeability speargrass formation the highly conductive rapaura gravels that host the aquifer are conceptualized by three layers of spatially variable thickness and hydraulic properties as derived from a re assessment of bore log data wilson 2016 the wairau river the smaller tributaries at the southern boundary and the main low land springs were implemented as streams and drains in the model daily values of land surface recharge and irrigation demand groundwater abstraction are computed using a spatially distributed soil water balance model that considers different soil types and regionalized meteorological inputs wöhling et al 2018 the total of 207 parameters of the modflow model were calibrated using regularization and subspace projection techniques the software pest doherty 2016 several different data types and locations as well as expert knowledge the calibration and evaluation periods were november 2013 to may 2016 and june 2016 to june 2019 respectively a main result of the model is the simulation and prediction of the spatial and temporal dynamics of exchange flows between river and aquifer the computed daily net exchange flows along the length of the wairau river are of importance for the dynamics of the aquifer storage investigated in this study the simulated net exchange flow is always positive i e the river is always losing and varies between 5 and 15 m³ s wöhling et al 2018 although localized reaches might exist where groundwater flow is returning to the river channel 2 3 natural factors influencing the hydrological regime in general all changes in the inputs and outputs sources and sinks of a considered hydrological system can cause changes in the flow regime natural factors relevant for the hydrological regime of the wairau aquifer and for aquifers fed by gravel bed rivers in general are exchange flows between river and aquifer land surface recharge deep drainage as well as other groundwater sources and sinks other factors include morphological changes of the river bed e g erosion or changes in the hydraulic properties of the aquifer materials e g by clogging or as consequence of sediment compaction in response to seismic activity the relevance of these potential factors for the wairau plain aquifer is subsequently discussed 2 3 1 groundwater sinks and sources vertical deep drainage from the rapaura formation into the low permeability speargrass formation brown 1981 can be considered negligible particularly when compared to the large annual flow volume through the wairau plain aquifer further there is no evidence of significant hydrogeological changes in the considered time period which rules out deep drainage as a dominant factor explaining the trends the same is true for potential groundwater inflows from the gravel fans of the northern tributaries it is likely that the waihopai fan in the west is losing water to the wairau aquifer and erosion of the river bed could lessen the hydraulic gradient and thus recharge rates however the losses must be very small compared to the river recharge from the much larger wairau river the groundwater of the wairau aquifer is not entirely discharged to the low land springs in the east some groundwater flows beneath the dillons point formation becomes artesian in the confined coastal aquifer and some of it is discharged as deep groundwater to cloudy bay davidson et al 1994 mdc experts estimated from spring flows to the east a constant deep groundwater flow towards the coast of up to 0 7 m³ s changes in sea level can change the hydraulic gradient between the confined aquifer and the sea and thus change the deep groundwater flow the current sea level rise in new zealand is on average approximately 1 7 mm a hannah and bell 2012 which equates at most to a few centimetres in the considered time period it can be expected that this has no significant impact on the hydrological regime of the aquifer since the groundwater discharges to the sea under confined conditions 2 3 2 climate factors both river recharge and land surface recharge are driven by temporally highly variable hydrometeorological factors such as precipitation river flow and evapotranspiration these factors are also spatially variable particularly at the catchment scale but to a much lesser extent on the wairau plain for our analysis we used the wairau river flow record which was made available from mdc for the time period 1961 2019 a time series of daily catchment average precipitation was computed based on the 0 05 raster data of the virtual climate station network vcsn purchased from the national institute of water and atmosphere research niwa the vcsn contains daily values for a range of meteorological data that are interpolated from station data over all of new zealand tait et al 2006 these data are available for the time period from 1960 until the current date for precipitation and from 1972 for potential evapotranspiration in this study we analysed the annual averages of catchment precipitation and runoff with respect to linear trends and anomalies from the mean further we analysed the interrelation of these anomalies to climate oscillations of up to several decades for this purpose we utilized the interdecadal pacific oscillation index ipo that represents anomalies of ocean temperature in the southern pacific and is a common indicator for multi year variations in climate in oceania salinger et al 2001 it has previously been shown that ipo shifts correlate to some degree with shifts in the flow regime of new zealand rivers mckerchar and henderson 2003 to investigate the hydrological drivers of the wairau plain aquifer in detail we computed the water balance components of the aquifer with the calibrated modflow model for the time period 2001 2019 then we investigated and related the potential factors to the observed modelled dynamic of groundwater storage in addition we conducted a hypothesis driven analysis of the impact of singular events such as earthquakes and extreme floods with the wairau plain model common implication of earthquakes are land subsidence or lifting and or the rearrangement and compaction of fluvial sediments by the physical shakes which can result in liquefaction where fine sediments are flushed to the land surface due to the corresponding decrease in pore space of the aquifer materials such geophysical changes would become apparent for example by abrupt jumps in groundwater levels among others cox et al 2012 2 3 3 river bed morphology floods can change the morphology of the river bed particularly in braided rivers which are essentially constantly changing environments however extreme floods have the erosive force to change the river bed in a single event that could potentially have an impact on the exchange flows between river and aquifer the wairau river is perched above the regional water table in the western part of the wairau plain this means the river is not directly connected with the underlying aquifer whether river water is just percolating vertically through the coarse gravels of the river bed or whether it feeds a saturated gravel trough underneath the river and then percolates both sideways and downward is a question of active research mbie 2019 in any case it can be expected that a colmation or clogging layer in a gravel bed river is unlikely to be present because of the constant reworking of the river bed gravels but large floods can cause changes in braiding and both incision and broadening of river cross sections the consequence would be a lower water level i e lower hydraulic gradient for the same river discharge compared to pre event conditions fig 4 this in turn leads to a lower percolation rate from the river to the aquifer this hypothesis can be conveniently tested by a corresponding change in parameterization of the river bed geometry in the numerical modflow model another factor caused by erosion and bed degradation could be a loss in connectivity to preferential lateral flow paths in the form of recent paelochannels or open framework gravel lenses which are common in new zealand s braided river aquifers e g dann et al 2009 burbery et al 2018 this is not further analysed here because specifically designed field experiments are yet to be conducted 2 4 anthropogenic factors 2 4 1 river engineering in the early 1870 s the wairau plain was still a swampy floodplain with the wairau river meandering freely across its width river training measures started more than 150 years ago for flood protection of early settlers around what later became blenheim and to drain the land for agriculture basher et al 1995 the largest modifications to the natural river course were the construction of stop banks at conders bend to prevent the wairau river from breaching into the ōpaoa channel starting 1917 with several amendments in the following decades and the construction of the wairau river diversion in 1963 downstream of the sh1 with the capacity to convey about 50 of the flood water flow directly to cloudy bay fig 3 today the wairau river channel is restricted to the northern boundary of the wairau plain it is constrained by stop banks that are up to several 100 m apart the river still forms braids in its gravel bed during mid to high flow but the degree of braiding is massively reduced compared to the situation in the 1950 s channelisation during the first phase of river training led to an enhanced erosion in the lower parts of the wairau plain this was counteracted to some extent by the construction of the wairau river diversion causing more gravel aggradation in the river bed in the lower reaches christensen and doscher 2010 the natural pre modification sediment load of the wairau river is estimated to be between 70 000 and more than 90 000 m³ a basher et al 1995 christensen 2007 enhanced deposition of sediment since the 1970 s and the corresponding decreased river channel capacity i e increased risk of flooding led to the commission of gravel works to extract excess gravel from the river bed between 1994 and 2016 gravel extraction averaged about 150 000 m³ a mdc 2016 which by far exceeds the natural gravel supply potentially this can lead to river bed erosion towards the apex of the wairau plain alluvial fan indeed it was observed that river bed levels decreased in most sections between the conders region and sh1 during the time period between 1969 and 2012 mdc 2016 the observed incision of the river bed could also be a cause for a change in river recharge rates to groundwater as explained in section 2 3 3 2 4 2 groundwater abstraction another factor influencing the water balance of the wairau plain aquifer is groundwater abstraction for irrigation currently there are about 5200 consented abstraction wells on the wairau plain the majority of the wairau plains are covered by vineyards the wine growing area of the total marlborough region expanded rapidly between 1997 and 2008 from 2655 ha to 22 277 ha and reached 23 769 ha in september 2013 hamill et al 2016 an estimate from 2019 shows that the total wine growing area is 27 000 ha for marlborough region today the region is new zealand s largest wine growing area and of large economic significance in 2019 marlborough produced 77 of all new zealand wine predominantly its world famous sauvignon blanc nzw 2020 the grapes require irrigation during the summer months november to april which is typically done using drip irrigation converting dryland to grapes necessarily increases the water demand almost certainly causing lower aquifer storage in the summer months actual irrigation water abstraction rates are however largely unknown because not all of the 630 active water permits to abstract groundwater from the wairau aquifer require reporting and because daily telemetered data have only been compulsory in selected zones and are only now progressively installed for new and renewed consents further little is known about the spatial and temporal variation of water abstraction across the wairau plain but demand is highest in summer when natural rainfall is absent or rare and negligible in winter when the vineyards are dormant because of the lack of water use data the irrigation water demand is estimated using a spatially distributed daily soil water balance model c f section 2 2 and wöhling et al 2018 the model assumes a fixed vineyard area and neglects land use changes prior to 2012 for the analysis presented here we can compute the fraction of the estimated irrigation water demand on the total water balance of the wairau plain aquifer other potential anthropogenic factors not investigated in this study are surface water abstraction and a diversion from the wairau river near the waihopai river confluence at max 2 5 m³ s for the southern valley irrigation scheme established in 2004 the hydropower scheme at the branch river built in 1983 and other factors listed in fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 wairau plain aquifer water balance the total storage of the unconfined wairau plain aquifer within the study area fig 2 is estimated to be 310 million m³ these calculations are based on estimates of average porosity of the three members of the rapaura gravel formation the aquifer volume derived from the geological model and the highest groundwater surface observed in 2002 interpolated from point values the average annual groundwater head variations range between approximately 0 5 m and 2 0 m at the lower and upper wairau plain respectively taking into account the lowest observed groundwater levels we estimated the dynamic or live aquifer storage to be approximately 10 15 million m³ which is only 3 5 of the total aquifer volume dynamic storage is the volume of water available while sustaining environmental flows in this case discharge through the springs if the volume of dynamic storage is reduced via decreased recharge or groundwater abstraction spring flows will decrease dynamic storage is represented on a groundwater hydrograph as the difference between the annual peak and low water level it can also be viewed as the manageable storage which includes the added effects of current groundwater abstractions a long term decline in groundwater levels therefore represents a potentially permanent loss of groundwater storage from the aquifer and permanent decrease in environmental flows the loss of storage can be computed as the difference between the past and current mean groundwater surfaces multiplied by the porosity of the aquifer materials considering that mean groundwater levels at well p3009 decreased by 0 22 m between 1997 and 2019 and by up to 0 58 m in the conders area in a shorter time period fig 3a b it can be estimated that the total groundwater storage has decreased by only 1 over that time period for the manageable storage however this is a decrease of circa 20 in only 23 years to investigate the aquifer storage volume and dynamics in more detail we analysed the water balance from the modflow model simulations over the years 2000 2018 the first year was omitted from the analysis as a warm up year for the model fig 5 a shows the calculated annual water balance and the average balance over the considered time period 2001 2018 for the model domain positive values denote recharge sources negative values signify storage sink terms i e water flows out of the aquifer domain the average annual net river recharge is 239 5 million m³ and accounts for 94 6 of the total aquifer recharge this value corresponds to an annual recharge of about 77 of the total aquifer volume and agrees well with the river losses determined from differential flow gauging campaigns the annual turnover of aquifer storage is extremely high due to the high transmissivity of the system the mean residence time for spring creek the largest spring on the wairau plain was estimated to be less than 1 year wöhling et al 2018 morgenstern et al 2019 in comparison to river recharge the annual average land surface recharge contribution is relatively small at 13 7 million m³ this relates to 5 4 of the total recharge or 163 mm a percolation from the soil or 25 of the precipitation on the wairau plain land surface recharge estimates vary significantly from 63 mm in 2003 to 343 mm in 2011 which is consistent with drainage measurements from wick lysimeters in the region green et al 2014 river recharge and land surface recharge together add up to the total average aquifer recharge of 253 2 million m³ a to some unknown extent there is groundwater inflow recharge to the wairau aquifer from the waihopai river in the west and from the gravel fans of the northern tributaries ōhinemahuta river are are creek waikakaho which are not considered in the computation the annual inflow to the wairau aquifer is therefore likely to be even higher losses from the aquifer considered here are spring flows groundwater abstraction for irrigation and groundwater outflow to the sea the latter is considered constant in time in the model at an estimated 22 1 million m³ annually the majority of the annual recharge 90 is discharged by the low land springs on average 229 1 million m³ a the computed average groundwater abstraction for irrigation is 2 2 million m³ a it has been previously reported that the irrigation demand in the region is about 80 mm a neal 2004 converted to the land area under vineyards in 2013 this would amount to 1 9 million m³ a which agrees well with the modelled abstraction the annual groundwater abstraction is therefore less than 1 of the total aquifer recharge however it takes up to 20 of the dynamic aquifer storage this can be problematic because the majority of the irrigation demand occurs in summer when both aquifer recharge and aquifer storage are low to illustrate this further fig 6 shows monthly averages 2000 2018 of computed groundwater abstraction and the corresponding values of change in aquifer storage for convenience of interpretation the graph starts from september the largest demand for groundwater abstraction is between november and march coinciding with the months where the aquifer is losing most of its dynamic storage the groundwater abstraction explains 35 of the total annual loss of aquifer storage between november and march and up to 51 in the two months of march and december fig 6 these numbers can be even more extreme in individual years therefore it seems likely that groundwater abstraction is a significant factor contributing to low summer aquifer levels and storage further it can be seen in fig 6 that the aquifer storage is essentially only recovering during the three months between april and june in all other months the discharge from the aquifer is on average higher or similar to the combined rate of river recharge and land surface recharge overall it can be summarised that the annual recharge of the wairau plain aquifer is several 17 25 times the dynamic storage volume but most of the water is not accessible for management because it is rapidly discharged again as spring flows and to a lesser extent deep groundwater to the sea fig 5a the manageable portion of aquifer storage is limited by mdc s objective to protect the flow of groundwater fed springs and is rather small compared to the total aquifer storage the average storage change has a slightly negative balance over the simulation period 0 2 million m³ a fig 5b shows the simulated dynamics of the aquifer storage daily values clearly visible is an annual variability with a strong decline in storage during summer typically the groundwater response to the highly dynamic hydro meteorological drivers precipitation runoff etc is delayed and dampened the exceptionally strong dynamic response of the wairau plain aquifer is explained by a very high effective transmissivity of the gravels of the rapaura formation and the relatively small thickness of the aquifer 25 30 m this leads to mean groundwater transit times of less than one year wöhling et al 2018 other factors influencing the temporal variability and potential trends of aquifer storage are discussed in the next subsections 3 2 impact of climate as described above the wairau plain aquifer is mainly recharged by percolation of river water therefore a change in the discharge regime of the wairau river could explain the observed trends in groundwater levels and spring flows the catchment rainfall was also analysed because it drives the runoff however both rainfall and runoff data are subject to error which could either falsely suggest or hide a relationship to the trends 3 2 1 precipitation fig 7 upper panel shows a large variability in the annual average catchment precipitation derived from the vcsn data a simple linear regression over the time period 59 years suggests a total decline in precipitation of 172 mm which is almost 2 9 mm per year the mann kendall test indicates that this trend is statistically not significant p 0 11 however the trend could be masked by the large variability of the data in addition to the analysis of catchment precipitation we investigated the spatial distribution of annual precipitation and trends by spatial interpolation of the statistics computed for the individual vcsn stations results are depicted in fig 8 where the wairau catchment outline is added for orientation panel a shows the mean annual precipitation map for marlborough derived for the time period 1960 2018 precipitation gradients are mainly in north south direction with 650 mm a at the wairau plain and more than 2500 mm a in the richmond ranges north of the wairau river the precipitation means are very likely underestimated in the west of the catchment where the peaks of the spenser mountains reach up to more than 2000 m a m s l and where previously derived rainfall isohyetal maps suggest annual precipitation sums of more than 3200 mm a mcb 1987 in addition the water balance for the headwater catchment of the wairau river gauge at dip flat area 505 km² revealed that the vcsn derived precipitation mean of 1538 mm a is about 100 mm less than the gauged annual runoff ludwig 2018 this is physically not possible even when accounting for uncertainty in the flow gauging data the hydrological analysis of a plausible water balance suggests that the vcsn precipitation data is by a factor of 1 7 to 2 0 too low in this area this is a known problem with vcsn data nationally because very few high elevation rainfall stations are available for interpolation tait et al 2006 2012 the average precipitation for the total catchment could therefore be higher by 150 225 mm a the annual precipitation exhibits negative trends almost everywhere in the wairau catchment and ranges from zero in the coastal region and the wairau plain to up to 12 mm a in isolated patches in the richmond ranges fig 8b the trends are small or even positive in the west of the catchment which is most likely an artefact of the biased mean annual precipitation in this area as explained above as expected the statistical significance of the trends is low in most of the area red colours in fig 8c the mann kendall p is only close to unity in areas where the trend is close to zero as indicated by the blue colours in fig 8c overall the analysis of the vcsn precipitation data shows ambiguous results although a decrease in annual wairau catchment precipitation over the past 59 years seems very likely 3 2 2 runoff runoff data should provide more evidence to our hypothesis of declining rainfall trends because it is directly related to precipitation and the trends should also be reflected by the runoff data runoff consists of liquid water leaving the catchment both at the surface as streamflow and via the subsurface as groundwater flow since the groundwater discharge to the sea is considered to be stationary see section 2 3 1 we used the wairau river streamflow gauged at barnetts bank fig 2 for the analysis as shown in the lower panel of fig 7 annual average flow in the catchment correlates well with precipitation values averaged over the entire time period about 58 of the precipitation becomes runoff which is a value that appears to be somewhat high for the region however considering the underestimation of the vcsn data in high elevations this value could potentially be 50 or less there is also a negative trend in the runoff values of 116 mm 2 0 mm a that is lower than the trend for precipitation due to its lower absolute values once again the trend is statistically not significant mann kendall p 0 27 but measurements of electrical conductivity ec taken at the wairau river at barnetts bank show a statistically significant increasing trend since the record started in 1988 which suggests that the percentage of older water typically associated with higher ec values has been increasing fig 3e this is consistent with decreasing trends for precipitation and runoff in the catchment 3 2 3 climate oscillation considering the large variability of the observed climate in the wairau catchment and of precipitation in particular we analysed a potential relationship to long term climate oscillations using the ipo index mfe 2017b the results are summarized in fig 9 the quantities depicted in the individual panels are presented as mass curves of the differences to the mean i e cumulative deviations from the average conditions which will subsequently be referred to as anomalies for a better comparison with the ipo index we included smoothed sliding window anomaly functions the window size for smoothing the data was chosen to be 151 2000 and 6000 days for precipitation groundwater heads and runoff respectively in marlborough positive ipo phases correlate with a warmer moister climate while negative values indicate a cooler dryer climate phase the average precipitation in marlborough was 4 8 higher during the ipo positive phase between 1977 and 1998 as compared to the preceding negative ipo phase mfe 2018 2020 correspondingly the time series depicted in fig 9 are divided in ipo positive phases 1977 1998 and since 2014 and ipo negative phases 1945 1976 and 1999 2013 in addition to the ipo index which is a measure of climate variability at time scales of 10 30 years fig 9a shows the oceanic niño index oni which is an indicator for the el niño southern oscillation with positive el niño and negative la niña phases alternating at 3 7 year intervals the negative ipo phase 1945 1976 is not discussed in the analysis because the data records start in the middle of this period the ipo index was available only until 2016 and the recent entry into an ipo positive phase has to be treated with some caution it remains to be seen whether the later years support a recent phase change so far the precipitation anomaly depicted in fig 9b doesn t support an ipo warm phase with a wetter climate time periods that are wetter than the average are indicated by an increase of the anomaly curve whereas dryer periods show a decrease the anomaly remains constant for periods with average conditions the positive phase between 1977 and 1998 shows an increase consistent with higher than average precipitation fig 9b the curve starts to decrease in 1999 indicating lower than average precipitation that is consistent with the negative ipo phase but it continues to decrease also after 2013 suggesting that the current warm phase is not leading to wetter than normal years or that the negative phase continues the opposite trend is observed for the potential evapotranspiration anomaly that also continues past 2013 vcsn data only available from 1972 this is an expected result because potential evapotranspiration pet is typically anti correlated with precipitation the catchment runoff anomaly depicted in fig 9c shows a higher variability over time and also an intermittent decrease in the positive ipo phase 1977 1998 but the dynamics of the smoothed curve is similar to the one for precipitation one significant difference can be seen for the years 2010 2015 where the anomaly is well correlated with the increasing ipo index that is not visible in the precipitation anomaly the flow data are less uncertain than the precipitation data but even though the vcsn data are biased trends should still become visible if they are systematically biased however the uncertainty in precipitation data is large also because different and unknown numbers of meteorological stations were used for the interpolation of the vcsn data at different periods of time the runoff anomaly for the waihopai river which flows into the wairau river at the upper wairau plain fig 2 is depicted in fig 9d it has a very similar shape to the wairau river flow anomaly and also exhibits above average flows for the years 2010 2015 but a decrease between 2015 and 2019 the direct analysis of the correlation between climate oscillation and the wairau plain storage was challenging because none of the groundwater head observations on the wairau plain dates back to 1960 however the record for the wratts rd well p3009 dates back to 1996 and could be complemented with the record of well p0238 located in the vicinity fig 2 this well has a record from 1958 to 1996 with a short overlapping period to adjust for the bias originating from a slightly upstream position the anomaly of the extended record of groundwater heads is depicted in fig 9e data gaps in the 1970 s were not filled there can be some artefacts in the early years caused by pumping in the vicinity of p0238 but groundwater heads have been lower than average even during the positive wetter ipo phase and were declining since 1982 it is noteworthy that the recent period of higher than average runoff observed for the wairau river catchment 2010 2015 has not resulted in correspondingly increasing groundwater levels aquifer storage this is an indicator that aquifer storage corresponds not only to climate but that there are other influencing factors as will be described in the following sections the results suggest that climate oscillation has an impact on long term trends in precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff in the wairau river catchment it is more than likely that climate change is superimposed on top of these oscillations meaning that a full recovery to previous meteorological conditions during the last positive ipo phase is also unlikely climate projections suggest an even drier and warmer future climate which will put further stress on the availability of water resources in the region mfe 2018 3 2 4 weather and climate in contrast to climate that determines the long term average meteorological conditions of a region weather describes the short term conditions which can impact the annual cycle of aquifer storage depletion and recharge a detailed analysis of wairau aquifer depletion was conducted for the time period 2010 2019 a period that includes three years with particularly dry summers 2012 2015 previous modelling analysis has demonstrated that the rate of groundwater recharge from the wairau river is mostly in the range between 7 and 15 m³ s the rate of recharge declines rapidly when wairau river flows are below 20 m³ s wöhling et al 2018 the years 2012 2015 were affected by distinctive and sustained low flow periods as shown in fig 10 a note the log scale a concurrent strong decline in groundwater levels of well p3009 and also of the manageable aquifer storage was observed figs 10b and 5 b respectively it is important to note that after a year with a prolonged low flow period the groundwater levels and aquifer storage do not recover to the previous year s maximum values despite the river recharge during the winter months summing up to a multitude of the depleted volume the summer low groundwater levels and aquifer storage keep on decreasing for the consecutive years 2012 2015 until they almost reach critical levels twice dashed line in fig 10b aquifer storage is only refilled to higher levels in years when the annual river low flow period is interrupted by higher flow events 2011 2012 and 2016 or when levels remain high throughout the summer 2017 these results provide evidence that the occurrence and extent of wairau river low flow periods with q 20 m³ s is of high significance to the sustainable management of the wairau plain aquifer currently wairau river flows are managed via a policy with three bands of water allocation class a permits are available at flows above 8 m³ s at the gauge at barnetts bank no water takes below that limit which is approximately 90 95 of the time class b permits are available for wairau river flows above 15 m³ s and class c permits allow abstraction when flows are above 30 m³ s these allocations and limits are currently being reconsidered in the drafting of the marlborough environment plan and future changes are possible our results suggest that aquifer storage may benefit from an adjustment of the management policy towards higher minimum flows to minimise the effect of extended low flow periods since the extent of low flow periods seems to be a crucial factor for aquifer storage recovery we counted in each year the number of days with wairau river flow below a threshold of 20 m³ s then we averaged the number of low flow days for the different ipo phases to analyse the relationship between the frequency and climate oscillation the results are depicted in fig 11 the average number of days with low flow during the previous positive ipo phase 1977 1998 was 28 days and significantly lower than the number in the previous and later negative phases this is consistent with expectations since positive ipo phases bring wetter climate to marlborough although more annual precipitation does not necessarily mean more precipitation in summer during the recent negative i e dryer ipo phase of 1999 2013 river flow was below 20 m³ s at an average of 57 days annually with a peak value of 119 days in 2001 such extended low flow periods were also observed in the negative ipo phase ending in 1976 but the average duration for that period was distinctively shorter 43 days the recent entry of a positive ipo phase is not yet reflected by a distinct decrease of low flow days at 47 days the average count is still above the previous negative phase 2019 was a year with particularly low flow levels that lasted almost for two months and 2015 brought a large count of 91 days below 20 m³ s that ranks 5th in the 60 year record low flow frequency analysis has also been conducted for a threshold of 10 m³ s which shows a similar pattern fig 11 the average count for 2013 2019 is 21 days the highest number in any of the previous ipo periods and more than 4 times the value of the previous positive ipo phase 5 days this is mainly due to the years 2019 and 2015 which attained the 4th and 5th largest counts on record respectively the results suggest that the frequency of low flow periods has increased in the past two decades and that there is a trend to more extreme low flow values low river flow is naturally correlated to climate drivers mainly to the temporal distribution and intensity of summer precipitation but non stationarity of the catchment characteristics such as land cover changes and upstream surface subsurface water management are potential additional factors that have an impact on the occurrence and severity of low flow periods since these periods have a strong adverse effect on wairau aquifer recharge it is necessary to disentangle the climate drivers and to review management options to sustain higher flows in the river during summer 3 3 river morphology the previous section showed that climatic drivers and particularly river low flows are important factors determining the dynamics of wairau aquifer storage trends in these climate driven variables will lead to corresponding trends in the aquifer if the hydrological regime of the wairau aquifer is solely determined by climate and weather we should be able to build a model that represents aquifer storage and spring flows equally well for current and past conditions we tested this hypothesis by extending the modflow model presented in wöhling et al 2018 the model was originally set up for the time period july 2013 to february 2017 here we extend the simulations to april 2019 and back in time to january 2000 the parameter set derived from calibration 07 2013 05 2016 was then used to conduct a single model run for the extended time period the corresponding simulated groundwater heads at the wells p3821 and p3009 and spring creek flows are presented in fig 12 b d light blue dashed line together with the observed values red the model simulations fit well to the observations for the time period 2012 2019 but exhibit visible deviations for the years prior to 2011 the bias computed for the entire simulation period is 0 41 m 0 14 m and 0 29 m³ s for well p3821 well p3009 and spring creek flows respectively this suggests that hydro meteorological drivers alone do not explain the observed trends in the wairau aquifer inspecting the model simulation further it appears that a singular event in mid 2011 may have caused a change in the hydrological regime because the model calibrated to recent time conditions exhibits a larger bias prior to that date singular events common in new zealand are earthquakes several strong quakes occurred in 2010 and 2011 in canterbury about 250 km to the south these quakes were not strongly felt in marlborough however and since groundwater levels didn t respond to these events quakes were excluded as a potential reason for the hydrological regime change of the wairau aquifer floods are also singular events the wairau river carried several large floods between 2010 and 2012 the largest flood event peaked at 2918 m³ s on 16 05 2011 daily averages are depicted in fig 12a this event was the largest in the simulation period and ranks 8th in the 60 year flow record of the wairau river historic floods 1868 and 1923 were certainly much larger but we hypothesise that the erosive forces of the may 2011 event were large enough to erode and incise the river bed and to cause lower river recharge rates as a result c f section 2 3 3 to test this hypothesis we used two different parameterizations of the river bed geometry in the model simulations the calibrated parameter set was used for may 2011 to the end of the simulation period details about the model and its parameterization are presented in wöhling et al 2018 and therefore not repeated here a slightly different parameter set representing a less eroded river bed was used for simulating the time period prior to may 2011 value of geometric function exponent b manually adjusted by factor 1 115 for the same flow values the new parameterization yields higher water levels in the river compared to the calibrated parameter set fig 4 the simulation results with the combined bias corrected parameterization are depicted in fig 12b d in blue continuous line groundwater levels and spring creek flows are visibly higher for the time period prior to may 2011 the bias to the observation was reduced in all observations to 0 14 m 0 07 m and 0 10 m³ s for well p3821 well p3009 and spring creek flows respectively this suggests that bed degradation is a potential contributing factor for the long term decline in groundwater levels the model simulations support the hypothesis of a singular event causing a hydrological regime change a change in river morphology following the 2011 flood or a series of larger floods between 2010 and 2012 is a likely cause for this change understanding the processes for the changes in river groundwater interaction is the topic of current research mbie 2019 it is conceivable that not only singular events have an impact on river morphology and lead to a corresponding change in the hydrological regime but also gradual longer term erosion and deposition processes these can have natural causes and or can be a delayed result of river training measures as well as sediment trapping and gravel extraction 4 summary and conclusions this study analysed a range of natural and anthropogenic factors influencing the hydrological regime of the wairau plain aquifer to understand the mechanisms for the observed decline in groundwater levels and spring flows several factors were identified that act at different time scales these factors include long term climate oscillation seasonality of the hydro meteorological conditions changes in river bed morphology as well as surface water and groundwater abstraction disentangling and ranking these factors was challenging because of the uncertainty or absence of data the main limitations of the study are a poor knowledge of actual abstraction rates the role of the complex river bed morphology and the spatial and temporal variations of the flow between the active river channel and the aquifer however the combination of targeted monitoring with hypothesis driven modelling provided evidence on the likely causes for the observed trends the main results and conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows 95 of aquifer recharge originates from wairau river losses aquifer storage exhibits a strong seasonality 10 15 million m³ and is recovered only in april to june the annual recharge volume is 17 25 times the dynamic storage but only a fraction of it is accessible for management because the majority is discharged again as spring flows after a dry year storage only recovers in a wet summer when wairau river flows don t fall below 20 m³ s a series of dry summers leads to a progressive storage depletion storage is naturally depleted between november and march due to lower wairau river flows which coincides with the months of highest irrigation demand groundwater abstraction accounts for up to 51 of the observed storage decrease during these months a further increase in abstraction will have a direct adverse effect on aquifer storage in summer climate oscillations of 10 30 years lead to alternating wetter dryer conditions in marlborough and the wairau river catchment a recent change towards wetter conditions is not yet seen in the hydrological record climate oscillations are likely to be superimposed by climate predictions for a warmer dryer and potentially more extreme climate in marlborough mfe 2018 aquifer recharge declines rapidly for river flows 20 m³ s the occurrence and extent of low flow periods is correlated to climate phases but the number of days with low flow is increasing overall which is a major cause of declining aquifer storage these effects are intensified by abstraction climate and weather alone don t fully explain the observed trends in the aquifer singular effects such as floods and earthquakes have the potential to change the hydrological regime it was demonstrated that river bed geometry changes caused by erosion during major floods can lead to a lasting decrease in groundwater levels and spring flows losses of total aquifer storage by river erosion are possibly permanent the estimated loss of the live dynamic storage between 1997 and 2019 is 20 there is a risk of further storage losses by future extreme flood events or major earthquakes the results from this study suggest that both natural and anthropogenic factors are responsible for the decline of average groundwater storage and spring flows the storage of the wairau aquifer is naturally very dynamic due to its highly transmissive gravels and is essentially acting as an extension of the wairau river any changes in the river regime have an almost immediate effect on aquifer storage options to mitigate storage losses include managing higher flows in summer through the river abstraction allocation system extending on site water storage for irrigation to reduce summer groundwater abstraction river management to increase braiding and sediment management to prevent further river bed incision and erosion at the upper wairau plain further investigations are currently under way to better understand the mechanisms preventing storage refilling after extended low flow periods in summer in a future climate the stresses on the wairau aquifer are likely to increase manageable aquifer storage is particularly vulnerable to an increase in the duration of low flow periods in summer which is already visible in the 60 year record of the wairau river the hydrological regime of the wairau river is typical for rivers of new zealand s east coast and the results from this study can possibly be transferred to these systems too credit

8317,1 study region the unconfined wairau aquifer in the marlborough district of new zealand is almost exclusively recharged by the wairau river and serves as the major resource for drinking water and irrigation in the region a declining trend in aquifer levels and low land spring flows has been observed for the past decades 2 study focus the aim of this study is to identify and analyse natural and anthropogenic factors controlling the hydrological regime of the wairau aquifer concurrent trends in the long term water balance components for the wairau catchment and in low flow statistics as well as the correlation between hydro meteorological drivers and the interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo index were investigated the impact of river morphology changes on river recharge rates was studied using a previously developed groundwater flow model 3 new hydrological insights for the region our study found that long term trends in declining catchment scale precipitation are superimposed on climate oscillation and a strong annual variability jointly these processes have resulted in lower than average river flows increased low flow periods and consequently in lower rates of aquifer recharge river engineering caused erosion of the braided river morphology leading to a possibly permanent loss of aquifer storage groundwater abstraction is not accurately known which is a limitation of this study this additional information and adaptation strategies are required for sustainable management of the groundwater resources keywords groundwater modelling river groundwater interactions climate change groundwater management river erosion hydrological regime change 1 introduction the demand on water resources for food production drinking water supply and energy generation as well as for industrial processes is increasing worldwide many aquifer systems in new zealand have already reached their sustainable yield limits nzier 2014 mfe 2017a any additional pressure on these systems such as changes in the hydrological regime can trigger the need to restrict the use of the available water resources with potential major economic consequences to stakeholders natural as well as human induced shifts in hydro climatic conditions are the major contributor for changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources e g stagl and hattermann 2015 pumo et al 2016 yu et al 2018 pichura et al 2020 other anthropogenic factors that can lead to a long term change in the hydrological regime of river aquifer systems are river training for flood protection land use changes water storage and diversion hydroelectric power generation water abstraction for irrigation and sediment management the contributing factors for changes in the hydrological regime are often manifold and difficult to identify but disentangling these factors is important for water resources management to i make predictions of future states of the hydrological system ii to identify factors that can be controlled to mitigate adverse impacts of hydrological change and iii to quantify the mitigation potential for different management scenarios consequently research on factors influencing the hydrological regime of river systems increasingly attracts the attention of scientific investigations according to the web of science database over 1000 scientific papers have dealt with the topic hydrologic al regime in the past five years as of dec 2019 with 145 articles bearing the keyword in the title a large proportion of the studies investigated the reasons for changes in the hydrological regime of rivers a majority analysed climate change impacts often using a combination of global climate model projections local downscaling and hydrological modelling e g von gunten et al 2016v kour et al 2016 another factor is the impact of large scale landuse changes such as deforestation zhang et al 2017 river management particularly the construction of reservoirs has a significant impact on the hydrological regime of river systems song et al 2018 wang et al 2018 other studies investigated the impact of hydrological change e g the impact on the vegetation of floodplains kwak et al 2017 sediment transport pfeiffer and finnegan 2018 water quality du et al 2018 biodiversity rolls et al 2018 and others the rather elaborate investigation of the reasons for hydrological change with hydrological system models is typically preceded by a statistical analysis of hydrometerological data to detect trends or break points in the time series a summary of the most commonly used statistical methods can be found in khaliq et al 2009 this study investigates the hydrological regime of the braided wairau river in new zealand and the unconfined wairau aquifer which is primarily recharged by river water it is motivated by an observed decrease of groundwater levels and spring flows during the past decades these trends are of concern for the marlborough district council mdc who manages the water resources and aims to protect the flow of groundwater fed springs the mdc initiated several investigations to understand the reasons of the observed trends the analysis of tritium δ18o radon and temperature in river water and groundwater showed that the unconfined wairau aquifer consists of relatively young water that originates from the wairau river stewart 2008 close 2014 morgenstern et al 2019 but the processes and controls of the interaction between the river and the aquifer were still poorly understood consequently the mdc extended its monitoring network based on the additional information wilson and wöhling 2015 found that the wairau river is potentially perched above the regional water table in the recharge sector another key finding was that the hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer are relatively complex and the unconfined aquifer appears to be highly stratified the structure of the aquifer was reviewed by wilson 2016 and the resulting hydrogeological model was incorporated in a detailed surface water groundwater flow model developed by wöhling et al 2018 the main purpose of the numerical model modflow was to better understand the river recharge mechanisms it integrates multiple data types as well as hard and soft data and reproduces the data well computed groundwater age distributions of spring flows mean age 1 year are also consistent with independent measurements the study revealed that net exchange flows are positive during all flow conditions i e recharging the aquifer and vary within a narrow band of approximately 5 12 m³ s most of the time recharge rates drop exponentially during base flow conditions when the active channel area is reduced while the model provided new insights into the mechanisms of river groundwater exchange it was not specifically targeted at finding the reasons for the observed trends in groundwater levels and spring flows this study attempts to address this knowledge gap by identifying dominant natural and anthropogenic factors controlling the hydrological regime of the wairau river and the unconfined wairau aquifer these factors are most likely not unique to the wairau river catchment since other mainly east coast rivers of new zealand exhibit a similar hydrology and morphology seasonal changes in the groundwater resource are best considered in terms of available storage components most of the water storage within the aquifer is made of a permanently saturated zone which is not discharged on an annual basis although this water provides the vital function of preserving the aquifer in a heathy state so that environmental flows the natural outputs of the groundwater system are sustained in contrast the live or dynamic storage is the upper part of the aquifer which experiences seasonal fluctuations of the water table due to lower recharge during the summer months the controls to maintain environmental flows within acceptable limits are the management of groundwater abstraction by pumping and of dynamic storage levels a range of natural and anthropogenic factors that potentially can cause the observed trends are listed in fig 1 they can be grouped by decreasing river and or land surface recharge rates increasing groundwater abstraction and increasing aquifer drainage rates particular emphasis is placed on the various factors leading to decreased river recharge as the unconfined wairau plain aquifer is mainly recharged by wairau river water wöhling et al 2018 this is a characteristic common to many braided rivers in new zealand e g dravid and brown 1997 white et al 2001 larned et al 2008 rupp et al 2008 white et al 2012 unique to this study is the combination of a comprehensive targeted monitoring program with a detailed numerical process model for a hypothesis driven analysis of potential factors responsible for hydrological change in the coupled surface water groundwater system the study is a major extension of earlier work published by wöhling 2019 in german results yield insights into the controlling factors and potential management options to mitigate the impact of current and future hydrological change in new zealand s braided river systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area at about 170 km length the wairau river is the largest river in marlborough and ranks 16th by length of all new zealand rivers it originates in the pristine spenser mountains at an altitude of above 2000 m a s l follows the southern boundary of the red hill and richmond ranges in a mainly eastward direction and then flows along the northern boundary of the wairau plain approximately 27 km before meeting the pacific ocean at cloudy bay fig 2 the total area of the wairau river catchment is 3430 km² mean annual precipitation p varies significantly with 650 mm a near the coast and more than 2500 mm a in the mountains to the west and north the runoff regime is very dynamic with a mean flow of 100 m³ s a median flow of 60 m³ s and annual mean peak flow of 1950 m³ s river flows are gauged at barnetts bank fig 2 a site slightly upstream of the old gauging station at the state highway 1 bridge both locations are not affected by tidal effects in the western part of the wairau plain the river is perched up to several meters above the regional groundwater table and river water is percolating through the braided gravel bed into the underlying wairau aquifer wilson and wöhling 2015 the extremely high conductive gravels of the rapaura gravels are 20 30 m thick are mostly unconfined and become confined in the east by a wedge of fine textured marine sediments of the dillons point formation consequently groundwater is re emerging as low land springs at the land surface boundary along the edge of the confining unit and the wairau river also becomes hydraulically connected to the local water table as the confining sediments are approached the aquifer becomes increasingly artesian towards the coast in response to the thickening of the dillons point formation confining sediments underneath the holocene gravels of the rapaura formation lies the speargrass formation which is orders of magnitude less permeable and thus considered to be a confining unit for more details of the geology of the wairau plain please refer to brown 1981 raiber et al 2012 and wilson 2016 several synoptic differential gauging campaigns have been conducted since the 1970s at various sections of the wairau river along the wairau plain due to the difficulties of gauging flow in braided rivers the campaigns were conducted mainly at low flow conditions when the river was confined mainly to a single braid the gaugings revealed a consistent net loss of about 7 8 m³ s to the wairau aquifer c f fig 2 in wöhling et al 2018 much of the recharge is re emerging at the low land springs and as return flow to the river as the aquifer becomes confined by the holocene marine sediments of the dillons point formation towards the coast the largest spring is spring creek with an annual average flow of 4 m³ s at the gauging site fig 2 the wairau plain aquifer hosts groundwater resources that are of regional importance for the blenheim region since all municipal water supplies are sourced from groundwater and groundwater is also used to irrigate marlborough s vineyards new zealand s largest wine growing region the water resources are managed by the marlborough district council mdc who maintains a comprehensive hydrological monitoring program that includes real time observations of groundwater levels on the plain as well as stage flow gauging at the wairau river some of its tributaries and springs including spring creek two key groundwater monitoring sites are the wells p3009 at wratts road and well p3821 at conders fig 2 the proposed marlborough environment plan mep 2016 includes restrictions on groundwater abstractors in most aquifer management sectors when groundwater levels fall below a certain elevation in these wells fig 3 a and 3b show the observed groundwater levels for well p3009 1996 2017 and for well p3821 2002 2016 linear regression indicates a decreasing trend in both wells the trend appears to be stronger at the upper western part of the wairau plain well p3821 despite a shorter record compared to the eastern part well p3009 where the groundwater is closer to the surface the seasonal interannual variance is large for both of the key wells and also other monitoring wells on the wairau plain this could mask the trends to some degree but statistical tests do confirm the trend to be significant mann kendall test h 1 p 0 similar observations could be made for spring creek flows fig 3d which are closely related to upgradient groundwater levels on the other hand there is a much lower not significant trend in groundwater levels in the confined aquifer exemplarily depicted for the well p1733 fig 3c at the wairau bar fig 2 this demonstrates that the spring flows are predominantly influenced by the trends in the unconfined aquifer while the confined aquifer remains largely unchanged the mdc has initiated several investigations to identify the reasons for the trends in the unconfined aquifer levels and spring flows and to develop solutions for sustainable management of the aquifer 2 2 surface water groundwater flow model part of these investigations was the development of a detailed numerical flow model modflow nwt for the wairau plain aquifer and the interaction between the braided river and groundwater flow the model was described in detail by wöhling et al 2018 and is therefore only summarized here the model domain encompasses an area of 85 km² and ranges from downstream of the confluence of the waihopai river in the west to the wairau river gauging site close to the state highway 1 sh1 in the east fig 2 the wairau river forms the boundary in the north and the southern boundary is an imaginary line perpendicular to the groundwater head isolines along the ruakanakana creek the base of the model domain is formed by the low permeability speargrass formation the highly conductive rapaura gravels that host the aquifer are conceptualized by three layers of spatially variable thickness and hydraulic properties as derived from a re assessment of bore log data wilson 2016 the wairau river the smaller tributaries at the southern boundary and the main low land springs were implemented as streams and drains in the model daily values of land surface recharge and irrigation demand groundwater abstraction are computed using a spatially distributed soil water balance model that considers different soil types and regionalized meteorological inputs wöhling et al 2018 the total of 207 parameters of the modflow model were calibrated using regularization and subspace projection techniques the software pest doherty 2016 several different data types and locations as well as expert knowledge the calibration and evaluation periods were november 2013 to may 2016 and june 2016 to june 2019 respectively a main result of the model is the simulation and prediction of the spatial and temporal dynamics of exchange flows between river and aquifer the computed daily net exchange flows along the length of the wairau river are of importance for the dynamics of the aquifer storage investigated in this study the simulated net exchange flow is always positive i e the river is always losing and varies between 5 and 15 m³ s wöhling et al 2018 although localized reaches might exist where groundwater flow is returning to the river channel 2 3 natural factors influencing the hydrological regime in general all changes in the inputs and outputs sources and sinks of a considered hydrological system can cause changes in the flow regime natural factors relevant for the hydrological regime of the wairau aquifer and for aquifers fed by gravel bed rivers in general are exchange flows between river and aquifer land surface recharge deep drainage as well as other groundwater sources and sinks other factors include morphological changes of the river bed e g erosion or changes in the hydraulic properties of the aquifer materials e g by clogging or as consequence of sediment compaction in response to seismic activity the relevance of these potential factors for the wairau plain aquifer is subsequently discussed 2 3 1 groundwater sinks and sources vertical deep drainage from the rapaura formation into the low permeability speargrass formation brown 1981 can be considered negligible particularly when compared to the large annual flow volume through the wairau plain aquifer further there is no evidence of significant hydrogeological changes in the considered time period which rules out deep drainage as a dominant factor explaining the trends the same is true for potential groundwater inflows from the gravel fans of the northern tributaries it is likely that the waihopai fan in the west is losing water to the wairau aquifer and erosion of the river bed could lessen the hydraulic gradient and thus recharge rates however the losses must be very small compared to the river recharge from the much larger wairau river the groundwater of the wairau aquifer is not entirely discharged to the low land springs in the east some groundwater flows beneath the dillons point formation becomes artesian in the confined coastal aquifer and some of it is discharged as deep groundwater to cloudy bay davidson et al 1994 mdc experts estimated from spring flows to the east a constant deep groundwater flow towards the coast of up to 0 7 m³ s changes in sea level can change the hydraulic gradient between the confined aquifer and the sea and thus change the deep groundwater flow the current sea level rise in new zealand is on average approximately 1 7 mm a hannah and bell 2012 which equates at most to a few centimetres in the considered time period it can be expected that this has no significant impact on the hydrological regime of the aquifer since the groundwater discharges to the sea under confined conditions 2 3 2 climate factors both river recharge and land surface recharge are driven by temporally highly variable hydrometeorological factors such as precipitation river flow and evapotranspiration these factors are also spatially variable particularly at the catchment scale but to a much lesser extent on the wairau plain for our analysis we used the wairau river flow record which was made available from mdc for the time period 1961 2019 a time series of daily catchment average precipitation was computed based on the 0 05 raster data of the virtual climate station network vcsn purchased from the national institute of water and atmosphere research niwa the vcsn contains daily values for a range of meteorological data that are interpolated from station data over all of new zealand tait et al 2006 these data are available for the time period from 1960 until the current date for precipitation and from 1972 for potential evapotranspiration in this study we analysed the annual averages of catchment precipitation and runoff with respect to linear trends and anomalies from the mean further we analysed the interrelation of these anomalies to climate oscillations of up to several decades for this purpose we utilized the interdecadal pacific oscillation index ipo that represents anomalies of ocean temperature in the southern pacific and is a common indicator for multi year variations in climate in oceania salinger et al 2001 it has previously been shown that ipo shifts correlate to some degree with shifts in the flow regime of new zealand rivers mckerchar and henderson 2003 to investigate the hydrological drivers of the wairau plain aquifer in detail we computed the water balance components of the aquifer with the calibrated modflow model for the time period 2001 2019 then we investigated and related the potential factors to the observed modelled dynamic of groundwater storage in addition we conducted a hypothesis driven analysis of the impact of singular events such as earthquakes and extreme floods with the wairau plain model common implication of earthquakes are land subsidence or lifting and or the rearrangement and compaction of fluvial sediments by the physical shakes which can result in liquefaction where fine sediments are flushed to the land surface due to the corresponding decrease in pore space of the aquifer materials such geophysical changes would become apparent for example by abrupt jumps in groundwater levels among others cox et al 2012 2 3 3 river bed morphology floods can change the morphology of the river bed particularly in braided rivers which are essentially constantly changing environments however extreme floods have the erosive force to change the river bed in a single event that could potentially have an impact on the exchange flows between river and aquifer the wairau river is perched above the regional water table in the western part of the wairau plain this means the river is not directly connected with the underlying aquifer whether river water is just percolating vertically through the coarse gravels of the river bed or whether it feeds a saturated gravel trough underneath the river and then percolates both sideways and downward is a question of active research mbie 2019 in any case it can be expected that a colmation or clogging layer in a gravel bed river is unlikely to be present because of the constant reworking of the river bed gravels but large floods can cause changes in braiding and both incision and broadening of river cross sections the consequence would be a lower water level i e lower hydraulic gradient for the same river discharge compared to pre event conditions fig 4 this in turn leads to a lower percolation rate from the river to the aquifer this hypothesis can be conveniently tested by a corresponding change in parameterization of the river bed geometry in the numerical modflow model another factor caused by erosion and bed degradation could be a loss in connectivity to preferential lateral flow paths in the form of recent paelochannels or open framework gravel lenses which are common in new zealand s braided river aquifers e g dann et al 2009 burbery et al 2018 this is not further analysed here because specifically designed field experiments are yet to be conducted 2 4 anthropogenic factors 2 4 1 river engineering in the early 1870 s the wairau plain was still a swampy floodplain with the wairau river meandering freely across its width river training measures started more than 150 years ago for flood protection of early settlers around what later became blenheim and to drain the land for agriculture basher et al 1995 the largest modifications to the natural river course were the construction of stop banks at conders bend to prevent the wairau river from breaching into the ōpaoa channel starting 1917 with several amendments in the following decades and the construction of the wairau river diversion in 1963 downstream of the sh1 with the capacity to convey about 50 of the flood water flow directly to cloudy bay fig 3 today the wairau river channel is restricted to the northern boundary of the wairau plain it is constrained by stop banks that are up to several 100 m apart the river still forms braids in its gravel bed during mid to high flow but the degree of braiding is massively reduced compared to the situation in the 1950 s channelisation during the first phase of river training led to an enhanced erosion in the lower parts of the wairau plain this was counteracted to some extent by the construction of the wairau river diversion causing more gravel aggradation in the river bed in the lower reaches christensen and doscher 2010 the natural pre modification sediment load of the wairau river is estimated to be between 70 000 and more than 90 000 m³ a basher et al 1995 christensen 2007 enhanced deposition of sediment since the 1970 s and the corresponding decreased river channel capacity i e increased risk of flooding led to the commission of gravel works to extract excess gravel from the river bed between 1994 and 2016 gravel extraction averaged about 150 000 m³ a mdc 2016 which by far exceeds the natural gravel supply potentially this can lead to river bed erosion towards the apex of the wairau plain alluvial fan indeed it was observed that river bed levels decreased in most sections between the conders region and sh1 during the time period between 1969 and 2012 mdc 2016 the observed incision of the river bed could also be a cause for a change in river recharge rates to groundwater as explained in section 2 3 3 2 4 2 groundwater abstraction another factor influencing the water balance of the wairau plain aquifer is groundwater abstraction for irrigation currently there are about 5200 consented abstraction wells on the wairau plain the majority of the wairau plains are covered by vineyards the wine growing area of the total marlborough region expanded rapidly between 1997 and 2008 from 2655 ha to 22 277 ha and reached 23 769 ha in september 2013 hamill et al 2016 an estimate from 2019 shows that the total wine growing area is 27 000 ha for marlborough region today the region is new zealand s largest wine growing area and of large economic significance in 2019 marlborough produced 77 of all new zealand wine predominantly its world famous sauvignon blanc nzw 2020 the grapes require irrigation during the summer months november to april which is typically done using drip irrigation converting dryland to grapes necessarily increases the water demand almost certainly causing lower aquifer storage in the summer months actual irrigation water abstraction rates are however largely unknown because not all of the 630 active water permits to abstract groundwater from the wairau aquifer require reporting and because daily telemetered data have only been compulsory in selected zones and are only now progressively installed for new and renewed consents further little is known about the spatial and temporal variation of water abstraction across the wairau plain but demand is highest in summer when natural rainfall is absent or rare and negligible in winter when the vineyards are dormant because of the lack of water use data the irrigation water demand is estimated using a spatially distributed daily soil water balance model c f section 2 2 and wöhling et al 2018 the model assumes a fixed vineyard area and neglects land use changes prior to 2012 for the analysis presented here we can compute the fraction of the estimated irrigation water demand on the total water balance of the wairau plain aquifer other potential anthropogenic factors not investigated in this study are surface water abstraction and a diversion from the wairau river near the waihopai river confluence at max 2 5 m³ s for the southern valley irrigation scheme established in 2004 the hydropower scheme at the branch river built in 1983 and other factors listed in fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 wairau plain aquifer water balance the total storage of the unconfined wairau plain aquifer within the study area fig 2 is estimated to be 310 million m³ these calculations are based on estimates of average porosity of the three members of the rapaura gravel formation the aquifer volume derived from the geological model and the highest groundwater surface observed in 2002 interpolated from point values the average annual groundwater head variations range between approximately 0 5 m and 2 0 m at the lower and upper wairau plain respectively taking into account the lowest observed groundwater levels we estimated the dynamic or live aquifer storage to be approximately 10 15 million m³ which is only 3 5 of the total aquifer volume dynamic storage is the volume of water available while sustaining environmental flows in this case discharge through the springs if the volume of dynamic storage is reduced via decreased recharge or groundwater abstraction spring flows will decrease dynamic storage is represented on a groundwater hydrograph as the difference between the annual peak and low water level it can also be viewed as the manageable storage which includes the added effects of current groundwater abstractions a long term decline in groundwater levels therefore represents a potentially permanent loss of groundwater storage from the aquifer and permanent decrease in environmental flows the loss of storage can be computed as the difference between the past and current mean groundwater surfaces multiplied by the porosity of the aquifer materials considering that mean groundwater levels at well p3009 decreased by 0 22 m between 1997 and 2019 and by up to 0 58 m in the conders area in a shorter time period fig 3a b it can be estimated that the total groundwater storage has decreased by only 1 over that time period for the manageable storage however this is a decrease of circa 20 in only 23 years to investigate the aquifer storage volume and dynamics in more detail we analysed the water balance from the modflow model simulations over the years 2000 2018 the first year was omitted from the analysis as a warm up year for the model fig 5 a shows the calculated annual water balance and the average balance over the considered time period 2001 2018 for the model domain positive values denote recharge sources negative values signify storage sink terms i e water flows out of the aquifer domain the average annual net river recharge is 239 5 million m³ and accounts for 94 6 of the total aquifer recharge this value corresponds to an annual recharge of about 77 of the total aquifer volume and agrees well with the river losses determined from differential flow gauging campaigns the annual turnover of aquifer storage is extremely high due to the high transmissivity of the system the mean residence time for spring creek the largest spring on the wairau plain was estimated to be less than 1 year wöhling et al 2018 morgenstern et al 2019 in comparison to river recharge the annual average land surface recharge contribution is relatively small at 13 7 million m³ this relates to 5 4 of the total recharge or 163 mm a percolation from the soil or 25 of the precipitation on the wairau plain land surface recharge estimates vary significantly from 63 mm in 2003 to 343 mm in 2011 which is consistent with drainage measurements from wick lysimeters in the region green et al 2014 river recharge and land surface recharge together add up to the total average aquifer recharge of 253 2 million m³ a to some unknown extent there is groundwater inflow recharge to the wairau aquifer from the waihopai river in the west and from the gravel fans of the northern tributaries ōhinemahuta river are are creek waikakaho which are not considered in the computation the annual inflow to the wairau aquifer is therefore likely to be even higher losses from the aquifer considered here are spring flows groundwater abstraction for irrigation and groundwater outflow to the sea the latter is considered constant in time in the model at an estimated 22 1 million m³ annually the majority of the annual recharge 90 is discharged by the low land springs on average 229 1 million m³ a the computed average groundwater abstraction for irrigation is 2 2 million m³ a it has been previously reported that the irrigation demand in the region is about 80 mm a neal 2004 converted to the land area under vineyards in 2013 this would amount to 1 9 million m³ a which agrees well with the modelled abstraction the annual groundwater abstraction is therefore less than 1 of the total aquifer recharge however it takes up to 20 of the dynamic aquifer storage this can be problematic because the majority of the irrigation demand occurs in summer when both aquifer recharge and aquifer storage are low to illustrate this further fig 6 shows monthly averages 2000 2018 of computed groundwater abstraction and the corresponding values of change in aquifer storage for convenience of interpretation the graph starts from september the largest demand for groundwater abstraction is between november and march coinciding with the months where the aquifer is losing most of its dynamic storage the groundwater abstraction explains 35 of the total annual loss of aquifer storage between november and march and up to 51 in the two months of march and december fig 6 these numbers can be even more extreme in individual years therefore it seems likely that groundwater abstraction is a significant factor contributing to low summer aquifer levels and storage further it can be seen in fig 6 that the aquifer storage is essentially only recovering during the three months between april and june in all other months the discharge from the aquifer is on average higher or similar to the combined rate of river recharge and land surface recharge overall it can be summarised that the annual recharge of the wairau plain aquifer is several 17 25 times the dynamic storage volume but most of the water is not accessible for management because it is rapidly discharged again as spring flows and to a lesser extent deep groundwater to the sea fig 5a the manageable portion of aquifer storage is limited by mdc s objective to protect the flow of groundwater fed springs and is rather small compared to the total aquifer storage the average storage change has a slightly negative balance over the simulation period 0 2 million m³ a fig 5b shows the simulated dynamics of the aquifer storage daily values clearly visible is an annual variability with a strong decline in storage during summer typically the groundwater response to the highly dynamic hydro meteorological drivers precipitation runoff etc is delayed and dampened the exceptionally strong dynamic response of the wairau plain aquifer is explained by a very high effective transmissivity of the gravels of the rapaura formation and the relatively small thickness of the aquifer 25 30 m this leads to mean groundwater transit times of less than one year wöhling et al 2018 other factors influencing the temporal variability and potential trends of aquifer storage are discussed in the next subsections 3 2 impact of climate as described above the wairau plain aquifer is mainly recharged by percolation of river water therefore a change in the discharge regime of the wairau river could explain the observed trends in groundwater levels and spring flows the catchment rainfall was also analysed because it drives the runoff however both rainfall and runoff data are subject to error which could either falsely suggest or hide a relationship to the trends 3 2 1 precipitation fig 7 upper panel shows a large variability in the annual average catchment precipitation derived from the vcsn data a simple linear regression over the time period 59 years suggests a total decline in precipitation of 172 mm which is almost 2 9 mm per year the mann kendall test indicates that this trend is statistically not significant p 0 11 however the trend could be masked by the large variability of the data in addition to the analysis of catchment precipitation we investigated the spatial distribution of annual precipitation and trends by spatial interpolation of the statistics computed for the individual vcsn stations results are depicted in fig 8 where the wairau catchment outline is added for orientation panel a shows the mean annual precipitation map for marlborough derived for the time period 1960 2018 precipitation gradients are mainly in north south direction with 650 mm a at the wairau plain and more than 2500 mm a in the richmond ranges north of the wairau river the precipitation means are very likely underestimated in the west of the catchment where the peaks of the spenser mountains reach up to more than 2000 m a m s l and where previously derived rainfall isohyetal maps suggest annual precipitation sums of more than 3200 mm a mcb 1987 in addition the water balance for the headwater catchment of the wairau river gauge at dip flat area 505 km² revealed that the vcsn derived precipitation mean of 1538 mm a is about 100 mm less than the gauged annual runoff ludwig 2018 this is physically not possible even when accounting for uncertainty in the flow gauging data the hydrological analysis of a plausible water balance suggests that the vcsn precipitation data is by a factor of 1 7 to 2 0 too low in this area this is a known problem with vcsn data nationally because very few high elevation rainfall stations are available for interpolation tait et al 2006 2012 the average precipitation for the total catchment could therefore be higher by 150 225 mm a the annual precipitation exhibits negative trends almost everywhere in the wairau catchment and ranges from zero in the coastal region and the wairau plain to up to 12 mm a in isolated patches in the richmond ranges fig 8b the trends are small or even positive in the west of the catchment which is most likely an artefact of the biased mean annual precipitation in this area as explained above as expected the statistical significance of the trends is low in most of the area red colours in fig 8c the mann kendall p is only close to unity in areas where the trend is close to zero as indicated by the blue colours in fig 8c overall the analysis of the vcsn precipitation data shows ambiguous results although a decrease in annual wairau catchment precipitation over the past 59 years seems very likely 3 2 2 runoff runoff data should provide more evidence to our hypothesis of declining rainfall trends because it is directly related to precipitation and the trends should also be reflected by the runoff data runoff consists of liquid water leaving the catchment both at the surface as streamflow and via the subsurface as groundwater flow since the groundwater discharge to the sea is considered to be stationary see section 2 3 1 we used the wairau river streamflow gauged at barnetts bank fig 2 for the analysis as shown in the lower panel of fig 7 annual average flow in the catchment correlates well with precipitation values averaged over the entire time period about 58 of the precipitation becomes runoff which is a value that appears to be somewhat high for the region however considering the underestimation of the vcsn data in high elevations this value could potentially be 50 or less there is also a negative trend in the runoff values of 116 mm 2 0 mm a that is lower than the trend for precipitation due to its lower absolute values once again the trend is statistically not significant mann kendall p 0 27 but measurements of electrical conductivity ec taken at the wairau river at barnetts bank show a statistically significant increasing trend since the record started in 1988 which suggests that the percentage of older water typically associated with higher ec values has been increasing fig 3e this is consistent with decreasing trends for precipitation and runoff in the catchment 3 2 3 climate oscillation considering the large variability of the observed climate in the wairau catchment and of precipitation in particular we analysed a potential relationship to long term climate oscillations using the ipo index mfe 2017b the results are summarized in fig 9 the quantities depicted in the individual panels are presented as mass curves of the differences to the mean i e cumulative deviations from the average conditions which will subsequently be referred to as anomalies for a better comparison with the ipo index we included smoothed sliding window anomaly functions the window size for smoothing the data was chosen to be 151 2000 and 6000 days for precipitation groundwater heads and runoff respectively in marlborough positive ipo phases correlate with a warmer moister climate while negative values indicate a cooler dryer climate phase the average precipitation in marlborough was 4 8 higher during the ipo positive phase between 1977 and 1998 as compared to the preceding negative ipo phase mfe 2018 2020 correspondingly the time series depicted in fig 9 are divided in ipo positive phases 1977 1998 and since 2014 and ipo negative phases 1945 1976 and 1999 2013 in addition to the ipo index which is a measure of climate variability at time scales of 10 30 years fig 9a shows the oceanic niño index oni which is an indicator for the el niño southern oscillation with positive el niño and negative la niña phases alternating at 3 7 year intervals the negative ipo phase 1945 1976 is not discussed in the analysis because the data records start in the middle of this period the ipo index was available only until 2016 and the recent entry into an ipo positive phase has to be treated with some caution it remains to be seen whether the later years support a recent phase change so far the precipitation anomaly depicted in fig 9b doesn t support an ipo warm phase with a wetter climate time periods that are wetter than the average are indicated by an increase of the anomaly curve whereas dryer periods show a decrease the anomaly remains constant for periods with average conditions the positive phase between 1977 and 1998 shows an increase consistent with higher than average precipitation fig 9b the curve starts to decrease in 1999 indicating lower than average precipitation that is consistent with the negative ipo phase but it continues to decrease also after 2013 suggesting that the current warm phase is not leading to wetter than normal years or that the negative phase continues the opposite trend is observed for the potential evapotranspiration anomaly that also continues past 2013 vcsn data only available from 1972 this is an expected result because potential evapotranspiration pet is typically anti correlated with precipitation the catchment runoff anomaly depicted in fig 9c shows a higher variability over time and also an intermittent decrease in the positive ipo phase 1977 1998 but the dynamics of the smoothed curve is similar to the one for precipitation one significant difference can be seen for the years 2010 2015 where the anomaly is well correlated with the increasing ipo index that is not visible in the precipitation anomaly the flow data are less uncertain than the precipitation data but even though the vcsn data are biased trends should still become visible if they are systematically biased however the uncertainty in precipitation data is large also because different and unknown numbers of meteorological stations were used for the interpolation of the vcsn data at different periods of time the runoff anomaly for the waihopai river which flows into the wairau river at the upper wairau plain fig 2 is depicted in fig 9d it has a very similar shape to the wairau river flow anomaly and also exhibits above average flows for the years 2010 2015 but a decrease between 2015 and 2019 the direct analysis of the correlation between climate oscillation and the wairau plain storage was challenging because none of the groundwater head observations on the wairau plain dates back to 1960 however the record for the wratts rd well p3009 dates back to 1996 and could be complemented with the record of well p0238 located in the vicinity fig 2 this well has a record from 1958 to 1996 with a short overlapping period to adjust for the bias originating from a slightly upstream position the anomaly of the extended record of groundwater heads is depicted in fig 9e data gaps in the 1970 s were not filled there can be some artefacts in the early years caused by pumping in the vicinity of p0238 but groundwater heads have been lower than average even during the positive wetter ipo phase and were declining since 1982 it is noteworthy that the recent period of higher than average runoff observed for the wairau river catchment 2010 2015 has not resulted in correspondingly increasing groundwater levels aquifer storage this is an indicator that aquifer storage corresponds not only to climate but that there are other influencing factors as will be described in the following sections the results suggest that climate oscillation has an impact on long term trends in precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff in the wairau river catchment it is more than likely that climate change is superimposed on top of these oscillations meaning that a full recovery to previous meteorological conditions during the last positive ipo phase is also unlikely climate projections suggest an even drier and warmer future climate which will put further stress on the availability of water resources in the region mfe 2018 3 2 4 weather and climate in contrast to climate that determines the long term average meteorological conditions of a region weather describes the short term conditions which can impact the annual cycle of aquifer storage depletion and recharge a detailed analysis of wairau aquifer depletion was conducted for the time period 2010 2019 a period that includes three years with particularly dry summers 2012 2015 previous modelling analysis has demonstrated that the rate of groundwater recharge from the wairau river is mostly in the range between 7 and 15 m³ s the rate of recharge declines rapidly when wairau river flows are below 20 m³ s wöhling et al 2018 the years 2012 2015 were affected by distinctive and sustained low flow periods as shown in fig 10 a note the log scale a concurrent strong decline in groundwater levels of well p3009 and also of the manageable aquifer storage was observed figs 10b and 5 b respectively it is important to note that after a year with a prolonged low flow period the groundwater levels and aquifer storage do not recover to the previous year s maximum values despite the river recharge during the winter months summing up to a multitude of the depleted volume the summer low groundwater levels and aquifer storage keep on decreasing for the consecutive years 2012 2015 until they almost reach critical levels twice dashed line in fig 10b aquifer storage is only refilled to higher levels in years when the annual river low flow period is interrupted by higher flow events 2011 2012 and 2016 or when levels remain high throughout the summer 2017 these results provide evidence that the occurrence and extent of wairau river low flow periods with q 20 m³ s is of high significance to the sustainable management of the wairau plain aquifer currently wairau river flows are managed via a policy with three bands of water allocation class a permits are available at flows above 8 m³ s at the gauge at barnetts bank no water takes below that limit which is approximately 90 95 of the time class b permits are available for wairau river flows above 15 m³ s and class c permits allow abstraction when flows are above 30 m³ s these allocations and limits are currently being reconsidered in the drafting of the marlborough environment plan and future changes are possible our results suggest that aquifer storage may benefit from an adjustment of the management policy towards higher minimum flows to minimise the effect of extended low flow periods since the extent of low flow periods seems to be a crucial factor for aquifer storage recovery we counted in each year the number of days with wairau river flow below a threshold of 20 m³ s then we averaged the number of low flow days for the different ipo phases to analyse the relationship between the frequency and climate oscillation the results are depicted in fig 11 the average number of days with low flow during the previous positive ipo phase 1977 1998 was 28 days and significantly lower than the number in the previous and later negative phases this is consistent with expectations since positive ipo phases bring wetter climate to marlborough although more annual precipitation does not necessarily mean more precipitation in summer during the recent negative i e dryer ipo phase of 1999 2013 river flow was below 20 m³ s at an average of 57 days annually with a peak value of 119 days in 2001 such extended low flow periods were also observed in the negative ipo phase ending in 1976 but the average duration for that period was distinctively shorter 43 days the recent entry of a positive ipo phase is not yet reflected by a distinct decrease of low flow days at 47 days the average count is still above the previous negative phase 2019 was a year with particularly low flow levels that lasted almost for two months and 2015 brought a large count of 91 days below 20 m³ s that ranks 5th in the 60 year record low flow frequency analysis has also been conducted for a threshold of 10 m³ s which shows a similar pattern fig 11 the average count for 2013 2019 is 21 days the highest number in any of the previous ipo periods and more than 4 times the value of the previous positive ipo phase 5 days this is mainly due to the years 2019 and 2015 which attained the 4th and 5th largest counts on record respectively the results suggest that the frequency of low flow periods has increased in the past two decades and that there is a trend to more extreme low flow values low river flow is naturally correlated to climate drivers mainly to the temporal distribution and intensity of summer precipitation but non stationarity of the catchment characteristics such as land cover changes and upstream surface subsurface water management are potential additional factors that have an impact on the occurrence and severity of low flow periods since these periods have a strong adverse effect on wairau aquifer recharge it is necessary to disentangle the climate drivers and to review management options to sustain higher flows in the river during summer 3 3 river morphology the previous section showed that climatic drivers and particularly river low flows are important factors determining the dynamics of wairau aquifer storage trends in these climate driven variables will lead to corresponding trends in the aquifer if the hydrological regime of the wairau aquifer is solely determined by climate and weather we should be able to build a model that represents aquifer storage and spring flows equally well for current and past conditions we tested this hypothesis by extending the modflow model presented in wöhling et al 2018 the model was originally set up for the time period july 2013 to february 2017 here we extend the simulations to april 2019 and back in time to january 2000 the parameter set derived from calibration 07 2013 05 2016 was then used to conduct a single model run for the extended time period the corresponding simulated groundwater heads at the wells p3821 and p3009 and spring creek flows are presented in fig 12 b d light blue dashed line together with the observed values red the model simulations fit well to the observations for the time period 2012 2019 but exhibit visible deviations for the years prior to 2011 the bias computed for the entire simulation period is 0 41 m 0 14 m and 0 29 m³ s for well p3821 well p3009 and spring creek flows respectively this suggests that hydro meteorological drivers alone do not explain the observed trends in the wairau aquifer inspecting the model simulation further it appears that a singular event in mid 2011 may have caused a change in the hydrological regime because the model calibrated to recent time conditions exhibits a larger bias prior to that date singular events common in new zealand are earthquakes several strong quakes occurred in 2010 and 2011 in canterbury about 250 km to the south these quakes were not strongly felt in marlborough however and since groundwater levels didn t respond to these events quakes were excluded as a potential reason for the hydrological regime change of the wairau aquifer floods are also singular events the wairau river carried several large floods between 2010 and 2012 the largest flood event peaked at 2918 m³ s on 16 05 2011 daily averages are depicted in fig 12a this event was the largest in the simulation period and ranks 8th in the 60 year flow record of the wairau river historic floods 1868 and 1923 were certainly much larger but we hypothesise that the erosive forces of the may 2011 event were large enough to erode and incise the river bed and to cause lower river recharge rates as a result c f section 2 3 3 to test this hypothesis we used two different parameterizations of the river bed geometry in the model simulations the calibrated parameter set was used for may 2011 to the end of the simulation period details about the model and its parameterization are presented in wöhling et al 2018 and therefore not repeated here a slightly different parameter set representing a less eroded river bed was used for simulating the time period prior to may 2011 value of geometric function exponent b manually adjusted by factor 1 115 for the same flow values the new parameterization yields higher water levels in the river compared to the calibrated parameter set fig 4 the simulation results with the combined bias corrected parameterization are depicted in fig 12b d in blue continuous line groundwater levels and spring creek flows are visibly higher for the time period prior to may 2011 the bias to the observation was reduced in all observations to 0 14 m 0 07 m and 0 10 m³ s for well p3821 well p3009 and spring creek flows respectively this suggests that bed degradation is a potential contributing factor for the long term decline in groundwater levels the model simulations support the hypothesis of a singular event causing a hydrological regime change a change in river morphology following the 2011 flood or a series of larger floods between 2010 and 2012 is a likely cause for this change understanding the processes for the changes in river groundwater interaction is the topic of current research mbie 2019 it is conceivable that not only singular events have an impact on river morphology and lead to a corresponding change in the hydrological regime but also gradual longer term erosion and deposition processes these can have natural causes and or can be a delayed result of river training measures as well as sediment trapping and gravel extraction 4 summary and conclusions this study analysed a range of natural and anthropogenic factors influencing the hydrological regime of the wairau plain aquifer to understand the mechanisms for the observed decline in groundwater levels and spring flows several factors were identified that act at different time scales these factors include long term climate oscillation seasonality of the hydro meteorological conditions changes in river bed morphology as well as surface water and groundwater abstraction disentangling and ranking these factors was challenging because of the uncertainty or absence of data the main limitations of the study are a poor knowledge of actual abstraction rates the role of the complex river bed morphology and the spatial and temporal variations of the flow between the active river channel and the aquifer however the combination of targeted monitoring with hypothesis driven modelling provided evidence on the likely causes for the observed trends the main results and conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows 95 of aquifer recharge originates from wairau river losses aquifer storage exhibits a strong seasonality 10 15 million m³ and is recovered only in april to june the annual recharge volume is 17 25 times the dynamic storage but only a fraction of it is accessible for management because the majority is discharged again as spring flows after a dry year storage only recovers in a wet summer when wairau river flows don t fall below 20 m³ s a series of dry summers leads to a progressive storage depletion storage is naturally depleted between november and march due to lower wairau river flows which coincides with the months of highest irrigation demand groundwater abstraction accounts for up to 51 of the observed storage decrease during these months a further increase in abstraction will have a direct adverse effect on aquifer storage in summer climate oscillations of 10 30 years lead to alternating wetter dryer conditions in marlborough and the wairau river catchment a recent change towards wetter conditions is not yet seen in the hydrological record climate oscillations are likely to be superimposed by climate predictions for a warmer dryer and potentially more extreme climate in marlborough mfe 2018 aquifer recharge declines rapidly for river flows 20 m³ s the occurrence and extent of low flow periods is correlated to climate phases but the number of days with low flow is increasing overall which is a major cause of declining aquifer storage these effects are intensified by abstraction climate and weather alone don t fully explain the observed trends in the aquifer singular effects such as floods and earthquakes have the potential to change the hydrological regime it was demonstrated that river bed geometry changes caused by erosion during major floods can lead to a lasting decrease in groundwater levels and spring flows losses of total aquifer storage by river erosion are possibly permanent the estimated loss of the live dynamic storage between 1997 and 2019 is 20 there is a risk of further storage losses by future extreme flood events or major earthquakes the results from this study suggest that both natural and anthropogenic factors are responsible for the decline of average groundwater storage and spring flows the storage of the wairau aquifer is naturally very dynamic due to its highly transmissive gravels and is essentially acting as an extension of the wairau river any changes in the river regime have an almost immediate effect on aquifer storage options to mitigate storage losses include managing higher flows in summer through the river abstraction allocation system extending on site water storage for irrigation to reduce summer groundwater abstraction river management to increase braiding and sediment management to prevent further river bed incision and erosion at the upper wairau plain further investigations are currently under way to better understand the mechanisms preventing storage refilling after extended low flow periods in summer in a future climate the stresses on the wairau aquifer are likely to increase manageable aquifer storage is particularly vulnerable to an increase in the duration of low flow periods in summer which is already visible in the 60 year record of the wairau river the hydrological regime of the wairau river is typical for rivers of new zealand s east coast and the results from this study can possibly be transferred to these systems too credit

8318,study region jemma sub basin upper blue nile basin ethiopia study focus this study develops watershed management alternatives which can ensure optimal climate change adaptation benefits under different climate scenarios the climate scenarios were developed using the statistically bias corrected multi model ensemble mean and the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios the hydrological impact of climate change was assessed using a multi gauge calibrated and validated the soil and water assessment tool swat model watershed management alternatives were prioritized using a multi criteria decision analysis which intercompared watershed management criteria and alternatives through the analytic hierarchy process new hydrological insights the findings showed a consistent decline of rainfall surface runoff and total water yield under all climate scenarios and climate impact scenarios water harvesting structures were the most prioritized watershed management alternatives to reduce climate change impacts more than half of the watersheds of the jemma sub basin are highly and optimally suitable for in situ water harvesting under baseline and future climate scenarios observed terrace and anticipated in situ water harvesting structures significantly p 0 05 reduced surface runoff and thereby significantly increase soil water under baseline and future climate scenarios however both in situ and ex situ water harvesting structures caused an insignificant change in the total water yield under climate scenarios we conclude implementing in situ water harvesting structures can help to increase green water without a decline in blue water keywords climate change watershed management scenarios multi criteria decision analysis jemma sub basin blue nile basin 1 introduction contemporary water management practices are not up to the challenges of the plausible climate change in several regions of the world snover et al 2003 bates et al 2008 wmo 2009 as a result there is a strong consensus that water resources management decisions should consider climate change information ipcc 2007 bates et al 2008 yang et al 2012 however in several regions of the world existing climate adaptation strategies were developed based on historical hydro climatic data which has a narrow margin to buffer future climate change impacts wmo 2009 different climate change adaptation strategies that consider future climate change scenarios are essential to adapt a wide range of climate change conditions ipcc 2007 hallegatte 2009 therefore an array of robust climate adaptation options are required to reduce future climate change and climate extreme impacts furthermore designing water management systems that can cope with climate change impacts is challenging due to uncertainties in climate change projections yang et al 2012 kundzewicz et al 2018 the uncertainties can stem from assumptions in the future socio economic development scenarios and associated greenhouse gas emission scenarios the conceptualization of the gcms and downscaling methods ipcc 2013 kundzewicz et al 2018 the uncertainties in climate models could limit from directly using the outputs of climate models to develop adaptation strategies hallegatte 2009 to address uncertainties the ensemble of several climate model outputs generated using multiple climate scenarios has been recommended snover et al 2003 yang et al 2012 further climate scenarios with low uncertainty are essential to develop robust climate adaptation strategies that can provide optimal benefits of reducing the impacts of future climate change ipcc 2007 kuikman et al 2009 haque 2016 besides the uncertainty in the science of climate change developing a robust climate change adaption policy is also influenced by the trade offs between environmental and economic objectives chung and lee 2016 therefore climate change adaptation decisions should balance the societal technological and institutional responses to ensure long term sustainability usaid 2013 consequently relevant stakeholders at all levels should be involved to ensure climate adaptation policies that transcend generations haque 2016 to this end decision support systems can play a critical role to inform a balanced accounting of environment and economic factors multi criteria decision analysis mcda systems have been considered as critical approaches to develop climate change adaptation strategies that can incorporate economic environmental and social factors so as to ensure optimal benefits ipcc 2007 kuikman et al 2009 haque 2016 multi criteria decision systems enable comparing different but competing criteria and selecting the best alternatives malczewski 2006 the ethiopian national adaptation programmes of action napas has used the mcda to identify and prioritize the national climate change adaptation strategies nma 2007 in ethiopia the community based watershed development guideline was developed in 2005 desta et al 2005 having appropriate site selection and implementation of watershed management technologies as its main objectives the guideline considered observed climatic conditions especially rainfall as its main criteria however it fails to recognize a potential change in the climate contrary to the guideline it is recognized that climate change affects the potential of existing water resources management structures and less likely to be effective under future climate conditions hallegatte 2009 there are also mounting evidence that climate change may impact water quantity soil erosion and nutrient loading and also may amplify water variability ipcc 2013 therefore water resources and watershed management planning should account for climate change to design resilient adaptation and mitigation measures under the scrutiny of different criteria in the upper blue nile basin amdihun et al 2014 and dile et al 2016 have applied gis based multi criteria decision analysis to identify suitable areas for water harvesting and other soil and water management structures under historical climate condition different from the previous studies the current study considered different climate scenarios climate impact scenarios existing biophysical settings and the perspectives of farmers and experts to identify optimal watershed management alternatives under changing climate conditions in the watersheds of the jemma sub basin of upper blue nile basin in the jemma sub basin an increase in rainfall and temperature extremes which could exacerbate the repercussion of climate change on water resources and agricultural systems was investigated worku et al 2018a future climate change scenarios consistently describe a decrease in mean annual rainfall in the jemma sub basin worku et al 2019 therefore it is worthwhile to devise watershed management technologies that sustain water resources availability in the face of climate change in the watersheds of the jemma sub basin in fact through the food for work program different watershed management interventions such as fanya juu cutoff drains stone and soil bunds and afforestation have been implemented since the 1970s hurni 1985 herweg and ludi 1999 however terraces were constructed on only about 42 of the jemma sub basin up until 2016 google earth 2016 whilst huge and optimal soil and water management investment is essential moreover watershed management technologies that could provide optimal adaptation benefits and their areas of suitability were not identified the objective of this study is to develop watershed management alternatives that could provide optimal benefits of climate change adaptation and to evaluate their effectiveness under different climate scenarios in the watersheds of the jemma sub basin consequently this study straddles climate scenarios hydrological climate change impact assessment and farmers and watershed management experts view through gis based mcda to develop watershed management planning in the face of climate change the outputs from climate and hydrological models were used in the mcda to identify alternative watershed management interventions in each watershed of the jemma sub basin the methodological framework and the findings of this study can provide empirical evidences to different climate change adaptation programs of ethiopia such as ethiopia s national adaptation plan nap eth fdre 2019 and the water and energy sector of climate resilience strategy fdre 2015 in different climate adaptation programs of ethiopia reducing climate change impacts and building resilience on water agriculture and other sectors is the main goal however an insufficient link between climate information and climate adaptation strategies are realized to reduce climate change impacts in ethiopia world bank 2006 conway and schipper 2011 thus this study can help the national climate adaptation plans of ethiopia to identify optimal climate adaptation alternatives through integrating climate scenarios hydrological climate change impact assessment biophysical settings and farmers and experts perspectives in the wake of climate change this study also inculcates watershed development policies and programs in ethiopia should thoroughly use robust climate change scenarios and realize climate sensitive watershed planning 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area is the jemma sub basin located in the central highlands of ethiopia south eastern part of the upper blue nile fig 1 which has an area of 15 000 km2 administratively jemma intersects the amhara and oromia regional states of ethiopia north shewa zone of the amhara region and north shewa zone of oromia region largely drained by the jemma sub basin jemma sub basin is among the sub basins of the upper blue nile basin of ethiopia which covers 8 of the area and 14 of the total annual flow of upper blue nile basin yilma and awulachew 2009 the topography of the jemma sub basin is characterized by uneven topography and dissected terrain where elevation varies with short distance the southern part of the sub basin is plain with even topography and gentle slope fig 3 however the central areas of the sub basin are highly dissected terrains elevation in the sub basin is in the order of 1040 3840 meters above sea level the eastern part of the sub basin is under high elevation above 3000 m a s l and dominantly afro alpine and sub afro alpine ecosystems the high elevation in this part of the sub basin is the water divide of the upper blue nile basin and awash river basins of ethiopia the rainfall of central highland of ethiopia is driven by the moisture from the indian ocean equatorial east pacific gulf of guinea mediterranean region and arabian peninsula viste and sorteberg 2011 jemma sub basin receives mean annual rainfall in the order of about 700 mm 1500 mm from 1981 to 2014 in this sub basin the baseline climate 1981 2014 revealed an increasing trend of mean annual and mean summer season rainfall and a decreasing trend of mean spring season rainfall worku et al 2018a there are areas of the sub basin with relatively low mean annual temperature 9 c and in contrast there are areas with high mean annual temperature 24 c land use and land cover classification of the year 2008 in the jemma sub basin revealed that about 57 of the sub basin was cultivated land fig 3 which may require some form of watershed management interventions other land uses and land cover types include grazing land 14 64 bare land 10 45 shrub land 6 44 woodland 6 05 and forestland 1 20 there are also afro alpine vegetation eucalyptus plantations and water bodies on the main course of the rivers which cover a small proportion of the sub basin the rivers channel and the lower part of the sub basin are characterized by bare land the soil types in the jemma sub basin include eutric vertisols 28 07 lithic leptosols 37 44 chromic lixisols 8 07 pellic vertisols 6 82 haplic luvisols 5 79 haplic acrisols 6 82 eutric fluvisols umbric nitisols and alic nitisols cover a small proportion of the sub basin wlrc 2016 leptosols and vertisols are the main soil types which cover more than 70 of the jemma sub basin sand load clay and loam are soil texture classes in the sub basin fig 3 due to the expansion of cultivated land and grazing lands towards the steep slopes and marginal lands jemma is highly prone to soil erosion 2 2 framework of the study this study integrates climate scenarios climate impact scenarios hydrological climate impact assessment biophysical settings and farmers and watershed management experts perspectives to prioritize optimal watersheds based adaptation alternatives that reduce the anticipated impact of climate change as a result baseline climate scenario future climate scenarios and hydrological climate impact scenarios were developed subsequently gis based multi criteria decision analysis was used to bridge spatial data such as climate and hydrological models output with non spatial data such as stakeholders perspectives pertaining to watershed management alternatives under climate change malczewski 2006 the hydrological model was also used to evaluate the effectiveness of prioritize watershed management alternatives fig 2 presents the integration of climate scenarios climate impact scenarios biophysical factors and the multi criteria decision analysis to develop optimal watersheds based adaptation decision making 2 3 data types and sources 2 3 1 observed climate and hydrological data observed climate data was required to establish baseline climate scenario future climate scenarios and hydrological climate impact scenarios thus observed 1981 2014 data of daily rainfall tmax tmin solar radiation sunshine wind speed and relative humidity of nine climatic stations of the jemma basin were obtained from the ethiopian national meteorological services agency nma 2007 daily streamflow data of gauge stations was obtained from the ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and electricity the hydrologic data was used to calibrate and validate the hydrological model and to develop baseline hydrologic balance components 2 3 2 regional climate models data historical 1981 2005 and future 2021 2100 regional climate model rcm simulations driven by four cmip5 gcms were used in this study the cmip5 gcms which were used as initial boundary conditions were cnrm cm5 ec earth hadgem2 es and mpi esm lr whilst the rcms which were used to regionalize these gcms are the cclm4 consortium for small scale modeling cosmo climate limited area model cclm version 4 8 and remo max planck institute regional model rcm simulations driven through the representative concentration pathways 8 5 rcp8 5 and rcp 4 5 moss et al 2010 were considered detail on rcms selection is given at worku et al 2018b 2 3 3 biophysical data the spatial data which include slope soil texture and land use data were acquired from different sources fig 3 slope map was generated from 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem which was obtained from the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm the land use map for the year 2008 was derived from landsat satellite imagery supervised image classification using maximum likelihood algorithm was performed to develop the land use map the soil data which include soil texture and other physical and chemical properties of soil was obtained from the ministry of water irrigation and electricity of ethiopian and water and land resources center of ethiopia wlrc 2016 all the spatial data were projected into the projection parameters for ethiopia which is utm zone of wgs 1984 37 n 2 3 4 land and water management data land and water management structures such as terraces and other physical soil and water management structures that were implemented in the watersheds of the jemma sub basin since the 1980s were identified through google earth satellite images and field surveys fig 1 particularly google earth image 2016 was used to map observed soil and water management structures in the watersheds besides field observations were made to identify soil and water management structures in different areas of the sub basin 2 3 5 qualitative data qualitative data was collected through interviews with farmers and natural resources and watershed management experts seven sample watersheds were selected to cover all elevation classes of the sub basin fig 1 in these sample watersheds 56 farmers were interviewed 8 from each watershed however two questionnaires were not complete the sampling is based on ethiopia s watershed development guideline desta et al 2005 the guideline designates that the kebele watershed team watershed team at lowest administrative level comprises seven members however in the recent watershed management campaigns particularly since 2010 the role of religious leaders is pivotal and as a result we include one religious leader at each watershed in principle development agent da is to be a member of the kebele watershed team however in all kebele watershed teams no da is available in such cases we include kebele s model farmer in the interview in all watersheds all kebele watershed team members are farmers during interview farmers were requested to list watershed management alternatives that could provide optimal benefits of climate change adaptation particularly climate change characterized by a reduction of rainfall and water availability the interview was also conducted with 13 5 and 12 natural resources and watershed management experts of woreda zonal and federal offices respectively the experts were requested to identify the criteria and alternatives of watershed management for climate change adaptation watershed management alternatives most frequently suggested by the farmers and the experts were subject to pairwise inter comparison and weighting similarly criteria most frequently suggested by experts were considered for weighting however only experts were involved to give weight for alternatives and criteria through pairwise inter comparison in the analytical hierarchy process 2 4 methods 2 4 1 climate change scenarios the study used the period 1981 2014 as a baseline scenario to assess the change in climate to develop future climate scenarios rcm simulations which better reproduce the historical climate of the jemma sub basin were used worku et al 2018b rcm simulations were further adjusted using a robust statistical bias correction technique for this different statistical bias correction methods were intercompared using different metrics the distribution mapping method was superior to other techniques to adjust mean values intensity and frequency of rcm simulations with observed counterparts worku et al 2019 consequently rcm simulations bias adjusted using distribution mapping technique were used to develop climate change scenarios for the near term future 2021 2050 and long term future 2071 2100 2 4 2 hydrological climate impact scenarios to develop climate impact scenarios the hydrological model i e the soil and water assessment tool swat model was used based on slope land use and soil the swat model discretizes the jemma sub basin into hydrological response units hrus the soil conservation service scs curve number method and the penman monteith method were used to estimate surface runoff and potential evapotranspiration pet respectively the swat model was calibrated and validated using multi site calibration and validation approach cao et al 2006 on sufi 2 in swat cup abbaspour and johnson 2004 the performance of the model during calibration and validation was evaluated using nash and sutcliffe simulation efficiency nse and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2015 the uncertainty of model simulation was also evaluated using p factor and the r factor on the sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour and johnson 2004 eventually the calibrated swat model was used to simulate hydrological processes under baseline and different future climate scenarios detail of hydrological climate change impact assessment is given in worku et al 2020 2 4 3 multi criteria decision analysis technique and procedures 2 4 3 1 define the problem and the stakeholders climate change scenarios at the jemma sub basin revealed a reduction of rainfall in the near and long term future worku et al 2019 this indicates that climate change will be a major constraint to the agriculture and water related sectors in the future this finding also suggests watershed management interventions need to be implemented to address the likely water shortage that may occur due to climate change in this study farmers and experts were the main stakeholders and involved to identify and prioritize criteria and watershed management alternatives in the wake of climate change 2 4 3 2 defining and weighting criteria criteria to prioritize watershed management alternatives under climate change were identified through interviews with experts besides the national climate adaptation action plan of ethiopia nma 2007 was also used to identify criteria we conducted interviews with 30 watershed management and natural resource officers at woreda zonal and national levels such a process helped to identify the most critical criteria to be considered in the selection of watershed management alternatives for climate adaptation watershed management experts opinion was used to estimate the weights of different criteria using the analytic hierarchy process ahp ahp is a structured multi criteria decision analysis technique that is used to estimate the weight of different but competing criteria saaty 1990 the ahp process relies on expert judgment of the perceived relative importance of criteria on a pairwise basis resulting in a set of weights for criteria it uses a matrix of pairwise comparisons to assign a weight for each criterion and determine the relative importance of two or more criteria ahp also tests whether the pairwise comparisons are consistent or not using a consistency ratio cr saaty 1994 the cr was calculated as c r c i r i where ci is the consistency index which is expressed as c i λ m a x n n 1 where λ max the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix and n is the order of the criteria ri is the random index which is the randomly generated index of the matrix saaty 1994 if the cr is 0 1 10 or less the criteria analysis is considered reasonable otherwise it is considered less consistent and requires a revision saaty 1990 2 4 3 3 defining and weighting of watershed management alternatives watershed management alternatives under climate conditions characterized by a reduction in rainfall and water availability were listed out through interviews with farmers and experts besides the community based participatory watershed management guideline desta et al 2005 of ethiopia was also used to identify potential watershed management alternatives based on these approaches eight watershed management alternatives were found relevant for climate change adaptation in the jemma watershed watershed management alternatives include physical and biological soil and water management crop change water harvesting land use change reclaim degraded lands introduce new crop varieties area closure and agroforestry see supplementary 1 physical and biological soil and water management mainly intended to reduce soil erosion and include physical and biological structures crop change embraces changes from one cereal to another cereal or from annual to perennial crops water harvesting embraces in situ and ex situ water harvesting structures the in situ water harvesting micro catchments are structures to capture and store rainfall where it falls terraces soil stone bunds trenches tie ridging micro basins and fanya juu are categorized as in situ water harvesting systems mati et al 2006 biazin et al 2012 the ex situ water harvesting structures macro catchment are to collect water from a large area water collection catchment and store rainwater using storage structures structures like ponds and dams are categorized as ex situ water harvesting structures mati et al 2006 biazin et al 2012 watershed management experts opinion used to intercompare and prioritize the most important alternatives through pairwise comparison matrix using ahp watershed management alternatives under each criterion were also compared and weight was assigned for each alternative using ahp by comparing eight alternatives under seven criteria the overall priority of alternative pi was estimated as the weight of criterion multiplied by the weight of the alternative under each criterion the pi of alternative ai is calculated as p i j 1 n a i j w j where aij is the weight of alternative i with respect to criterion j and wj is the weight of criterion j saaty 1990 2 4 4 suitability analysis using weighted overlay analysis after identifying and prioritizing watershed management alternatives suitability analysis was performed to identify a suitable spatial implementation of prioritized watershed management alternatives using gis based weighted overlay analysis malczewski 2000 in the multi criteria decision analysis water harvesting structures were prioritized followed by physical and biological soil and water management structures according to fao 2003 guideline climate hydrology topography agronomy and soil are the most important criteria to identify suitable sites for water harvesting structures therefore rainfall and surface runoff outputs under different climate scenarios and hydrological climate impact scenarios were used as factors to the suitability analysis all input layers which include rainfall surface runoff land use slope and soil texture were reclassified into five suitability classes suitability score before overlaying these layers tables 1 and 2 the suitability score of in situ and ex situ water harvesting structures was developed based on literature desta et al 2005 mati et al 2006 dile et al 2016 hurni et al 2016 similar to the weighting of criteria and alternatives the ahp was also used to assign a weight wi to rainfall surface runoff slope land use and soil texture the ahp process relies on expert judgment which helped to produce a suitability map the ahp returned a set of percentage weights for each factor finally these weights were used in a weighted spatial overlay analysis in order to create suitability map of in situ and ex situ water harvesting the weight of each factor reflects the relative importance in determining the in situ and ex situ water harvesting structures based on the pairwise comparison the weight of factors to design in situ water harvesting is as follows rainfall 31 2 surface runoff 24 1 slope 19 land use 17 9 and soil texture 7 9 similarly the weight of factors to design ex situ water harvesting is as follows slope 30 2 surface runoff 24 8 rainfall 20 4 land use 13 8 and soil texture 11 the suitability score can be calculated as s w i x i where s is the suitability score wi is the weight of factor i and xi is suitability score of factor i malczewski 2000 2 4 5 evaluation of effectiveness of watershed management scenarios the effectiveness of prioritized watershed management alternatives after multi criteria decision analysis and suitability analysis and observed terrace in reducing the negative impact of baseline and future climate change was evaluated using the swat model specifically there were three main scenarios and subject to comparison scenario 0 baseline this scenario is used to show the water balance components under baseline and future climate scenarios in this scenario prioritized watershed management alternatives were not considered and represented on the swat model this scenario embraces sub scenarios from a e table 3 scenario 1 climate change observed terrace this scenario was used to assess the effectiveness of observed terrace on water balance components under baseline and future climate scenarios currently on 6562 km2 42 71 of the watersheds of the sub basin terrace and other physical soil and water management structures were implemented watersheds under observed terrace were identified and represented on the swat model to analyze changes on surface runoff soil water and total water yield terraces have the effect of reducing slope which thereby reduces surface runoff and peak flow by impounding water in small depressions thus observed terraces were represented by modifying slope length slsubbsn desta et al 2005 hurni et al 2016 curve number cn arnold et al 2012 and usle p universal soil loss equation management factor gebremichael et al 2005 table 4 this scenario encompasses the sub scenarios from f j table 3 scenario 2 climate change watershed management alternatives prioritized using multi criteria decision analysis mcda and suitability analysis sa this scenario was used to evaluate the effect of prioritized watershed management alternatives in situ and ex situ water harvesting and biological soil and water management structures on water balance components under baseline and future climate scenarios watersheds suitable for in situ and ex situ water harvesting and biological soil and water management structures were identified and represented on the swat model to analyze changes in surface runoff soil water and total water yield the slsubbsn cn and usle p were modified to represent in situ water harvesting structures table 4 whereas pnd fr fraction of sub basin area that drains into ponds were modified to represent ex situ water harvesting structures table 4 the in situ water harvesting structures were represented in the swat model based on hurni et al 2016 arnold et al 2012 gebremichael et al 2005 recommendations whereas the ex situ water harvesting structures were represented in the swat model as recommended by waidler et al 2011 and biological alternatives i e filter strips were based on betrie et al 2011 hurni et al 2016 scenario 2 embraces sub scenarios from k o table 3 changes in soil water surface runoff and total water yield as a response to observed terrace under baseline and future climate scenarios scenario 1 were analyzed similarly changes in soil water surface runoff and total water yield and as a response to in situ water harvesting ex situ water harvesting and filter strips under baseline and future climate scenarios scenario 2 were analyzed differences in effectiveness between the various scenarios were studied using t tests p 0 05 3 result and discussion 3 1 climate and hydrological conditions under climate scenarios the baseline climate 1981 2014 exhibited an increasing trend of mean annual and mean summer season rainfall in more than 78 of the stations and a subsidence of spring season rainfall in most of the stations worku et al 2018a however under future climate scenarios a decrease in mean annual rainfall was projected fig 4 the statistical bias corrected output of ensemble mean of rcms showed a decline of mean annual rainfall in the range of 23 in the near term 2021 2050 and 19 in the long term 2071 2100 climate conditions under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios worku et al 2019 the projected future rainfall had similar spatial pattern with the observed rainfall where lower rainfall is projected in the northern part of the sub basin the surface runoff output under baseline and future climate impact scenarios is based on worku et al 2020 all future climate scenarios presented a decline of surface run off but in different magnitude there will be maximum reduction of surface runoff 65 under rcp8 5 2021 2050 climate scenario followed by under rcp4 5 2021 2050 climate scenario for which 63 reduction of surface runoff was estimated fig 5 in long term climate scenarios 2071 2100 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 lower reduction of surface runoff is projected mainly attributed to the higher rainfall projected in the long term climate scenarios than the near term scenarios 3 2 criteria and alternatives of watershed management in the multi criteria decision analysis contribution to retain water is the most prioritized criteria to select watershed management alternatives for climate change adaptation in the jemma sub basin table 5 contribution to reduce flood and soil erosion and contribution to the economy are other important criteria among the criteria less weight is given to the criterion i e coherence of the intended alternative with the objectives of napa of ethiopia and other development programs the criterion i e the inexpensiveness of technology in terms of money and labor has also given less weight this might be due to good access to labor for watershed management in the study area through pairwise comparison matrix water harvesting which includes in situ and ex situ water harvesting structures were the most prioritized watershed management alternative for climate change adaptation next to water harvesting physical and biological soil and water management are the most prioritized watershed management alternatives table 6 the weight of each alternative under each criterion was also compared the overall priority ranking table 7 showed that water harvesting structures are the most preferred alternatives to build resilience for future climate under few criteria for instance contribution to the economy high weight is given to other alternatives i e for crop change and introducing new crop varieties than water harvesting structures table 7 similar to this study the ipcc fourth assessment report has also recommended the expansion of water harvesting storage structures and indigenous practices for sustainable water use ipcc 2007 there are also other studies which prioritize water harvesting for climate change adaptation and adaptation under uncertainty hallegatte 2009 haque 2016 in the ethiopian climate resilience strategy water harvesting was identified as among the strategies to buffer the negative impact of climate change fdre 2019 however to get optimal benefit from water harvesting optimal site identification is the most important step desta et al 2005 dile et al 2016 3 3 suitability analysis the weighted overlay suitability analysis has shown that most watersheds of the jemma sub basin are suitable for in situ water harvesting structures more than 50 of the watersheds are highly and optimally suitable for in situ water harvesting structures under baseline near and long term future climate scenarios fig 6 this is because more weight was given for rainfall and the amount of rainfall under baseline and future climate scenarios is highly and optimally suitable for in situ water harvesting structures about 74 of the watersheds are suitable for in situ water harvesting under the baseline climate scenario unlike the baseline climate scenario less than 62 of the watersheds are optimally and highly suitable for in situ water harvesting structures under future climate scenarios table 8 the decline of rainfall under future climate scenarios is the main constraint to find large areas of the watersheds highly and optimally suitable for water harvesting structures the watersheds in the northern part of the sub basin are moderately suitable for ex situ water harvesting mainly attributed to low rainfall under baseline and future climate scenarios the lower slope 8 is considered as not highly and optimally suitable because designing in situ harvesting structures in this slope class could trigger waterlogging herweg and ludi 1999 desta et al 2005 comparable to this study about 60 of the central rift valley region of ethiopia was mapped as highly suitable area for in situ water harvesting structures under historical climate condition using gis based multi criteria analysis moges 2009 using the weighted overlay analysis 6 24 and 50 of the upper blue nile basin was also identified as highly and moderately suitable respectively for water harvesting structures under historical climate condition dile et al 2016 the study also revealed that more areas of the upper blue nile basin can be considered as highly suitable for water harvesting structures through assigning more weight to slope and rainfall parameters mati et al 2006 has also identified that most of ethiopia is suitable for in situ water harvesting structures under historical climate condition the area of the watersheds highly and optimally suitable for ex situ water harvesting are lower than the area of the watersheds suitable for in situ water harvesting fig 7 it is only under the baseline climate condition where about 37 of the watersheds are highly and optimally suitable for ex situ water harvesting table 9 less than 13 of the area of watersheds are highly and optimally suitable under the near and long term climate scenarios the main constraint to find large suitable sites for ex situ water harvesting structures is slope where only less than 8 of the slope is highly and optimally suitable another constraint is surface runoff which is projected to decline under near and long term climate scenarios equivalent to the in situ water harvesting suitability the watersheds in the northern part of the sub basin are moderately suitable for ex situ water harvesting structures mainly attributed to low surface runoff and rainfall under future climate and climate impact scenarios both in situ and ex situ water harvesting suitability analysis showed the area of the watersheds suitable under near term and long term climate scenarios is lower than the baseline climate scenario besides about 15 of the area of the watersheds is river channels settlements swamp areas and restricted to implement any of the water harvesting structures as a result it is essential to consider the second prioritized watershed management alternatives to design on the main river channels and areas not suitable for water harvesting structures physical and biological soil water management technologies were the second alternative prioritized by the multi criteria decision analysis however most of the physical soil and water management structures are similar with in situ water harvesting structures perhaps such structures are intended to reduce soil erosion biological soil and water management alternatives vegetative measures that could slow runoff water leaving the catchments and increase water availability in the soil are to be designed filter strips grass and vegetative are soil and water management technologies which include plantation of grasses and vegetation along with the river channels degraded bare lands and cultivated lands desta et al 2005 waidler et al 2011 in this study we identify suitable areas of the jemma sub basin for filter strips under different climate scenarios the river channels bare lands cultivated lands rainfall 500 mm slope 0 15 surface runoff 150 mm are highly and optimally suitable to design filter strips desta et al 2005 hurni et al 2016 fig 8 shows suitable areas for filter strips under different climate scenarios comparable to in situ water harvesting structures about 64 10 015 km2 of the watersheds are highly and optimally suitable for filter strips under the baseline climate scenario in the future climate scenarios less than 56 of the watersheds are highly and optimally suitable for filter strips similar to water harvesting structures large areas of the watersheds in the northern part of the sub basin are moderately suitable for filter strips under future climate scenarios the main constraint to locate highly and optimally suitable areas for filter strips under future climate scenarios is rainfall in future climate scenarios the annual rainfall is reduced and watersheds in the northern part of the sub basin have an annual rainfall of less than 500 mm validation was done using the layer of observed terrace and the in situ water harvesting suitability analysis under the baseline climate the analysis revealed that 4592 km2 70 of the observed terraced landscape was identified as suitable for in situ water harvesting structures the suitability analysis showed the northern part of the sub basin is not highly and optimally suitable for in situ water harvesting mainly attributed to low rainfall and surface runoff however on the northern part of the sub basin terraces are built and it is already a terraced landscape 3 4 effectiveness of watershed management alternatives under climate change scenarios prioritized watershed management alternatives and observed terraces have the effect to increase soil water and reduce surface runoff but at different magnitude figs 9 and 10 and table 10 in the baseline climate observed terraces have the effect to reduce surface runoff by 27 7 at the sub basin scale observed terrace could result in 35 12 35 00 32 97 and 32 08 reduction of surface runoff under rcp4 5 2021 2050 rcp8 5 2021 2050 rcp4 5 2071 2100 and rcp8 5 2071 2100 climate scenarios respectively in the baseline climate scenario there will be 56 66 reduction of surface runoff under in situ water harvesting structures at the sub basin scale in situ water harvesting structures could result in 63 45 75 80 74 70 and 72 98 reduction of surface runoff under rcp4 5 2021 2050 rcp8 5 2021 2050 rcp4 5 2071 2100 and rcp8 5 2071 2100 climate scenarios respectively the change in surface runoff due to observed terrace and in situ water harvesting under baseline and future climate scenarios is statistically significant p 0 05 table 10 at the watersheds scale observed terraces trigger a reduction of surface runoff in the range of 1 88 in the watersheds located in the central part of the sub basin fig 9 higher reduction of surface runoff 28 88 was estimated whereas in the watersheds located northern part of the sub basin observed terraces trigger lower reduction of surface runoff 1 23 under baseline and future climate scenarios on 73 of the watersheds in situ water harvesting structures resulted in a reduction of surface runoff in the range of 13 88 in the watersheds located northern part of the sub basin no change in surface runoff is estimated since the watersheds in this region are not suitable for in situ water harvesting fig 9 although watershed scale studies are absent in the jemma sub basin to make a comparison we have used plot scale experiments conducted in the sub basin herweg and ludi 1999 reported 45 and 62 reduction of surface runoff in response to water retention technologies level fanya juu and level soil bund respectively in the andit tid catchment of the jemma sub basin our result is lower than the findings of herweg and ludi 1999 in situ water management technologies have also triggered a reduction of surface runoff in the order of 19 50 in the anjeni watershed of the upper blue nile river basin mengistu et al 2016 at large spatial scale in situ water harvesting structures reduced surface runoff in the order of 13 60 in the semi arid region of northern ethiopia araya and stroosnijder 2010 the difference in the performance of in situ water harvesting structures in reducing surface runoff probably due to the difference in area coverage of in situ water harvesting structures local topographic condition and variations in spatial scale between the jemma sub basin and other study areas prioritized watershed management alternatives and observed terraces have also significant effect to increase soil water under baseline and future climate scenarios fig 10 and table 10 in the baseline climate scenario there could be 8 increase in soil water as a response to the observed terrace at the sub basin scale observed terrace could result in 13 24 14 06 13 68 and 12 24 increase of soil water under rcp4 5 2021 2050 rcp8 5 2021 2050 rcp4 5 2071 2100 and rcp8 5 2071 2100 climate scenarios respectively in the baseline climate scenario a 14 increase in soil water was estimated as a response to in situ water harvesting structures whereas in situ water harvesting triggers an increase of soil water by 19 24 23 and 21 under rcp4 5 2021 2050 rcp8 5 2021 2050 rcp4 5 2071 2100 and rcp8 5 2071 2100 climate scenarios respectively at sub basin scale the increase in soil water as a response to the observed terrace and in situ water harvesting under baseline and future climate scenarios is statistically significant p 0 05 table 10 among the watersheds large difference of soil water is estimated as a response to in situ water harvesting and observed terrace the watersheds in the eastern part of the sub basin showed a higher increase of soil water 34 48 as a response to observed terrace under baseline and future climate scenarios fig 10 the watersheds in the southern part of the sub basin revealed no change in soil water since no terraces were represented in this area of the sub basin equivalent to the observed terrace watersheds in the eastern part of the sub basin showed a higher increase of soil water as a response to in situ water harvesting however no change of soil water is estimated between scenario 0 climate scenarios and scenario 2 climate scenarios with in situ water harvesting in the watersheds located in the northern part of the sub basin fig 10 on more than 74 of the watersheds in situ water harvesting resulted in an increase of soil water in the range of 19 48 under baseline and future climate scenarios comparable to the effect of observed terrace and in situ water harvesting structures under baseline and future climate scenarios in the jemma sub basin an increase of soil water 30 was investigated as a response to in situ water harvesting structures in ethiopia and other sub saharan african countries biazin et al 2012 in contrast to the response of surface runoff and soil water response to observed terrace and in situ water harvesting an insignificant p 0 05 change was estimated on total water yield fig 11 and table 10 this indicates there will be an insignificant reduction of streamflow from the watersheds of the jemma sub basin to the downstream rivers as a response to the observed terrace and in situ water harvesting structures in total water yield the contribution of surface runoff showed a decrease while the contribuion of groundwater flow to total water yield has shown an increase under the observed terrace and in situ water harvesting eventhough insignificant reduction of mean annual streamflow was simulated the water harvesting structures trigger a slight change in the hydrography of the streamflow an increase in groundwater and prolonged dry season flow was simulated as a response to watershed management structures than under climate change scenarios see supplementary 6 there will be far low streamflow in july and an increase in the consecutive months as a response to the observed terrace and in situ water harvesting structures in september november there will be high streamflow under in situ water harvesting this could be due to the storage and release effects of the water harvesting structures this storage and realse effects of water harvesting structures could improve soil moisture reduce soil erosion and increase crop growing period in the jemma sub basin in the downstream to the jemma sub basin this situation can reduce flood frequency and increase water availability in dry seasons this finding strongly corroborates with rockstro m et al 2009 lemann et al 2016 and dile et al 2015 for instance for instance rockstrom et al 2009 has explored that water harvesting structures are among the strategies to realize global water availability and food production through increasing green water availability under future climate change and population growth the study of lemann et al 2016 also revealed an insignificant change in water yield to the downstream community as a response to soil and water management in the upper blue nile basin of ethiopia more analogously an increase of dry season flow low flow and a decrease of high flows that further increase in situ agricultural production and reduce flood damages was simulated in the lake tana sub basin of blue nile basin dile et al 2015 comparable to the area of land suitable for ex situ water harvesting structures ex situ rainwater harvesting has a lower effect of change on soil water and surface runoff ex situ water harvesting structures will significantly reduce surface runoff under baseline and long term climate scenarios table 10 however ex situ water harvesting structures will have no benefits to increase soil water under any of the climate scenarios table 10 this is attributed to the difference in area of land suitable for ex situ and in situ water harvesting structures where only less than 37 and 15 of the sub basin is suitable for ex situ water harvesting structures under baseline and future climate scenarios respectively in other areas of ethiopia for instance in the lake tana sub basin of upper blue nile basin ex situ water harvesting triggers a reduction of surface runoff that further result a decrease of total water yield in the order of 14 33 under different rainfall years dile et al 2016 4 conclusion climate change unequivocally triggers changes in freshwater availability and as a response it is worthwhile to design watershed management strategies that could provide optimal benefits under different climate conditions this study was intended to develop watershed management scenarios for climate change adaptation using multi criteria decision analysis which blended climate scenarios climate impact scenarios farmers and watershed management experts view and the existing biophysical settings there was intercomparison among a portfolio of alternatives and criteria using the multi criteria decision analysis tool the analytical hierarchy process ahp through this process water harvesting structures were identified as appropriate watershed management alternatives for existing and future climate change adaptation this is primarily because water harvesting structures can retain and increase soil water availability and provide benefits in reducing the impact of extreme events like drought and flood thus water harvesting structures will reduce the effects of uncertainties stem from climate scenarios and climate impact scenarios by providing benefits under negative and positive changes in climate suitability analysis showed at least 50 of the watersheds of the jemma sub basin are highly and optimally suitable to design water harvesting and biological soil and water management structures under baseline and future climate conditions in contrast the watersheds in the northern part of the jemma sub basin are moderately suitable for water harvesting structures mainly due to low rainfall and surface runoff on the other hand the watersheds in eastern parts of the jemma sub basin are not highly and optimally suitable for in situ water harvesting structures exclusively due to high rainfall and runoff that needs graded structures to circumvent waterlogging effects due to slope surface runoff and rainfall the area suitable for ex situ water harvesting is lower under baseline and future climate scenarios both in situ and ex situ water harvesting suitability analysis accentuates climate change is the limiting factor to design adaptation options representation of prioritized watershed management alternatives particularly in situ water harvesting on the hydrological model resulted in a significant increase of soil water significant reduction of surface runoff and insignificant change on water yield this corroborates the need to implement and expand water harvesting structures and other water management structures to increase water retention and water availability under different climate conditions however terrace and other physical soil and water management structures are implemented on about 42 of the watersheds of the jemma sub basin up until 2016 concurrently existing and prioritized water management structures need to be regularly maintained since there are studies which show the decrease of the effectiveness of such structures after a certain time herweg and ludi 1999 the national adaptation plan of ethiopia fdre 2019 has also prioritized water harvesting as among the main strategies to ensure climate change adaptation however water harvesting implementation is far low from its potential for climate adaptation food security and other objectives lack of data and information related to the effectiveness of water harvesting structures insufficient information on potentials of different areas for water harvesting structures and lack of advanced research and extension services are among the constraints of water harvesting techniques in the blue nile basin of ethiopia johnston and mccartney 2010 this accentuates the need to involve the stakeholders in dialogues and discussion forums and to develop a strong database which shows the capability of each land for water harvesting under different climate conditions

8318,study region jemma sub basin upper blue nile basin ethiopia study focus this study develops watershed management alternatives which can ensure optimal climate change adaptation benefits under different climate scenarios the climate scenarios were developed using the statistically bias corrected multi model ensemble mean and the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios the hydrological impact of climate change was assessed using a multi gauge calibrated and validated the soil and water assessment tool swat model watershed management alternatives were prioritized using a multi criteria decision analysis which intercompared watershed management criteria and alternatives through the analytic hierarchy process new hydrological insights the findings showed a consistent decline of rainfall surface runoff and total water yield under all climate scenarios and climate impact scenarios water harvesting structures were the most prioritized watershed management alternatives to reduce climate change impacts more than half of the watersheds of the jemma sub basin are highly and optimally suitable for in situ water harvesting under baseline and future climate scenarios observed terrace and anticipated in situ water harvesting structures significantly p 0 05 reduced surface runoff and thereby significantly increase soil water under baseline and future climate scenarios however both in situ and ex situ water harvesting structures caused an insignificant change in the total water yield under climate scenarios we conclude implementing in situ water harvesting structures can help to increase green water without a decline in blue water keywords climate change watershed management scenarios multi criteria decision analysis jemma sub basin blue nile basin 1 introduction contemporary water management practices are not up to the challenges of the plausible climate change in several regions of the world snover et al 2003 bates et al 2008 wmo 2009 as a result there is a strong consensus that water resources management decisions should consider climate change information ipcc 2007 bates et al 2008 yang et al 2012 however in several regions of the world existing climate adaptation strategies were developed based on historical hydro climatic data which has a narrow margin to buffer future climate change impacts wmo 2009 different climate change adaptation strategies that consider future climate change scenarios are essential to adapt a wide range of climate change conditions ipcc 2007 hallegatte 2009 therefore an array of robust climate adaptation options are required to reduce future climate change and climate extreme impacts furthermore designing water management systems that can cope with climate change impacts is challenging due to uncertainties in climate change projections yang et al 2012 kundzewicz et al 2018 the uncertainties can stem from assumptions in the future socio economic development scenarios and associated greenhouse gas emission scenarios the conceptualization of the gcms and downscaling methods ipcc 2013 kundzewicz et al 2018 the uncertainties in climate models could limit from directly using the outputs of climate models to develop adaptation strategies hallegatte 2009 to address uncertainties the ensemble of several climate model outputs generated using multiple climate scenarios has been recommended snover et al 2003 yang et al 2012 further climate scenarios with low uncertainty are essential to develop robust climate adaptation strategies that can provide optimal benefits of reducing the impacts of future climate change ipcc 2007 kuikman et al 2009 haque 2016 besides the uncertainty in the science of climate change developing a robust climate change adaption policy is also influenced by the trade offs between environmental and economic objectives chung and lee 2016 therefore climate change adaptation decisions should balance the societal technological and institutional responses to ensure long term sustainability usaid 2013 consequently relevant stakeholders at all levels should be involved to ensure climate adaptation policies that transcend generations haque 2016 to this end decision support systems can play a critical role to inform a balanced accounting of environment and economic factors multi criteria decision analysis mcda systems have been considered as critical approaches to develop climate change adaptation strategies that can incorporate economic environmental and social factors so as to ensure optimal benefits ipcc 2007 kuikman et al 2009 haque 2016 multi criteria decision systems enable comparing different but competing criteria and selecting the best alternatives malczewski 2006 the ethiopian national adaptation programmes of action napas has used the mcda to identify and prioritize the national climate change adaptation strategies nma 2007 in ethiopia the community based watershed development guideline was developed in 2005 desta et al 2005 having appropriate site selection and implementation of watershed management technologies as its main objectives the guideline considered observed climatic conditions especially rainfall as its main criteria however it fails to recognize a potential change in the climate contrary to the guideline it is recognized that climate change affects the potential of existing water resources management structures and less likely to be effective under future climate conditions hallegatte 2009 there are also mounting evidence that climate change may impact water quantity soil erosion and nutrient loading and also may amplify water variability ipcc 2013 therefore water resources and watershed management planning should account for climate change to design resilient adaptation and mitigation measures under the scrutiny of different criteria in the upper blue nile basin amdihun et al 2014 and dile et al 2016 have applied gis based multi criteria decision analysis to identify suitable areas for water harvesting and other soil and water management structures under historical climate condition different from the previous studies the current study considered different climate scenarios climate impact scenarios existing biophysical settings and the perspectives of farmers and experts to identify optimal watershed management alternatives under changing climate conditions in the watersheds of the jemma sub basin of upper blue nile basin in the jemma sub basin an increase in rainfall and temperature extremes which could exacerbate the repercussion of climate change on water resources and agricultural systems was investigated worku et al 2018a future climate change scenarios consistently describe a decrease in mean annual rainfall in the jemma sub basin worku et al 2019 therefore it is worthwhile to devise watershed management technologies that sustain water resources availability in the face of climate change in the watersheds of the jemma sub basin in fact through the food for work program different watershed management interventions such as fanya juu cutoff drains stone and soil bunds and afforestation have been implemented since the 1970s hurni 1985 herweg and ludi 1999 however terraces were constructed on only about 42 of the jemma sub basin up until 2016 google earth 2016 whilst huge and optimal soil and water management investment is essential moreover watershed management technologies that could provide optimal adaptation benefits and their areas of suitability were not identified the objective of this study is to develop watershed management alternatives that could provide optimal benefits of climate change adaptation and to evaluate their effectiveness under different climate scenarios in the watersheds of the jemma sub basin consequently this study straddles climate scenarios hydrological climate change impact assessment and farmers and watershed management experts view through gis based mcda to develop watershed management planning in the face of climate change the outputs from climate and hydrological models were used in the mcda to identify alternative watershed management interventions in each watershed of the jemma sub basin the methodological framework and the findings of this study can provide empirical evidences to different climate change adaptation programs of ethiopia such as ethiopia s national adaptation plan nap eth fdre 2019 and the water and energy sector of climate resilience strategy fdre 2015 in different climate adaptation programs of ethiopia reducing climate change impacts and building resilience on water agriculture and other sectors is the main goal however an insufficient link between climate information and climate adaptation strategies are realized to reduce climate change impacts in ethiopia world bank 2006 conway and schipper 2011 thus this study can help the national climate adaptation plans of ethiopia to identify optimal climate adaptation alternatives through integrating climate scenarios hydrological climate change impact assessment biophysical settings and farmers and experts perspectives in the wake of climate change this study also inculcates watershed development policies and programs in ethiopia should thoroughly use robust climate change scenarios and realize climate sensitive watershed planning 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area is the jemma sub basin located in the central highlands of ethiopia south eastern part of the upper blue nile fig 1 which has an area of 15 000 km2 administratively jemma intersects the amhara and oromia regional states of ethiopia north shewa zone of the amhara region and north shewa zone of oromia region largely drained by the jemma sub basin jemma sub basin is among the sub basins of the upper blue nile basin of ethiopia which covers 8 of the area and 14 of the total annual flow of upper blue nile basin yilma and awulachew 2009 the topography of the jemma sub basin is characterized by uneven topography and dissected terrain where elevation varies with short distance the southern part of the sub basin is plain with even topography and gentle slope fig 3 however the central areas of the sub basin are highly dissected terrains elevation in the sub basin is in the order of 1040 3840 meters above sea level the eastern part of the sub basin is under high elevation above 3000 m a s l and dominantly afro alpine and sub afro alpine ecosystems the high elevation in this part of the sub basin is the water divide of the upper blue nile basin and awash river basins of ethiopia the rainfall of central highland of ethiopia is driven by the moisture from the indian ocean equatorial east pacific gulf of guinea mediterranean region and arabian peninsula viste and sorteberg 2011 jemma sub basin receives mean annual rainfall in the order of about 700 mm 1500 mm from 1981 to 2014 in this sub basin the baseline climate 1981 2014 revealed an increasing trend of mean annual and mean summer season rainfall and a decreasing trend of mean spring season rainfall worku et al 2018a there are areas of the sub basin with relatively low mean annual temperature 9 c and in contrast there are areas with high mean annual temperature 24 c land use and land cover classification of the year 2008 in the jemma sub basin revealed that about 57 of the sub basin was cultivated land fig 3 which may require some form of watershed management interventions other land uses and land cover types include grazing land 14 64 bare land 10 45 shrub land 6 44 woodland 6 05 and forestland 1 20 there are also afro alpine vegetation eucalyptus plantations and water bodies on the main course of the rivers which cover a small proportion of the sub basin the rivers channel and the lower part of the sub basin are characterized by bare land the soil types in the jemma sub basin include eutric vertisols 28 07 lithic leptosols 37 44 chromic lixisols 8 07 pellic vertisols 6 82 haplic luvisols 5 79 haplic acrisols 6 82 eutric fluvisols umbric nitisols and alic nitisols cover a small proportion of the sub basin wlrc 2016 leptosols and vertisols are the main soil types which cover more than 70 of the jemma sub basin sand load clay and loam are soil texture classes in the sub basin fig 3 due to the expansion of cultivated land and grazing lands towards the steep slopes and marginal lands jemma is highly prone to soil erosion 2 2 framework of the study this study integrates climate scenarios climate impact scenarios hydrological climate impact assessment biophysical settings and farmers and watershed management experts perspectives to prioritize optimal watersheds based adaptation alternatives that reduce the anticipated impact of climate change as a result baseline climate scenario future climate scenarios and hydrological climate impact scenarios were developed subsequently gis based multi criteria decision analysis was used to bridge spatial data such as climate and hydrological models output with non spatial data such as stakeholders perspectives pertaining to watershed management alternatives under climate change malczewski 2006 the hydrological model was also used to evaluate the effectiveness of prioritize watershed management alternatives fig 2 presents the integration of climate scenarios climate impact scenarios biophysical factors and the multi criteria decision analysis to develop optimal watersheds based adaptation decision making 2 3 data types and sources 2 3 1 observed climate and hydrological data observed climate data was required to establish baseline climate scenario future climate scenarios and hydrological climate impact scenarios thus observed 1981 2014 data of daily rainfall tmax tmin solar radiation sunshine wind speed and relative humidity of nine climatic stations of the jemma basin were obtained from the ethiopian national meteorological services agency nma 2007 daily streamflow data of gauge stations was obtained from the ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and electricity the hydrologic data was used to calibrate and validate the hydrological model and to develop baseline hydrologic balance components 2 3 2 regional climate models data historical 1981 2005 and future 2021 2100 regional climate model rcm simulations driven by four cmip5 gcms were used in this study the cmip5 gcms which were used as initial boundary conditions were cnrm cm5 ec earth hadgem2 es and mpi esm lr whilst the rcms which were used to regionalize these gcms are the cclm4 consortium for small scale modeling cosmo climate limited area model cclm version 4 8 and remo max planck institute regional model rcm simulations driven through the representative concentration pathways 8 5 rcp8 5 and rcp 4 5 moss et al 2010 were considered detail on rcms selection is given at worku et al 2018b 2 3 3 biophysical data the spatial data which include slope soil texture and land use data were acquired from different sources fig 3 slope map was generated from 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem which was obtained from the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm the land use map for the year 2008 was derived from landsat satellite imagery supervised image classification using maximum likelihood algorithm was performed to develop the land use map the soil data which include soil texture and other physical and chemical properties of soil was obtained from the ministry of water irrigation and electricity of ethiopian and water and land resources center of ethiopia wlrc 2016 all the spatial data were projected into the projection parameters for ethiopia which is utm zone of wgs 1984 37 n 2 3 4 land and water management data land and water management structures such as terraces and other physical soil and water management structures that were implemented in the watersheds of the jemma sub basin since the 1980s were identified through google earth satellite images and field surveys fig 1 particularly google earth image 2016 was used to map observed soil and water management structures in the watersheds besides field observations were made to identify soil and water management structures in different areas of the sub basin 2 3 5 qualitative data qualitative data was collected through interviews with farmers and natural resources and watershed management experts seven sample watersheds were selected to cover all elevation classes of the sub basin fig 1 in these sample watersheds 56 farmers were interviewed 8 from each watershed however two questionnaires were not complete the sampling is based on ethiopia s watershed development guideline desta et al 2005 the guideline designates that the kebele watershed team watershed team at lowest administrative level comprises seven members however in the recent watershed management campaigns particularly since 2010 the role of religious leaders is pivotal and as a result we include one religious leader at each watershed in principle development agent da is to be a member of the kebele watershed team however in all kebele watershed teams no da is available in such cases we include kebele s model farmer in the interview in all watersheds all kebele watershed team members are farmers during interview farmers were requested to list watershed management alternatives that could provide optimal benefits of climate change adaptation particularly climate change characterized by a reduction of rainfall and water availability the interview was also conducted with 13 5 and 12 natural resources and watershed management experts of woreda zonal and federal offices respectively the experts were requested to identify the criteria and alternatives of watershed management for climate change adaptation watershed management alternatives most frequently suggested by the farmers and the experts were subject to pairwise inter comparison and weighting similarly criteria most frequently suggested by experts were considered for weighting however only experts were involved to give weight for alternatives and criteria through pairwise inter comparison in the analytical hierarchy process 2 4 methods 2 4 1 climate change scenarios the study used the period 1981 2014 as a baseline scenario to assess the change in climate to develop future climate scenarios rcm simulations which better reproduce the historical climate of the jemma sub basin were used worku et al 2018b rcm simulations were further adjusted using a robust statistical bias correction technique for this different statistical bias correction methods were intercompared using different metrics the distribution mapping method was superior to other techniques to adjust mean values intensity and frequency of rcm simulations with observed counterparts worku et al 2019 consequently rcm simulations bias adjusted using distribution mapping technique were used to develop climate change scenarios for the near term future 2021 2050 and long term future 2071 2100 2 4 2 hydrological climate impact scenarios to develop climate impact scenarios the hydrological model i e the soil and water assessment tool swat model was used based on slope land use and soil the swat model discretizes the jemma sub basin into hydrological response units hrus the soil conservation service scs curve number method and the penman monteith method were used to estimate surface runoff and potential evapotranspiration pet respectively the swat model was calibrated and validated using multi site calibration and validation approach cao et al 2006 on sufi 2 in swat cup abbaspour and johnson 2004 the performance of the model during calibration and validation was evaluated using nash and sutcliffe simulation efficiency nse and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2015 the uncertainty of model simulation was also evaluated using p factor and the r factor on the sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour and johnson 2004 eventually the calibrated swat model was used to simulate hydrological processes under baseline and different future climate scenarios detail of hydrological climate change impact assessment is given in worku et al 2020 2 4 3 multi criteria decision analysis technique and procedures 2 4 3 1 define the problem and the stakeholders climate change scenarios at the jemma sub basin revealed a reduction of rainfall in the near and long term future worku et al 2019 this indicates that climate change will be a major constraint to the agriculture and water related sectors in the future this finding also suggests watershed management interventions need to be implemented to address the likely water shortage that may occur due to climate change in this study farmers and experts were the main stakeholders and involved to identify and prioritize criteria and watershed management alternatives in the wake of climate change 2 4 3 2 defining and weighting criteria criteria to prioritize watershed management alternatives under climate change were identified through interviews with experts besides the national climate adaptation action plan of ethiopia nma 2007 was also used to identify criteria we conducted interviews with 30 watershed management and natural resource officers at woreda zonal and national levels such a process helped to identify the most critical criteria to be considered in the selection of watershed management alternatives for climate adaptation watershed management experts opinion was used to estimate the weights of different criteria using the analytic hierarchy process ahp ahp is a structured multi criteria decision analysis technique that is used to estimate the weight of different but competing criteria saaty 1990 the ahp process relies on expert judgment of the perceived relative importance of criteria on a pairwise basis resulting in a set of weights for criteria it uses a matrix of pairwise comparisons to assign a weight for each criterion and determine the relative importance of two or more criteria ahp also tests whether the pairwise comparisons are consistent or not using a consistency ratio cr saaty 1994 the cr was calculated as c r c i r i where ci is the consistency index which is expressed as c i λ m a x n n 1 where λ max the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix and n is the order of the criteria ri is the random index which is the randomly generated index of the matrix saaty 1994 if the cr is 0 1 10 or less the criteria analysis is considered reasonable otherwise it is considered less consistent and requires a revision saaty 1990 2 4 3 3 defining and weighting of watershed management alternatives watershed management alternatives under climate conditions characterized by a reduction in rainfall and water availability were listed out through interviews with farmers and experts besides the community based participatory watershed management guideline desta et al 2005 of ethiopia was also used to identify potential watershed management alternatives based on these approaches eight watershed management alternatives were found relevant for climate change adaptation in the jemma watershed watershed management alternatives include physical and biological soil and water management crop change water harvesting land use change reclaim degraded lands introduce new crop varieties area closure and agroforestry see supplementary 1 physical and biological soil and water management mainly intended to reduce soil erosion and include physical and biological structures crop change embraces changes from one cereal to another cereal or from annual to perennial crops water harvesting embraces in situ and ex situ water harvesting structures the in situ water harvesting micro catchments are structures to capture and store rainfall where it falls terraces soil stone bunds trenches tie ridging micro basins and fanya juu are categorized as in situ water harvesting systems mati et al 2006 biazin et al 2012 the ex situ water harvesting structures macro catchment are to collect water from a large area water collection catchment and store rainwater using storage structures structures like ponds and dams are categorized as ex situ water harvesting structures mati et al 2006 biazin et al 2012 watershed management experts opinion used to intercompare and prioritize the most important alternatives through pairwise comparison matrix using ahp watershed management alternatives under each criterion were also compared and weight was assigned for each alternative using ahp by comparing eight alternatives under seven criteria the overall priority of alternative pi was estimated as the weight of criterion multiplied by the weight of the alternative under each criterion the pi of alternative ai is calculated as p i j 1 n a i j w j where aij is the weight of alternative i with respect to criterion j and wj is the weight of criterion j saaty 1990 2 4 4 suitability analysis using weighted overlay analysis after identifying and prioritizing watershed management alternatives suitability analysis was performed to identify a suitable spatial implementation of prioritized watershed management alternatives using gis based weighted overlay analysis malczewski 2000 in the multi criteria decision analysis water harvesting structures were prioritized followed by physical and biological soil and water management structures according to fao 2003 guideline climate hydrology topography agronomy and soil are the most important criteria to identify suitable sites for water harvesting structures therefore rainfall and surface runoff outputs under different climate scenarios and hydrological climate impact scenarios were used as factors to the suitability analysis all input layers which include rainfall surface runoff land use slope and soil texture were reclassified into five suitability classes suitability score before overlaying these layers tables 1 and 2 the suitability score of in situ and ex situ water harvesting structures was developed based on literature desta et al 2005 mati et al 2006 dile et al 2016 hurni et al 2016 similar to the weighting of criteria and alternatives the ahp was also used to assign a weight wi to rainfall surface runoff slope land use and soil texture the ahp process relies on expert judgment which helped to produce a suitability map the ahp returned a set of percentage weights for each factor finally these weights were used in a weighted spatial overlay analysis in order to create suitability map of in situ and ex situ water harvesting the weight of each factor reflects the relative importance in determining the in situ and ex situ water harvesting structures based on the pairwise comparison the weight of factors to design in situ water harvesting is as follows rainfall 31 2 surface runoff 24 1 slope 19 land use 17 9 and soil texture 7 9 similarly the weight of factors to design ex situ water harvesting is as follows slope 30 2 surface runoff 24 8 rainfall 20 4 land use 13 8 and soil texture 11 the suitability score can be calculated as s w i x i where s is the suitability score wi is the weight of factor i and xi is suitability score of factor i malczewski 2000 2 4 5 evaluation of effectiveness of watershed management scenarios the effectiveness of prioritized watershed management alternatives after multi criteria decision analysis and suitability analysis and observed terrace in reducing the negative impact of baseline and future climate change was evaluated using the swat model specifically there were three main scenarios and subject to comparison scenario 0 baseline this scenario is used to show the water balance components under baseline and future climate scenarios in this scenario prioritized watershed management alternatives were not considered and represented on the swat model this scenario embraces sub scenarios from a e table 3 scenario 1 climate change observed terrace this scenario was used to assess the effectiveness of observed terrace on water balance components under baseline and future climate scenarios currently on 6562 km2 42 71 of the watersheds of the sub basin terrace and other physical soil and water management structures were implemented watersheds under observed terrace were identified and represented on the swat model to analyze changes on surface runoff soil water and total water yield terraces have the effect of reducing slope which thereby reduces surface runoff and peak flow by impounding water in small depressions thus observed terraces were represented by modifying slope length slsubbsn desta et al 2005 hurni et al 2016 curve number cn arnold et al 2012 and usle p universal soil loss equation management factor gebremichael et al 2005 table 4 this scenario encompasses the sub scenarios from f j table 3 scenario 2 climate change watershed management alternatives prioritized using multi criteria decision analysis mcda and suitability analysis sa this scenario was used to evaluate the effect of prioritized watershed management alternatives in situ and ex situ water harvesting and biological soil and water management structures on water balance components under baseline and future climate scenarios watersheds suitable for in situ and ex situ water harvesting and biological soil and water management structures were identified and represented on the swat model to analyze changes in surface runoff soil water and total water yield the slsubbsn cn and usle p were modified to represent in situ water harvesting structures table 4 whereas pnd fr fraction of sub basin area that drains into ponds were modified to represent ex situ water harvesting structures table 4 the in situ water harvesting structures were represented in the swat model based on hurni et al 2016 arnold et al 2012 gebremichael et al 2005 recommendations whereas the ex situ water harvesting structures were represented in the swat model as recommended by waidler et al 2011 and biological alternatives i e filter strips were based on betrie et al 2011 hurni et al 2016 scenario 2 embraces sub scenarios from k o table 3 changes in soil water surface runoff and total water yield as a response to observed terrace under baseline and future climate scenarios scenario 1 were analyzed similarly changes in soil water surface runoff and total water yield and as a response to in situ water harvesting ex situ water harvesting and filter strips under baseline and future climate scenarios scenario 2 were analyzed differences in effectiveness between the various scenarios were studied using t tests p 0 05 3 result and discussion 3 1 climate and hydrological conditions under climate scenarios the baseline climate 1981 2014 exhibited an increasing trend of mean annual and mean summer season rainfall in more than 78 of the stations and a subsidence of spring season rainfall in most of the stations worku et al 2018a however under future climate scenarios a decrease in mean annual rainfall was projected fig 4 the statistical bias corrected output of ensemble mean of rcms showed a decline of mean annual rainfall in the range of 23 in the near term 2021 2050 and 19 in the long term 2071 2100 climate conditions under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios worku et al 2019 the projected future rainfall had similar spatial pattern with the observed rainfall where lower rainfall is projected in the northern part of the sub basin the surface runoff output under baseline and future climate impact scenarios is based on worku et al 2020 all future climate scenarios presented a decline of surface run off but in different magnitude there will be maximum reduction of surface runoff 65 under rcp8 5 2021 2050 climate scenario followed by under rcp4 5 2021 2050 climate scenario for which 63 reduction of surface runoff was estimated fig 5 in long term climate scenarios 2071 2100 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 lower reduction of surface runoff is projected mainly attributed to the higher rainfall projected in the long term climate scenarios than the near term scenarios 3 2 criteria and alternatives of watershed management in the multi criteria decision analysis contribution to retain water is the most prioritized criteria to select watershed management alternatives for climate change adaptation in the jemma sub basin table 5 contribution to reduce flood and soil erosion and contribution to the economy are other important criteria among the criteria less weight is given to the criterion i e coherence of the intended alternative with the objectives of napa of ethiopia and other development programs the criterion i e the inexpensiveness of technology in terms of money and labor has also given less weight this might be due to good access to labor for watershed management in the study area through pairwise comparison matrix water harvesting which includes in situ and ex situ water harvesting structures were the most prioritized watershed management alternative for climate change adaptation next to water harvesting physical and biological soil and water management are the most prioritized watershed management alternatives table 6 the weight of each alternative under each criterion was also compared the overall priority ranking table 7 showed that water harvesting structures are the most preferred alternatives to build resilience for future climate under few criteria for instance contribution to the economy high weight is given to other alternatives i e for crop change and introducing new crop varieties than water harvesting structures table 7 similar to this study the ipcc fourth assessment report has also recommended the expansion of water harvesting storage structures and indigenous practices for sustainable water use ipcc 2007 there are also other studies which prioritize water harvesting for climate change adaptation and adaptation under uncertainty hallegatte 2009 haque 2016 in the ethiopian climate resilience strategy water harvesting was identified as among the strategies to buffer the negative impact of climate change fdre 2019 however to get optimal benefit from water harvesting optimal site identification is the most important step desta et al 2005 dile et al 2016 3 3 suitability analysis the weighted overlay suitability analysis has shown that most watersheds of the jemma sub basin are suitable for in situ water harvesting structures more than 50 of the watersheds are highly and optimally suitable for in situ water harvesting structures under baseline near and long term future climate scenarios fig 6 this is because more weight was given for rainfall and the amount of rainfall under baseline and future climate scenarios is highly and optimally suitable for in situ water harvesting structures about 74 of the watersheds are suitable for in situ water harvesting under the baseline climate scenario unlike the baseline climate scenario less than 62 of the watersheds are optimally and highly suitable for in situ water harvesting structures under future climate scenarios table 8 the decline of rainfall under future climate scenarios is the main constraint to find large areas of the watersheds highly and optimally suitable for water harvesting structures the watersheds in the northern part of the sub basin are moderately suitable for ex situ water harvesting mainly attributed to low rainfall under baseline and future climate scenarios the lower slope 8 is considered as not highly and optimally suitable because designing in situ harvesting structures in this slope class could trigger waterlogging herweg and ludi 1999 desta et al 2005 comparable to this study about 60 of the central rift valley region of ethiopia was mapped as highly suitable area for in situ water harvesting structures under historical climate condition using gis based multi criteria analysis moges 2009 using the weighted overlay analysis 6 24 and 50 of the upper blue nile basin was also identified as highly and moderately suitable respectively for water harvesting structures under historical climate condition dile et al 2016 the study also revealed that more areas of the upper blue nile basin can be considered as highly suitable for water harvesting structures through assigning more weight to slope and rainfall parameters mati et al 2006 has also identified that most of ethiopia is suitable for in situ water harvesting structures under historical climate condition the area of the watersheds highly and optimally suitable for ex situ water harvesting are lower than the area of the watersheds suitable for in situ water harvesting fig 7 it is only under the baseline climate condition where about 37 of the watersheds are highly and optimally suitable for ex situ water harvesting table 9 less than 13 of the area of watersheds are highly and optimally suitable under the near and long term climate scenarios the main constraint to find large suitable sites for ex situ water harvesting structures is slope where only less than 8 of the slope is highly and optimally suitable another constraint is surface runoff which is projected to decline under near and long term climate scenarios equivalent to the in situ water harvesting suitability the watersheds in the northern part of the sub basin are moderately suitable for ex situ water harvesting structures mainly attributed to low surface runoff and rainfall under future climate and climate impact scenarios both in situ and ex situ water harvesting suitability analysis showed the area of the watersheds suitable under near term and long term climate scenarios is lower than the baseline climate scenario besides about 15 of the area of the watersheds is river channels settlements swamp areas and restricted to implement any of the water harvesting structures as a result it is essential to consider the second prioritized watershed management alternatives to design on the main river channels and areas not suitable for water harvesting structures physical and biological soil water management technologies were the second alternative prioritized by the multi criteria decision analysis however most of the physical soil and water management structures are similar with in situ water harvesting structures perhaps such structures are intended to reduce soil erosion biological soil and water management alternatives vegetative measures that could slow runoff water leaving the catchments and increase water availability in the soil are to be designed filter strips grass and vegetative are soil and water management technologies which include plantation of grasses and vegetation along with the river channels degraded bare lands and cultivated lands desta et al 2005 waidler et al 2011 in this study we identify suitable areas of the jemma sub basin for filter strips under different climate scenarios the river channels bare lands cultivated lands rainfall 500 mm slope 0 15 surface runoff 150 mm are highly and optimally suitable to design filter strips desta et al 2005 hurni et al 2016 fig 8 shows suitable areas for filter strips under different climate scenarios comparable to in situ water harvesting structures about 64 10 015 km2 of the watersheds are highly and optimally suitable for filter strips under the baseline climate scenario in the future climate scenarios less than 56 of the watersheds are highly and optimally suitable for filter strips similar to water harvesting structures large areas of the watersheds in the northern part of the sub basin are moderately suitable for filter strips under future climate scenarios the main constraint to locate highly and optimally suitable areas for filter strips under future climate scenarios is rainfall in future climate scenarios the annual rainfall is reduced and watersheds in the northern part of the sub basin have an annual rainfall of less than 500 mm validation was done using the layer of observed terrace and the in situ water harvesting suitability analysis under the baseline climate the analysis revealed that 4592 km2 70 of the observed terraced landscape was identified as suitable for in situ water harvesting structures the suitability analysis showed the northern part of the sub basin is not highly and optimally suitable for in situ water harvesting mainly attributed to low rainfall and surface runoff however on the northern part of the sub basin terraces are built and it is already a terraced landscape 3 4 effectiveness of watershed management alternatives under climate change scenarios prioritized watershed management alternatives and observed terraces have the effect to increase soil water and reduce surface runoff but at different magnitude figs 9 and 10 and table 10 in the baseline climate observed terraces have the effect to reduce surface runoff by 27 7 at the sub basin scale observed terrace could result in 35 12 35 00 32 97 and 32 08 reduction of surface runoff under rcp4 5 2021 2050 rcp8 5 2021 2050 rcp4 5 2071 2100 and rcp8 5 2071 2100 climate scenarios respectively in the baseline climate scenario there will be 56 66 reduction of surface runoff under in situ water harvesting structures at the sub basin scale in situ water harvesting structures could result in 63 45 75 80 74 70 and 72 98 reduction of surface runoff under rcp4 5 2021 2050 rcp8 5 2021 2050 rcp4 5 2071 2100 and rcp8 5 2071 2100 climate scenarios respectively the change in surface runoff due to observed terrace and in situ water harvesting under baseline and future climate scenarios is statistically significant p 0 05 table 10 at the watersheds scale observed terraces trigger a reduction of surface runoff in the range of 1 88 in the watersheds located in the central part of the sub basin fig 9 higher reduction of surface runoff 28 88 was estimated whereas in the watersheds located northern part of the sub basin observed terraces trigger lower reduction of surface runoff 1 23 under baseline and future climate scenarios on 73 of the watersheds in situ water harvesting structures resulted in a reduction of surface runoff in the range of 13 88 in the watersheds located northern part of the sub basin no change in surface runoff is estimated since the watersheds in this region are not suitable for in situ water harvesting fig 9 although watershed scale studies are absent in the jemma sub basin to make a comparison we have used plot scale experiments conducted in the sub basin herweg and ludi 1999 reported 45 and 62 reduction of surface runoff in response to water retention technologies level fanya juu and level soil bund respectively in the andit tid catchment of the jemma sub basin our result is lower than the findings of herweg and ludi 1999 in situ water management technologies have also triggered a reduction of surface runoff in the order of 19 50 in the anjeni watershed of the upper blue nile river basin mengistu et al 2016 at large spatial scale in situ water harvesting structures reduced surface runoff in the order of 13 60 in the semi arid region of northern ethiopia araya and stroosnijder 2010 the difference in the performance of in situ water harvesting structures in reducing surface runoff probably due to the difference in area coverage of in situ water harvesting structures local topographic condition and variations in spatial scale between the jemma sub basin and other study areas prioritized watershed management alternatives and observed terraces have also significant effect to increase soil water under baseline and future climate scenarios fig 10 and table 10 in the baseline climate scenario there could be 8 increase in soil water as a response to the observed terrace at the sub basin scale observed terrace could result in 13 24 14 06 13 68 and 12 24 increase of soil water under rcp4 5 2021 2050 rcp8 5 2021 2050 rcp4 5 2071 2100 and rcp8 5 2071 2100 climate scenarios respectively in the baseline climate scenario a 14 increase in soil water was estimated as a response to in situ water harvesting structures whereas in situ water harvesting triggers an increase of soil water by 19 24 23 and 21 under rcp4 5 2021 2050 rcp8 5 2021 2050 rcp4 5 2071 2100 and rcp8 5 2071 2100 climate scenarios respectively at sub basin scale the increase in soil water as a response to the observed terrace and in situ water harvesting under baseline and future climate scenarios is statistically significant p 0 05 table 10 among the watersheds large difference of soil water is estimated as a response to in situ water harvesting and observed terrace the watersheds in the eastern part of the sub basin showed a higher increase of soil water 34 48 as a response to observed terrace under baseline and future climate scenarios fig 10 the watersheds in the southern part of the sub basin revealed no change in soil water since no terraces were represented in this area of the sub basin equivalent to the observed terrace watersheds in the eastern part of the sub basin showed a higher increase of soil water as a response to in situ water harvesting however no change of soil water is estimated between scenario 0 climate scenarios and scenario 2 climate scenarios with in situ water harvesting in the watersheds located in the northern part of the sub basin fig 10 on more than 74 of the watersheds in situ water harvesting resulted in an increase of soil water in the range of 19 48 under baseline and future climate scenarios comparable to the effect of observed terrace and in situ water harvesting structures under baseline and future climate scenarios in the jemma sub basin an increase of soil water 30 was investigated as a response to in situ water harvesting structures in ethiopia and other sub saharan african countries biazin et al 2012 in contrast to the response of surface runoff and soil water response to observed terrace and in situ water harvesting an insignificant p 0 05 change was estimated on total water yield fig 11 and table 10 this indicates there will be an insignificant reduction of streamflow from the watersheds of the jemma sub basin to the downstream rivers as a response to the observed terrace and in situ water harvesting structures in total water yield the contribution of surface runoff showed a decrease while the contribuion of groundwater flow to total water yield has shown an increase under the observed terrace and in situ water harvesting eventhough insignificant reduction of mean annual streamflow was simulated the water harvesting structures trigger a slight change in the hydrography of the streamflow an increase in groundwater and prolonged dry season flow was simulated as a response to watershed management structures than under climate change scenarios see supplementary 6 there will be far low streamflow in july and an increase in the consecutive months as a response to the observed terrace and in situ water harvesting structures in september november there will be high streamflow under in situ water harvesting this could be due to the storage and release effects of the water harvesting structures this storage and realse effects of water harvesting structures could improve soil moisture reduce soil erosion and increase crop growing period in the jemma sub basin in the downstream to the jemma sub basin this situation can reduce flood frequency and increase water availability in dry seasons this finding strongly corroborates with rockstro m et al 2009 lemann et al 2016 and dile et al 2015 for instance for instance rockstrom et al 2009 has explored that water harvesting structures are among the strategies to realize global water availability and food production through increasing green water availability under future climate change and population growth the study of lemann et al 2016 also revealed an insignificant change in water yield to the downstream community as a response to soil and water management in the upper blue nile basin of ethiopia more analogously an increase of dry season flow low flow and a decrease of high flows that further increase in situ agricultural production and reduce flood damages was simulated in the lake tana sub basin of blue nile basin dile et al 2015 comparable to the area of land suitable for ex situ water harvesting structures ex situ rainwater harvesting has a lower effect of change on soil water and surface runoff ex situ water harvesting structures will significantly reduce surface runoff under baseline and long term climate scenarios table 10 however ex situ water harvesting structures will have no benefits to increase soil water under any of the climate scenarios table 10 this is attributed to the difference in area of land suitable for ex situ and in situ water harvesting structures where only less than 37 and 15 of the sub basin is suitable for ex situ water harvesting structures under baseline and future climate scenarios respectively in other areas of ethiopia for instance in the lake tana sub basin of upper blue nile basin ex situ water harvesting triggers a reduction of surface runoff that further result a decrease of total water yield in the order of 14 33 under different rainfall years dile et al 2016 4 conclusion climate change unequivocally triggers changes in freshwater availability and as a response it is worthwhile to design watershed management strategies that could provide optimal benefits under different climate conditions this study was intended to develop watershed management scenarios for climate change adaptation using multi criteria decision analysis which blended climate scenarios climate impact scenarios farmers and watershed management experts view and the existing biophysical settings there was intercomparison among a portfolio of alternatives and criteria using the multi criteria decision analysis tool the analytical hierarchy process ahp through this process water harvesting structures were identified as appropriate watershed management alternatives for existing and future climate change adaptation this is primarily because water harvesting structures can retain and increase soil water availability and provide benefits in reducing the impact of extreme events like drought and flood thus water harvesting structures will reduce the effects of uncertainties stem from climate scenarios and climate impact scenarios by providing benefits under negative and positive changes in climate suitability analysis showed at least 50 of the watersheds of the jemma sub basin are highly and optimally suitable to design water harvesting and biological soil and water management structures under baseline and future climate conditions in contrast the watersheds in the northern part of the jemma sub basin are moderately suitable for water harvesting structures mainly due to low rainfall and surface runoff on the other hand the watersheds in eastern parts of the jemma sub basin are not highly and optimally suitable for in situ water harvesting structures exclusively due to high rainfall and runoff that needs graded structures to circumvent waterlogging effects due to slope surface runoff and rainfall the area suitable for ex situ water harvesting is lower under baseline and future climate scenarios both in situ and ex situ water harvesting suitability analysis accentuates climate change is the limiting factor to design adaptation options representation of prioritized watershed management alternatives particularly in situ water harvesting on the hydrological model resulted in a significant increase of soil water significant reduction of surface runoff and insignificant change on water yield this corroborates the need to implement and expand water harvesting structures and other water management structures to increase water retention and water availability under different climate conditions however terrace and other physical soil and water management structures are implemented on about 42 of the watersheds of the jemma sub basin up until 2016 concurrently existing and prioritized water management structures need to be regularly maintained since there are studies which show the decrease of the effectiveness of such structures after a certain time herweg and ludi 1999 the national adaptation plan of ethiopia fdre 2019 has also prioritized water harvesting as among the main strategies to ensure climate change adaptation however water harvesting implementation is far low from its potential for climate adaptation food security and other objectives lack of data and information related to the effectiveness of water harvesting structures insufficient information on potentials of different areas for water harvesting structures and lack of advanced research and extension services are among the constraints of water harvesting techniques in the blue nile basin of ethiopia johnston and mccartney 2010 this accentuates the need to involve the stakeholders in dialogues and discussion forums and to develop a strong database which shows the capability of each land for water harvesting under different climate conditions

8319,study region south central italy study focus a detailed analysis is carried out in five catchments in the adriatic coast where a complex system of artificial lakes forced conducts and hydropower stations has modified the river regime this together with the decrease of the annual rainfall in central italy make quantifying the relative contributions of human activities and climatic variability to streamflow change a challenging task statistically significant trends in annual rainfall and streamflow and change points in runoff have been investigated potential changes in precipitation runoff relationship have been examined and a quantitative evaluation of the effect of climate variability and human activities on runoff has been assessed separately new hydrological insights for the region significant negative trends in runoff have been found in all the catchments except the feltrino river precipitation also exhibits negative trend except the pescara basin significant change points in runoff were detected in all the basins and the study period was divided in a pre change and a post change period by climate elasticity method the climatic variability seems to be the main driving factor of the runoff decrease only for the pescara river human activities were dominant factors of the runoff reduction as expected from the absence of any significant trend in the annual precipitation the hydrological model confirms this result although the assessment of two contributions is affected by some uncertainties keywords climate change human activities hydrological model climate elasticity runoff 1 introduction the climate system warming is globally recognized with observed changes since 1950s pachauri et al 2014 observed changes in global annual precipitation from 1951 to 2010 indicate a significant increment in precipitation in north america part of the south america especially argentine part of northern and central asia india northern europe and australia conversely a reduction is observed in southern and central africa in the mediterranean area and the in east part of central asia pachauri et al 2014 in many regions changes in melting snow and ice or precipitation are modifying hydrological process with effects in water resources in terms of quantity and quality pachauri et al 2014 besides climate change human activities such as irrigation cultivation afforestation deforestation and urban construction introduce variability in the flow regime as an example afforestation reduces streamflow brown et al 2005 urbanization increases the surface generating runoff and reduces the time of concentration with an increase of the peak flow while land use and land cover change is believed to have impacts on infiltration and evapotranspiration ma et al 2008 zheng et al 2009 thus investigation of the impacts of climate change and human activity on hydrology and water resources has become a considerable field of interest hydrological variables such as precipitation are strongly dependent on atmospheric circulation and on the local orography soldini and darvini 2017 climate change impacts on natural and human systems are often spatially heterogeneous even because their variability arises also from social and economic factors hence the changes can be studied at different spatial scales and they may be more easily observed at local levels wang et al 2013 libertino et al 2019 numerous methods can be utilized for separating the individual impact of climate variability and human activities on streamflow like hydrological modeling ma et al 2008 wang et al 2013 climate elasticity zheng et al 2009 hydrological sensitivity method wang et al 2013 a review of methodologies and critical assumptions can be found in dey and mishra 2017 the majority of the studies on this topic have been carried out in chinese catchments as an example a quantitative assessment of the impact of climate variability and human activity on runoff reduction in the miyun reservoir basin in china is analyzed by ma et al 2010 by using a distributed hydrological model and a climate elasticity model the authors found that climate variability accounted for about 55 and 51 of the decrease of inflow responses of runoff to land surface and climate change in the headwaters of the yellow river basin are analyzed by a modified estimator of the climate elasticity by zheng et al 2009 they estimated that land use change is responsible for more than 70 of the streamflow reduction while climate change contributed to less than 30 of the reduction wang et al 2013 analyzed the runoff changes in four catchments of the haihe river basin china by three methods including hydrological sensitivity analysis hydrological model and climate elasticity method they found that human activities should be mainly responsible for the runoff reduction in three catchments from 54 to 67 whereas about 70 of runoff reduction in the hutuo river catchment was attributed to climate variability a few studies attempted to separate the climate change variability and human impacts on streamflow in european catchments by using rainfall runoff models in central belgium poelmans et al 2011 found that climate factor may affect flows up to 30 in southern italy d agostino et al 2010 concluded that by 2050 streamflows of the candelaro catchment would decrease by 16 23 recently impacts of climate variability and human activities on the streamflow of an alpine river in north western italy are quantified by saidi et al 2018 by means the application of methods including hydrological sensitivity climate elasticity and hydrological modeling they found that climate variability accounted for 85 of the decrease in streamflow the large variability of the results obtained in different countries confirms that the detection of individual effects of climate change and human activities on the hydrological regime is a challenge that needs to be studied at a local scale in this paper hydrological data of five catchments of rivers located in the abruzzo region except the biferno river which flows in the molise region and flowing in the adriatic sea fig 1 were analyzed this coastal area is important not just because of its delicate natural ecosystems but also for the connected economic and recreational activities however the salinity artegiani et al 1997 and the eutrophication ingarao et al 2009 of these coastal waters are influenced by river runoff with obvious consequence for this frail ecosystem this region is characterized by the presence of a complex system of artificial reservoirs and hydropower stations built from 1950 to 1970 for energy production or irrigation and drinking water purposes the massive presence of the human activity and the variation in the rainfall observed in the mediterranean area make the analysis of driving factors in the runoff changes of these basins a severe challenge therefore with this contribution we aim to 1 detect statistically significant change points and trends in annual streamflow and precipitation 2 find potential changes in precipitation runoff relationship and 3 evaluate the proportional influence on streamflow regime variations due to human activities and climate change the assessment of the relative contributions is carried out by the climate elasticity method and the hydrological model and results obtained by the two methods are compared each other 2 study area and dataset the analysis concerns annual and monthly data of rainfall and runoff in five catchments of rivers flowing in the adriatic sea in south central italy the rainfall and runoff dataset refers to the historical series collected in the hydrographic basins of the rivers tordino pescara feltrino and sangro in the abruzzo region and biferno in the molise region fig 1 the main characteristics of the five hydrometric stations and of the analyzed basins are reported in table 1 the id code gives the position of each station in the study area fig 1 the tordino river is located in the northern part of the abruzzo region initially it flows in the territory of the gran sasso national park with a torrential type regime near the sources the tordino river forms the waterfall of the fiumata and the tordino falls in the past the first reach of the river was also called trontino in the upper part there are mills and crushers up to valle san giovanni upstream of which the tordino is derived again for energy production the hydrometric station of teramo is located at the confluence of the tordino and vezzola rivers at a distance from the mouth of about 24 km altitude of 221 8 m a s l and watershed area of about 147 km 2 the pescara river originates by the outflows from the apennine mountains and flows toward the adriatic sea at the homonymous city its water network is particularly elaborate the watercourse is originated from the confluence of the aterno river which comes from the north west and the sagittarius river which flows from the south east this anomalous conformation if compared with others apennine rivers flowing in the adriatic sea derives from the particular conformation of the mountains which form two watersheds parallel to the sea the eastern basin characterized by the highest elevations of gran sasso 2814 m a s l and maiella 2714 m a s l and the second watershed at west with remarkable altitudes over 2000 m a s l the altitude of the station at maraone is 240 2 m a s l with a distance from the mouth of 50 km and the basin includes an area of 2003 km 2 the feltrino river originates on the hills of the abruzzo region at about 460 m a s l and flows after 16 km at san vito town the hydrometric station is at 3 m a s l and the total area of the basin is about 50 km 2 the sangro river is in the southern abruzzo and molise regions it originates in the abruzzo national park at about 1600 m of altitude the river flows between abruzzo and molise for about 60 km and then definitely falls in abruzzo the river is barred by dams forming three artificial lakes used to produce electricity barrea bomba and castel del giudice the sangro river receives the contribution of its major tributary the aventine river from this confluence it begins the low reach up to the mouth in the adriatic sea in the lower course of the sangro river there is another artificial barrier created for irrigation purposes in 1981 the basin at the ateleta gauge has a total area of about 545 km 2 the hydrometrical station is 58 km from the mouth at 720 m a s l the biferno river is entirely located in the molise region it is 85 km long and it originates from the matese mountains at 500 m a s l after crossing a rocky valley full of gullies and cliffs the river flows into guardialfiera or liscione lake an artificial basin built between the sixties and seventies to meet potable agricultural and industrial needs of the coastal area of molise and northern puglia after 30 km from the barrier the river reaches the adriatic sea with an estuary mouth near termoli town the basin area at the altopantano station is 1290 km 2 the hydrometric gauge is 9 6 km from the mouth at 6 m a s l annual monthly and daily data have been selected from the database of the servizio idrografico e mareografico of the abruzzo region the recording period of observation for the daily rainfall and runoff is the interval reported in table 1 with the characteristics of the gauges in fig 1 are shown also the thermometric stations whose temperature data have been used for the hydrological model as described in section 3 2 2 unlike a previous analysis memmola and darvini 2018 timeseries of rainfall and runoff have been checked to ensure the quality of the analyzed series in terms of homogeneity and continuity missing data of annual runoff have been reconstructed based on the concept of persistence koutsoyiannis 2005 by means of daily data in order to identify the final dataset the selection have has been made based on two criteria stations must have recorded for more than 50 years wmo 1988 and the total missing data cannot be more than 20 furthermore the consecutive missing data are not more than 12 of the total data instead for daily rainfall the number of missing data in the annual series must be smaller than 10 of the length of the series 36 missing days maximum 3 methodology 3 1 trend detection and break point analysis method the mann kendall trend test is a rank based test mann 1945 kendall 1975 used to discover trends in precipitation and streamflow time series among advantages of this test is that it does not require a normal distribution of the data the presence of outliers does not significantly affect the test results and its power is comparable to that of other similar statistical tests trends magnitude was estimated by the sen s slope method sen 1968 based on kendall s tau the pettitt s test pettitt 1979 consists of a non parametric approach to detect the likely location of a single change point the test is a rank based and distribution free method used when the exact time of the change is unknown the significant differences between means of two samples were tested using the two tails t test with a 95 confidence level the double mass curve dmc is usually used to discover hydrological changes in the streamflow regime due to human activities it consists of the plot of the accumulate values of two related variables for the same time period the two accumulate values are plotted one against the other if two variables are proportional the dmc is a straight line and the ratio between the two variables is represented by the slope of the line the breaking of the original relationship can be indicated by the change of the line slope in this study the dmc connecting runoff and precipitation has been used as a further confirmation of the change points detected by the pettitt s test 3 2 separation of climate change and human activities impacts on runoff variation the runoff of a catchment can be assumed as a function of human activities and climate variables by 1 q f c h where q is the runoff h represents the human activities factor on runoff and c the climate variables affecting the hydrological cycle changes in runoff due to human activities and climate variability can be evaluated as 2 δ q f h δ h f c δ c where δ q δ h and δ c are changes in runoff human activities and climate respectively with f h q h and f c q c by a first order approximation eq 2 can be written as 3 δ q δ q h δ q c where δ q h and δ q c are the changes in runoff due to human activity and climate variability respectively even though human activities and climate variability are not independent of each other for the small basins analyzed in this study climate variability can be considered mainly controlled by external forces consequently these two variables were treated as independent factors at basin scale wang et al 2013 in this framework δ q can be obtained as the difference between the observed average annual runoff during pre changed period q 1 and the observed average annual runoff during the post changed period q 2 as a consequence the separation of the effect of human activities and of the influence of climate change can be obtained if δ q h or δ q c is estimated 3 2 1 climate elasticity method in this study we estimate the effect of climate change on streamflow using at first the climate elasticity method first proposed by schaake 1990 and then developed by several authors e g dooge et al 1999 zheng et al 2009 the elasticity of streamflow can be considered as the corresponding change of runoff against the corresponding change of a climate factor with reference to the rainfall the sensitivity coefficient of the streamflow to precipitation p can be expressed as zheng et al 2009 4 ε p δ q i q δ p i p q i q q p i p p where δ q i and δ p i are the variations of the annual streamflow and precipitation computed with respect to the long term average of streamflow q and precipitation p analogously the sensitivity coefficient of the streamflow to actual evapotranspiration ae is 5 ε ae δ q i q δ a e i a e q i q q ae i a e a e where δ ae i is the change of the annual actual evapotranspiration with respect to the long term average of the actual evapotranspiration a e from the values of ε p and ε ae computed in the entire observation period the variation of runoff related to the climate change can be estimated by annual data in the post change period 6 δ q c δ q p δ q ae ε p δ p p ε ep δ ae ae q natural ε p p 1 p 2 p 1 ε ae ae 1 ae 2 ae 1 q 1 where p 1 and ae 1 are the average precipitation and actual evapotranspiration during the pre change period and p 2 and ae 2 are the average precipitation and actual evapotranspiration during the post change period the natural streamflow q natural is represented by the streamflow in the pre change period in this study potential evapotranspiration pe was estimated by the thornthwaite empirical method described in section 3 2 2 thornthwaite 1948 this method only requires the mean monthly temperature as the input therefore the climate signal in the temperature data is considered in the calculations of evapotranspiration other methods need additional input data which are not readily available or are more complicated to collect saidi et al 2018 after δ q c has been calculated by eq 6 δ q h can be estimated by subtracting δ q c from the total runoff variation δ q 3 2 2 hydrological model the monthly hydrological model proposed by xiong and guo 1999 and described by wang et al 2013 was used in this study the water balance of a catchment can be expressed as p δ s q ae where p is the precipitation δ s is the variation of the water content in soil s q is the runoff and a e is the real evapotranspiration the basin is considered as a linear reservoir and the balance equation expresses the conservation of the amount of water that falls through the rainfall and then returns to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration unless infiltration and surface flow evapotranspiration consists of the quantity of water referred to the unit of time that from the ground passes through the air to the vapor state due to the joint effect of transpiration through the plants and evaporation directly from the ground the potential evapotranspiration is different referring to a standard environmental condition in which the incidence of external factors agronomic biological and part of the climatic factors is not considered the purpose of this variable is to make the evapotranspiration values in space and time comparable for this reason potential evapotranspiration refers to the maximum amount that can be lost in the unit of time by evaporation and transpiration without external limitations many formulas are available for the calculation of the real evapotranspiration of a basin following the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 a potential evapotranspiration estimation pe nc is obtained for each month considering that a month is 30 days long and there are 12 theoretical sunshine hours per day applying the following equation 7 pe nc 16 10 t i α where t is the average monthly temperature i i 1 12 i the annual heat index calculated as the sum of the monthly heat indices i t 5 1 514 and α 675 10 9 i 3 771 10 7 i 2 1792 10 5 i 0 49239 obtained values are later corrected according to the real length of the month and the theoretical sunshine hours for the latitude of interest with the formula 8 pe pe nc n 12 d 30 with n the theoretical monthly mean of sunshine hours for each month and d number of days for each month given the series of observations of both the monthly rainfall p t and the potential monthly evapotranspiration pe t the actual monthly evapotranspiration ae t can be determined as follows i if p t or the sum p t s t is greater or equal to the potential monthly evapotranspiration pe t i e if there is no water limit the potential evapotranspiration can be considered coinciding with the real monthly evapotranspiration ae t pe t ii if p t s t is smaller than pe t the actual evapotranspiration is less than the potential evapotranspiration and it is equal to the sum p t s t in the model the actual evapotranspiration is then adjusted by a calibration parameter c which multiples a e t the monthly streamflow is related to the water content in soil by 9 q t s t tanh s t sc where sc is the second model parameter which represents the soil moisture capacity in unit of millimeter the water quantity remaining in the soil at the beginning of the t t h month is p t s t 1 ae t where s t 1 is the content of water in the soil at the beginning of the t t h month and at the end of t 1 t h month eq 9 can be used to estimate the t t h monthly streamflow as 10 q t p t s t 1 ae t tanh p t s t 1 ae t sc where s 0 is the third parameter of the model whose determination is quite simple because it has no significant incidence except in the first period of the series analyzed afterward the content of water at the end of the t t h month can be computed by the water conservation law as 11 s t p t s t 1 ae t q t the performance of the hydrological model has been assessed by computing the relative bias bias the nash sutcliffe coefficient nsce and the correlation coefficient r these three statistics are defined as 12 bias i 1 n q obs i q sim i i 1 n q obs i 13 nsce i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 14 r i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 1 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 1 2 where n is the number of data points q sim i is the simulated streamflow millimeter per month at time step i q obs i is the observed streamflow millimeter per month at time step i q sim and q obs are the means of the simulated and observed values millimeter per month respectively the estimation of the model parameters has been carried out ensuring a value of the correlation coefficient and the nsce coefficient close to 1 and minimizing the absolute value of bias after the comparison of the hydrological model results with the hydro meteorological data of the pre change period the meteorological data of the post change period influenced by anthropic activities are used as input to reproduce the natural flow with no consideration of the change in the characteristics of the watershed the difference between the simulated outflow and the outflow observed in the post change period gives the runoff variation and in particular it estimates the anthropic component 15 δ q h q sim 2 q obs 2 eq 15 proposed by wang et al 2013 can be seen as the simplified form of the more general equation 16 δ q h q obs 1 q obs 2 q sim 1 q sim 2 if it is assumed that the difference between q obs 1 and q sim 1 is negligible eq 16 reduces to eq 15 4 results and discussion 4 1 observed trends and change points analysis observed annual precipitation and runoff in the five catchments during the period 1951 2007 are presented in fig 2 trends in annual precipitation and runoff were detected by the mann kendal test and results are reported in table 2 except the feltrino basin at s vito annual runoff show significant negative trends in all the catchments with a confidence level of 99 annual precipitations also show significant negative trend except the pescara catchment this reduction of the annual rainfall is in agreement with findings of recent studies in central italy soldini and darvini 2017 the observed increase of the annual runoff despite the decrease of the annual precipitation in the feltrino river may be explained by the contribution of the sewer discharge from the municipalities located within the basin which volume is higher of the river natural flow to confirm this framework the increase of the mean streamflow respect to the natural condition has been estimated of about 82 in the spring summer seasons in the period 2002 2012 lanciani and pagliani 2015 however the positive trend detected for the feltrino at s vito catchment is not statistically significant see table 2 the pettitt s test was used to detect change points in runoff series and results are shown in table 3 and fig 3 the results show a significant change points in 1963 for the tordino at teramo in 1972 for the sangro at ateleta in 1973 for the pescara at maraone and in 1973 for the biferno at altopantano not significant change point is detected in 1997 for the feltrino at s vito to further study the change points of runoff series the double mass curve dmc method was also applied in fig 4 the dmc is represented by a blue line and stars up to the change point detected by the pettitt s test and by a red line and triangles after that results from the dmc are in good agreement with the change points detected by the pettitt s test with the exception for the tordino at teramo and to a lesser extent biferno catchments since dmc test is sensible to change not related with precipitation this implies that runoff might be affected by other factors such as human activities human activity may have started to affect the streamflow around 1959 for the tordino river and around 1968 for the biferno river this anthropic influence in the biferno river is probably due to the construction of the liscione dam which spanned from 1967 to 1973 regarding to the tordino catchment the period that goes from 1959 to 1963 seems to be characterized by a transitional streamflow regime this is more evident from fig 5 where the annual runoff time series and mean annual runoff before and after the change point detected by the pettitt s test are shown for all rivers being the dmc method mostly visual in case of uncertainty we decided to use the change point from the pettitt s test which instead provides quantitative results more reliable from a statistical point of view however the calibration period for the hydrological model was always chosen in order to do not overcome in time the change point detected by the dmc method according to change points detected in runoff the study period for all the catchments was divided into two periods a pre change period when few human activities affect runoff and a post change period where a decrease of the runoff is observed 4 2 precipitation and runoff relationship with the aim to understand the feature of the streamflow change table 3 the mean and standard deviation of the annual streamflow during the pre change and post change periods have been calculated with the exception of the feltrino river in all the others catchments the mean annual runoff decreased during the post change period the ratio between the mean annual streamflow of the post change period and that of the pre change period ranges from 21 5 to 67 5 this reveals a substantial reduction in the annual streamflow during the post change period furthermore in four catchments the coefficient of variation increases indicating a large variability of the streamflow during the post change period the correlation between precipitation and runoff was analyzed to better understand the influence of climate and other factors on streamflow during the two periods fig 6 the slope of the linear regression was higher during the pre change period for tordino and pescara rivers while in all the other basins the correlation is stronger in the post change periods the regression lines for the pre change period in all the catchments is above that for the post change period this indicates that for the same amount of rainfall the resulting runoff during the post change period is less than the one produced during pre change period and it suggests that also human activities in recent years affect runoff in the study area all the previous results have been used to quantify the individual effects of climate change and human activities on hydrological cycle 4 3 elasticity climate model results the precipitation elasticity of four catchments was calculated and shown in fig 7 by considering the tordino basin the precipitation elasticity ε p calculated from eq 4 is 2 48 fig 7 meaning that a rainfall variation of 10 will produce a 24 8 change in streamflow the values of ε p for the sangro pescara and biferno catchments are 1 24 0 44 and 1 75 respectively the r 2 values are smaller than 0 53 as a result of a certain dispersion of the experimental data the actual evapotranspiration elasticity ε ae is estimated to be 7 15 for the tordino basin meaning that a 10 increase in potential evapotranspiration would lead to a 71 5 decrease in streamflow the values of ε ae for sangro pescara and biferno catchments are 0 26 0 06 and 2 55 respectively as reported in table 4 for tordino and biferno rivers the annual streamflow was more sensitive to the change in potential evapotranspiration than to the change in precipitation while for sangro and pescara the opposite happens anyway as the variation of potential evapotranspiration between two periods is small data not shown the main driving factor for the runoff variation has been the variation of precipitation anyhow these results must be considered with caution as demonstrated by the very small r 2 values the variation of runoff related to the climate change can be estimated by annual data in the post change period by eq 6 the analysis does not concern the feltrino river as the statistical analysis reported in tables 2 and 3 are not significant the results displayed in table 4 indicate that the smallest impact of the precipitation change on the runoff is observed in the pesacara catchment while the tordino basin shows the largest response of the runoff to precipitation variations the latter result is consistent with the absence of any significant trend in the precipitation in the pescara basin so that the runoff variation in the poste change period is due to a large impact of human activities this is consistent also with the fact that in the upstream part of the pescara river the aterno and sagittarius rivers are involved in hydraulic exchanges with some important artificial reservoirs that alter the water cycle of the whole basin of the pescara river for the tordino biferno and sangro rivers the climate change has a larger impact on the runoff variation than the human activity for the sangro river the influence of the two factors on the streamflow reduction is more comparable than for the other basins 4 4 hydrological model results the hydrological model was calibrated with time series from january 1951 to december 1959 for the tordino river basin from january 1951 to december 1965 for the basin of the pescara from january 1953 to december 1964 for the biferno basin from january 1951 to december 1964 for the sangro basin for the feltrino basin due to the anomalies found in the rainfall and runoff trends with previous tests we have completely renounced the use of the model certain of the impossibility of obtaining reliable results the validation period for the tordino river basin ranges from january 1960 to december 1962 for the pescara basin from january 1966 to december 1972 for the sangro from january 1965 to december 1971 and for the biferno basin from january 1965 to december 1973 the simulated and measured streamflow for the calibration and validation period are shown in figs 8 and 9 to calibrate the model a base runoff has been added for the tordino river it was necessary to assume a base runoff of 5 mm of 29 mm for the pescara 12 mm for the sangro and 9 mm for the biferno this is probably due to the inaccuracies of the tornthwaite method for the calculation of evaporation which may result affected by errors and therefore lead to an overestimation of the evaporative contribution especially in the autumn months it can be seen that the model was calibrated generally well to the measured runoff depth and the calibrated model performed well for the validation data even though there are over or under estimates in some peak runoff the optimized parameter values and statistics for evaluating the performance are summarized in table 5 the parameter sc assumes in some cases very high values such as in the case of pescara river this aspect could be due to the difficulty already highlighted of the model of estimating evaporation based on the average basin temperature and it should be further investigated in the calibration period the coefficients r vary from 0 72 to 0 88 the nsce vary from 0 2 to 0 77 and the absolute values of the bias are smaller than 4 except for the tordino which shows a bias value of about 6 even if the model performances during the validation period are worst than those of the calibration period with smaller r and nsce and larger bias the results reported in table 5 are acceptable also considering the errors in the calculation of the evapotranspiration that often lead to an overestimation of the runoff once the hydrological model is calibrated using the hydro meteorological conditions of the pre change period baseline period precipitation and evapotranspiration data for the post change period human induced period are used as input to reconstruct natural streamflow with the validated model parameters when variations in the characteristics of the basin or realizations of artificial reservoirs are not considered 4 5 climate change and human activities effects on runoff after the natural streamflow time series for the basins during the post change period recreated the effects of human activities and climate variability on runoff can be assessed by the general framework of section 3 2 figs 10 and 11 show measured monthly runoff and simulated runoff by the hydrological model for the post change period as expected from the reduction of the runoff observed in the catchments in recent years the average annual mean flows simulated by the model are larger than the observed value in the post change period the greatest difference between two values is found in the tordino river the model overestimates the peak values of the runoff in the tordino and pescara rivers and underestimates the peak streamflow in the biferno river difference between observed and reconstructed values in the monthly streamflow during the post change period indicate that streamflow in the recent years should be driven also by increased anthropic activities in these areas the quantitative effects estimated by the hydrological model by eq 15 are reported in table 4 for the tordino sangro and biferno rivers the climate change is the main factor affecting the runoff variation in recent years which arises directly from the fact that the basins are controlled by the significant reduction in precipitation conversely for the pescara at maraone station human activities were dominant factors for the change in runoff the latter result is expected as no significant trend is observed in the annual precipitation table 2 for all the basins the hydrological model confirms the results of the climate elasticity method however there are uncertainties associated with assessing contribution of climate variability and human activities on runoff and a certain variation of the results obtained by two different methods is present differences on the percentages can be explained by the fact that the elasticity coefficient has been computed on the entire time series to ensure a long term average of precipitation p actual evapotranspiration ae and runoff q e g ma et al 2008 however the climate elasticity model may give different results if the elasticity coefficients are computed only in the pre change period furthermore the difference of the results of the two methods can be attributed to the role of the evapotranspiration which has been taken into account in terms of actual ae calculation computed by the thornthwaite method although the inaccuracy in the ae calculation negatively affects the results of both methods calibration may mitigate this spurious effect in the hydrological model regarding this aspect results from the hydrological model may are more reliable than results arising from the elasticity method 5 conclusions statistical analysis was used to detect trends and change points in precipitation and runoff time series in five catchments in the abruzzo and molise regions in italy significant negative trends in runoff can be found in all the catchments except the feltrino river precipitation also exhibits negative trend except the pescara at maraone basin thus the climate variability can be recognized as the main factor driving the reduction of the runoff which is in good agreement with what found for the mediterranean area ipcc pachauri et al 2014 nevertheless as the abruzzo and molise regions host several artificial lakes built for irrigation drinking water purpose or energy production we expected that human activities are also an important factor affecting hydrological processes as significant change points were detected in runoff the study period for all the catchments was divided into two periods a pre change period when few human activities affect runoff and a post change period characterized by a decrease in river runoff the climate elasticity method was first used to separately assess the anthropic and climate change impact on runoff the precipitation elasticity of the streamflow has allowed us to estimate the effects of climate variability on runoff during the post change period then a monthly hydrological model has been calibrated and validated based on hydro climatic data during the pre change period the effects of human activities on runoff were evaluated as a difference between measured runoff and simulated runoff by the model the climate elasticity method indicates that the reduction of the streamflow during the post change period must be mainly attributed to the climatic variability i e reduction of the precipitation for the sangro river the results are more uncertain and the impact of the anthropic effect and climate changes on the variation of the runoff is comparable conversely for the pescara river human activities were dominant factors for the change in runoff as expected from the absence of any significant trend in the annual precipitation the climate elasticity method results are confirmed by the hydrological model method although in the assessment of the effects of climate variability and human activities on runoff a certain variation of the percentages with different methods is observed except the tordino river the hydrological model seems to underestimate the contribution of the human activities on the runoff reduction this fact can be related to the capacity of the model to represent the contribution of the actual evapotranspiration ae only by measured temperatures the results should be further confirmed by improving the computation of ae nevertheless complex methods for the ae evaluation require additional input data that are not readily available we are well aware of the related uncertainties in trying to isolate the influence of the climate change and human activities on river runoff however we believe that using long data series together with the use of two different methodologies applied in five different catchments allows us to provide some useful information for the study area in that direction author contributions giovanna darvini conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft

8319,study region south central italy study focus a detailed analysis is carried out in five catchments in the adriatic coast where a complex system of artificial lakes forced conducts and hydropower stations has modified the river regime this together with the decrease of the annual rainfall in central italy make quantifying the relative contributions of human activities and climatic variability to streamflow change a challenging task statistically significant trends in annual rainfall and streamflow and change points in runoff have been investigated potential changes in precipitation runoff relationship have been examined and a quantitative evaluation of the effect of climate variability and human activities on runoff has been assessed separately new hydrological insights for the region significant negative trends in runoff have been found in all the catchments except the feltrino river precipitation also exhibits negative trend except the pescara basin significant change points in runoff were detected in all the basins and the study period was divided in a pre change and a post change period by climate elasticity method the climatic variability seems to be the main driving factor of the runoff decrease only for the pescara river human activities were dominant factors of the runoff reduction as expected from the absence of any significant trend in the annual precipitation the hydrological model confirms this result although the assessment of two contributions is affected by some uncertainties keywords climate change human activities hydrological model climate elasticity runoff 1 introduction the climate system warming is globally recognized with observed changes since 1950s pachauri et al 2014 observed changes in global annual precipitation from 1951 to 2010 indicate a significant increment in precipitation in north america part of the south america especially argentine part of northern and central asia india northern europe and australia conversely a reduction is observed in southern and central africa in the mediterranean area and the in east part of central asia pachauri et al 2014 in many regions changes in melting snow and ice or precipitation are modifying hydrological process with effects in water resources in terms of quantity and quality pachauri et al 2014 besides climate change human activities such as irrigation cultivation afforestation deforestation and urban construction introduce variability in the flow regime as an example afforestation reduces streamflow brown et al 2005 urbanization increases the surface generating runoff and reduces the time of concentration with an increase of the peak flow while land use and land cover change is believed to have impacts on infiltration and evapotranspiration ma et al 2008 zheng et al 2009 thus investigation of the impacts of climate change and human activity on hydrology and water resources has become a considerable field of interest hydrological variables such as precipitation are strongly dependent on atmospheric circulation and on the local orography soldini and darvini 2017 climate change impacts on natural and human systems are often spatially heterogeneous even because their variability arises also from social and economic factors hence the changes can be studied at different spatial scales and they may be more easily observed at local levels wang et al 2013 libertino et al 2019 numerous methods can be utilized for separating the individual impact of climate variability and human activities on streamflow like hydrological modeling ma et al 2008 wang et al 2013 climate elasticity zheng et al 2009 hydrological sensitivity method wang et al 2013 a review of methodologies and critical assumptions can be found in dey and mishra 2017 the majority of the studies on this topic have been carried out in chinese catchments as an example a quantitative assessment of the impact of climate variability and human activity on runoff reduction in the miyun reservoir basin in china is analyzed by ma et al 2010 by using a distributed hydrological model and a climate elasticity model the authors found that climate variability accounted for about 55 and 51 of the decrease of inflow responses of runoff to land surface and climate change in the headwaters of the yellow river basin are analyzed by a modified estimator of the climate elasticity by zheng et al 2009 they estimated that land use change is responsible for more than 70 of the streamflow reduction while climate change contributed to less than 30 of the reduction wang et al 2013 analyzed the runoff changes in four catchments of the haihe river basin china by three methods including hydrological sensitivity analysis hydrological model and climate elasticity method they found that human activities should be mainly responsible for the runoff reduction in three catchments from 54 to 67 whereas about 70 of runoff reduction in the hutuo river catchment was attributed to climate variability a few studies attempted to separate the climate change variability and human impacts on streamflow in european catchments by using rainfall runoff models in central belgium poelmans et al 2011 found that climate factor may affect flows up to 30 in southern italy d agostino et al 2010 concluded that by 2050 streamflows of the candelaro catchment would decrease by 16 23 recently impacts of climate variability and human activities on the streamflow of an alpine river in north western italy are quantified by saidi et al 2018 by means the application of methods including hydrological sensitivity climate elasticity and hydrological modeling they found that climate variability accounted for 85 of the decrease in streamflow the large variability of the results obtained in different countries confirms that the detection of individual effects of climate change and human activities on the hydrological regime is a challenge that needs to be studied at a local scale in this paper hydrological data of five catchments of rivers located in the abruzzo region except the biferno river which flows in the molise region and flowing in the adriatic sea fig 1 were analyzed this coastal area is important not just because of its delicate natural ecosystems but also for the connected economic and recreational activities however the salinity artegiani et al 1997 and the eutrophication ingarao et al 2009 of these coastal waters are influenced by river runoff with obvious consequence for this frail ecosystem this region is characterized by the presence of a complex system of artificial reservoirs and hydropower stations built from 1950 to 1970 for energy production or irrigation and drinking water purposes the massive presence of the human activity and the variation in the rainfall observed in the mediterranean area make the analysis of driving factors in the runoff changes of these basins a severe challenge therefore with this contribution we aim to 1 detect statistically significant change points and trends in annual streamflow and precipitation 2 find potential changes in precipitation runoff relationship and 3 evaluate the proportional influence on streamflow regime variations due to human activities and climate change the assessment of the relative contributions is carried out by the climate elasticity method and the hydrological model and results obtained by the two methods are compared each other 2 study area and dataset the analysis concerns annual and monthly data of rainfall and runoff in five catchments of rivers flowing in the adriatic sea in south central italy the rainfall and runoff dataset refers to the historical series collected in the hydrographic basins of the rivers tordino pescara feltrino and sangro in the abruzzo region and biferno in the molise region fig 1 the main characteristics of the five hydrometric stations and of the analyzed basins are reported in table 1 the id code gives the position of each station in the study area fig 1 the tordino river is located in the northern part of the abruzzo region initially it flows in the territory of the gran sasso national park with a torrential type regime near the sources the tordino river forms the waterfall of the fiumata and the tordino falls in the past the first reach of the river was also called trontino in the upper part there are mills and crushers up to valle san giovanni upstream of which the tordino is derived again for energy production the hydrometric station of teramo is located at the confluence of the tordino and vezzola rivers at a distance from the mouth of about 24 km altitude of 221 8 m a s l and watershed area of about 147 km 2 the pescara river originates by the outflows from the apennine mountains and flows toward the adriatic sea at the homonymous city its water network is particularly elaborate the watercourse is originated from the confluence of the aterno river which comes from the north west and the sagittarius river which flows from the south east this anomalous conformation if compared with others apennine rivers flowing in the adriatic sea derives from the particular conformation of the mountains which form two watersheds parallel to the sea the eastern basin characterized by the highest elevations of gran sasso 2814 m a s l and maiella 2714 m a s l and the second watershed at west with remarkable altitudes over 2000 m a s l the altitude of the station at maraone is 240 2 m a s l with a distance from the mouth of 50 km and the basin includes an area of 2003 km 2 the feltrino river originates on the hills of the abruzzo region at about 460 m a s l and flows after 16 km at san vito town the hydrometric station is at 3 m a s l and the total area of the basin is about 50 km 2 the sangro river is in the southern abruzzo and molise regions it originates in the abruzzo national park at about 1600 m of altitude the river flows between abruzzo and molise for about 60 km and then definitely falls in abruzzo the river is barred by dams forming three artificial lakes used to produce electricity barrea bomba and castel del giudice the sangro river receives the contribution of its major tributary the aventine river from this confluence it begins the low reach up to the mouth in the adriatic sea in the lower course of the sangro river there is another artificial barrier created for irrigation purposes in 1981 the basin at the ateleta gauge has a total area of about 545 km 2 the hydrometrical station is 58 km from the mouth at 720 m a s l the biferno river is entirely located in the molise region it is 85 km long and it originates from the matese mountains at 500 m a s l after crossing a rocky valley full of gullies and cliffs the river flows into guardialfiera or liscione lake an artificial basin built between the sixties and seventies to meet potable agricultural and industrial needs of the coastal area of molise and northern puglia after 30 km from the barrier the river reaches the adriatic sea with an estuary mouth near termoli town the basin area at the altopantano station is 1290 km 2 the hydrometric gauge is 9 6 km from the mouth at 6 m a s l annual monthly and daily data have been selected from the database of the servizio idrografico e mareografico of the abruzzo region the recording period of observation for the daily rainfall and runoff is the interval reported in table 1 with the characteristics of the gauges in fig 1 are shown also the thermometric stations whose temperature data have been used for the hydrological model as described in section 3 2 2 unlike a previous analysis memmola and darvini 2018 timeseries of rainfall and runoff have been checked to ensure the quality of the analyzed series in terms of homogeneity and continuity missing data of annual runoff have been reconstructed based on the concept of persistence koutsoyiannis 2005 by means of daily data in order to identify the final dataset the selection have has been made based on two criteria stations must have recorded for more than 50 years wmo 1988 and the total missing data cannot be more than 20 furthermore the consecutive missing data are not more than 12 of the total data instead for daily rainfall the number of missing data in the annual series must be smaller than 10 of the length of the series 36 missing days maximum 3 methodology 3 1 trend detection and break point analysis method the mann kendall trend test is a rank based test mann 1945 kendall 1975 used to discover trends in precipitation and streamflow time series among advantages of this test is that it does not require a normal distribution of the data the presence of outliers does not significantly affect the test results and its power is comparable to that of other similar statistical tests trends magnitude was estimated by the sen s slope method sen 1968 based on kendall s tau the pettitt s test pettitt 1979 consists of a non parametric approach to detect the likely location of a single change point the test is a rank based and distribution free method used when the exact time of the change is unknown the significant differences between means of two samples were tested using the two tails t test with a 95 confidence level the double mass curve dmc is usually used to discover hydrological changes in the streamflow regime due to human activities it consists of the plot of the accumulate values of two related variables for the same time period the two accumulate values are plotted one against the other if two variables are proportional the dmc is a straight line and the ratio between the two variables is represented by the slope of the line the breaking of the original relationship can be indicated by the change of the line slope in this study the dmc connecting runoff and precipitation has been used as a further confirmation of the change points detected by the pettitt s test 3 2 separation of climate change and human activities impacts on runoff variation the runoff of a catchment can be assumed as a function of human activities and climate variables by 1 q f c h where q is the runoff h represents the human activities factor on runoff and c the climate variables affecting the hydrological cycle changes in runoff due to human activities and climate variability can be evaluated as 2 δ q f h δ h f c δ c where δ q δ h and δ c are changes in runoff human activities and climate respectively with f h q h and f c q c by a first order approximation eq 2 can be written as 3 δ q δ q h δ q c where δ q h and δ q c are the changes in runoff due to human activity and climate variability respectively even though human activities and climate variability are not independent of each other for the small basins analyzed in this study climate variability can be considered mainly controlled by external forces consequently these two variables were treated as independent factors at basin scale wang et al 2013 in this framework δ q can be obtained as the difference between the observed average annual runoff during pre changed period q 1 and the observed average annual runoff during the post changed period q 2 as a consequence the separation of the effect of human activities and of the influence of climate change can be obtained if δ q h or δ q c is estimated 3 2 1 climate elasticity method in this study we estimate the effect of climate change on streamflow using at first the climate elasticity method first proposed by schaake 1990 and then developed by several authors e g dooge et al 1999 zheng et al 2009 the elasticity of streamflow can be considered as the corresponding change of runoff against the corresponding change of a climate factor with reference to the rainfall the sensitivity coefficient of the streamflow to precipitation p can be expressed as zheng et al 2009 4 ε p δ q i q δ p i p q i q q p i p p where δ q i and δ p i are the variations of the annual streamflow and precipitation computed with respect to the long term average of streamflow q and precipitation p analogously the sensitivity coefficient of the streamflow to actual evapotranspiration ae is 5 ε ae δ q i q δ a e i a e q i q q ae i a e a e where δ ae i is the change of the annual actual evapotranspiration with respect to the long term average of the actual evapotranspiration a e from the values of ε p and ε ae computed in the entire observation period the variation of runoff related to the climate change can be estimated by annual data in the post change period 6 δ q c δ q p δ q ae ε p δ p p ε ep δ ae ae q natural ε p p 1 p 2 p 1 ε ae ae 1 ae 2 ae 1 q 1 where p 1 and ae 1 are the average precipitation and actual evapotranspiration during the pre change period and p 2 and ae 2 are the average precipitation and actual evapotranspiration during the post change period the natural streamflow q natural is represented by the streamflow in the pre change period in this study potential evapotranspiration pe was estimated by the thornthwaite empirical method described in section 3 2 2 thornthwaite 1948 this method only requires the mean monthly temperature as the input therefore the climate signal in the temperature data is considered in the calculations of evapotranspiration other methods need additional input data which are not readily available or are more complicated to collect saidi et al 2018 after δ q c has been calculated by eq 6 δ q h can be estimated by subtracting δ q c from the total runoff variation δ q 3 2 2 hydrological model the monthly hydrological model proposed by xiong and guo 1999 and described by wang et al 2013 was used in this study the water balance of a catchment can be expressed as p δ s q ae where p is the precipitation δ s is the variation of the water content in soil s q is the runoff and a e is the real evapotranspiration the basin is considered as a linear reservoir and the balance equation expresses the conservation of the amount of water that falls through the rainfall and then returns to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration unless infiltration and surface flow evapotranspiration consists of the quantity of water referred to the unit of time that from the ground passes through the air to the vapor state due to the joint effect of transpiration through the plants and evaporation directly from the ground the potential evapotranspiration is different referring to a standard environmental condition in which the incidence of external factors agronomic biological and part of the climatic factors is not considered the purpose of this variable is to make the evapotranspiration values in space and time comparable for this reason potential evapotranspiration refers to the maximum amount that can be lost in the unit of time by evaporation and transpiration without external limitations many formulas are available for the calculation of the real evapotranspiration of a basin following the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 a potential evapotranspiration estimation pe nc is obtained for each month considering that a month is 30 days long and there are 12 theoretical sunshine hours per day applying the following equation 7 pe nc 16 10 t i α where t is the average monthly temperature i i 1 12 i the annual heat index calculated as the sum of the monthly heat indices i t 5 1 514 and α 675 10 9 i 3 771 10 7 i 2 1792 10 5 i 0 49239 obtained values are later corrected according to the real length of the month and the theoretical sunshine hours for the latitude of interest with the formula 8 pe pe nc n 12 d 30 with n the theoretical monthly mean of sunshine hours for each month and d number of days for each month given the series of observations of both the monthly rainfall p t and the potential monthly evapotranspiration pe t the actual monthly evapotranspiration ae t can be determined as follows i if p t or the sum p t s t is greater or equal to the potential monthly evapotranspiration pe t i e if there is no water limit the potential evapotranspiration can be considered coinciding with the real monthly evapotranspiration ae t pe t ii if p t s t is smaller than pe t the actual evapotranspiration is less than the potential evapotranspiration and it is equal to the sum p t s t in the model the actual evapotranspiration is then adjusted by a calibration parameter c which multiples a e t the monthly streamflow is related to the water content in soil by 9 q t s t tanh s t sc where sc is the second model parameter which represents the soil moisture capacity in unit of millimeter the water quantity remaining in the soil at the beginning of the t t h month is p t s t 1 ae t where s t 1 is the content of water in the soil at the beginning of the t t h month and at the end of t 1 t h month eq 9 can be used to estimate the t t h monthly streamflow as 10 q t p t s t 1 ae t tanh p t s t 1 ae t sc where s 0 is the third parameter of the model whose determination is quite simple because it has no significant incidence except in the first period of the series analyzed afterward the content of water at the end of the t t h month can be computed by the water conservation law as 11 s t p t s t 1 ae t q t the performance of the hydrological model has been assessed by computing the relative bias bias the nash sutcliffe coefficient nsce and the correlation coefficient r these three statistics are defined as 12 bias i 1 n q obs i q sim i i 1 n q obs i 13 nsce i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 14 r i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 1 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 1 2 where n is the number of data points q sim i is the simulated streamflow millimeter per month at time step i q obs i is the observed streamflow millimeter per month at time step i q sim and q obs are the means of the simulated and observed values millimeter per month respectively the estimation of the model parameters has been carried out ensuring a value of the correlation coefficient and the nsce coefficient close to 1 and minimizing the absolute value of bias after the comparison of the hydrological model results with the hydro meteorological data of the pre change period the meteorological data of the post change period influenced by anthropic activities are used as input to reproduce the natural flow with no consideration of the change in the characteristics of the watershed the difference between the simulated outflow and the outflow observed in the post change period gives the runoff variation and in particular it estimates the anthropic component 15 δ q h q sim 2 q obs 2 eq 15 proposed by wang et al 2013 can be seen as the simplified form of the more general equation 16 δ q h q obs 1 q obs 2 q sim 1 q sim 2 if it is assumed that the difference between q obs 1 and q sim 1 is negligible eq 16 reduces to eq 15 4 results and discussion 4 1 observed trends and change points analysis observed annual precipitation and runoff in the five catchments during the period 1951 2007 are presented in fig 2 trends in annual precipitation and runoff were detected by the mann kendal test and results are reported in table 2 except the feltrino basin at s vito annual runoff show significant negative trends in all the catchments with a confidence level of 99 annual precipitations also show significant negative trend except the pescara catchment this reduction of the annual rainfall is in agreement with findings of recent studies in central italy soldini and darvini 2017 the observed increase of the annual runoff despite the decrease of the annual precipitation in the feltrino river may be explained by the contribution of the sewer discharge from the municipalities located within the basin which volume is higher of the river natural flow to confirm this framework the increase of the mean streamflow respect to the natural condition has been estimated of about 82 in the spring summer seasons in the period 2002 2012 lanciani and pagliani 2015 however the positive trend detected for the feltrino at s vito catchment is not statistically significant see table 2 the pettitt s test was used to detect change points in runoff series and results are shown in table 3 and fig 3 the results show a significant change points in 1963 for the tordino at teramo in 1972 for the sangro at ateleta in 1973 for the pescara at maraone and in 1973 for the biferno at altopantano not significant change point is detected in 1997 for the feltrino at s vito to further study the change points of runoff series the double mass curve dmc method was also applied in fig 4 the dmc is represented by a blue line and stars up to the change point detected by the pettitt s test and by a red line and triangles after that results from the dmc are in good agreement with the change points detected by the pettitt s test with the exception for the tordino at teramo and to a lesser extent biferno catchments since dmc test is sensible to change not related with precipitation this implies that runoff might be affected by other factors such as human activities human activity may have started to affect the streamflow around 1959 for the tordino river and around 1968 for the biferno river this anthropic influence in the biferno river is probably due to the construction of the liscione dam which spanned from 1967 to 1973 regarding to the tordino catchment the period that goes from 1959 to 1963 seems to be characterized by a transitional streamflow regime this is more evident from fig 5 where the annual runoff time series and mean annual runoff before and after the change point detected by the pettitt s test are shown for all rivers being the dmc method mostly visual in case of uncertainty we decided to use the change point from the pettitt s test which instead provides quantitative results more reliable from a statistical point of view however the calibration period for the hydrological model was always chosen in order to do not overcome in time the change point detected by the dmc method according to change points detected in runoff the study period for all the catchments was divided into two periods a pre change period when few human activities affect runoff and a post change period where a decrease of the runoff is observed 4 2 precipitation and runoff relationship with the aim to understand the feature of the streamflow change table 3 the mean and standard deviation of the annual streamflow during the pre change and post change periods have been calculated with the exception of the feltrino river in all the others catchments the mean annual runoff decreased during the post change period the ratio between the mean annual streamflow of the post change period and that of the pre change period ranges from 21 5 to 67 5 this reveals a substantial reduction in the annual streamflow during the post change period furthermore in four catchments the coefficient of variation increases indicating a large variability of the streamflow during the post change period the correlation between precipitation and runoff was analyzed to better understand the influence of climate and other factors on streamflow during the two periods fig 6 the slope of the linear regression was higher during the pre change period for tordino and pescara rivers while in all the other basins the correlation is stronger in the post change periods the regression lines for the pre change period in all the catchments is above that for the post change period this indicates that for the same amount of rainfall the resulting runoff during the post change period is less than the one produced during pre change period and it suggests that also human activities in recent years affect runoff in the study area all the previous results have been used to quantify the individual effects of climate change and human activities on hydrological cycle 4 3 elasticity climate model results the precipitation elasticity of four catchments was calculated and shown in fig 7 by considering the tordino basin the precipitation elasticity ε p calculated from eq 4 is 2 48 fig 7 meaning that a rainfall variation of 10 will produce a 24 8 change in streamflow the values of ε p for the sangro pescara and biferno catchments are 1 24 0 44 and 1 75 respectively the r 2 values are smaller than 0 53 as a result of a certain dispersion of the experimental data the actual evapotranspiration elasticity ε ae is estimated to be 7 15 for the tordino basin meaning that a 10 increase in potential evapotranspiration would lead to a 71 5 decrease in streamflow the values of ε ae for sangro pescara and biferno catchments are 0 26 0 06 and 2 55 respectively as reported in table 4 for tordino and biferno rivers the annual streamflow was more sensitive to the change in potential evapotranspiration than to the change in precipitation while for sangro and pescara the opposite happens anyway as the variation of potential evapotranspiration between two periods is small data not shown the main driving factor for the runoff variation has been the variation of precipitation anyhow these results must be considered with caution as demonstrated by the very small r 2 values the variation of runoff related to the climate change can be estimated by annual data in the post change period by eq 6 the analysis does not concern the feltrino river as the statistical analysis reported in tables 2 and 3 are not significant the results displayed in table 4 indicate that the smallest impact of the precipitation change on the runoff is observed in the pesacara catchment while the tordino basin shows the largest response of the runoff to precipitation variations the latter result is consistent with the absence of any significant trend in the precipitation in the pescara basin so that the runoff variation in the poste change period is due to a large impact of human activities this is consistent also with the fact that in the upstream part of the pescara river the aterno and sagittarius rivers are involved in hydraulic exchanges with some important artificial reservoirs that alter the water cycle of the whole basin of the pescara river for the tordino biferno and sangro rivers the climate change has a larger impact on the runoff variation than the human activity for the sangro river the influence of the two factors on the streamflow reduction is more comparable than for the other basins 4 4 hydrological model results the hydrological model was calibrated with time series from january 1951 to december 1959 for the tordino river basin from january 1951 to december 1965 for the basin of the pescara from january 1953 to december 1964 for the biferno basin from january 1951 to december 1964 for the sangro basin for the feltrino basin due to the anomalies found in the rainfall and runoff trends with previous tests we have completely renounced the use of the model certain of the impossibility of obtaining reliable results the validation period for the tordino river basin ranges from january 1960 to december 1962 for the pescara basin from january 1966 to december 1972 for the sangro from january 1965 to december 1971 and for the biferno basin from january 1965 to december 1973 the simulated and measured streamflow for the calibration and validation period are shown in figs 8 and 9 to calibrate the model a base runoff has been added for the tordino river it was necessary to assume a base runoff of 5 mm of 29 mm for the pescara 12 mm for the sangro and 9 mm for the biferno this is probably due to the inaccuracies of the tornthwaite method for the calculation of evaporation which may result affected by errors and therefore lead to an overestimation of the evaporative contribution especially in the autumn months it can be seen that the model was calibrated generally well to the measured runoff depth and the calibrated model performed well for the validation data even though there are over or under estimates in some peak runoff the optimized parameter values and statistics for evaluating the performance are summarized in table 5 the parameter sc assumes in some cases very high values such as in the case of pescara river this aspect could be due to the difficulty already highlighted of the model of estimating evaporation based on the average basin temperature and it should be further investigated in the calibration period the coefficients r vary from 0 72 to 0 88 the nsce vary from 0 2 to 0 77 and the absolute values of the bias are smaller than 4 except for the tordino which shows a bias value of about 6 even if the model performances during the validation period are worst than those of the calibration period with smaller r and nsce and larger bias the results reported in table 5 are acceptable also considering the errors in the calculation of the evapotranspiration that often lead to an overestimation of the runoff once the hydrological model is calibrated using the hydro meteorological conditions of the pre change period baseline period precipitation and evapotranspiration data for the post change period human induced period are used as input to reconstruct natural streamflow with the validated model parameters when variations in the characteristics of the basin or realizations of artificial reservoirs are not considered 4 5 climate change and human activities effects on runoff after the natural streamflow time series for the basins during the post change period recreated the effects of human activities and climate variability on runoff can be assessed by the general framework of section 3 2 figs 10 and 11 show measured monthly runoff and simulated runoff by the hydrological model for the post change period as expected from the reduction of the runoff observed in the catchments in recent years the average annual mean flows simulated by the model are larger than the observed value in the post change period the greatest difference between two values is found in the tordino river the model overestimates the peak values of the runoff in the tordino and pescara rivers and underestimates the peak streamflow in the biferno river difference between observed and reconstructed values in the monthly streamflow during the post change period indicate that streamflow in the recent years should be driven also by increased anthropic activities in these areas the quantitative effects estimated by the hydrological model by eq 15 are reported in table 4 for the tordino sangro and biferno rivers the climate change is the main factor affecting the runoff variation in recent years which arises directly from the fact that the basins are controlled by the significant reduction in precipitation conversely for the pescara at maraone station human activities were dominant factors for the change in runoff the latter result is expected as no significant trend is observed in the annual precipitation table 2 for all the basins the hydrological model confirms the results of the climate elasticity method however there are uncertainties associated with assessing contribution of climate variability and human activities on runoff and a certain variation of the results obtained by two different methods is present differences on the percentages can be explained by the fact that the elasticity coefficient has been computed on the entire time series to ensure a long term average of precipitation p actual evapotranspiration ae and runoff q e g ma et al 2008 however the climate elasticity model may give different results if the elasticity coefficients are computed only in the pre change period furthermore the difference of the results of the two methods can be attributed to the role of the evapotranspiration which has been taken into account in terms of actual ae calculation computed by the thornthwaite method although the inaccuracy in the ae calculation negatively affects the results of both methods calibration may mitigate this spurious effect in the hydrological model regarding this aspect results from the hydrological model may are more reliable than results arising from the elasticity method 5 conclusions statistical analysis was used to detect trends and change points in precipitation and runoff time series in five catchments in the abruzzo and molise regions in italy significant negative trends in runoff can be found in all the catchments except the feltrino river precipitation also exhibits negative trend except the pescara at maraone basin thus the climate variability can be recognized as the main factor driving the reduction of the runoff which is in good agreement with what found for the mediterranean area ipcc pachauri et al 2014 nevertheless as the abruzzo and molise regions host several artificial lakes built for irrigation drinking water purpose or energy production we expected that human activities are also an important factor affecting hydrological processes as significant change points were detected in runoff the study period for all the catchments was divided into two periods a pre change period when few human activities affect runoff and a post change period characterized by a decrease in river runoff the climate elasticity method was first used to separately assess the anthropic and climate change impact on runoff the precipitation elasticity of the streamflow has allowed us to estimate the effects of climate variability on runoff during the post change period then a monthly hydrological model has been calibrated and validated based on hydro climatic data during the pre change period the effects of human activities on runoff were evaluated as a difference between measured runoff and simulated runoff by the model the climate elasticity method indicates that the reduction of the streamflow during the post change period must be mainly attributed to the climatic variability i e reduction of the precipitation for the sangro river the results are more uncertain and the impact of the anthropic effect and climate changes on the variation of the runoff is comparable conversely for the pescara river human activities were dominant factors for the change in runoff as expected from the absence of any significant trend in the annual precipitation the climate elasticity method results are confirmed by the hydrological model method although in the assessment of the effects of climate variability and human activities on runoff a certain variation of the percentages with different methods is observed except the tordino river the hydrological model seems to underestimate the contribution of the human activities on the runoff reduction this fact can be related to the capacity of the model to represent the contribution of the actual evapotranspiration ae only by measured temperatures the results should be further confirmed by improving the computation of ae nevertheless complex methods for the ae evaluation require additional input data that are not readily available we are well aware of the related uncertainties in trying to isolate the influence of the climate change and human activities on river runoff however we believe that using long data series together with the use of two different methodologies applied in five different catchments allows us to provide some useful information for the study area in that direction author contributions giovanna darvini conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft
