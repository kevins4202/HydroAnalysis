11050,increasing plant density under insufficiency or deficit irrigation is considered a new water saving technique in cotton production especially in xinjiang china an arid area with a short growing period increasing plant density reduces light intensity within the canopy therefore we hypothesized that resource use efficiency may be the main factor affecting cotton yield and water use efficiency under limited irrigation conditions to test this hypothesis 2 year field experiments were conducted to explore the effects of two irrigation patterns i500 conventional irrigation i425 limited

plant worldwide the total seed cotton yield in china accounts for approximately 30 of the worldwide cotton production approximately 68 of the cotton in china is produced in xinjiang province national bureau of statistics of china 2017 however the growing period of cotton in northern xinjiang is usually 40 90 days shorter than those in other parts of china lou 2010 mao 2014 the usa jost and cothren 2000 and southern queensland of australia cotton production in australia 2016 mainly due to the rapid decrease in air temperature in late august and early september in addition the annual radiation reaches 5500 6000 mj m 2 with a day length of 1200 h while the active accumulated temperature and its duration in xinjiang province are lower by approximately 1000 1800 and 120 180 d respectively than in southern queensland australia cotton production in australia 2016 however cotton production in the region is easily limited by water evapotranspiration over 2000 mm thus coordinating the relationship between light temperature and water is key for further improving cotton yield under a lower active accumulated temperature and sufficient light environment the relationship between light temperature and water can be coordinated only in response to proper crop management practices of which irrigation level zhang et al 2016 and plant population dong et al 2005 kaggwa asiimwe et al 2013 yao et al 2015 are most important for instance deficit irrigation and alternative irrigation practices can maintain crop yields and improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue kang and zhang 2001 by limiting vegetative growth and stomatal opening changing the growth stage reducing transpiration and maintaining photosynthesis in addition a mild water deficit had no significant effect on crop photosynthesis but reduced irrigation amounts shangguan et al 2000 chen 2007 different planting densities can change the light temperature heat and enzyme activity of assimilated metabolism at different positions in the canopy lou et al 2010 kaggwa asiimwe et al 2013 in addition dense plants increase the size of the cotton population promoting the canopy apparent photosynthetic rate cap before the full flowering stage antonietta et al 2014 studies have also reported that higher planting densities can reduce water evaporation and increase the water consumption in the field kaggwa asiimwe et al 2013 antonietta et al 2014 yao et al 2015 in addition a reasonable higher planting density could promote early maturation and full use of accumulated temperature for cotton plants li 2002 bai et al 2017 in summary the reasonable combination of mild water deficit and higher planting density may be a way to coordinate the relationship among light temperature and water to promote higher cotton yield and resource use efficiency by increasing the planting density above 20 22 plant m 2 cotton yield and boll formation in the middle and lower parts of the plants were reduced as a result of large amounts of shading in the middle and lower parts of the cotton plant zhang et al 2016 in addition an irrigation deficit can adjust the canopy structure changing the light distribution in the canopy zhan et al 2015 thus under limited water application conditions it is unknown whether a higher planting density can adapt the lower active accumulated temperature and its duration to improve the canopy light use efficiency of cotton to achieve optimal yields the objective of this study was to 1 determine the effects of irrigation patterns and planting densities on canopy structure traits including leaf area index lai mean leaf inclination angle mia light interception rate lir cap yield traits iwue and fiber quality of cotton crops and 2 determine the best management options for

density alter the cotton canopy structure crop yield formation is a population level process and is easily altered by water nutrient management and population numbers planting density sidlauskas and bernotas 2003 redfern et al 2012 many studies have shown that reasonable water zhang et al 2011 zhan et al 2015 and planting density dong et al 2006a b yao et al 2015 management can increase cotton yields by improving both light use rates and the coordination between vegetative organ growth and the development of reproductive organs in the present study the interaction between limited irrigation and high planting density i425d36 achieved the greatest cotton sy this high sy was obtained because of the high boll numbers in the cotton population before 105 das i425d36 first increased the mia and then increased the lai u lir and m lir further improving the cap which provides the basic materials required for boll formation after 105 das i425d36 first increased the lai and then increased the u lir and m lir supporting sys maintaining this light interception ensures that energy is available for photosynthesis in addition there are higher co2 concentrations in the middle and lower canopies than in the upper canopy of a cotton population under a high planting density ensuring that materials are available for photosynthesis zhang et al 2004 all of these conditions increase the cap which promotes dry matter accumulation in the population ficklin et al 2010 liu et al 2011 in our study before 105 das a high planting density and limited irrigation increased the mia which increased light interception in the upper and middle canopies of the cotton population after 105 das limited irrigation and a higher planting density simultaneously increased both the canopy openness of the cotton population and the lai this phenomenon also averts the premature senescence of leaves in the middle and lower canopies of a cotton population because of greater vegetative organs shading the light under adequate water conditions liu et al 2011 mao et al 2014 therefore limited irrigation and a higher planting density increased the lai ensuring both light interception and absorption in the upper and middle canopies and promoting cap supporting the formation of yield 4 2 effective cotton middle canopy structure was detrimental to improving cotton fiber quality quality is mainly affected by genetic factors bowman and gutiérrez 2003 followed by environmental factors and cultivation management practices in the field pettigrew 2001 read et al 2006 however cultivation management affects mostly resource use efficiency including light temperature water and nutrients of field cotton dong et al 2006b zhang et al 2007 2016 in the present study compared with the other treatments i425d36 had no significant effect on fiber quality however i425d36 lost the capacity to regulate the mia especially after boll stage this relatively lost ability reduced the light interception in the upper canopy and increased the lir in the middle canopy which potentially negatively affected cotton fiber quality the cotton fiber quality in the upper canopy is low brandow and davidonis 2000 davidonis et al 2004 i425d36 increased the proportion of boll numbers in the upper canopy data not shown which in turn decreased the proportion of fine fiber quality to the total fiber quality many studies have reported that adequate light pettigrew 1995 jiang et al 2005 hassanli et al 2009 and reasonable temperature approximately 24 c reddy et al 1991 wang et al 2006 are the major factors governing the formation or development of cotton fiber quality especially fl fs and fu under limited or adequate water application conditions after the full boll stage i425d36 could provide adequate light and temperature in the upper and middle canopies of the cotton population however this treatment counteracted the maintaining of reasonable temperatures in the upper canopy of the cotton population thus this treatment did not improve cotton fiber quality in addition the cotton population in i425d36 still exhibited low photosynthetic production despite a high m lir making it difficult to both support the formation of fine fiber quality in the middle canopy of the cotton population and maintain the proportion of fine fiber quality to total fiber quality thus i425d36 was disadvantaged with respect to coordinating the relationship among light interception light distribution boll location and cotton fiber quality formation in the upper and middle canopies after boll stage to improve cotton fiber quality 4 3 limited irrigation and high planting densities improve irrigation water use efficiency in our study i425d36 improved the iwue mainly in two ways first by increasing yield which maintained relatively high water productivity second by supporting the size of the upper and middle canopies in the cotton population and enlarging the m lir after 105 das boll stage meng et al 2008 and li et al 2012 reported that limited irrigation during the early growth stage can increase the root distribution in the deep soil layer to acquire the stored moisture in the deeper soil layer from rain or other sources ensuring water application improves the wue xu et al 2016 however reducing the irrigation amount after the full boll stage despite decreasing stomatal opening and transpiration had less effect on dry matter accumulation and yield formation which ensures a relatively high water productivity chastain et al 2014 lima et al 2015 in addition luo et al 2013 also reported that reasonably reducing the irrigation amount during the growth stage could stimulate the compensatory ability to improve water productivity in the present study high planting density easily caused competition among single plants within the cotton population this competition promoted vegetative organ growth to limit the development of reproductive organs however limiting irrigation could balance the relationship between vegetative organs and reproductive organs meng et al 2008 improving or maintaining the iwue via high yields under certain water application conditions is a possible reason in addition transpiration accounted for 80 90 of the total water consumption and higher planting density formed a greater lai and canopy size of the cotton population which can reduce soil water evaporation meng et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 moreover increasing the mia promoted light transmittance in the upper canopy causing relatively high temperature reddy et al 1995 conaty et al 2015 xu et al 2016 and light mayoral et al 2015 conditions in the upper and middle canopies these conditions decreased stomatal opening and the transpiration rate leading to increased wue however studies gao et al 2007 chen et al 2010 antonietta et al 2014 have also reported that water consumption increases as plant density increases moreover limited irrigation during the early growth stage counteracts the formation of photosynthates in the cotton population reducing wue possible reasons are that small individual cotton plants exhibited low water consumption rates and the higher planting density decreased soil evaporation moreover cotton exhibited high stress tolerance to the limited irrigation which had less adverse effects on the growth of the cotton population thus increasing the lai and the light distribution and absorption in middle and upper canopies is one way to achieve high iwue in cotton production 5 conclusion in conclusion to cope with large amounts of annual radiation and limited active accumulated temperature and water availability limited irrigation with high plant density should be used to achieve an optimum yield and irrigation water use efficiency no adverse effects on fiber quality were observed across different treatments increases in lint yield and irrigation water use efficiency in cotton are generally caused by increases in leaf area index light interception and absorption in the top and middle canopies these results indicate that cotton can be irrigated with the drip irrigation method at a 425 mm level and a plant density of 36 plants m 2 without reducing lint yield in regions where water and active accumulated temperature are limited acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the research fund for the national natural science

density alter the cotton canopy structure crop yield formation is a population level process and is easily altered by water nutrient management and population numbers planting density sidlauskas and bernotas 2003 redfern et al 2012 many studies have shown that reasonable water zhang et al 2011 zhan et al 2015 and planting density dong et al 2006a b yao et al 2015 management can increase cotton yields by improving both light use rates and the coordination between vegetative organ growth and the development of reproductive organs in the present study the interaction between limited irrigation and high planting density i425d36 achieved the greatest cotton sy this high sy was obtained because of the high boll numbers in the cotton population before 105 das i425d36 first increased the mia and then increased the lai u lir and m lir further improving the cap which provides the basic materials required for boll formation after 105 das i425d36 first increased the lai and then increased the u lir and m lir supporting sys maintaining this light interception ensures that energy is available for photosynthesis in addition there are higher co2 concentrations in the middle and lower canopies than in the upper canopy of a cotton population under a high planting density ensuring that materials are available for photosynthesis zhang et al 2004 all of these conditions increase the cap which promotes dry matter accumulation in the population ficklin et al 2010 liu et al 2011 in our study before 105 das a high planting density and limited irrigation increased the mia which increased light interception in the upper and middle canopies of the cotton population after 105 das limited irrigation and a higher planting density simultaneously increased both the canopy openness of the cotton population and the lai this phenomenon also averts the premature senescence of leaves in the middle and lower canopies of a cotton population because of greater vegetative organs shading the light under adequate water conditions liu et al 2011 mao et al 2014 therefore limited irrigation and a higher planting density increased the lai ensuring both light interception and absorption in the upper and middle canopies and promoting cap supporting the formation of yield 4 2 effective cotton middle canopy structure was detrimental to improving cotton fiber quality quality is mainly affected by genetic factors bowman and gutiérrez 2003 followed by environmental factors and cultivation management practices in the field pettigrew 2001 read et al 2006 however cultivation management affects mostly resource use efficiency including light temperature water and nutrients of field cotton dong et al 2006b zhang et al 2007 2016 in the present study compared with the other treatments i425d36 had no significant effect on fiber quality however i425d36 lost the capacity to regulate the mia especially after boll stage this relatively lost ability reduced the light interception in the upper canopy and increased the lir in the middle canopy which potentially negatively affected cotton fiber quality the cotton fiber quality in the upper canopy is low brandow and davidonis 2000 davidonis et al 2004 i425d36 increased the proportion of boll numbers in the upper canopy data not shown which in turn decreased the proportion of fine fiber quality to the total fiber quality many studies have reported that adequate light pettigrew 1995 jiang et al 2005 hassanli et al 2009 and reasonable temperature approximately 24 c reddy et al 1991 wang et al 2006 are the major factors governing the formation or development of cotton fiber quality especially fl fs and fu under limited or adequate water application conditions after the full boll stage i425d36 could provide adequate light and temperature in the upper and middle canopies of the cotton population however this treatment counteracted the maintaining of reasonable temperatures in the upper canopy of the cotton population thus this treatment did not improve cotton fiber quality in addition the cotton population in i425d36 still exhibited low photosynthetic production despite a high m lir making it difficult to both support the formation of fine fiber quality in the middle canopy of the cotton population and maintain the proportion of fine fiber quality to total fiber quality thus i425d36 was disadvantaged with respect to coordinating the relationship among light interception light distribution boll location and cotton fiber quality formation in the upper and middle canopies after boll stage to improve cotton fiber quality 4 3 limited irrigation and high planting densities improve irrigation water use efficiency in our study i425d36 improved the iwue mainly in two ways first by increasing yield which maintained relatively high water productivity second by supporting the size of the upper and middle canopies in the cotton population and enlarging the m lir after 105 das boll stage meng et al 2008 and li et al 2012 reported that limited irrigation during the early growth stage can increase the root distribution in the deep soil layer to acquire the stored moisture in the deeper soil layer from rain or other sources ensuring water application improves the wue xu et al 2016 however reducing the irrigation amount after the full boll stage despite decreasing stomatal opening and transpiration had less effect on dry matter accumulation and yield formation which ensures a relatively high water productivity chastain et al 2014 lima et al 2015 in addition luo et al 2013 also reported that reasonably reducing the irrigation amount during the growth stage could stimulate the compensatory ability to improve water productivity in the present study high planting density easily caused competition among single plants within the cotton population this competition promoted vegetative organ growth to limit the development of reproductive organs however limiting irrigation could balance the relationship between vegetative organs and reproductive organs meng et al 2008 improving or maintaining the iwue via high yields under certain water application conditions is a possible reason in addition transpiration accounted for 80 90 of the total water consumption and higher planting density formed a greater lai and canopy size of the cotton population which can reduce soil water evaporation meng et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 moreover increasing the mia promoted light transmittance in the upper canopy causing relatively high temperature reddy et al 1995 conaty et al 2015 xu et al 2016 and light mayoral et al 2015 conditions in the upper and middle canopies these conditions decreased stomatal opening and the transpiration rate leading to increased wue however studies gao et al 2007 chen et al 2010 antonietta et al 2014 have also reported that water consumption increases as plant density increases moreover limited irrigation during the early growth stage counteracts the formation of photosynthates in the cotton population reducing wue possible reasons are that small individual cotton plants exhibited low water consumption rates and the higher planting density decreased soil evaporation moreover cotton exhibited high stress tolerance to the limited irrigation which had less adverse effects on the growth of the cotton population thus increasing the lai and the light distribution and absorption in middle and upper canopies is one way to achieve high iwue in cotton production 5 conclusion in conclusion to cope with large amounts of annual radiation and limited active accumulated temperature and water availability limited irrigation with high plant density should be used to achieve an optimum yield and irrigation water use efficiency no adverse effects on fiber quality were observed across different treatments increases in lint yield and irrigation water use efficiency in cotton are generally caused by increases in leaf area index light interception and absorption in the top and middle canopies these results indicate that cotton can be irrigated with the drip irrigation method at a 425 mm level and a plant density of 36 plants m 2 without reducing lint yield in regions where water and active accumulated temperature are limited acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the research fund for the national natural science

11051,water deficit stress is a common environmental factor affecting growth and yield of crops but comparative studies on quantitative and qualitative characteristics among oilseed crops do not exist in the literature a three year field experiment was conducted in a calcareous soil of east azerbaijan iran to determine the impact of water deficit stress on a number of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of sunflower helianthus annuus l safflower carthamus tinctorius l and sesame sesamum indicum l four levels of irrigation i e 40 60 80 and 100 of potential evapotranspiration pet were applied during the growing season low water availability significantly decreased seed yield in all oilseed crops followed by a significant increase in malondialdehyde mda and proline pro content averaged over irrigation water availability levels sunflower showed the greatest reduction in seed yield by 16 3 followed by sesame 12 8 and safflower 9 4 the seed yield reduction in all crops was mainly due to a reduction in seed weight and a reduction in seed number in capitula or capsules averaged over irrigation water availability levels sunflower showed the greatest reduction in oil yield by 22 5 followed by sesame 13 3 and safflower 10 2 mild lack of irrigation water availability 80 of pet neither affected negatively nor improved oil percentage particularly in safflower and sesame severe lack of irrigation water availability 40 of pet significantly reduced oil percentage particularly in sunflower a significant reduction in oleic acid oa linoleic acid la linolenic acid lna and palmitic acid pa content due to low availability of irrigation water was observed in all crops apart from breeding efforts for improving crop resistance to drought management practices should be considered to reduce drought related issues in major oilseed crops keywords fatty acids malondialdehyde oil yield proline seed yield water deficit 1 introduction water stress is one of the most significant factors influencing plant growth and yield micheletto et al 2007 the stress from water shortage activates several responses in plants at physiological biochemical and molecular level resulting in alteration of plant metabolic pathways koocheki et al 2016 thus it may lead to physiological disorders such as a reduction in photosynthesis and transpiration sarker et al 2005 petropoulos et al 2008 changes in the chlorophyll content and damage in the photosynthetic apparatus nayyar and gupta 2006 and inhibition of photochemical and enzyme activities monakhova and chernyadev 2002 moreover water deficit stress induces production of reactive oxygen species ros choudhury et al 2017 optimal irrigation management which is determined based on water requirements of crops is essential to improve crop yield and economic income koocheki et al 2014 nevertheless limitation in available water is one of the most important factors threatening crop production in arid and semi arid regions sayari et al 2013 rezaei chiyaneh et al 2018 water deficit during critical growth periods reduces yield and quality of crops but crops differ in their response to water stress at a given growth stage el bially et al 2018 hence if a crop can continue to perform well under water shortage conditions it can play an effective role in sustainable production systems oilseed crops are the second source of food after cereals with a large expansion worldwide due to high demand for vegetable edible oil with important functions regarding nutritional physiology and human health vegetable oils are essential components of human diet çamaş et al 2007 the fatty acids of vegetable oils play an important role in cell division and growth as well as in cellular metabolism as a way to store energy and provide energy when needed kumar et al 2016 in particular consumers demand healthy oils naturally low in saturated fat such as olive safflower canola sunflower and sesame oils the quality of oils is connected with their composition in fatty acids especially with percentages in oleic omega 9 linoleic omega 6 and linolenic omega 3 acids jalilian et al 2012 sunflower helianthus annuus l is an important oilseed crop of the family asteraceae originated in north america blackman et al 2011 the oil content of sunflower seed may range from 35 to 50 and consists mainly of unsaturated fatty acids that render it a desirable option for human consumption tahmasebpour et al 2011 water is essential at every stage of sunflower growth and development but the productivity of this crop is highly dependent upon water at flowering and seed filling stages nevertheless water shortage during all stages of growth is a major limiting factor for seed formation and can largely influence the composition of sunflower oil flagella et al 2002 petcu et al 2001 showed that grain yield of sunflower was reduced by water deficit stress whereas concerning fatty acids a significant reduction in oleic acid was reported similarly iqbal et al 2005 reported a negative trend in yield and yield components due to water stress treatments in a study from a semi arid region of wyoming usa it was found that irrigation of confection sunflower on heavy soils could be terminated as early as at r5 5 stage i e beginning of flowering with 50 of head area in flowering without a significant yield reduction joshi et al 2017 safflower carthamus tinctorius l whose origin is largely unknown chapman and burke 2007 is a major oilseed crop that yields 32 40 seed oil soliman et al 2011 safflower oil is utilized in many industries for edible and dying purposes safflower is a moderately tolerant crop to water stress as it is a tap rooted crop that can tolerate environmental stresses including water stress this response can be explained by the deep root system of the crop which allows water extraction from deeper soil layers to satisfy its water requirements wasson et al 2012 in this case even a small amount of water can alleviate the effects of drought stress at critical growth stages of the crop and thus allow adequate yield wasson et al 2012 in spring safflower water stress during flowering and seed filling was detrimental on yield yau 2007 koutroubas et al 2009 similarly drought conditions at heading stage decreased chlorophyll content in the foliage together with seed and oil yield kafi and rostami 2008 moreover a reduction in the rate of photosynthesis and transpiration of safflower plants were found under water stress leading to reduced plant height and biomass which in turn reduced seed yield singh et al 2016 sesame sesamum indicum l the oldest oilseed crop that was domesticated in india venkataramana bhat et al 1999 is a drought tolerant plant in part due to an extensive root system though sensitive to drought at germination and seedling stages bahrami et al 2012 this crop is usually cultivated in arid and semi arid regions of the world for its quality of edible oil eskandari et al 2009 sesame has one of the highest oil content in seed often exceeding 50 sesame tolerance to drought is of major importance because this crop is cultivated without irrigation and often faces mild or severe water stress golestani and pakniyat 2007 therefore its yield and oil quality may be reduced under drought stress despite relative tolerance to drought stress water limitation reduced growth grain yield and yield components of sesame mensah et al 2006 golestani and pakniyat 2007 however highly significant differences for grain yield were observed among genotypes under both normal and limited irrigation conditions gharib eshghi et al 2016 indicating the existence of considerable genetic variation among genotypes and thus the possibility of identifying drought tolerant genotypes within sesame germplasm many plants accumulate organic osmolytes as a result of environmental stresses that cause cellular dehydration it has often been proposed that osmolytes might be valuable storage compounds for reducing power and a source of carbon and or nitrogen upon relief from stress hare et al 1998 proline an amino acid plays a major role in plant osmoregulation and exhibits a highly beneficial effect on plants exposed to various stress conditions acting as a metal chelator an antioxidative defense molecule and a signaling molecule besides being an excellent osmolyte yamada et al 2005 hayat et al 2012 about one third of the world s land is classified as arid land fao 1989 and therefore irrigation plays a vital role in growth and yield of crops in those regions while water deficit stress is a common environmental factor affecting growth and yield of crops comparative studies among oilseed crops do not exist in the literature also there is no clear answer to the question to what extent sunflower safflower and sesame are able to produce acceptable yield under water shortage conditions hence the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of low availability of irrigation water on yield and yield components oil percentage fatty acid composition and stress indicators in sunflower safflower and sesame the research question of this study was set as does low availability of irrigation water affect yield and oil quality of sunflower safflower and sesame and if so to what extent 2 materials and methods 2 1

water deficit stress is a common environmental factor affecting growth and yield of crops but comparative studies among oilseed crops do not exist in the literature this study determined the impact of water deficit stress on a number of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of sunflower safflower and sesame in the current study sunflower showed the greatest reduction in seed yield 16 3 averaged over water availability levels followed by sesame 12 8 and safflower 9 4 the seed yield reduction in all crops was mainly due to a reduction in seed weight and a reduction in seed number in capitula or capsules similarly lack of irrigation water reduced oil yield in all crops sunflower showed the greatest reduction in oil yield by 22 5 averaged over water availability levels followed by sesame 13 3 and safflower 10 2 sunflower is regarded as a less or moderately sensitive crop to drought and both quantity and distribution of water affect achene and oil yield in this crop fereres et al 1986 reddy et al 2003 iqbal et al 2005 drought stress can affect every developmental stage of sunflower but drought during the reproductive stage causes the maximum yield reduction reddy et al 2003 with reference to safflower previous studies showed decreased seed and oil yields in arid and semi arid regions under drought stress during seed filling stage eslam et al 2010 bagheri and sam daliri 2011 despite its relative tolerance to drought stress previous research studies showed that water limitation reduced growth grain yield and yield components of sesame mensah et al 2006 golestani and pakniyat 2007 however highly significant differences for grain were observed among the genotypes under both normal and limited irrigation conditions gharib eshghi et al 2016 indicating the existence of considerable genetic variation among genotypes and thus the possibility of identifying drought tolerant genotypes within sesame germplasm lower oil yield under conditions of low availability of irrigation water than under normal irrigation were previously observed in canola cultivars rashidi et al 2012 the oil yield represents the economic yield of the crop and is connected with seed production and oil content percentage of the seeds yeilaghi et al 2012 in addition rashidi et al 2012 reported that the reason of seed yield reduction in canola cultivars could be due to the level of stress studied and its effect on some yield components such as flower per plant seeds number and seed weight since seed yield in sunflower safflower and sesame is a cumulative effect of various yield components like flower number seeds number per capitulum or capsule and seed weight any change in these components will affect final seed yield furthermore decreasing seed yield under irrigation deficit could be the result of a reduction in chlorophyll content and photosynthesis during vegetative growth a decrease of water content in the plant shrinks cells and relaxes cell walls resulting in lower turgor pressure and lower concentration of solutes in the cells which hinders cell expansion hassan and ali 2014 mild lack of irrigation water 80 of pet did not affect significantly or slightly improved oil percentage particularly in safflower and sesame however severe lack of irrigation water 40 of pet significantly reduced oil percentage particularly in sunflower it seems that under mild lack of irrigation the plant can induce a specific defense mechanism through fatty acid synthesis as osmotic regulation metabolites recent research also found that mild drought i e irrigation at 70 of field capacity enhanced the oil productivity of german chamomile matricaria recutita while severe drought irrigation at 55 of field capacity decreased growth photosynthesis rate and essential oil yield of this plant farhoudi et al 2014 a similar trend was also found in black cumin nigella sativa rezaei chiyaneh et al 2018 by contrast the fatty acid induction signals may be disrupted due to impaired cellular metabolism under severe stress the reduction in oil percentage observed in this study with moderate lack of irrigation water is in line with previous studies under lack of water availability conditions for instance the decrease in oil content in different oil crops such as safflower due to water deficiency has also been reported by other researchers kar et al 2007 according to zahedi et al 2009 the decrease in oil percentage by water deficit in canola was most likely the result of reduced photosynthesis and poor remobilization of assimilates there was a significant reduction in oa la lna and pa content due to lack of water availability in all crops lna and pa acid showed the maximum reduction due to water deficit i e by 23 3 and 28 5 in sunflower 29 8 and 25 5 in safflower and 24 7 and 22 6 in sesame respectively as reported in previous research total lipid content within all lipidic classes increased with moderate lack of irrigation water but a sharp decrease in the total lipid content was observed with moderate water stress hamrouni et al 2001 the ratio of fatty acids in seed oils depends largely upon environmental conditions during seed maturation particularly moisture and temperature gecgel et al 2007 therefore oa la lna and pa content which affect the quality of oil was reduced due to lack of irrigation water as previously reported for safflower carvalho et al 2006 sabzalian et al 2008 samanci and özkaynak 2003 reported that changes in oa and la in safflower were due to seasonal weather differences particularly moisture and temperature moreover ensiye and khorshid 2010 reported reduced values of oa and la contents in safflower due to drought stress similarly the change in oa and la contents due to lack of water availability could be different when stress occurs at different growth stages ali et al 2009 a possible reason for the variability in fatty acid content may be the water deficit stress soon after the initiation of flowering monotti 2003 considering pro accumulation as a widespread response to stress pro content increased in all three oilseed crops pro accumulation in plants is commonly reported in response to drought stress probably as a part of some stress tolerance mechanisms verbruggen and hermans 2008 in fact pro can act as an osmo protector of cellular structures and cytosolic enzymes abbaspoura et al 2012 moreover the amount of mda in plants a decomposition product of polyunsaturated fatty acids increased in this study with increasing water deficit according to our results the increase in the concentration of mda under low availability of irrigation water was a critical factor for alleviating damage by oxidative stress solute accumulation to maintain turgor and other physiological activities through osmotic adjustment was reported in safflower under water stress singh et al 2016 5 conclusions the present study investigated the effect of lack of irrigation water on yield and oil quality of sunflower safflower and sesame lack of irrigation water significantly decreased seed yield in all oil crops followed by a significant increase in mda and pro sunflower showed the greatest reduction in seed yield by 16 3 averaged over water availability levels followed by sesame 12 8 and safflower 9 4 moreover sunflower showed the greatest reduction in oil yield by 22 5 averaged over water availability levels followed by sesame 13 3 and safflower 10 2 thus it could be stated that under such conditions sunflower production is not recommended as its seed and oil yield are more sensitive to water shortage there was a significant reduction in oleic acid oa linoleic acid la linolenic acid lna and palmitic acid pa content due to lack of water availability in all crops in sum proper water management practices that prevent negative effects on yield should be implemented to minimize the problem of drought this important goal could be based on the proper selection of oilseed crops for cultivation 
11051,water deficit stress is a common environmental factor affecting growth and yield of crops but comparative studies on quantitative and qualitative characteristics among oilseed crops do not exist in the literature a three year field experiment was conducted in a calcareous soil of east azerbaijan iran to determine the impact of water deficit stress on a number of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of sunflower helianthus annuus l safflower carthamus tinctorius l and sesame sesamum indicum l four levels of irrigation i e 40 60 80 and 100 of potential evapotranspiration pet were applied during the growing season low water availability significantly decreased seed yield in all oilseed crops followed by a significant increase in malondialdehyde mda and proline pro content averaged over irrigation water availability levels sunflower showed the greatest reduction in seed yield by 16 3 followed by sesame 12 8 and safflower 9 4 the seed yield reduction in all crops was mainly due to a reduction in seed weight and a reduction in seed number in capitula or capsules averaged over irrigation water availability levels sunflower showed the greatest reduction in oil yield by 22 5 followed by sesame 13 3 and safflower 10 2 mild lack of irrigation water availability 80 of pet neither affected negatively nor improved oil percentage particularly in safflower and sesame severe lack of irrigation water availability 40 of pet significantly reduced oil percentage particularly in sunflower a significant reduction in oleic acid oa linoleic acid la linolenic acid lna and palmitic acid pa content due to low availability of irrigation water was observed in all crops apart from breeding efforts for improving crop resistance to drought management practices should be considered to reduce drought related issues in major oilseed crops keywords fatty acids malondialdehyde oil yield proline seed yield water deficit 1 introduction water stress is one of the most significant factors influencing plant growth and yield micheletto et al 2007 the stress from water shortage activates several responses in plants at physiological biochemical and molecular level resulting in alteration of plant metabolic pathways koocheki et al 2016 thus it may lead to physiological disorders such as a reduction in photosynthesis and transpiration sarker et al 2005 petropoulos et al 2008 changes in the chlorophyll content and damage in the photosynthetic apparatus nayyar and gupta 2006 and inhibition of photochemical and enzyme activities monakhova and chernyadev 2002 moreover water deficit stress induces production of reactive oxygen species ros choudhury et al 2017 optimal irrigation management which is determined based on water requirements of crops is essential to improve crop yield and economic income koocheki et al 2014 nevertheless limitation in available water is one of the most important factors threatening crop production in arid and semi arid regions sayari et al 2013 rezaei chiyaneh et al 2018 water deficit during critical growth periods reduces yield and quality of crops but crops differ in their response to water stress at a given growth stage el bially et al 2018 hence if a crop can continue to perform well under water shortage conditions it can play an effective role in sustainable production systems oilseed crops are the second source of food after cereals with a large expansion worldwide due to high demand for vegetable edible oil with important functions regarding nutritional physiology and human health vegetable oils are essential components of human diet çamaş et al 2007 the fatty acids of vegetable oils play an important role in cell division and growth as well as in cellular metabolism as a way to store energy and provide energy when needed kumar et al 2016 in particular consumers demand healthy oils naturally low in saturated fat such as olive safflower canola sunflower and sesame oils the quality of oils is connected with their composition in fatty acids especially with percentages in oleic omega 9 linoleic omega 6 and linolenic omega 3 acids jalilian et al 2012 sunflower helianthus annuus l is an important oilseed crop of the family asteraceae originated in north america blackman et al 2011 the oil content of sunflower seed may range from 35 to 50 and consists mainly of unsaturated fatty acids that render it a desirable option for human consumption tahmasebpour et al 2011 water is essential at every stage of sunflower growth and development but the productivity of this crop is highly dependent upon water at flowering and seed filling stages nevertheless water shortage during all stages of growth is a major limiting factor for seed formation and can largely influence the composition of sunflower oil flagella et al 2002 petcu et al 2001 showed that grain yield of sunflower was reduced by water deficit stress whereas concerning fatty acids a significant reduction in oleic acid was reported similarly iqbal et al 2005 reported a negative trend in yield and yield components due to water stress treatments in a study from a semi arid region of wyoming usa it was found that irrigation of confection sunflower on heavy soils could be terminated as early as at r5 5 stage i e beginning of flowering with 50 of head area in flowering without a significant yield reduction joshi et al 2017 safflower carthamus tinctorius l whose origin is largely unknown chapman and burke 2007 is a major oilseed crop that yields 32 40 seed oil soliman et al 2011 safflower oil is utilized in many industries for edible and dying purposes safflower is a moderately tolerant crop to water stress as it is a tap rooted crop that can tolerate environmental stresses including water stress this response can be explained by the deep root system of the crop which allows water extraction from deeper soil layers to satisfy its water requirements wasson et al 2012 in this case even a small amount of water can alleviate the effects of drought stress at critical growth stages of the crop and thus allow adequate yield wasson et al 2012 in spring safflower water stress during flowering and seed filling was detrimental on yield yau 2007 koutroubas et al 2009 similarly drought conditions at heading stage decreased chlorophyll content in the foliage together with seed and oil yield kafi and rostami 2008 moreover a reduction in the rate of photosynthesis and transpiration of safflower plants were found under water stress leading to reduced plant height and biomass which in turn reduced seed yield singh et al 2016 sesame sesamum indicum l the oldest oilseed crop that was domesticated in india venkataramana bhat et al 1999 is a drought tolerant plant in part due to an extensive root system though sensitive to drought at germination and seedling stages bahrami et al 2012 this crop is usually cultivated in arid and semi arid regions of the world for its quality of edible oil eskandari et al 2009 sesame has one of the highest oil content in seed often exceeding 50 sesame tolerance to drought is of major importance because this crop is cultivated without irrigation and often faces mild or severe water stress golestani and pakniyat 2007 therefore its yield and oil quality may be reduced under drought stress despite relative tolerance to drought stress water limitation reduced growth grain yield and yield components of sesame mensah et al 2006 golestani and pakniyat 2007 however highly significant differences for grain yield were observed among genotypes under both normal and limited irrigation conditions gharib eshghi et al 2016 indicating the existence of considerable genetic variation among genotypes and thus the possibility of identifying drought tolerant genotypes within sesame germplasm many plants accumulate organic osmolytes as a result of environmental stresses that cause cellular dehydration it has often been proposed that osmolytes might be valuable storage compounds for reducing power and a source of carbon and or nitrogen upon relief from stress hare et al 1998 proline an amino acid plays a major role in plant osmoregulation and exhibits a highly beneficial effect on plants exposed to various stress conditions acting as a metal chelator an antioxidative defense molecule and a signaling molecule besides being an excellent osmolyte yamada et al 2005 hayat et al 2012 about one third of the world s land is classified as arid land fao 1989 and therefore irrigation plays a vital role in growth and yield of crops in those regions while water deficit stress is a common environmental factor affecting growth and yield of crops comparative studies among oilseed crops do not exist in the literature also there is no clear answer to the question to what extent sunflower safflower and sesame are able to produce acceptable yield under water shortage conditions hence the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of low availability of irrigation water on yield and yield components oil percentage fatty acid composition and stress indicators in sunflower safflower and sesame the research question of this study was set as does low availability of irrigation water affect yield and oil quality of sunflower safflower and sesame and if so to what extent 2 materials and methods 2 1

sesame plants table 2 the highest and lowest sesame yield and yield components were obtained with irrigation at 100 and 40 of pet respectively table 2 a reduction in sesame oil yield was noted due to reduced irrigation amounts 60 and 40 of pet however oil percentage was improved by mild lack of irrigation water 80 of pet table 2 and was not affected significantly by irrigation equal to 60 of pet in 2014 fig 9 la lna and pa percentage significantly decreased under moderate 60 of pet and severe lack of irrigation water 40 of pet fig 10 however oa was not affected by mild lack of irrigation water 80 of pet in 2016 fig 11 the pro and mda content gradually increased with decreasing irrigation amount and reached their maximum values with irrigation equal to 40 of pet fig 12 4 discussion water deficit stress is a common environmental factor affecting growth and yield of crops but comparative studies among oilseed crops do not exist in the literature this study determined the impact of water deficit stress on a number of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of sunflower safflower and sesame in the current study sunflower showed the greatest reduction in seed yield 16 3 averaged over water availability levels followed by sesame 12 8 and safflower 9 4 the seed yield reduction in all crops was mainly due to a reduction in seed weight and a reduction in seed number in capitula or capsules similarly lack of irrigation water reduced oil yield in all crops sunflower showed the greatest reduction in oil yield by 22 5 averaged over water availability levels followed by sesame 13 3 and safflower 10 2 sunflower is regarded as a less or moderately sensitive crop to drought and both quantity and distribution of water affect achene and oil yield in this crop fereres et al 1986 reddy et al 2003 iqbal et al 2005 drought stress can affect every developmental stage of sunflower but drought during the reproductive stage causes the maximum yield reduction reddy et al 2003 with reference to safflower previous studies showed decreased seed and oil yields in arid and semi arid regions under drought stress during seed filling stage eslam et al 2010 bagheri and sam daliri 2011 despite its relative tolerance to drought stress previous research studies showed that water limitation reduced growth grain yield and yield components of sesame mensah et al 2006 golestani and pakniyat 2007 however highly significant differences for grain were observed among the genotypes under both normal and limited irrigation conditions gharib eshghi et al 2016 indicating the existence of considerable genetic variation among genotypes and thus the possibility of identifying drought tolerant genotypes within sesame germplasm lower oil yield under conditions of low availability of irrigation water than under normal irrigation were previously observed in canola cultivars rashidi et al 2012 the oil yield represents the economic yield of the crop and is connected with seed production and oil content percentage of the seeds yeilaghi et al 2012 in addition rashidi et al 2012 reported that the reason of seed yield reduction in canola cultivars could be due to the level of stress studied and its effect on some yield components such as flower per plant seeds number and seed weight since seed yield in sunflower safflower and sesame is a cumulative effect of various yield components like flower number seeds number per capitulum or capsule and seed weight any change in these components will affect final seed yield furthermore decreasing seed yield under irrigation deficit could be the result of a reduction in chlorophyll content and photosynthesis during vegetative growth a decrease of water content in the plant shrinks cells and relaxes cell walls resulting in lower turgor pressure and lower concentration of solutes in the cells which hinders cell expansion hassan and ali 2014 mild lack of irrigation water 80 of pet did not affect significantly or slightly improved oil percentage particularly in safflower and sesame however severe lack of irrigation water 40 of pet significantly reduced oil percentage particularly in sunflower it seems that under mild lack of irrigation the plant can induce a specific defense mechanism through fatty acid synthesis as osmotic regulation metabolites recent research also found that mild drought i e irrigation at 70 of field capacity enhanced the oil productivity of german chamomile matricaria recutita while severe drought irrigation at 55 of field capacity decreased growth photosynthesis rate and essential oil yield of this plant farhoudi et al 2014 a similar trend was also found in black cumin nigella sativa rezaei chiyaneh et al 2018 by contrast the fatty acid induction signals may be disrupted due to impaired cellular metabolism under severe stress the reduction in oil percentage observed in this study with moderate lack of irrigation water is in line with previous studies under lack of water availability conditions for instance the decrease in oil content in different oil crops such as safflower due to water deficiency has also been reported by other researchers kar et al 2007 according to zahedi et al 2009 the decrease in oil percentage by water deficit in canola was most likely the result of reduced photosynthesis and poor remobilization of assimilates there was a significant reduction in oa la lna and pa content due to lack of water availability in all crops lna and pa acid showed the maximum reduction due to water deficit i e by 23 3 and 28 5 in sunflower 29 8 and 25 5 in safflower and 24 7 and 22 6 in sesame respectively as reported in previous research total lipid content within all lipidic classes increased with moderate lack of irrigation water but a sharp decrease in the total lipid content was observed with moderate water stress hamrouni et al 2001 the ratio of fatty acids in seed oils depends largely upon environmental conditions during seed maturation particularly moisture and temperature gecgel et al 2007 therefore oa la lna and pa content which affect the quality of oil was reduced due to lack of irrigation water as previously reported for safflower carvalho et al 2006 sabzalian et al 2008 samanci and özkaynak 2003 reported that changes in oa and la in safflower were due to seasonal weather differences particularly moisture and temperature moreover ensiye and khorshid 2010 reported reduced values of oa and la contents in safflower due to drought stress similarly the change in oa and la contents due to lack of water availability could be different when stress occurs at different growth stages ali et al 2009 a possible reason for the variability in fatty acid content may be the water deficit stress soon after the initiation of flowering monotti 2003 considering pro accumulation as a widespread response to stress pro content increased in all three oilseed crops pro accumulation in plants is commonly reported in response to drought stress probably as a part of some stress tolerance mechanisms verbruggen and hermans 2008 in fact pro can act as an osmo protector of cellular structures and cytosolic enzymes abbaspoura et al 2012 moreover the amount of mda in plants a decomposition product of polyunsaturated fatty acids increased in this study with increasing water deficit according to our results the increase in the concentration of mda under low availability of irrigation water was a critical factor for alleviating damage by oxidative stress solute accumulation to maintain turgor and other physiological activities through osmotic adjustment was reported in safflower under water stress singh et al 2016 5 conclusions the present study investigated the effect of lack of irrigation water on yield and oil quality of sunflower safflower and sesame lack of irrigation water significantly decreased seed yield in all oil crops followed by a significant increase in mda and pro sunflower showed the greatest reduction in seed yield by 16 3 averaged over water availability levels followed by sesame 12 8 and safflower 9 4 moreover sunflower showed the greatest reduction in oil yield by 22 5 averaged over water availability levels followed by sesame 13 3 and safflower 10 2 thus it could be stated that under such conditions sunflower production is not recommended as its seed and oil yield are more sensitive to water shortage there was a significant reduction in oleic acid oa linoleic acid la linolenic acid lna and palmitic acid pa content due to lack of water availability in all crops in sum proper water management practices that prevent negative effects on yield should be implemented to minimize the problem of drought this important goal could be based on the proper selection of oilseed crops for cultivation

food demand of the growing population martínez et al 2017 the agricultural industry must therefore maximize the use of available resources in order to cope with the present trajectory of population

schrijver 2016 abdullahi et al 2015 sensors commonly used in precision irrigation systems such as drip irrigation reduce crop water use but provide only point estimates when digital techniques such as uas are utilized in precision agriculture the spatial and temporal variability of the crop conditions are accounted for in greater detail than commonly used sensor technologies precision agriculture generally aims to increase the quality and quantity of agricultural output while using less input e g water pesticides fertilizer energy herbicides etc agricultural water use is one of the main factors behind increasing water scarcity with irrigated agriculture accounting for about 70 of the freshwater withdrawals in the world tshwene and oladele 2016 with water being a significant limiting factor in agricultural management this high agricultural water use can be better managed using the crop water productivity concept cwp also referred to as water use efficiency can be defined as the relationship between crop output and the amount of water used in crop production it is mathematically expressed as the quantity of yield kg hectare per unit amount of water mm day consumed i e crop evapotranspiration jin et al 2016 araya et al 2018 kukal and irmak 2017 brauman et al 2013 dogaru 2016 humphreys et al 2006 nhamo et al 2016 wichelns 2014 cwp is an indicator that quantifies the effect of agricultural water management sakthivadivel et al 1999 sun et al 2017 the use of cwp helps to meet the rising demand of water by irrigation amidst other sectors and also provide food for the growing population according to igbadun et al 2006 there are many expressions and definitions for quantifying cwp such as water use technical efficiency which is defined as quantity of agricultural output per unit amount of water used in the production water use economic efficiency which is the value of the output produced per quantity of water consumed and water use hydraulic efficiency which is defined as the ratio of water consumed by irrigated agriculture to the volume of water supplied these three cwp definitions are centred on minimizing water input while maximizing the crop yield output deficit irrigation techniques have been found to improve cwp by more than 200 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 hirich et al 2014 adeboye et al 2015 if irrigation is timeously managed however deficit irrigation must be carefully managed as igbadun et al 2006 described an attempt to maximize cwp by withholding irrigation in multiple crop growth stages which resulted in significant reduction in crop yield zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 however found that plants are more efficient with water when they are stressed and agricultural production can be sustained with 20 40 less water resources as long as new water management techniques are adopted the agricultural sector is currently under pressure to produce high quantity of food while using less water per unit of output thereby increasing cwp tshwene and oladele 2016 this is achieved by either producing the same quantity of crop with less water resources or a higher quantity of crop with the same quantity of water resources zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 either way cwp is generally derived from the relationship between the water consumption and yield of a particular crop both of which are highly variable in space and time kukal and irmak 2017 cwp can exhibit high spatial and temporal variability due to climatic and agricultural factors mdemu et al 2009 among the climatic factors cwp is more sensitive to wind speed and relative humidity compared to sunshine hours while for agricultural factors it is more sensitive to irrigation efficiency than the quantity of fertilizer used sun et al 2017 therefore to improve cwp emphasis should focus on the climatic factors and on irrigation efficiency existing techniques for improving cwp such as partial root zone drying barrios masias and jackson 2016 optimized regulated deficit irrigation léllis et al 2017 gendron et al 2018 adeboye et al 2015 etc do not currently account for the integrated effects of climatic and irrigation efficiency factors as well as spatial variability of cwp unmanned aerial systems uas technology offers high spatial resolution and rapid collection of data over large areas potentially enabling farmers to increase the precision of irrigation both spatially and temporally therefore the aim of this study is to give a general overview of the current and potential capabilities of uas to improve crop water productivity under precision agriculture 2 uas in precision agriculture uas are platforms for remote sensing rs used in precision agriculture and examples of their use are found in hunt et al 2018 adão et al 2017 bendig et al 2012 santesteban et al 2017 poblete et al 2017 muchiri and kimathi 2016 abdullahi et al 2015 simelli and apostolos 2015 whitehead et al 2014 whitehead and hugenholtz 2014 manfreda et al 2018 these platforms are evolving rapidly technically and with regard to regulations ballesteros et al 2014 uass recently have become a common remote sensing technology comprising aerial platforms suitable for carrying small and lightweight sensors there are different classes of uas for instance according to whitehead and hugenholtz 2014 in united states it ranges from micro 0 9 kg mini 0 9 13 6 kg tactical 13 6 454 5 kg medium altitude long endurance 454 5 13 636 4 kg and high altitude long endurance 13 636 4 kg they noted that commercial and remote sensing applications prefer uas weighing less than 5 kg because of cost advantages and reduced risk associated with blunt force impact mini uas weighing less than 5 kg can carry 0 2 kg to 1 5 kg of sensor payload bendig et al 2012 according to gago et al 2015 four component tasks to be considered before selecting the appropriate uas for precision agriculture are design of experiment data acquisition data processing and results for agricultural management fixed wing airplanes and unmanned helicopters uass are mainly used these two aerial platforms have some limitations and advantages to mention a few limitations and advantages unmanned helicopters are able to travel in any direction while fixed wing airplanes travel in a more linear and restricted fashion fixed wing aircrafts have simple flight systems and can fly for longer duration compared to unmanned helicopters unmanned helicopters have more complex flight systems and can offer lower flight altitudes with low speed fixed wing aircrafts therefore have capacity to cover wider areas but their flight altitude is higher which reduces the image resolution also fixed wing uas aerial platforms require specific runways or at least sufficient open space for landing and take off because of these limitations recently a new aircraft platform emerged multi copter multi rotor which does not require special take off or landing runway the multi copter is more user friendly which makes it possible to be operated by farmers in order to obtain real time data and apply adapted water management generally the type of uas required depends on the aim of the study as well as the quality of the desired output result in addition to uas aerial platforms the camera sensors are key to the quality of images produced selection of camera type also depends on the aim of the project the most commonly used uas cameras in agriculture include thermal multispectral hyperspectral and red green blue rgb gago et al 2015 recommended different camera types depending on the type of crop trait status of interest for biotic and abiotic stress thermal and hyperspectral cameras are recommended while multispectral and red green blue rgb cameras are recommended for growth biomass assessment rgb cameras are one of the traditional imaging systems used in agroforestry applications however they lack the precision and spectral range to profile materials that hyperspectral and multispectral cameras can provide adão et al 2017 3 commonly used uas imaging cameras for water status 3 1 hyperspectral hyperspectral imaging techniques measure the reflectance from the vegetation canopy the recorded reflectance cannot be applied directly as a metric of leaf water content therefore reflectance indices are used indices for hyperspectral data include simple ratio index sri normalized difference e g photochemical reflectance index pri etc elvanidi et al 2018 pôças et al 2017 rapaport et al 2015 hyperspectral technology integrates spectroscopy with the benefits of digital imagery loggenberg et al 2018 the capability of hyperspectral imaging ranging from 400 to 2500 nm in assessing the water deficiency in tomato plants was demonstrated by susič et al 2018 zarco tejada et al 2012 demonstrated the ability of uav based hyperspectral and thermal cameras to assess water stress levels in a citrus crop and confirmed that there is link between pri and canopy temperature recently loggenberg et al 2018 combined hyperspectral rs technologies with machine learning to discriminate between stressed and non stressed grape vines from hyperspectral imaging the results obtained showed that machine ensemble learners effectively analysed the hyperspectral data generally hyperspectral imaging cameras capture more detailed data in both spatial and spectral ranges compared to other cameras it can measure hundreds of bands which raises complexity when considering the quantity of data acquired loggenberg et al 2018 noted that the major limiting factor in applying hyperspectral data is the inherent curse of dimensionality which results in reduced classification accuracies in addition hyperspectral cameras are very expensive and complex elvanidi et al 2018 which limit their wide spread application especially in commercial agriculture 3 2 multispectral multispectral imaging techniques are based on the theory that each surface reflects part of the light received therefore multispectral cameras measure reflectance and light absorption from the vegetation canopy matese and di gennaro 2018 vegetation reflectance characteristics are used to derive vegetation indices vis healthy vegetation absorbs all the red light and reflects back much of the near infrared light while stressed vegetation reflects more red light and less near infrared light multispectral vis used for detecting water status include structural indices e g normalized difference vegetation index ndvi renormalized difference vegetation index rdvi optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi sri etc xanthophyll indices e g photochemical reflectance index pri570 pri515 chlorophyll indices e g transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index tcari tcari osavi etc blue green red ratio indices e g green index gi red green ratio index rgri etc baluja et al 2012 rallo et al 2014 zarco tejada et al 2013 2012 a new index prinorm was proposed by zarco tejada et al 2013 in which pri index is normalized to be sensitive to canopy structure and chlorophyll content prinorm performed better than standard pri index when tested against leaf water potential and stomatal conductance the ndvi which is the index of plant greenness is popularly used among other vis matese and di gennaro 2018 zhao et al 2017 it is expressed as the normalized difference between the red and nir near infrared bands hence it manages the differences in illumination within an image due to aspect and slope as well as differences due to time images were obtained baluja et al 2012 used different spectral indices to assess water status of a vineyard and noted that ndvi and tcari osavi gave the highest coefficient of determination with stem water potential ѱstem and leaf stomatal conductance gs therefore the two indices reflect the cumulative water deficit hence long term response to water status unlike thermal that gives short term response zhao et al 2017 established a relationship between canopy ndvi and ѱstem at different growing stages multispectral rs imaging technology uses bands such as green 500 600 nm spectral band red 600 700 nm spectral band red edge 700 730 nm and nir 700 nm to 1 3 μm wavebands to capture visible and invisible images of vegetation according to poblete et al 2017 plant water status is not accurately predicted with multispectral indices between 500 800 nm spectral band because of their non sensitivity to water content however wavelengths greater than 800 nm may be better rallo et al 2014 noted that satisfactory estimation of leaf water potentials at leaf canopy levels can be derived using vis based on the nir shortwave infrared domain with specific optimization of the centre bands recently some researchers have developed artificial neural network ann models derived from multispectral images to forecast spatial variability of ѱstem of crops romero et al 2018 classified the water status level of the grapevine based on ten vegetation indices using red green red edge and nir wavebands and found that there were no significant relationships between vis individually and ѱstem however with lower correlation values of less than 0 3 for almost all the indices studied they went further to develop an ann model model 1 using all vis calculated as inputs and compared the output with actual measured ѱstem and got higher correlation values similarly poblete et al 2017 compared ann model outputs with ground truth measurements of ѱstem and found the best performance of the model was with simulations that included the spectral bands of 550 570 670 700 and 800 nm 3 3 thermal imaging thermal rs measures the radiation emitted from an object s surface and converts it into temperature khanal et al 2017 the theory behind thermal rs is that all objects on the earth s surface with a temperature above 273 c emit radiation and the quantity of radiation is a function of the emissivity of the surface temperature khanal et al 2017 crop canopy surface temperature in general is a function of transpiration rate available soil water status and atmospheric evaporative demand khanal et al 2017 therefore thermal rs determines the crop canopy surface temperature as a way of quantifying crop water stress which is useful in irrigation scheduling additionally thermal rs can also quantify soil moisture and evapotranspiration status many studies have used thermal rs to assess crop water stress for several crop species including citrus orchards zarco tejada et al 2012 pinto beans zhou et al 2018 sugar beet plants quebrajo et al 2018 almond trees garcía tejero et al 2018a 2018b and grapevines bellvert et al 2014 bellvert et al 2016 espinoza et al 2017 matese et al 2018 garcía tejero et al 2016 notwithstanding that thermal rs is capable of providing temporal and spatial information of crop water stress certain issues must be considered while using thermal rs images the issues include 1 temporal and spatial resolutions of images acquired 2 atmospheric conditions 3 altitude and viewing angle of thermal sensors and 4 variation in crop species and crop growth stages khanal et al 2017 among these camera types thermal imaging cameras are popularly used for water stress detection khanal et al 2017 some studies have used a combination of multispectral and thermal cameras in assessing crop water stress using some indicators zhou et al 2018 espinoza et al 2017 they noted that thermal imaging cameras are useful tool for rapid detection of crop water stress considering cost availability and popularity therefore thermal imaging cameras seem to be the most suitable for detecting crop water stress table 1 table 1 shows research conducted using uass with different rs technologies for crop water stress assessment resolution of the images obtained altitude of the flight and area covered by uas 3 3 1 indices for water stress in thermal imaging several indices exist for monitoring and quantifying water stress based on the crop canopy temperature these indices include crop water stress index cwsi degrees above canopy threshold dact and degrees above non stressed dans etc and canopy temperature is used as the main driver for evaluating water status dejonge et al 2015 kullberg et al 2017 evaluated thermal rs indices and found that crop canopy temperature based water stress indices with less data requirements dans and dact are sensitive to crop water stress and this is comparable to more data intensive methods such as cwsi however dans and dact have not been widely tested like cwsi a new indicator also based on canopy temperature ctsd standard deviation of canopy temperature was developed by han et al 2016 this index was tested using maize crop and found to be non sensitive to small changes in water stress among the indices cwsi is used as the standard index for quantifying water stress however it requires additional data such as vapour pressure deficit vpd as well as ideal weather conditions and prior computation baselines ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 gerhards et al 2016 in estimating cwsi emissivity from crop canopy acquired with a thermal imaging camera is used in the computation of water stress related to canopy temperature santesteban et al 2017 according to quebrajo et al 2018 cwsi is computed as 1 c w s i δ t i c i δ t d r y i c i where δ t d r y i is the maximum δ t i and δ t i is difference between canopy temperature tc and air temperature ta at the ith measurement moment dejonge et al 2015 noted that accumulation of daily midday difference between ta tc throughout a season is linearly proportional to the crop final yield c is a value representing the non water stressed baselines nwsb nwsb is a linear function that combines the change in difference between air temperature and canopy temperature when crop transpiration is at potential rate and vapour pressure deficit value simultaneously measures canopy temperature nwsb denoted as ci is expressed mathematically as 2 c i a b v p d i where a and b are empirical parameters obtained for each species in the study environment vpdi is the vapour pressure deficit kpa at the moment of flight on the ith measurement day according to garcía tejero et al 2018a thermal imagery information is better interpreted using nwsb they evaluated the potential of nwsb obtained from thermal imagery in order to establish a practical protocol for decisions related to irrigation management in almond plantations some studies have evaluated cwsi indicator in some crops sugar beet plants quebrajo et al 2018 grape matese et al 2018 pou et al 2014 garcía tejero et al 2016 santesteban et al 2017 olive orchard egea et al 2017 euonymus japonica euonymus plants gómez bellot et al 2015 citrus gonzalez dugo et al 2014 maize dejonge et al 2015 and found that it is a valuable indicator for assessing spatial variability of crop water status cwsi derived from thermal imagery has also been deployed for high spatial and temporal monitoring of water stress of the corn canopy in greenhouse mangus et al 2016 results obtained indicate that cwsi estimated from thermal canopy temperature can be used to quantify spatial and temporal soil moisture variability for irrigation scheduling in addition to water stress detection using crop temperature thermal imaging cameras can also detect water stress using soil moisture index and evapotranspiration algorithms khanal et al 2017 evapotranspiration algorithms have been successfully applied to estimate daily evapotranspiration from soybean and corn khanal et al 2017 4 real time irrigation scheduling with thermal uas recent advances in irrigation technology have platforms for continuous transmitting of data among irrigation controllers installed field sensors as well as equipment for variable irrigation rate quebrajo et al 2018 thermally based techniques currently employed in evaluating water stress for automatic irrigation scheduling include crop canopy temperature cwsi empirical or theoretical and time temperature threshold o shaughnessy and evett 2010 the cwsi algorithm is mostly used for automatic irrigation control systems in order to improve crop water productivity o shaughnessy et al 2012 developed a method that integrated cwsi and time threshold for automatic irrigation scheduling the effectiveness of the method was investigated on short and long season grain sorghum hybrids they noted that the method can effectively trigger the irrigation system for automatic irrigation scheduling also osroosh et al 2015 developed an adaptive scheduling algorithm that relied on theoretical cwsi to automatically irrigate apple trees most of these studies utilized the mobility of linear or center pivot irrigation systems to mount thermal imaging cameras thereby getting a dynamic scan of the effects of canopy temperature dejonge et al 2015 cwsi obtained from uas thermal imaging cameras can be adapted for real time irrigation scheduling for maximum crop water productivity real time canopy temperature the main driver of cwsi is better estimated automatically from thermal images jiménez bello et al 2011 developed and validated an automatic uas thermal imaging process for assessing plant water status that requires no operator participation with this the uas thermal imaging techniques coupled with software platforms will not only estimate the spatial and temporal crop water stress variation but drastically reduce the time needed between image processing analysis and taking action with the water stress information from thermal imaging either from canopy temperature soil moisture index or evapotranspiration algorithms irrigation controllers can be communicated for real time irrigation scheduling to improve water use productivity cwsi from thermal imagery has great potential to detect instantaneous variations of water status santesteban et al 2017 osroosh et al 2016 bellvert et al 2016 used a uas with a thermal sensor to fly over grape vineyards and obtained water stress information for real time irrigation scheduling leaf water potential obtained from the cwsi was successfully used as an irrigation trigger and there was no negative effect on yield and composition of the crop torres rua 2017 also used uas carrying a thermal camera sensor to estimate evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration information obtained was aggregated to irrigation valve zones that the irrigation technology supports reliable data and information acquired rapidly and easily are therefore essential for assessing water use productivity 5 conclusion cwp exhibit high spatial and temporal variability due to climatic and agricultural factors to improve cwp emphasis should be more on the climatic factors as well as on irrigation efficiency uas technologies with these commonly used cameras hyperspectral multispectral and thermal can improve cwp among these cameras uas thermal rs is identified as a valuable tool for monitoring and assessing crop water status uas thermal imaging cameras are used to estimate climatic factors that can improve cwp thermal rs determines the crop canopy temperature as a way of quantifying crop water stress some indices have been identified and used for quantifying crop water status using thermal rs among these indices cwsi is widely used in quantifying and assessing crop water stress despite its data demand compared to other indices cwsi is known to vary in space and time therefore uas thermal imaging cameras have the potential to account for spatial and temporal variability associated with cwsi in addition to water stress detection using crop temperature thermal imaging cameras can also detect water stress using soil moisture index and evapotranspiration algorithms irrigation technologies that improve cwp should be adopted in order to meet the global food demand associated with increasing global populations conventional irrigation systems alone are not enough to improve cwp to feed the projected human population increase especially in the face of climate change recently researchers have tried to improve cwp by developing an adaptive irrigation scheduling algorithm that relied on theoretical cwsi obtained from thermal imaging cameras mounted on the linear or centre pivot irrigation system this method failed to account properly for the spatial and temporal variation associated with crop water stress similarly uas have also been used for quasi time irrigation scheduling where the crop water stress information obtained is interpreted and used much later after the measurement for maximum cwp while accounting for spatial and temporal variability of crop water status there is need for real time irrigation scheduling using uas carrying thermal imaging cameras real time canopy temperature the main driver of cwsi is estimated automatically from thermal images with the water stress information from thermal imaging irrigation controllers can be communicated for real time irrigation scheduling thereby producing maximum crop water productivity acknowledgment we want to acknowledge rhodes university south africa for funding and providing a favourable environment for

evapotranspiration jin et al 2016 araya et al 2018 kukal and irmak 2017 brauman et al 2013 dogaru 2016 humphreys et al 2006 nhamo et al 2016 wichelns 2014 cwp is an indicator that quantifies the effect of agricultural water management sakthivadivel et al 1999 sun et al 2017 the use of cwp helps to meet the rising demand of water by irrigation amidst other sectors and also provide food for the growing population according to igbadun et al 2006 there are many expressions and definitions for quantifying cwp such as water use technical efficiency which is defined as quantity of agricultural output per unit amount of water used in the production water use economic efficiency which is the value of the output produced per quantity of water consumed and water use hydraulic efficiency which is defined as the ratio of water consumed by irrigated agriculture to the volume of water supplied these three cwp definitions are centred on minimizing water input while maximizing the crop yield output deficit irrigation techniques have been found to improve cwp by more than 200 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 hirich et al 2014 adeboye et al 2015 if irrigation is timeously managed however deficit irrigation must be carefully managed as igbadun et al 2006 described an attempt to maximize cwp by withholding irrigation in multiple crop growth stages which resulted in significant reduction in crop yield zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 however found that plants are more efficient with water when they are stressed and agricultural production can be sustained with 20 40 less water resources as long as new water management techniques are adopted the agricultural sector is currently under pressure to produce high quantity of food while using less water per unit of output thereby increasing cwp tshwene and oladele 2016 this is achieved by either producing the same quantity of crop with less water resources or a higher quantity of crop with the same quantity of water resources zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 either way cwp is generally derived from the relationship between the water consumption and yield of a particular crop both of which are highly variable in space and time kukal and irmak 2017 cwp can exhibit high spatial and temporal variability due to climatic and agricultural factors mdemu et al 2009 among the climatic factors cwp is more sensitive to wind speed and relative humidity compared to sunshine hours while for agricultural factors it is more sensitive to irrigation efficiency than the quantity of fertilizer used sun et al 2017 therefore to improve cwp emphasis should focus on the climatic factors and on irrigation efficiency existing techniques for improving cwp such as partial root zone drying barrios masias and jackson 2016 optimized regulated deficit irrigation léllis et al 2017 gendron et al 2018 adeboye et al 2015 etc do not currently account for the integrated effects of climatic and irrigation efficiency factors as well as spatial variability of cwp unmanned aerial systems uas technology offers high spatial resolution and rapid collection of data over large areas potentially enabling farmers to increase the precision of irrigation both spatially and temporally therefore the aim of this study is to give a general overview of the current and potential capabilities of uas to improve crop water productivity under precision agriculture 2 uas in precision agriculture uas are platforms for remote sensing rs used in precision agriculture and examples of their use are found in hunt et al 2018 adão et al 2017 bendig et al 2012 santesteban et al 2017 poblete et al 2017 muchiri and kimathi 2016 abdullahi et al 2015 simelli and apostolos 2015 whitehead et al 2014 whitehead and hugenholtz 2014 manfreda et al 2018 these platforms are evolving rapidly technically and with regard to regulations ballesteros et al 2014 uass recently have become a common remote sensing technology comprising aerial platforms suitable for carrying small and lightweight sensors there are different classes of uas for instance according to whitehead and hugenholtz 2014 in united states it ranges from micro 0 9 kg mini 0 9 13 6 kg tactical 13 6 454 5 kg medium altitude long endurance 454 5 13 636 4 kg and high altitude long endurance 13 636 4 kg they noted that commercial and remote sensing applications prefer uas weighing less than 5 kg because of cost advantages and reduced risk associated with blunt force impact mini uas weighing less than 5 kg can carry 0 2 kg to 1 5 kg of sensor payload bendig et al 2012 according to gago et al 2015 four component tasks to be considered before selecting the appropriate uas for precision agriculture are design of experiment data acquisition data processing and results for agricultural management fixed wing airplanes and unmanned helicopters uass are mainly used these two aerial platforms have some limitations and advantages to mention a few limitations and advantages unmanned helicopters are able to travel in any direction while fixed wing airplanes travel in a more linear and restricted fashion fixed wing aircrafts have simple flight systems and can fly for longer duration compared to unmanned helicopters unmanned helicopters have more complex flight systems and can offer lower flight altitudes with low speed fixed wing aircrafts therefore have capacity to cover wider areas but their flight altitude is higher which reduces the image resolution also fixed wing uas aerial platforms require specific runways or at least sufficient open space for landing and take off because of these limitations recently a new aircraft platform emerged multi copter multi rotor which does not require special take off or landing runway the multi copter is more user friendly which makes it possible to be operated by farmers in order to obtain real time data and apply adapted water management generally the type of uas required depends on the aim of the study as well as the quality of the desired output result in addition to uas aerial platforms the camera sensors are key to the quality of images produced selection of camera type also depends on the aim of the project the most commonly used uas cameras in agriculture include thermal multispectral hyperspectral and red green blue rgb gago et al 2015 recommended different camera types depending on the type of crop trait status of interest for biotic and abiotic stress thermal and hyperspectral cameras are recommended while multispectral and red green blue rgb cameras are recommended for growth biomass assessment rgb cameras are one of the traditional imaging systems used in agroforestry applications however they lack the precision and spectral range to profile materials that hyperspectral and multispectral cameras can provide adão et al 2017 3 commonly used uas imaging cameras for water status 3 1 hyperspectral hyperspectral imaging techniques measure the reflectance from the vegetation canopy the recorded reflectance cannot be applied directly as a metric of leaf water content therefore reflectance indices are used indices for hyperspectral data include simple ratio index sri normalized difference e g photochemical reflectance index pri etc elvanidi et al 2018 pôças et al 2017 rapaport et al 2015 hyperspectral technology integrates spectroscopy with the benefits of digital imagery loggenberg et al 2018 the capability of hyperspectral imaging ranging from 400 to 2500 nm in assessing the water deficiency in tomato plants was demonstrated by susič et al 2018 zarco tejada et al 2012 demonstrated the ability of uav based hyperspectral and thermal cameras to assess water stress levels in a citrus crop and confirmed that there is link between pri and canopy temperature recently loggenberg et al 2018 combined hyperspectral rs technologies with machine learning to discriminate between stressed and non stressed grape vines from hyperspectral imaging the results obtained showed that machine ensemble learners effectively analysed the hyperspectral data generally hyperspectral imaging cameras capture more detailed data in both spatial and spectral ranges compared to other cameras it can measure hundreds of bands which raises complexity when considering the quantity of data acquired loggenberg et al 2018 noted that the major limiting factor in applying hyperspectral data is the inherent curse of dimensionality which results in reduced classification accuracies in addition hyperspectral cameras are very expensive and complex elvanidi et al 2018 which limit their wide spread application especially in commercial agriculture 3 2 multispectral multispectral imaging techniques are based on the theory that each surface reflects part of the light received therefore multispectral cameras measure reflectance and light absorption from the vegetation canopy matese and di gennaro 2018 vegetation reflectance characteristics are used to derive vegetation indices vis healthy vegetation absorbs all the red light and reflects back much of the near infrared light while stressed vegetation reflects more red light and less near infrared light multispectral vis used for detecting water status include structural indices e g normalized difference vegetation index ndvi renormalized difference vegetation index rdvi optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi sri etc xanthophyll indices e g photochemical reflectance index pri570 pri515 chlorophyll indices e g transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index tcari tcari osavi etc blue green red ratio indices e g green index gi red green ratio index rgri etc baluja et al 2012 rallo et al 2014 zarco tejada et al 2013 2012 a new index prinorm was proposed by zarco tejada et al 2013 in which pri index is normalized to be sensitive to canopy structure and chlorophyll content prinorm performed better than standard pri index when tested against leaf water potential and stomatal conductance the ndvi which is the index of plant greenness is popularly used among other vis matese and di gennaro 2018 zhao et al 2017 it is expressed as the normalized difference between the red and nir near infrared bands hence it manages the differences in illumination within an image due to aspect and slope as well as differences due to time images were obtained baluja et al 2012 used different spectral indices to assess water status of a vineyard and noted that ndvi and tcari osavi gave the highest coefficient of determination with stem water potential ѱstem and leaf stomatal conductance gs therefore the two indices reflect the cumulative water deficit hence long term response to water status unlike thermal that gives short term response zhao et al 2017 established a relationship between canopy ndvi and ѱstem at different growing stages multispectral rs imaging technology uses bands such as green 500 600 nm spectral band red 600 700 nm spectral band red edge 700 730 nm and nir 700 nm to 1 3 μm wavebands to capture visible and invisible images of vegetation according to poblete et al 2017 plant water status is not accurately predicted with multispectral indices between 500 800 nm spectral band because of their non sensitivity to water content however wavelengths greater than 800 nm may be better rallo et al 2014 noted that satisfactory estimation of leaf water potentials at leaf canopy levels can be derived using vis based on the nir shortwave infrared domain with specific optimization of the centre bands recently some researchers have developed artificial neural network ann models derived from multispectral images to forecast spatial variability of ѱstem of crops romero et al 2018 classified the water status level of the grapevine based on ten vegetation indices using red green red edge and nir wavebands and found that there were no significant relationships between vis individually and ѱstem however with lower correlation values of less than 0 3 for almost all the indices studied they went further to develop an ann model model 1 using all vis calculated as inputs and compared the output with actual measured ѱstem and got higher correlation values similarly poblete et al 2017 compared ann model outputs with ground truth measurements of ѱstem and found the best performance of the model was with simulations that included the spectral bands of 550 570 670 700 and 800 nm 3 3 thermal imaging thermal rs measures the radiation emitted from an object s surface and converts it into temperature khanal et al 2017 the theory behind thermal rs is that all objects on the earth s surface with a temperature above 273 c emit radiation and the quantity of radiation is a function of the emissivity of the surface temperature khanal et al 2017 crop canopy surface temperature in general is a function of transpiration rate available soil water status and atmospheric evaporative demand khanal et al 2017 therefore thermal rs determines the crop canopy surface temperature as a way of quantifying crop water stress which is useful in irrigation scheduling additionally thermal rs can also quantify soil moisture and evapotranspiration status many studies have used thermal rs to assess crop water stress for several crop species including citrus orchards zarco tejada et al 2012 pinto beans zhou et al 2018 sugar beet plants quebrajo et al 2018 almond trees garcía tejero et al 2018a 2018b and grapevines bellvert et al 2014 bellvert et al 2016 espinoza et al 2017 matese et al 2018 garcía tejero et al 2016 notwithstanding that thermal rs is capable of providing temporal and spatial information of crop water stress certain issues must be considered while using thermal rs images the issues include 1 temporal and spatial resolutions of images acquired 2 atmospheric conditions 3 altitude and viewing angle of thermal sensors and 4 variation in crop species and crop growth stages khanal et al 2017 among these camera types thermal imaging cameras are popularly used for water stress detection khanal et al 2017 some studies have used a combination of multispectral and thermal cameras in assessing crop water stress using some indicators zhou et al 2018 espinoza et al 2017 they noted that thermal imaging cameras are useful tool for rapid detection of crop water stress considering cost availability and popularity therefore thermal imaging cameras seem to be the most suitable for detecting crop water stress table 1 table 1 shows research conducted using uass with different rs technologies for crop water stress assessment resolution of the images obtained altitude of the flight and area covered by uas 3 3 1 indices for water stress in thermal imaging several indices exist for monitoring and quantifying water stress based on the crop canopy temperature these indices include crop water stress index cwsi degrees above canopy threshold dact and degrees above non stressed dans etc and canopy temperature is used as the main driver for evaluating water status dejonge et al 2015 kullberg et al 2017 evaluated thermal rs indices and found that crop canopy temperature based water stress indices with less data requirements dans and dact are sensitive to crop water stress and this is comparable to more data intensive methods such as cwsi however dans and dact have not been widely tested like cwsi a new indicator also based on canopy temperature ctsd standard deviation of canopy temperature was developed by han et al 2016 this index was tested using maize crop and found to be non sensitive to small changes in water stress among the indices cwsi is used as the standard index for quantifying water stress however it requires additional data such as vapour pressure deficit vpd as well as ideal weather conditions and prior computation baselines ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 gerhards et al 2016 in estimating cwsi emissivity from crop canopy acquired with a thermal imaging camera is used in the computation of water stress related to canopy temperature santesteban et al 2017 according to quebrajo et al 2018 cwsi is computed as 1 c w s i δ t i c i δ t d r y i c i where δ t d r y i is the maximum δ t i and δ t i is difference between canopy temperature tc and air temperature ta at the ith measurement moment dejonge et al 2015 noted that accumulation of daily midday difference between ta tc throughout a season is linearly proportional to the crop final yield c is a value representing the non water stressed baselines nwsb nwsb is a linear function that combines the change in difference between air temperature and canopy temperature when crop transpiration is at potential rate and vapour pressure deficit value simultaneously measures canopy temperature nwsb denoted as ci is expressed mathematically as 2 c i a b v p d i where a and b are empirical parameters obtained for each species in the study environment vpdi is the vapour pressure deficit kpa at the moment of flight on the ith measurement day according to garcía tejero et al 2018a thermal imagery information is better interpreted using nwsb they evaluated the potential of nwsb obtained from thermal imagery in order to establish a practical protocol for decisions related to irrigation management in almond plantations some studies have evaluated cwsi indicator in some crops sugar beet plants quebrajo et al 2018 grape matese et al 2018 pou et al 2014 garcía tejero et al 2016 santesteban et al 2017 olive orchard egea et al 2017 euonymus japonica euonymus plants gómez bellot et al 2015 citrus gonzalez dugo et al 2014 maize dejonge et al 2015 and found that it is a valuable indicator for assessing spatial variability of crop water status cwsi derived from thermal imagery has also been deployed for high spatial and temporal monitoring of water stress of the corn canopy in greenhouse mangus et al 2016 results obtained indicate that cwsi estimated from thermal canopy temperature can be used to quantify spatial and temporal soil moisture variability for irrigation scheduling in addition to water stress detection using crop temperature thermal imaging cameras can also detect water stress using soil moisture index and evapotranspiration algorithms khanal et al 2017 evapotranspiration algorithms have been successfully applied to estimate daily evapotranspiration from soybean and corn khanal et al 2017 4 real time irrigation scheduling with thermal uas recent advances in irrigation technology have platforms for continuous transmitting of data among irrigation controllers installed field sensors as well as equipment for variable irrigation rate quebrajo et al 2018 thermally based techniques currently employed in evaluating water stress for automatic irrigation scheduling include crop canopy temperature cwsi empirical or theoretical and time temperature threshold o shaughnessy and evett 2010 the cwsi algorithm is mostly used for automatic irrigation control systems in order to improve crop water productivity o shaughnessy et al 2012 developed a method that integrated cwsi and time threshold for automatic irrigation scheduling the effectiveness of the method was investigated on short and long season grain sorghum hybrids they noted that the method can effectively trigger the irrigation system for automatic irrigation scheduling also osroosh et al 2015 developed an adaptive scheduling algorithm that relied on theoretical cwsi to automatically irrigate apple trees most of these studies utilized the mobility of linear or center pivot irrigation systems to mount thermal imaging cameras thereby getting a dynamic scan of the effects of canopy temperature dejonge et al 2015 cwsi obtained from uas thermal imaging cameras can be adapted for real time irrigation scheduling for maximum crop water productivity real time canopy temperature the main driver of cwsi is better estimated automatically from thermal images jiménez bello et al 2011 developed and validated an automatic uas thermal imaging process for assessing plant water status that requires no operator participation with this the uas thermal imaging techniques coupled with software platforms will not only estimate the spatial and temporal crop water stress variation but drastically reduce the time needed between image processing analysis and taking action with the water stress information from thermal imaging either from canopy temperature soil moisture index or evapotranspiration algorithms irrigation controllers can be communicated for real time irrigation scheduling to improve water use productivity cwsi from thermal imagery has great potential to detect instantaneous variations of water status santesteban et al 2017 osroosh et al 2016 bellvert et al 2016 used a uas with a thermal sensor to fly over grape vineyards and obtained water stress information for real time irrigation scheduling leaf water potential obtained from the cwsi was successfully used as an irrigation trigger and there was no negative effect on yield and composition of the crop torres rua 2017 also used uas carrying a thermal camera sensor to estimate evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration information obtained was aggregated to irrigation valve zones that the irrigation technology supports reliable data and information acquired rapidly and easily are therefore essential for assessing water use productivity 5 conclusion cwp exhibit high spatial and temporal variability due to climatic and agricultural factors to improve cwp emphasis should be more on the climatic factors as well as on irrigation efficiency uas technologies with these commonly used cameras hyperspectral multispectral and thermal can improve cwp among these cameras uas thermal rs is identified as a valuable tool for monitoring and assessing crop water status uas thermal imaging cameras are used to estimate climatic factors that can improve cwp thermal rs determines the crop canopy temperature as a way of quantifying crop water stress some indices have been identified and used for quantifying crop water status using thermal rs among these indices cwsi is widely used in quantifying and assessing crop water stress despite its data demand compared to other indices cwsi is known to vary in space and time therefore uas thermal imaging cameras have the potential to account for spatial and temporal variability associated with cwsi in addition to water stress detection using crop temperature thermal imaging cameras can also detect water stress using soil moisture index and evapotranspiration algorithms irrigation technologies that improve cwp should be adopted in order to meet the global food demand associated with increasing global populations conventional irrigation systems alone are not enough to improve cwp to feed the projected human population increase especially in the face of climate change recently researchers have tried to improve cwp by developing an adaptive irrigation scheduling algorithm that relied on theoretical cwsi obtained from thermal imaging cameras mounted on the linear or centre pivot irrigation system this method failed to account properly for the spatial and temporal variation associated with crop water stress similarly uas have also been used for quasi time irrigation scheduling where the crop water stress information obtained is interpreted and used much later after the measurement for maximum cwp while accounting for spatial and temporal variability of crop water status there is need for real time irrigation scheduling using uas carrying thermal imaging cameras real time canopy temperature the main driver of cwsi is estimated automatically from thermal images with the water stress information from thermal imaging irrigation controllers can be communicated for real time irrigation scheduling thereby producing maximum crop water productivity acknowledgment we want to acknowledge rhodes university south africa for funding and providing a favourable environment for study 
11053,crop models are useful tools in investigating crop yield and water consumption and thus far they have been well developed in field applications moreover their regional applications have evolved from lumped models to distributed models by considering the spatial variation in soil climate crop and management measures to some extent with the advent of modernized and refined farming and water management the spatial variation of environment related initial and crop parameters of models should be appropriately reflected on this basis this study performs spatial inversion of sowing date maximum canopy coverage ccx and relative biomass brel based on the aquacrop gis model and by using remote sensing data these parameters are incorporated as independent spatial variables into the distributed aquacrop gis model to produce a remote sensing based distributed aquacrop rs crop model which will be validated with the corn data in the middle oasis of heihe river findings suggest that the initial condition sowing date and crop parameters ccx and brel exhibit considerable spatial variation the introduction of sowing date has a considerable influence on the simulation accuracy of evapotranspiration et and crop parameters ccx and brel have a considerable influence on yield simulation accuracy in comparison with the traditional aquacrop gis model the simulation accuracy of aquacrop rs model is generally improved by 5 26 in regional et and by 35 72 in regional yield keywords aquacrop rs maximum canopy coverage relative biomass sowing date 1 introduction crop models have been extensively developed and used as important tools in research on water consumption and crop yield due to their high repeatability and satisfactory performance in addressing issues such as long growing cycle susceptibility to natural factors and high costs associated with field experiments crop models are developed based on field experiments a traditional lumped model cannot adequately consider the spatial variation of crop growth environment and field management in large areas which introduces large errors to regional simulation results given the development of gis new advanced models have been established in regional applications gis provides a means to analyze the spatial variation of regional factors such as climate soil irrigation and crop type on this basis a family of spatially distributed models have been developed such as swap model which is a regional distributed hydrological model developed based on gis singh et al 2006 wesseling and feddes 2006 droogers et al 2000 and swap epic or swap wofost model which is a distributed agricultural hydrological model developed from the swap model jiang et al 2015 van dam et al 2006 meanwhile the hydrus epic model hao et al 2015 has been applied for the quantitative evaluation of the spatiotemporal variation in soil salinity and crop growth in hetao irrigation district to some extent these distributed models consider the spatial variation of the environment in which crops grow thereby improving the simulation accuracy of the distributed models however they have a strict requirement on model calibration and input data preparation for end users vanuytrecht et al 2014b which limits their application to a large extent given such a situation simple distributed models should be developed in view of the aforementioned requirement the international food and agriculture organization fao released a moisture based crop growth model called aquacrop in 2009 in this model the input data are intuitive specific and easy to obtain and the calibration is simple and can be used for multiple crops mabhaudhi et al 2014 bello and walker 2017 these merits have led to the rapid development of the model fao released aquacrop gis by merging the aquacrop model with gis software to promote the model for regional applications lorite et al 2013 the traditional aquacrop gis model for regional applications considers the spatial variation in soil climate crop and management measures li et al 2016 van gaelen et al 2017 the parameters of the model tend to vary with the change of natural environment in which crops grow however the model currently used in regional areas fails to consider this situation li et al 2016 only by the spatial correction for the parameters of crop models can the simulation results reflect more realistically the regional growth status of crops the aquacrop model describes the degree of fertility stress in the growth environment in terms of maximum canopy coverage ccx and relative biomass brel several studies geerts et al 2009 vanuytrecht et al 2014a have demonstrated that the model is sensitive to ccx and brel in addition sowing date is an important initial parameter and has a considerable effect on the crop growth process the extent of temperature stress which the crops will suffer during the growth stage varies with sowing dates and affects the development of the crop jahan et al 2018 humphreys et al 2016 apparent variation exists in ground elevation soil type climate and management factors in the middle oasis of the heihe river basin hrb which results in the spatial variation of ccx and brel which are the two factors that reflect the growth environment and optimum sowing date the development of remote sensing has provided an effective means for estimating the spatial distribution of such parameters hence this study utilizes remote sensing data in estimating the spatial distribution of the initial and crop parameters of the model to improve the regional applications of the aquacrop model thus this paper propose the aquacrop rs model which is a distributed crop moisture model based on remote sensing to obtain an accurate estimation of water consumption and yield of regional crops this study preliminarily analyzes the sensitivity of simulation results that is yield evapotranspiration et and water productivity wpet which is the ratio between yield and et on three parameters i e sowing date ccx and brel by using corn as the research subject remote sensing data are used in performing the inversion of sowing date ccx and brel which are used as independent spatial variables to construct the distributed aquacrop rs model the aquacrop rs performance is evaluated under four different scenarios in terms of prediction for yield et and water productivity in the middle oasis of the hrb scenario 1 is called aquacrop gis and comprises the constant sowing date and crop parameters scenario 2 is called aquacrop rs1 and comprises the spatially distributed sowing date and constant crop parameters scenario 3 is called aquacrop rs2 and comprises the spatially distributed crop parameters and constant sowing date and scenario 4 is called aquacrop rs3 and comprises the spatially distributed crop parameters and sowing date the simulation accuracies for the four scenarios are then compared and analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the research region this study focuses on the middle oasis of the hrb that mainly covers ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county according to the direction of flowing water namely from southeast to northwest this paper divided the middle oasis into the upstream ganzhou district middle reaches linze county and downstream gaotai county the location spans 38 52 n 39 52 n and 98 57 e 100 52 e fig 1 in this district which is dominated by typical continental arid and semi arid climate with annual average temperature of 6 8 c annual insolation duration of 3000 4000 h annual potential evaporation capacity of 1410 mm and average annual rainfall of only 140 mm the elevation varies between 1200 m and 3600 m and a considerable spatial variation is observed in temperature and soil type the total irrigated area is approximately 2 2 million mu 146 667 ha of which farmland accounts for approximately 85 the major crops include wheat corn barley vegetables melons and other cash crops among which corn and wheat account for approximately 51 and 17 of the planting area respectively all crops have only one cropping a year except for vegetables that have double cropping rotation irrigation is practiced however the irrigation schedule slightly varies from region to region based on the statistics from the irrigation management offices in the district 2 2 data acquisition and method field experiments were conducted in yingke irrigation district from april 2012 to october 2013 and the data were used to calibrate and validate the model han et al 2019 the sowing date irrigation schedule and yield in the middle oasis were surveyed and sampled in 2012 2015 and 2016 in which 14 30 and 148 sampling points were obtained respectively the spatial distribution of the sampling points in these years is shown in fig 2 the soil texture data of the middle oasis were obtained from the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences the soil types are mainly loam silt loam clay loam and sandy soil the soil hydraulic parameters were estimated with rosetta software on the basis of soil particle size composition schaap et al 2001 jiang et al 2015 wen et al 2017 the meteorological data were obtained from china meteorological data service center http data cma cn the dataset of land use in the hrb was obtained from the heihe planning data management center zhong et al 2014 2015 2 3 space inversion of sowing date sowing date is an important input parameter that affects the growth process subsequent pollination and filling and yield the spatiotemporal variation of the sowing date of corn with the elevation of the middle oasis is notable the remote sensing data of ndvi are spatiotemporally continuous and can reflect the vegetation growth well thereby providing a good means to investigate the crop phenology in the region in this study the sowing dates of corn in the middle oasis were estimated vyas et al 2013 with modnd1f 500 m 5 days data products for 2012 with doy of 81 158 2015 with doy of 89 139 and 2016 with doy of 91 136 as shown as follows http www gscloud cn 1 n d v i i c 1 n d v i i 1 n d v i i 0 n d v i i 2 n d v i i 1 0 t h e

the time of emergence which takes 0 13 in this text see section 3 2 1 the five day composite ndvi data can eliminate the influence of atmosphere and cloud to ensure that the acquired ndvi values are within the true value range to the large extent n d v i i 1 n d v i i and n d v i i 2 n d v i i 1 are greater than zero to ensure that the crop continuously grows over the selected period thereby removing non crop effect given the growth characteristics of the corn in heihe region and the research data the average emergence time is set to 10 days thus the sowing date is 10 days ahead of the date of emergence 2 4 space inversion of crop parameters in this paper the crop parameters of ccx and brel reflect the soil fertility stress in the aquacrop model the space inversion of crop parameters in the actual environment was performed by mod13q1 250 m 16 days https lpdaac usgs gov data the ccx and brel were brought into the crop files of the distributed model for different growth environments so that each crop file corresponded to a set of fertilizer stress coefficients which could compensate for the regional simulation error caused by the single crop parameters evaluated in the field experiment the maximum canopy coverage ccx refers to the maximum value that the canopy can reach in the optimal environment ndvi data was used to invert the canopy coverage during crop growth and the spatial distribution of ccx was obtained by the maximum value composite mvc referring to taking the maximum value from several images to regenerate a new image by use of arcgis see eq 2 the relative biomass brel refers to the ratio between the actual biomass under fertility stress and the latent biomass at the start of flowering the remote sensing product of cumulative net photosynthesis and the method of mvc were used to obtain spatial brel see eqs 3 5 additional information about the inversion technique can be found in the study of han et al 2019 2 c c x m a x c c 1 c

schedule and crop type in the middle oasis of the hrb this paper combined the inverted sowing date and crop parameters with aquacrop gis model to build a regional distributed aquacrop rs model fig 3 with the aid of gis the aforementioned spatial factors were intersected to produce simulation units whose natural crop and management attributes are spatially consistent ccx and brel were used to adjust the fertility stress coefficient in each unit 2 6 evaluation of the model the model performance was evaluated in terms of normalized root mean square error nrmse root mean square error rmse

oj denotes the remote sensing data and pi denotes the simulated value of aquacrop gis model and pi denotes the simulated value of aquacrop rs model described below in this paper a decreased dare indicates a decreasing relative error and thus a high simulation accuracy of the region by the corresponding model an increased dare denotes an increasing relative error and thus a low simulation accuracy of the region by the corresponding model and an unchanged dare indicates an unchanged relative error and thus an unchanged simulation accuracy of the region by the corresponding model 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis a number of simulation scenarios were performed in which brel was set as 50 60 70 80 and 90 to evaluate the sensitivity of crop yield et and wpet to the major parameters of aquacrop the results are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a c brel varies between 50 and 80 and has a considerable effect on yield et and wpet which all tend to increase with brel this result is consistent with the findings of akumaga et al 2017 crop yield et and wpet are no longer sensitive to brel when they are greater than 80 it shows that the wpet decreases with the increase of ccx fig 4 c when ccx varies between 50 and 70 which is in contrary to the effect of ccx on et fig 4 b this finding suggests that excessive growth of crop canopy is detrimental to crop yield and wpet this paper analyzed the effect of sowing date on crop yield wpet and et during the cycle in ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county with other conditions kept constant the results are shown in fig 4 d f from the figures the yield tends to initially increase and then stabilizes with the delay of sowing date the yield starts to reach maximum in linze county and ganzhou district when sowing occurs on the 92nd 97th day of the year to obtain a maximum yield the sowing date in gaotai county should be 5 days ahead of that in linze county and ganzhou district due to its low elevation and high average annual temperature the et of growing cycle has an opposite trend to that of wpet when the sowing date is delayed fig 4 e f the wpet in all three districts increases with the sowing date and reaches the maximum when the sowing occurs between the 107th and 112th day of the year the crop may experience different temperature stresses which in turn will influence pollination and filling thus the effect of the same sowing date on yield and wpet slightly varies from area to area due to different meteorological conditions 3 2 spatial distribution of sowing date 3 2 1 spatial inversion accuracy of sowing date to obtain the threshold of ndvi at emergence 30 points in the corn field were uniformly selected in 2012 2015 and 2016 from the middle oasis of the hrb and the average changing trend of ndvi at the initial stage is shown in fig 5 on the basis of the three year ndvi changing trend in the district this paper assumed the ndvi value to be 0 13 at emergence the inversion values and observations of the sowing date in 2012 2015 and 2016 for this district were compared and analyzed the results are shown in fig 6 a c and table 1 statistics show that the estimation error of sowing date within 5 days accounts for 64 69 and 68 of the sampling points and the maximum errors are 10 days 10 days and 10 days for 2012 2015 and 2016 respectively the rmse is approximately 5 days and the mae is approximately 4 days of sowing date the inversion accuracy of 2015 is the highest and that of 2012 is the lowest which can be attributed to the small size of samples and the restriction of sampled areas for 2012 sakamoto et al 2005 and vyas et al 2013 estimated the sowing date with modis and insat ccd data based on the characteristics of crops under different phenomena 3 2 2 spatial distribution of sowing date the spatial distributions of the sowing date for corn in 2012 and 2015 in the middle oasis of the hrb are shown in fig 7 the sowing date is obviously spatial and temporal the spatial variation for 2015 is obvious that is the sowing date in the upper reaches of the district is late meanwhile the sowing date is generally early in the downstream areas except for the areas along the mountains and xinba irrigation district where the sowing date is late due to the delayed warming up of climate for its high altitudes in addition the temperature in 2015 prior to the sowing date is generally higher and the sowing date is generally earlier in 2015 than in 2012 by comparing the daily maximum temperature and daily minimum temperature in the middle oasis for 2012 and 2015 statistics show that the sowing date of corn in 2012 is mostly distributed between april 11 and april 21 which accounts for 88 for 2015 the sowing date began on march 25 in which the sowing date is regularly distributed throughout the period 3 3 spatial distribution of crop parameters ccx and brel 3 3 1 spatial distribution of maximum canopy coverage ccx the growth status of corn is spatial due to the combined effect of environment and human activities which can be described by the spatial distribution of the maximum canopy coverage remote sensing data were used to invert the maximum canopy coverage of corn in 2012 and 2015 in the middle oasis of the hrb the results were grouped in four levels based on the classification criteria for aquacrop proposed by fao fig 8 the comparison of the spatial distribution of ccx for 2012 and 2015 suggests that the spatial variation is more pronounced in 2015 than in 2012 however the ccx is generally higher in 2012 compared with 2015 statistics show that the proportion of ccx between 80 and 89 is approximately around 60 in 2012 and 2015 however the proportion of ccx larger than 90 in 2012 and 2015 is 28 and 9 respectively in addition the ccx is higher in the heihe irrigation district than that along the mountains which is largely related to the different temperature water supply and soil fertility to simplify the calculation the proportions of ccx at each level are separately counted and the weighted average is used as the comprehensive index for the level in the simulation statistics show that the comprehensive value of each level and the corresponding proportion are 55 accounting for 1 75 accounting for 7 86 accounting for 64 and 91 accounting for 28 in 2015 the comprehensive value and corresponding proportion are 54 accounting for 8 74 accounting for 26 85 accounting for 59 and 91 accounting for 7 3 3 2 spatial distribution of relative biomass brel the spatial distribution of soil fertility is irregular throughout the district due to the influence of human activities and soil texture thereby leading to the spatial variation of energy storage during the vegetative growth stage of crops which can be indirectly reflected by brel in the aquacrop model remote sensing data were used to invert the relative biomass brel of corn in the middle oasis in 2012 and 2015 fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of this parameter in which brel in the district is lower but more spatially obvious for 2012 than for 2015 and exhibits an overall decreasing pattern from upstream to downstream the soil type of this district shows that the downstream areas are mainly sandy soil in which its texture is relatively poor in water and fertilizer retention and imposes a considerable restriction on crop growth the relative biomass brel for 2015 is generally high but without remarkable spatial regularity which is caused by the higher temperature in 2015 than in 2012 wang et al 2018 another reason might be the additional human interventions in the production process such as the improvement of field management to simplify the calculation the previously described method for evaluating the comprehensive value of ccx is followed to obtain the comprehensive values of brel for different levels in 2012 and 2015 for 2012 the values and corresponding percentages are 71 accounting for 23 79 accounting for 22 and 84 accounting for 32 89 accounting for 21 and 100 accounting for 22 for 2015 the results are 69 accounting for 0 79 accounting for 1 85 accounting for 2 95 accounting for 44 and 100 accounting for 53 3 4 simulation accuracy analysis of distributed aquacrop rs model 3 4 1 simulation accuracy analysis of regional et the sum of the et of corn from may to august 2012 for the four scenarios were compared with the monthly et data with a resolution of 1000 m for the middle oasis to estimate the effects of input parameters on the simulation accuracy of the distributed model wu et al 2012 liu et al 2011 wesseling and feddes 2006 which was estimated by the latest etwatch model based on multi source remote sensing data the results are shown in table 2 from the table the simulation accuracies are improved by 21 5 and 26 for the second third and fourth scenarios relative to the first scenario respectively the areas in the middle oasis in which the simulation accuracy changed were counted statistics show that the areas with improved and worsened simulation accuracies from the simulation results of aquacrop rs1 account for 85 and 15 those of aquacrop rs2 account for 87 and 8 and those of aquacrop rs3 account for 85 and 15 respectively in relation to those of aquacrop gis the three scenarios of aquacrop rs1 aquacrop rs2 and aquacrop rs3 do not differ considerably from one another in terms of the percentage of the area in which the simulation accuracy improved however all registered areas increased with improved simulation accuracy the introduction of spatial sowing date had a considerable effect on the simulation accuracy and regional effect on the et in the region for the aquacrop rs model 3 4 2 simulation accuracy analysis on regional yield the corn yields for 2015 as gathered in the survey in the middle oasis were divided into low 13 103 kg ha medium 15 103 kg ha and high 15 103 kg ha yield groups comparisons were made with the yield of the four scenarios in the region for the year 2015 and the results are shown in table 3 from the table the introduction of spatial sowing date in the aquacrop rs1 model has a small effect on yield simulation accuracy however the aquacrop rs2 model which incorporates spatial crop parameters has a considerable improvement by 34 68 in yield simulation accuracy in view of the simulation accuracy of aquacrop rs3 on yield a general improvement in accuracy by 35 72 spatial crop parameters play an important role in improving the regional simulation accuracy of yield in the aquacrop rs model relative biomass brel is a characteristic indicator of soil fertility and has a direct effect on crop yield thus crop parameters especially brel have a considerable effect on yield when sowing date and crop parameters are considered for their effect on the simulation accuracy of the model however the introduction of distributed sowing date has a small effect on yield simulation accuracy in the model the spatial distribution of sampled points for regional yield shows that these points are mostly located in the heihe irrigation district of the middle oasis and no data from the irrigation areas along the mountains are available for comparison this condition can be attributed to the fact that the temperature in the heihe irrigation district cannot produce a restrictive effect on the yield waha et al 2013 hence the introduction of sowing date in the distributed model has a minimal effect on the simulation accuracy of yield therefore balanced consideration should be provided to the condition of temperature and rainfall to improve the regional simulation accuracy and the sowing date should be optimized when utilizing a distributed crop model to simulate the regional growth of crop under changing climates in the future in conclusion a distributed model that only considers the traditional factors such as soil properties weather and irrigation is prone to produce large errors in regional simulations and is unable to account for the variation in regional crop production accurately therefore in the absence of regional data the improved distributed model in this study can accurately simulate the actual production in the region 3 5 regional simulation of the distributed model based on remote sensing the spatial distribution of yield and wpet for corn in the middle oasis of the hrb simulated by aquacrop rs3 in 2012 and 2015 is shown in fig 10 from the figure the spatiotemporal variation of yield and wpet is obvious throughout the middle oasis for 2015 the yield is generally above 11 3 103 kg ha and wpet concentrates approximately 1 9 2 3 kg m3 for 2012 the yield shows a notable decreasing pattern from upstream to downstream through the middle oasis district and wpet is mostly distributed between 1 4 kg m3 and 2 0 kg m3 the yield and wpet are generally higher in 2015 than that in 2012 the meteorological data of 2012 and 2015 show that the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in the middle oasis are approximately 1 c higher in 2015 than in 2012 wang et al 2017 and abebe et al 2016 indicated that the temperature affected yield by acting on phenology growth rate photosynthesis and respiration wang et al 2018 reported that the rise in temperature not exceeding 1 c resulted in an increasing trend in corn yield the comparison of the spatial distribution of yield and sowing date in the district shows that the high yield in 2015 is related to the early sowing date in the year to some extent bastidas et al 2008 the sowing date is earlier in 2015 than in 2012 in the district especially in the middle and lower reaches of the middle oasis and the sowing date in 2015 is 10 days earlier on average than in 2012 with the average cycle of 6 days longer in 2015 than in 2012 the analysis on temperature irrigation volume and soil texture for 2012 and 2015 in the middle oasis suggests that the spatiotemporal variation in yield and wpet is caused by the combined effect of the three factors i e sowing date ccx and brel the wpet is spatiotemporally irregular and variational which suggests large room for improvement in the middle oasis 4 conclusions the combination of crop model gis and remote sensing promotes the regional application of point models the parameters of the aquacrop model namely sowing date ccx and brel have varied effects on yield et and wpet in the middle oasis of the hrb particularly brel has a considerable effect on yield et and wpet which all increase with brel however ccx has a more considerable effect on et and wpet which increase and decrease with the increase of ccx respectively the effect of sowing date on crop yield et and wpet also show different trends in view of the influences of the parameters on simulation results remote sensing data are used to develop the spatial distribution of sowing date ccx and brel for the aquacrop model the findings indicate that sowing date ccx and brel in the middle oasis have considerable spatial variation particularly the sowing date varies between 79th day and 122th day at different altitudes in the district on the basis of previous studies the present work improves the regional application of the aquacrop model by combining remote sensing data a new and complete regional distributed aquacrop rs model is constructed by combining the initial parameter of sowing date and crop parameters of ccx and brel in comparison with the traditional aquacrop gis model aquacrop rs model generally performs better in improving the regional simulation accuracy for et by 5 26 and for yield by 35 72 in the region the improved aquacrop rs model may provide support for the accurate simulation of regional crop yield et and wpet and guidance for regional

11053,crop models are useful tools in investigating crop yield and water consumption and thus far they have been well developed in field applications moreover their regional applications have evolved from lumped models to distributed models by considering the spatial variation in soil climate crop and management measures to some extent with the advent of modernized and refined farming and water management the spatial variation of environment related initial and crop parameters of models should be appropriately reflected on this basis this study performs spatial inversion of sowing date maximum canopy coverage ccx and relative biomass brel based on the aquacrop gis model and by using remote sensing data these parameters are incorporated as independent spatial variables into the distributed aquacrop gis model to produce a remote sensing based distributed aquacrop rs crop model which will be validated with the corn data in the middle oasis of heihe river findings suggest that the initial condition sowing date and crop parameters ccx and brel exhibit considerable spatial variation the introduction of sowing date has a considerable influence on the simulation accuracy of evapotranspiration et and crop parameters ccx and brel have a considerable influence on yield simulation accuracy in comparison with the traditional aquacrop gis model the simulation accuracy of aquacrop rs model is generally improved by 5 26 in regional et and by 35 72 in regional yield keywords aquacrop rs maximum canopy coverage relative biomass sowing date 1 introduction crop models have been extensively developed and used as important tools in research on water consumption and crop yield due to their high repeatability and satisfactory performance in addressing issues such as long growing cycle susceptibility to natural factors and high costs associated with field experiments crop models are developed based on field experiments a traditional lumped model cannot adequately consider the spatial variation of crop growth environment and field management in large areas which introduces large errors to regional simulation results given the development of gis new advanced models have been established in regional applications gis provides a means to analyze the spatial variation of regional factors such as climate soil irrigation and crop type on this basis a family of spatially distributed models have been developed such as swap model which is a regional distributed hydrological model developed based on gis singh et al 2006 wesseling and feddes 2006 droogers et al 2000 and swap epic or swap wofost model which is a distributed agricultural hydrological model developed from the swap model jiang et al 2015 van dam et al 2006 meanwhile the hydrus epic model hao et al 2015 has been applied for the quantitative evaluation of the spatiotemporal variation in soil salinity and crop growth in hetao irrigation district to some extent these distributed models consider the spatial variation of the environment in which crops grow thereby improving the simulation accuracy of the distributed models however they have a strict requirement on model calibration and input data preparation for end users vanuytrecht et al 2014b which limits their application to a large extent given such a situation simple distributed models should be developed in view of the aforementioned requirement the international food and agriculture organization fao released a moisture based crop growth model called aquacrop in 2009 in this model the input data are intuitive specific and easy to obtain and the calibration is simple and can be used for multiple crops mabhaudhi et al 2014 bello and walker 2017 these merits have led to the rapid development of the model fao released aquacrop gis by merging the aquacrop model with gis software to promote the model for regional applications lorite et al 2013 the traditional aquacrop gis model for regional applications considers the spatial variation in soil climate crop and management measures li et al 2016 van gaelen et al 2017 the parameters of the model tend to vary with the change of natural environment in which crops grow however the model currently used in regional areas fails to consider this situation li et al 2016 only by the spatial correction for the parameters of crop models can the simulation results reflect more realistically the regional growth status of crops the aquacrop model describes the degree of fertility stress in the growth environment in terms of maximum canopy coverage ccx and relative biomass brel several studies geerts et al 2009 vanuytrecht et al 2014a have demonstrated that the model is sensitive to ccx and brel in addition sowing date is an important initial parameter and has a considerable effect on the crop growth process the extent of temperature stress which the crops will suffer during the growth stage varies with sowing dates and affects the development of the crop jahan et al 2018 humphreys et al 2016 apparent variation exists in ground elevation soil type climate and management factors in the middle oasis of the heihe river basin hrb which results in the spatial variation of ccx and brel which are the two factors that reflect the growth environment and optimum sowing date the development of remote sensing has provided an effective means for estimating the spatial distribution of such parameters hence this study utilizes remote sensing data in estimating the spatial distribution of the initial and crop parameters of the model to improve the regional applications of the aquacrop model thus this paper propose the aquacrop rs model which is a distributed crop moisture model based on remote sensing to obtain an accurate estimation of water consumption and yield of regional crops this study preliminarily analyzes the sensitivity of simulation results that is yield evapotranspiration et and water productivity wpet which is the ratio between yield and et on three parameters i e sowing date ccx and brel by using corn as the research subject remote sensing data are used in performing the inversion of sowing date ccx and brel which are used as independent spatial variables to construct the distributed aquacrop rs model the aquacrop rs performance is evaluated under four different scenarios in terms of prediction for yield et and water productivity in the middle oasis of the hrb scenario 1 is called aquacrop gis and comprises the constant sowing date and crop parameters scenario 2 is called aquacrop rs1 and comprises the spatially distributed sowing date and constant crop parameters scenario 3 is called aquacrop rs2 and comprises the spatially distributed crop parameters and constant sowing date and scenario 4 is called aquacrop rs3 and comprises the spatially distributed crop parameters and sowing date the simulation accuracies for the four scenarios are then compared and analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the research region this study focuses on the middle oasis of the hrb that mainly covers ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county according to the direction of flowing water namely from southeast to northwest this paper divided the middle oasis into the upstream ganzhou district middle reaches linze county and downstream gaotai county the location spans 38 52 n 39 52 n and 98 57 e 100 52 e fig 1 in this district which is dominated by typical continental arid and semi arid climate with annual average temperature of 6 8 c annual insolation duration of 3000 4000 h annual potential evaporation capacity of 1410 mm and average annual rainfall of only 140 mm the elevation varies between 1200 m and 3600 m and a considerable spatial variation is observed in temperature and soil type the total irrigated area is approximately 2 2 million mu 146 667 ha of which farmland accounts for approximately 85 the major crops include wheat corn barley vegetables melons and other cash crops among which corn and wheat account for approximately 51 and 17 of the planting area respectively all crops have only one cropping a year except for vegetables that have double cropping rotation irrigation is practiced however the irrigation schedule slightly varies from region to region based on the statistics from the irrigation management offices in the district 2 2 data acquisition and method field experiments were conducted in yingke irrigation district from april 2012 to october 2013 and the data were used to calibrate and validate the model han et al 2019 the sowing date irrigation schedule and yield in the middle oasis were surveyed and sampled in 2012 2015 and 2016 in which 14 30 and 148 sampling points were obtained respectively the spatial distribution of the sampling points in these years is shown in fig 2 the soil texture data of the middle oasis were obtained from the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences the soil types are mainly loam silt loam clay loam and sandy soil the soil hydraulic parameters were estimated with rosetta software on the basis of soil particle size composition schaap et al 2001 jiang et al 2015 wen et al 2017 the meteorological data were obtained from china meteorological data service center http data cma cn the dataset of land use in the hrb was obtained from the heihe planning data management center zhong et al 2014 2015 2 3 space inversion of sowing date sowing date is an important input parameter that affects the growth process subsequent pollination and filling and yield the spatiotemporal variation of the sowing date of corn with the elevation of the middle oasis is notable the remote sensing data of ndvi are spatiotemporally continuous and can reflect the vegetation growth well thereby providing a good means to investigate the crop phenology in the region in this study the sowing dates of corn in the middle oasis were estimated vyas et al 2013 with modnd1f 500 m 5 days data products for 2012 with doy of 81 158 2015 with doy of 89 139 and 2016 with doy of 91 136 as shown as follows http www gscloud cn 1 n d v i i c 1 n d v i i 1 n d v i i 0 n d v i i 2 n d v i i 1 0 t h e

the time of emergence which takes 0 13 in this text see section 3 2 1 the five day composite ndvi data can eliminate the influence of atmosphere and cloud to ensure that the acquired ndvi values are within the true value range to the large extent n d v i i 1 n d v i i and n d v i i 2 n d v i i 1 are greater than zero to ensure that the crop continuously grows over the selected period thereby removing non crop effect given the growth characteristics of the corn in heihe region and the research data the average emergence time is set to 10 days thus the sowing date is 10 days ahead of the date of emergence 2 4 space inversion of crop parameters in this paper the crop parameters of ccx and brel reflect the soil fertility stress in the aquacrop model the space inversion of crop parameters in the actual environment was performed by mod13q1 250 m 16 days https lpdaac usgs gov data the ccx and brel were brought into the crop files of the distributed model for different growth environments so that each crop file corresponded to a set of fertilizer stress coefficients which could compensate for the regional simulation error caused by the single crop parameters evaluated in the field experiment the maximum canopy coverage ccx refers to the maximum value that the canopy can reach in the optimal environment ndvi data was used to invert the canopy coverage during crop growth and the spatial distribution of ccx was obtained by the maximum value composite mvc referring to taking the maximum value from several images to regenerate a new image by use of arcgis see eq 2 the relative biomass brel refers to the ratio between the actual biomass under fertility stress and the latent biomass at the start of flowering the remote sensing product of cumulative net photosynthesis and the method of mvc were used to obtain spatial brel see eqs 3 5 additional information about the inversion technique can be found in the study of han et al 2019 2 c c x m a x c c 1 c

schedule and crop type in the middle oasis of the hrb this paper combined the inverted sowing date and crop parameters with aquacrop gis model to build a regional distributed aquacrop rs model fig 3 with the aid of gis the aforementioned spatial factors were intersected to produce simulation units whose natural crop and management attributes are spatially consistent ccx and brel were used to adjust the fertility stress coefficient in each unit 2 6 evaluation of the model the model performance was evaluated in terms of normalized root mean square error nrmse root mean square error rmse

oj denotes the remote sensing data and pi denotes the simulated value of aquacrop gis model and pi denotes the simulated value of aquacrop rs model described below in this paper a decreased dare indicates a decreasing relative error and thus a high simulation accuracy of the region by the corresponding model an increased dare denotes an increasing relative error and thus a low simulation accuracy of the region by the corresponding model and an unchanged dare indicates an unchanged relative error and thus an unchanged simulation accuracy of the region by the corresponding model 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis a number of simulation scenarios were performed in which brel was set as 50 60 70 80 and 90 to evaluate the sensitivity of crop yield et and wpet to the major parameters of aquacrop the results are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a c brel varies between 50 and 80 and has a considerable effect on yield et and wpet which all tend to increase with brel this result is consistent with the findings of akumaga et al 2017 crop yield et and wpet are no longer sensitive to brel when they are greater than 80 it shows that the wpet decreases with the increase of ccx fig 4 c when ccx varies between 50 and 70 which is in contrary to the effect of ccx on et fig 4 b this finding suggests that excessive growth of crop canopy is detrimental to crop yield and wpet this paper analyzed the effect of sowing date on crop yield wpet and et during the cycle in ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county with other conditions kept constant the results are shown in fig 4 d f from the figures the yield tends to initially increase and then stabilizes with the delay of sowing date the yield starts to reach maximum in linze county and ganzhou district when sowing occurs on the 92nd 97th day of the year to obtain a maximum yield the sowing date in gaotai county should be 5 days ahead of that in linze county and ganzhou district due to its low elevation and high average annual temperature the et of growing cycle has an opposite trend to that of wpet when the sowing date is delayed fig 4 e f the wpet in all three districts increases with the sowing date and reaches the maximum when the sowing occurs between the 107th and 112th day of the year the crop may experience different temperature stresses which in turn will influence pollination and filling thus the effect of the same sowing date on yield and wpet slightly varies from area to area due to different meteorological conditions 3 2 spatial distribution of sowing date 3 2 1 spatial inversion accuracy of sowing date to obtain the threshold of ndvi at emergence 30 points in the corn field were uniformly selected in 2012 2015 and 2016 from the middle oasis of the hrb and the average changing trend of ndvi at the initial stage is shown in fig 5 on the basis of the three year ndvi changing trend in the district this paper assumed the ndvi value to be 0 13 at emergence the inversion values and observations of the sowing date in 2012 2015 and 2016 for this district were compared and analyzed the results are shown in fig 6 a c and table 1 statistics show that the estimation error of sowing date within 5 days accounts for 64 69 and 68 of the sampling points and the maximum errors are 10 days 10 days and 10 days for 2012 2015 and 2016 respectively the rmse is approximately 5 days and the mae is approximately 4 days of sowing date the inversion accuracy of 2015 is the highest and that of 2012 is the lowest which can be attributed to the small size of samples and the restriction of sampled areas for 2012 sakamoto et al 2005 and vyas et al 2013 estimated the sowing date with modis and insat ccd data based on the characteristics of crops under different phenomena 3 2 2 spatial distribution of sowing date the spatial distributions of the sowing date for corn in 2012 and 2015 in the middle oasis of the hrb are shown in fig 7 the sowing date is obviously spatial and temporal the spatial variation for 2015 is obvious that is the sowing date in the upper reaches of the district is late meanwhile the sowing date is generally early in the downstream areas except for the areas along the mountains and xinba irrigation district where the sowing date is late due to the delayed warming up of climate for its high altitudes in addition the temperature in 2015 prior to the sowing date is generally higher and the sowing date is generally earlier in 2015 than in 2012 by comparing the daily maximum temperature and daily minimum temperature in the middle oasis for 2012 and 2015 statistics show that the sowing date of corn in 2012 is mostly distributed between april 11 and april 21 which accounts for 88 for 2015 the sowing date began on march 25 in which the sowing date is regularly distributed throughout the period 3 3 spatial distribution of crop parameters ccx and brel 3 3 1 spatial distribution of maximum canopy coverage ccx the growth status of corn is spatial due to the combined effect of environment and human activities which can be described by the spatial distribution of the maximum canopy coverage remote sensing data were used to invert the maximum canopy coverage of corn in 2012 and 2015 in the middle oasis of the hrb the results were grouped in four levels based on the classification criteria for aquacrop proposed by fao fig 8 the comparison of the spatial distribution of ccx for 2012 and 2015 suggests that the spatial variation is more pronounced in 2015 than in 2012 however the ccx is generally higher in 2012 compared with 2015 statistics show that the proportion of ccx between 80 and 89 is approximately around 60 in 2012 and 2015 however the proportion of ccx larger than 90 in 2012 and 2015 is 28 and 9 respectively in addition the ccx is higher in the heihe irrigation district than that along the mountains which is largely related to the different temperature water supply and soil fertility to simplify the calculation the proportions of ccx at each level are separately counted and the weighted average is used as the comprehensive index for the level in the simulation statistics show that the comprehensive value of each level and the corresponding proportion are 55 accounting for 1 75 accounting for 7 86 accounting for 64 and 91 accounting for 28 in 2015 the comprehensive value and corresponding proportion are 54 accounting for 8 74 accounting for 26 85 accounting for 59 and 91 accounting for 7 3 3 2 spatial distribution of relative biomass brel the spatial distribution of soil fertility is irregular throughout the district due to the influence of human activities and soil texture thereby leading to the spatial variation of energy storage during the vegetative growth stage of crops which can be indirectly reflected by brel in the aquacrop model remote sensing data were used to invert the relative biomass brel of corn in the middle oasis in 2012 and 2015 fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of this parameter in which brel in the district is lower but more spatially obvious for 2012 than for 2015 and exhibits an overall decreasing pattern from upstream to downstream the soil type of this district shows that the downstream areas are mainly sandy soil in which its texture is relatively poor in water and fertilizer retention and imposes a considerable restriction on crop growth the relative biomass brel for 2015 is generally high but without remarkable spatial regularity which is caused by the higher temperature in 2015 than in 2012 wang et al 2018 another reason might be the additional human interventions in the production process such as the improvement of field management to simplify the calculation the previously described method for evaluating the comprehensive value of ccx is followed to obtain the comprehensive values of brel for different levels in 2012 and 2015 for 2012 the values and corresponding percentages are 71 accounting for 23 79 accounting for 22 and 84 accounting for 32 89 accounting for 21 and 100 accounting for 22 for 2015 the results are 69 accounting for 0 79 accounting for 1 85 accounting for 2 95 accounting for 44 and 100 accounting for 53 3 4 simulation accuracy analysis of distributed aquacrop rs model 3 4 1 simulation accuracy analysis of regional et the sum of the et of corn from may to august 2012 for the four scenarios were compared with the monthly et data with a resolution of 1000 m for the middle oasis to estimate the effects of input parameters on the simulation accuracy of the distributed model wu et al 2012 liu et al 2011 wesseling and feddes 2006 which was estimated by the latest etwatch model based on multi source remote sensing data the results are shown in table 2 from the table the simulation accuracies are improved by 21 5 and 26 for the second third and fourth scenarios relative to the first scenario respectively the areas in the middle oasis in which the simulation accuracy changed were counted statistics show that the areas with improved and worsened simulation accuracies from the simulation results of aquacrop rs1 account for 85 and 15 those of aquacrop rs2 account for 87 and 8 and those of aquacrop rs3 account for 85 and 15 respectively in relation to those of aquacrop gis the three scenarios of aquacrop rs1 aquacrop rs2 and aquacrop rs3 do not differ considerably from one another in terms of the percentage of the area in which the simulation accuracy improved however all registered areas increased with improved simulation accuracy the introduction of spatial sowing date had a considerable effect on the simulation accuracy and regional effect on the et in the region for the aquacrop rs model 3 4 2 simulation accuracy analysis on regional yield the corn yields for 2015 as gathered in the survey in the middle oasis were divided into low 13 103 kg ha medium 15 103 kg ha and high 15 103 kg ha yield groups comparisons were made with the yield of the four scenarios in the region for the year 2015 and the results are shown in table 3 from the table the introduction of spatial sowing date in the aquacrop rs1 model has a small effect on yield simulation accuracy however the aquacrop rs2 model which incorporates spatial crop parameters has a considerable improvement by 34 68 in yield simulation accuracy in view of the simulation accuracy of aquacrop rs3 on yield a general improvement in accuracy by 35 72 spatial crop parameters play an important role in improving the regional simulation accuracy of yield in the aquacrop rs model relative biomass brel is a characteristic indicator of soil fertility and has a direct effect on crop yield thus crop parameters especially brel have a considerable effect on yield when sowing date and crop parameters are considered for their effect on the simulation accuracy of the model however the introduction of distributed sowing date has a small effect on yield simulation accuracy in the model the spatial distribution of sampled points for regional yield shows that these points are mostly located in the heihe irrigation district of the middle oasis and no data from the irrigation areas along the mountains are available for comparison this condition can be attributed to the fact that the temperature in the heihe irrigation district cannot produce a restrictive effect on the yield waha et al 2013 hence the introduction of sowing date in the distributed model has a minimal effect on the simulation accuracy of yield therefore balanced consideration should be provided to the condition of temperature and rainfall to improve the regional simulation accuracy and the sowing date should be optimized when utilizing a distributed crop model to simulate the regional growth of crop under changing climates in the future in conclusion a distributed model that only considers the traditional factors such as soil properties weather and irrigation is prone to produce large errors in regional simulations and is unable to account for the variation in regional crop production accurately therefore in the absence of regional data the improved distributed model in this study can accurately simulate the actual production in the region 3 5 regional simulation of the distributed model based on remote sensing the spatial distribution of yield and wpet for corn in the middle oasis of the hrb simulated by aquacrop rs3 in 2012 and 2015 is shown in fig 10 from the figure the spatiotemporal variation of yield and wpet is obvious throughout the middle oasis for 2015 the yield is generally above 11 3 103 kg ha and wpet concentrates approximately 1 9 2 3 kg m3 for 2012 the yield shows a notable decreasing pattern from upstream to downstream through the middle oasis district and wpet is mostly distributed between 1 4 kg m3 and 2 0 kg m3 the yield and wpet are generally higher in 2015 than that in 2012 the meteorological data of 2012 and 2015 show that the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in the middle oasis are approximately 1 c higher in 2015 than in 2012 wang et al 2017 and abebe et al 2016 indicated that the temperature affected yield by acting on phenology growth rate photosynthesis and respiration wang et al 2018 reported that the rise in temperature not exceeding 1 c resulted in an increasing trend in corn yield the comparison of the spatial distribution of yield and sowing date in the district shows that the high yield in 2015 is related to the early sowing date in the year to some extent bastidas et al 2008 the sowing date is earlier in 2015 than in 2012 in the district especially in the middle and lower reaches of the middle oasis and the sowing date in 2015 is 10 days earlier on average than in 2012 with the average cycle of 6 days longer in 2015 than in 2012 the analysis on temperature irrigation volume and soil texture for 2012 and 2015 in the middle oasis suggests that the spatiotemporal variation in yield and wpet is caused by the combined effect of the three factors i e sowing date ccx and brel the wpet is spatiotemporally irregular and variational which suggests large room for improvement in the middle oasis 4 conclusions the combination of crop model gis and remote sensing promotes the regional application of point models the parameters of the aquacrop model namely sowing date ccx and brel have varied effects on yield et and wpet in the middle oasis of the hrb particularly brel has a considerable effect on yield et and wpet which all increase with brel however ccx has a more considerable effect on et and wpet which increase and decrease with the increase of ccx respectively the effect of sowing date on crop yield et and wpet also show different trends in view of the influences of the parameters on simulation results remote sensing data are used to develop the spatial distribution of sowing date ccx and brel for the aquacrop model the findings indicate that sowing date ccx and brel in the middle oasis have considerable spatial variation particularly the sowing date varies between 79th day and 122th day at different altitudes in the district on the basis of previous studies the present work improves the regional application of the aquacrop model by combining remote sensing data a new and complete regional distributed aquacrop rs model is constructed by combining the initial parameter of sowing date and crop parameters of ccx and brel in comparison with the traditional aquacrop gis model aquacrop rs model generally performs better in improving the regional simulation accuracy for et by 5 26 and for yield by 35 72 in the region the improved aquacrop rs model may provide support for the accurate simulation of regional crop yield et and wpet and guidance for regional

11054,reclaimed water rw can alleviate agricultural water scarcity all around the year with the quality factor but its use is often questioned by farmers due to agronomic concerns in this study we selected three areas and five different representative crops muskmelon lettuce lemon peach and tomato in the southeast of spain to study the impact of the irrigation with rw on i the supply of essential nutrients ii the effect of water salinity on the crop yield iii the crop toxicity to cl na and b ions iv the soil sodicity risk and v the economic inflow outflow analysis the results evidenced that rw could supply a large part of the crop nutrient requirements particularly in the selected woody crops although temporal mismatches between crop nutrient requirements and nutrients in the water supplies should be considered when preparing fertigation plan the electrical conductivity ecw of the rws could lead to yield reductions from 0 in muskmelon to 23 2 in peach despite this only chlorosis risk in lemon and peach and toxicity effects of na and b in lemon trees could be envisaged in addition soil sodicity risks were low for most of the rws the economic inflow outflow balance justified the fertigation with rw in muskmelon lettuce and lemon however for peach and tomato despite the economic savings associated to the fertigation the high yield reduction due to the ecw made less viable the irrigation with rw overall the study shows that fertigation accounting for rw nutrients can substantially save fertilizers costs while agronomical risks when present can be controlled with irrigation management strategies for several crops in se spain keywords fertigation essential nutrients phytotoxic elements economic savings circular economy 1 introduction southeastern spain is a semiarid agricultural region where lack of fresh water resources forces farmers to use non conventional water such as reclaimed water rw and desalinated seawater martinez alvarez et al 2017 in spain rw used for irrigation is water that has been treated in waste water treatment plants wwtps to fulfil the minimum water quality requirements regulated in spain by the 1620 2007 royal decree the use of rw for irrigation is often questioned due to its high concentration of salts and heavy metals and the presence of viruses and bacteria which can result in undesirable effects in soils and plants as well as jeopardize agricultural sustainability qadir et al 2010 chen et al 2011 pedrero et al 2018 moreover the use of rw for irrigation can lead to the concentration of heavy metals troldborg et al 2017 and the presence of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps in the edible parts of crops paranychianakis et al 2015 although the majority of individual ppcps represent minimal risk to human health prosser and sibley 2015 however rw alleviates agricultural water scarcity all around the year allowing farmers to continue with their agricultural practices maestre valero et al 2016 and it enables nutrient recovery for crops and decreases disposal costs for the wwtps haruvy 2006 li et al 2015 maestre valero et al 2019 in the region of murcia southeastern spain there are 92 wwtps that produce on average 110 hm3 year almost 100 of this treated effluent is used for irrigation which represents about 10 of the annual renewable resources for irrigation esamur 2018 in addition the spanish policy polluter pays makes it free of charge for farmers except for local distribution costs mounzer et al 2013 despite the substantial amount of nutrients available for crops in rw such as nitrates phosphates potassium calcium and magnesium most farmers do not adapt the fertilizer doses to the quality of the water used for irrigation in this line several scientific studies have evaluated the medium to long term viability of using rw to irrigate several crops like grapefruit romero trigueros et al 2014 and mandarin orchards pedrero et al 2016 without considering the nutrients already present in the irrigation water in their fertigation plans although they did not consider the extra nutrients provided by rw in the fertigation programs they stated that rw could have provided up to 9 2 of n 4 5 of p and more than 100 of the trees k requirements implying a significant reduction of the fertilizer application and its associated costs maurer and davies 1993 pedrero et al 2018 studied the effects of rw on nectarines quality and yield in the region of apulia southern italy even though their fertigation programs discarded nutrients available in the irrigation water they indicated that rw could have provided 4 kg no3 ha year 44 kg po4 3 ha year 84 kg k ha year 300 kg ca ha year 60 kg mg ha year and 360 kg so4 2 ha year furthermore they highlighted that these quantities should have been considered in the fertigation plans to avoid plant injuries specific ion toxicities interactions and soil and groundwater pollution grattan and grieve 1998 in fact some consequences of not adapting the fertigation programs to the input water quality have been reported for instance morgan et al 2008 and pedrero and alarcón 2009 observed high concentrations of mg and b in citrus irrigated with rw and toxicity linked to the excess of some micronutrients b cu ni and zn was reported in citrus and brassica aucejo et al 1997 kalavrouziotis et al 2008 pedrero et al 2010 most agronomical studies involving irrigation with rw have focused on the study of the yield and the fruit quality however to our knowledge only few studies have addressed the adaptation of fertigation programs to a specific water quality maurer and davis 1995 compared the effects of canal water and rw on the growth yield and fruit quality of a grapefruit orchard in florida they observed that trees receiving rw with adjusted substantially lower fertilizer rates were more vigorous and produced higher yields than those receiving canal water paranychianakis et al 2006 irrigated a grapevine orchard with rw without applying fertilizers and found that the needs for p k mg and fe were met without the addition of commercial fertilizers nevertheless they noted that special attention should be paid to the overload of p and k in recycled effluents to limit potential adverse impacts on the environment and on the grapevine performance from the economic perspective papadopoulos et al 2009 found a total cost reduction of 245 ha year while maintaining the grain yield in paddy fields of sindos greece as a result of adapting fertigation to rw considering the growing evidence of the agronomic environmental and economic implications of the adaptation of the fertigation programs to rw in this study we provide a comprehensive assessment of i the impact of accounting for essential nutrients present in the irrigation water on the fertigation programs ii the effect of water salinity on the crop yield iii the crop toxicity to cl na and b iv the soil sodicity risk and v the potential economic savings of adapting fertigation to rw quality in three agricultural areas of southeastern spain 2 materials and methods 2 1 areas selected for the study three representative agricultural areas of the region of murcia spain were selected for the study fig 1 shows the location and the extension of the selected areas with their corresponding wwtps and the crops studied in each area the area 1 corresponds to campo de cartagena irrigation district where the coastal wwtps of torre pacheco roldan and la union provide an annual rw volume of 2 83 hm3 for agriculture the area 2 is the norwest of the segura river and receives 1 70 hm3 of rw per year from the inland wwtps of caravaca de la cruz el moralejo and valentin finally the area 3 corresponds to mazarron which gets rw from the coastal wwtps of mazarron 0 56 hm3 year wastewater in torre pacheco roldan la union and caravaca de la cruz wwtps is treated by active sludge prolonged aeration coagulation flocculation filtration and ultraviolet disinfection wastewater in el moralejo and valentin wwtps is treated by active sludge and prolonged aeration wastewater in mazarron wwtp is treated by aerated storage esamur 2018 all the wwtps selected fulfilled the established microbiological minimum requirements for helminth eggs and escherichia coli regulated in spain by the 1620 2007 royal decree the five crops selected in areas 1 3 muskmelon lettuce iceberg ic lettuce little gem lg and lemon peach and tomato respectively currently represent the 35 of the irrigated area in the region of murcia esyrce 2017 the chemical properties of the rw of all wwtps considered in this study and of the conventional fresh water fw source available in se spain are summarized in table 1 2 2 crops water and fertilizer requirements table 2 presents the fertilizer and irrigation requirements of the selected crops the irrigation water volume applied to each crop was calculated following penman monteith methodology with their specific crop coefficients kc allen et al 1998 daily meteorological data from local weather stations and kc were collected for crop evapotranspiration calculation in the areas of study siar 2019 the fertilizers needs for each crop were consulted in scientific literature as indicated in table 2 table 3 shows the purity and the unitary cost of the commercial fertilizers used to meet the fertilization requirements presented in table 2 note that the selected fertilizers were those with high water solubility and high purity to prevent irrigation network clogging and with low salt index to avoid unnecessary increases in salinity 2 3 determination of the fertilizer doses in order to determine the amount of fertilizers to apply to each crop the quantities recommended in the literature table 2 and the nutrients provided by the different water resources i e fw and rw were considered table 1 the following steps which correspond to the method proposed by alarcón 2013 were taken to determine the amount of fertilizers 1 acidification of the nutrient solution and p application first when possible the hco3 present in the irrigation water is neutralized up to 0 5 mmol l with h3po4 then if the p requirements are fulfilled before achieving 0 5 mmol l of hco3 hno3 is used to reach that threshold and provide part of the n requirements 2 satisfying p needs second if the p requirements are not fulfilled with h3po4 the remaining amount of p is provided by nh4h2po4 or kh2po4 the latter also supplies extra n or k respectively 3 satisfying ca needs third when the irrigation water does not contain enough ca to fulfill the crop requirements ca no3 2 is added to provide ca and n 4 satisfying k needs fourth k is delivered with kno3 which also supplies n unless n is fulfilled before satisfying the k requirements and then k2so4 is applied 5 satisfying n needs fifth if n needs are not met in the previous steps nh4no3 is supplied 6 satisfying mg needs sixth only when the irrigation water does not contain enough mg to fulfill the crop requirements mg no3 2 or mgso4 are considered 7 satisfying micronutrient needs seventh and last a concentration of 15 mg l of micronutrients solution is applied 2 4 evaluation of agronomic risks the main agronomic concerns of irrigating with rw considered in this study were the effect of high salinity the toxicity risk and the mid long term soil sodicity firstly the effect of the salinity on the crop yield was estimated with a response function characterized by a salinity threshold value below which the yield is unaffected and above which the yield decreases linearly with salinity maas and hoffman 1977 table 4 presents the model and the threshold slope values for the selected crops ayers and westcot 1985 secondly the crop toxicity risk due to high concentrations of cl na and b was analyzed based on their maximum permissible concentrations to avoid toxicity problems in the selected crops table 5 it should be noted that for seasonal crops specific ion effects are minimal and osmotic effects predominate however woody crops can accumulate cl na and b up to toxic levels which cause leaf burn necrosis and defoliation maas and grattan 1999 this is the reason why there are some missing values in table 5 as they have not been listed in literature finally the mid long term soil sodicity hazard was analyzed by studying the relation between the sodium adsorption rate sar and the ecw ayers and westcot 1985 2 5 economic assessment two water scenarios based on the source of irrigation water are compared in our analysis 1 scenario fw irrigation with 100 of fw with a cost of 0 30 m3 and 2 scenario rw irrigation with 100 of rw with a cost of 0 031 m3 maestre valero et al 2016 the potential savings of adapting fertigation to irrigation water were evaluated accounting for the price and chemical properties of each water source the inputs considered for the analysis were the maximum fruit production without agronomic restrictions muskmelon 39 400 kg ha lettuce ic 26 000 kg ha lettuce lg 42 800 kg ha lemon 24 900 kg ha peach 23 125 kg ha tomato 119 800 kg ha ecrea 2016 the yield losses associated to water salinity fig 3 and the sale prices in origin published by the government of region of murcia carm 2018 muskmelon 0 30 kg lettuce ic 0 15 unit lettuce lg 0 08 unit lemon 0 30 kg peach 0 60 kg tomato 0 50 kg the outflows were calculated based on the amount of irrigation water and fertilizers applied in each scenario and their costs tables 2 and 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 essential nutrient analysis table 6 shows the amount of fertilizers applied for the different cases of study and irrigation water scenarios in fig 2 the n p2o5 k2o cao and mgo provided by the fw and the rw locally available in each studied area have been compared to the nutrient requirements per cycle and per cycle stage for each studied crop muskmelon lettuce ic and lg tomato peach and lemon in the per cycle stage cases crop cycles have been divided in four phases as indicated in the table 7 a quick look to fig 2a makes apparent that the irrigation water either fw or rw can provide enough ca and mg while the addition of fertilizers is needed for n p and k however as there are higher satisfaction values for rw lower fertilizers doses are required particularly for the case of k2o another noticeable aspect is the rw higher satisfaction rates for woody crops fig 2b shows how nutrient requirements vary for each phase of the crop and how the temporal fluctuation of rw composition often leads to temporal nutritional mismatches between plat demand and water supply a clear example of this is the mgo supplied by rw in tomato that although it can fully cover the mgo requirements at a cycle scale it can only cover 47 2 and 83 7 in stages 2 and 3 respectively fig 2 the rw produced at the wwtps had higher hco3 h2po4 no3 and k concentration than the fw table 1 in all the cases except for the tomato the addition of h3po4 to neutralize part of the hco3 was enough to supply the crop phosphorus requirements such a high concentration of po4 3 led to a slight reduction in the amount of h3po4 needed that ranged from 61 4 in the case of lettuce ic to 0 in tomato the rw might supply up to 40 4 of the total p2o5 requirements for the peach whereas only up to 12 3 for lemon fig 2 and from 2 9 to 7 4 for the rest of crops for woody crops almost all n requirements were provided by hno3 although this latter was not enough to reduce hco3 up to 0 5 mmol l for muskmelon lettuce and tomato the application of hno3 was enough to reduce hco3 up to 0 5 mmol l but insufficient to supply the total crops n requirements rw can supply up to 31 1 of the total n requirements for the peach and up 12 9 for lemon however for the rest of crops lower satisfaction percentages were observed i e from 2 7 8 9 of total n requirements fig 2 concerning the application of k2o for muskmelon lettuce ic lettuce lg and tomato the use of rw allows reductions of 31 0 33 6 27 6 and 18 1 in the application of k2o respectively such reductions increased up to 48 6 in the case of peach and more than 100 in the case of lemon fig 2 our results are in accordance with pedrero et al 2016 who reported that irrigating with rw can provide more than 100 of citrus trees k requirements and with those by maestre valero et al 2019 who showed that about 30 of lettuce k2o requirements may come from the rw 3 2 effect of water salinity on crop yield fig 3 presents the application of the salinity model shown in table 4 for the study crops and the ecw of the different rws table 1 the ecw values ranged from 1 2 ds m observed in la union to 3 0 ds m in mazarron wwtp lettuce lemon and peach are sensible to salinity maas and grattan 1999 with ecw thresholds between 0 9 1 1 ds m while muskmelon and tomato are more resistant to salinity with ecw thresholds of 1 5 and 1 7 ds m respectively table 4 maas and grattan 1999 consequently since ecw of the rw produced at the wwtps ranged between 1 2 and 3 0 ds m table 1 yield reductions can be expected in most crops for the case of mazarron wwtp rw with high ecw significant yield reductions of 60 48 44 19 and 16 can be expected for peach lemon lettuce tomato and muskmelon respectively in order to avoid such yield reductions the adequate blending of rw with fw in collective or individual on farm ponds can enable to lower ecw in the irrigation water benefiting crop yields and even saving water since the supplementary amount of irrigation water for salts leaching can be significantly reduced mansour et al 2016 martínez alvarez et al 2017 3 3 crops toxicity by cl na and b soil and crops are directly exposed to toxicity by cl na and b in the case of the plants their accumulation over time above certain thresholds table 5 may harm tissues and negatively affect metabolic processes resulting in yield reductions grattan et al 2015 further information regarding the toxicity effects of these ions can be found in martinez alvarez et al 2017 one important aspect to consider is that tolerances vary among rootstocks due to differences in their ability to absorb and transport potentially toxic elements to their shoots levy and syvertsen 2004 this is the case of citrus where up to three different tolerances for cl in the irrigation water which ranged from 152 to 350 mg l have been reported table 5 in contrast in the case of seasonal crops muskmelon lettuce and tomato in this study expected specific ion effects are minimum due to the short cycle duration that prevents their accumulation over the toxic limits maas and grattan 1999 here we have compared ion toxicity thresholds table 5 with cl na and b concentrations in the rw at each wwtp table 1 in the case of cl the concentration in the rw ranged between 200 2 and 320 3 mg l only mazarron rw considerably exceeded this value reaching 763 7 mg l table 1 posing chlorosis risks for lemon and peach crops of toxicity thresholds for b have been only found in soil water except for tomato table 5 although relationships between b concentration in the irrigation water and in the soil solution are still poorly understood grattan et al 2015 suggested that the limits for orange trees can be increased over the long term from 0 3 0 5 mg l in the irrigation water to 0 5 0 75 mg l in the soil solution i e an increase between 50 and 66 assuming the later only negative effects are then expected in lemon orchards since maximum b concentration in soil water was established at 0 5 mg l in the case of na only a toxicity threshold has been found for lemon in the soil solution 115 mg l and as in the case of b no references have been found in irrigation water table 5 if assumptions like b are considered na in the soil water would be up to 60 higher than that in the irrigation water since na concentration in the rw in the study wwtps ranged between 146 3 and 252 5 mg l again only mazarron rw exceeded this value reaching 435 0 mg l table 1 na toxicity should only be a risk for lemon trees 3 4 soil sodicity risk high concentrations of na can also damage the soil physical properties causing clay dispersion which leads to i the structural collapse of soil aggregates ii decreased soil hydraulic conductivity iii erosion problems iv soil compaction v and decreased soil aeration mandal et al 2008 muyen et al 2011 all the study wwtps produced rw with large amounts of na and elevated sar values substantially higher than those observed in fw table 1 however the combination of sar and ecw of each wwtp rw mostly showed no sodicity risks fig 4 ayers and wetscot 1985 only rws from roldan and la union wwtps in area 1 presented slight to moderate sodicity risk that could cause in the medium to long term a drop in the soil infiltration rate ayers and wetscot 1985 as ecw in these two wwtps was not too high to produce significant yield reductions fig 3 mitigating sodicity risks could be tackled by adjusting the fertigation programs increasing the amount of ca and mg can displace na from the soil exchange complex and reduce the sar another possible option is to mitigate the soil sodicity risk by blending rw with other water resources of better quality in any case seasonal soil monitoring is strongly encouraged to detect any deterioration of the soil structure when rw is used for crop irrigation especially in soils with high clay content where the sodicity hazard may be more relevant martinez alvarez et al 2017 3 5 economic assessment table 8 shows for the study water scenarios the water cost and the income derived from the sale of the fruit the results showed that the fertigation with rw could potentially save from 436 ha cycle 37 2 of the fertigation with fw cost in the case of lettuce lg to 2 050 ha year 68 6 of the fertigation with fw cost in the case of peach table 8 however the yield losses due to the salinity of the rws led to notable economic losses that ranged from 29 5 in the case of peach 3 221 ha year to 0 in the case of muskmelon despite this the inflow outflow balance for muskmelon lettuce ic and lg and lemon was positive in the rw scenario making the irrigation with rw in the study area more viable that the fertigation with fw this was not the case for peach where yield reduction was 23 2 and for tomato where yield reduction was 19 1 offsetting any fertilization savings 4 conclusions this study has evidenced the possible agronomic and economic impacts of considering the nutritional value of reclaimed water rw for irrigation in southeast of spain firstly the study confirms that rw can supply a large part of the nutrient crop requirements especially in the case of woody crops however each crop phase must be analyzed independently due to temporal mismatches between the crops nutrient requirements and the nutrients supplied by water secondly the high concentration of cl na and b in the rw might produce chlorosis in lemon and peach and toxicity effects by na and b in lemon thirdly the relationship between the sodium adsorption rate and the electrical conductivity of the water ecw has shown no sodicity risk for most of the rws fourtly the high salinity of the rws compared to the fw led in most of the selected crops except muskmelon to considerable yield reductions in fact the analysis of the inflow outflow balance which considers both the use of fertilizers and the yield losses associated to water salinity has revealed the feasibility of the fertigation with rw only for muskmelon lettuce iceberg and little gem and lemon nonetheless for peach and tomato the high yield reduction associated to the ecw makes less viable the irrigation with rw despite the economic savings

to be a good option from agronomical and economic perspectives for most crops in se spain the appropriate irrigation and soil management strategies such as salt leaching the introduction of calcium amendments or the mix with other conventional sources of water quality when sodicity is a problem are recommended in addition edible parts of rw irrigated crops must not pose any microbiological and

11054,reclaimed water rw can alleviate agricultural water scarcity all around the year with the quality factor but its use is often questioned by farmers due to agronomic concerns in this study we selected three areas and five different representative crops muskmelon lettuce lemon peach and tomato in the southeast of spain to study the impact of the irrigation with rw on i the supply of essential nutrients ii the effect of water salinity on the crop yield iii the crop toxicity to cl na and b ions iv the soil sodicity risk and v the economic inflow outflow analysis the results evidenced that rw could supply a large part of the crop nutrient requirements particularly in the selected woody crops although temporal mismatches between crop nutrient requirements and nutrients in the water supplies should be considered when preparing fertigation plan the electrical conductivity ecw of the rws could lead to yield reductions from 0 in muskmelon to 23 2 in peach despite this only chlorosis risk in lemon and peach and toxicity effects of na and b in lemon trees could be envisaged in addition soil sodicity risks were low for most of the rws the economic inflow outflow balance justified the fertigation with rw in muskmelon lettuce and lemon however for peach and tomato despite the economic savings associated to the fertigation the high yield reduction due to the ecw made less viable the irrigation with rw overall the study shows that fertigation accounting for rw nutrients can substantially save fertilizers costs while agronomical risks when present can be controlled with irrigation management strategies for several crops in se spain keywords fertigation essential nutrients phytotoxic elements economic savings circular economy 1 introduction southeastern spain is a semiarid agricultural region where lack of fresh water resources forces farmers to use non conventional water such as reclaimed water rw and desalinated seawater martinez alvarez et al 2017 in spain rw used for irrigation is water that has been treated in waste water treatment plants wwtps to fulfil the minimum water quality requirements regulated in spain by the 1620 2007 royal decree the use of rw for irrigation is often questioned due to its high concentration of salts and heavy metals and the presence of viruses and bacteria which can result in undesirable effects in soils and plants as well as jeopardize agricultural sustainability qadir et al 2010 chen et al 2011 pedrero et al 2018 moreover the use of rw for irrigation can lead to the concentration of heavy metals troldborg et al 2017 and the presence of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps in the edible parts of crops paranychianakis et al 2015 although the majority of individual ppcps represent minimal risk to human health prosser and sibley 2015 however rw alleviates agricultural water scarcity all around the year allowing farmers to continue with their agricultural practices maestre valero et al 2016 and it enables nutrient recovery for crops and decreases disposal costs for the wwtps haruvy 2006 li et al 2015 maestre valero et al 2019 in the region of murcia southeastern spain there are 92 wwtps that produce on average 110 hm3 year almost 100 of this treated effluent is used for irrigation which represents about 10 of the annual renewable resources for irrigation esamur 2018 in addition the spanish policy polluter pays makes it free of charge for farmers except for local distribution costs mounzer et al 2013 despite the substantial amount of nutrients available for crops in rw such as nitrates phosphates potassium calcium and magnesium most farmers do not adapt the fertilizer doses to the quality of the water used for irrigation in this line several scientific studies have evaluated the medium to long term viability of using rw to irrigate several crops like grapefruit romero trigueros et al 2014 and mandarin orchards pedrero et al 2016 without considering the nutrients already present in the irrigation water in their fertigation plans although they did not consider the extra nutrients provided by rw in the fertigation programs they stated that rw could have provided up to 9 2 of n 4 5 of p and more than 100 of the trees k requirements implying a significant reduction of the fertilizer application and its associated costs maurer and davies 1993 pedrero et al 2018 studied the effects of rw on nectarines quality and yield in the region of apulia southern italy even though their fertigation programs discarded nutrients available in the irrigation water they indicated that rw could have provided 4 kg no3 ha year 44 kg po4 3 ha year 84 kg k ha year 300 kg ca ha year 60 kg mg ha year and 360 kg so4 2 ha year furthermore they highlighted that these quantities should have been considered in the fertigation plans to avoid plant injuries specific ion toxicities interactions and soil and groundwater pollution grattan and grieve 1998 in fact some consequences of not adapting the fertigation programs to the input water quality have been reported for instance morgan et al 2008 and pedrero and alarcón 2009 observed high concentrations of mg and b in citrus irrigated with rw and toxicity linked to the excess of some micronutrients b cu ni and zn was reported in citrus and brassica aucejo et al 1997 kalavrouziotis et al 2008 pedrero et al 2010 most agronomical studies involving irrigation with rw have focused on the study of the yield and the fruit quality however to our knowledge only few studies have addressed the adaptation of fertigation programs to a specific water quality maurer and davis 1995 compared the effects of canal water and rw on the growth yield and fruit quality of a grapefruit orchard in florida they observed that trees receiving rw with adjusted substantially lower fertilizer rates were more vigorous and produced higher yields than those receiving canal water paranychianakis et al 2006 irrigated a grapevine orchard with rw without applying fertilizers and found that the needs for p k mg and fe were met without the addition of commercial fertilizers nevertheless they noted that special attention should be paid to the overload of p and k in recycled effluents to limit potential adverse impacts on the environment and on the grapevine performance from the economic perspective papadopoulos et al 2009 found a total cost reduction of 245 ha year while maintaining the grain yield in paddy fields of sindos greece as a result of adapting fertigation to rw considering the growing evidence of the agronomic environmental and economic implications of the adaptation of the fertigation programs to rw in this study we provide a comprehensive assessment of i the impact of accounting for essential nutrients present in the irrigation water on the fertigation programs ii the effect of water salinity on the crop yield iii the crop toxicity to cl na and b iv the soil sodicity risk and v the potential economic savings of adapting fertigation to rw quality in three agricultural areas of southeastern spain 2 materials and methods 2 1 areas selected for the study three representative agricultural areas of the region of murcia spain were selected for the study fig 1 shows the location and the extension of the selected areas with their corresponding wwtps and the crops studied in each area the area 1 corresponds to campo de cartagena irrigation district where the coastal wwtps of torre pacheco roldan and la union provide an annual rw volume of 2 83 hm3 for agriculture the area 2 is the norwest of the segura river and receives 1 70 hm3 of rw per year from the inland wwtps of caravaca de la cruz el moralejo and valentin finally the area 3 corresponds to mazarron which gets rw from the coastal wwtps of mazarron 0 56 hm3 year wastewater in torre pacheco roldan la union and caravaca de la cruz wwtps is treated by active sludge prolonged aeration coagulation flocculation filtration and ultraviolet disinfection wastewater in el moralejo and valentin wwtps is treated by active sludge and prolonged aeration wastewater in mazarron wwtp is treated by aerated storage esamur 2018 all the wwtps selected fulfilled the established microbiological minimum requirements for helminth eggs and escherichia coli regulated in spain by the 1620 2007 royal decree the five crops selected in areas 1 3 muskmelon lettuce iceberg ic lettuce little gem lg and lemon peach and tomato respectively currently represent the 35 of the irrigated area in the region of murcia esyrce 2017 the chemical properties of the rw of all wwtps considered in this study and of the conventional fresh water fw source available in se spain are summarized in table 1 2 2 crops water and fertilizer requirements table 2 presents the fertilizer and irrigation requirements of the selected crops the irrigation water volume applied to each crop was calculated following penman monteith methodology with their specific crop coefficients kc allen et al 1998 daily meteorological data from local weather stations and kc were collected for crop evapotranspiration calculation in the areas of study siar 2019 the fertilizers needs for each crop were consulted in scientific literature as indicated in table 2 table 3 shows the purity and the unitary cost of the commercial fertilizers used to meet the fertilization requirements presented in table 2 note that the selected fertilizers were those with high water solubility and high purity to prevent irrigation network clogging and with low salt index to avoid unnecessary increases in salinity 2 3 determination of the fertilizer doses in order to determine the amount of fertilizers to apply to each crop the quantities recommended in the literature table 2 and the nutrients provided by the different water resources i e fw and rw were considered table 1 the following steps which correspond to the method proposed by alarcón 2013 were taken to determine the amount of fertilizers 1 acidification of the nutrient solution and p application first when possible the hco3 present in the irrigation water is neutralized up to 0 5 mmol l with h3po4 then if the p requirements are fulfilled before achieving 0 5 mmol l of hco3 hno3 is used to reach that threshold and provide part of the n requirements 2 satisfying p needs second if the p requirements are not fulfilled with h3po4 the remaining amount of p is provided by nh4h2po4 or kh2po4 the latter also supplies extra n or k respectively 3 satisfying ca needs third when the irrigation water does not contain enough ca to fulfill the crop requirements ca no3 2 is added to provide ca and n 4 satisfying k needs fourth k is delivered with kno3 which also supplies n unless n is fulfilled before satisfying the k requirements and then k2so4 is applied 5 satisfying n needs fifth if n needs are not met in the previous steps nh4no3 is supplied 6 satisfying mg needs sixth only when the irrigation water does not contain enough mg to fulfill the crop requirements mg no3 2 or mgso4 are considered 7 satisfying micronutrient needs seventh and last a concentration of 15 mg l of micronutrients solution is applied 2 4 evaluation of agronomic risks the main agronomic concerns of irrigating with rw considered in this study were the effect of high salinity the toxicity risk and the mid long term soil sodicity firstly the effect of the salinity on the crop yield was estimated with a response function characterized by a salinity threshold value below which the yield is unaffected and above which the yield decreases linearly with salinity maas and hoffman 1977 table 4 presents the model and the threshold slope values for the selected crops ayers and westcot 1985 secondly the crop toxicity risk due to high concentrations of cl na and b was analyzed based on their maximum permissible concentrations to avoid toxicity problems in the selected crops table 5 it should be noted that for seasonal crops specific ion effects are minimal and osmotic effects predominate however woody crops can accumulate cl na and b up to toxic levels which cause leaf burn necrosis and defoliation maas and grattan 1999 this is the reason why there are some missing values in table 5 as they have not been listed in literature finally the mid long term soil sodicity hazard was analyzed by studying the relation between the sodium adsorption rate sar and the ecw ayers and westcot 1985 2 5 economic assessment two water scenarios based on the source of irrigation water are compared in our analysis 1 scenario fw irrigation with 100 of fw with a cost of 0 30 m3 and 2 scenario rw irrigation with 100 of rw with a cost of 0 031 m3 maestre valero et al 2016 the potential savings of adapting fertigation to irrigation water were evaluated accounting for the price and chemical properties of each water source the inputs considered for the analysis were the maximum fruit production without agronomic restrictions muskmelon 39 400 kg ha lettuce ic 26 000 kg ha lettuce lg 42 800 kg ha lemon 24 900 kg ha peach 23 125 kg ha tomato 119 800 kg ha ecrea 2016 the yield losses associated to water salinity fig 3 and the sale prices in origin published by the government of region of murcia carm 2018 muskmelon 0 30 kg lettuce ic 0 15 unit lettuce lg 0 08 unit lemon 0 30 kg peach 0 60 kg tomato 0 50 kg the outflows were calculated based on the amount of irrigation water and fertilizers applied in each scenario and their costs tables 2 and 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 essential nutrient analysis table 6 shows the amount of fertilizers applied for the different cases of study and irrigation water scenarios in fig 2 the n p2o5 k2o cao and mgo provided by the fw and the rw locally available in each studied area have been compared to the nutrient requirements per cycle and per cycle stage for each studied crop muskmelon lettuce ic and lg tomato peach and lemon in the per cycle stage cases crop cycles have been divided in four phases as indicated in the table 7 a quick look to fig 2a makes apparent that the irrigation water either fw or rw can provide enough ca and mg while the addition of fertilizers is needed for n p and k however as there are higher satisfaction values for rw lower fertilizers doses are required particularly for the case of k2o another noticeable aspect is the rw higher satisfaction rates for woody crops fig 2b shows how nutrient requirements vary for each phase of the crop and how the temporal fluctuation of rw composition often leads to temporal nutritional mismatches between plat demand and water supply a clear example of this is the mgo supplied by rw in tomato that although it can fully cover the mgo requirements at a cycle scale it can only cover 47 2 and 83 7 in stages 2 and 3 respectively fig 2 the rw produced at the wwtps had higher hco3 h2po4 no3 and k concentration than the fw table 1 in all the cases except for the tomato the addition of h3po4 to neutralize part of the hco3 was enough to supply the crop phosphorus requirements such a high concentration of po4 3 led to a slight reduction in the amount of h3po4 needed that ranged from 61 4 in the case of lettuce ic to 0 in tomato the rw might supply up to 40 4 of the total p2o5 requirements for the peach whereas only up to 12 3 for lemon fig 2 and from 2 9 to 7 4 for the rest of crops for woody crops almost all n requirements were provided by hno3 although this latter was not enough to reduce hco3 up to 0 5 mmol l for muskmelon lettuce and tomato the application of hno3 was enough to reduce hco3 up to 0 5 mmol l but insufficient to supply the total crops n requirements rw can supply up to 31 1 of the total n requirements for the peach and up 12 9 for lemon however for the rest of crops lower satisfaction percentages were observed i e from 2 7 8 9 of total n requirements fig 2 concerning the application of k2o for muskmelon lettuce ic lettuce lg and tomato the use of rw allows reductions of 31 0 33 6 27 6 and 18 1 in the application of k2o respectively such reductions increased up to 48 6 in the case of peach and more than 100 in the case of lemon fig 2 our results are in accordance with pedrero et al 2016 who reported that irrigating with rw can provide more than 100 of citrus trees k requirements and with those by maestre valero et al 2019 who showed that about 30 of lettuce k2o requirements may come from the rw 3 2 effect of water salinity on crop yield fig 3 presents the application of the salinity model shown in table 4 for the study crops and the ecw of the different rws table 1 the ecw values ranged from 1 2 ds m observed in la union to 3 0 ds m in mazarron wwtp lettuce lemon and peach are sensible to salinity maas and grattan 1999 with ecw thresholds between 0 9 1 1 ds m while muskmelon and tomato are more resistant to salinity with ecw thresholds of 1 5 and 1 7 ds m respectively table 4 maas and grattan 1999 consequently since ecw of the rw produced at the wwtps ranged between 1 2 and 3 0 ds m table 1 yield reductions can be expected in most crops for the case of mazarron wwtp rw with high ecw significant yield reductions of 60 48 44 19 and 16 can be expected for peach lemon lettuce tomato and muskmelon respectively in order to avoid such yield reductions the adequate blending of rw with fw in collective or individual on farm ponds can enable to lower ecw in the irrigation water benefiting crop yields and even saving water since the supplementary amount of irrigation water for salts leaching can be significantly reduced mansour et al 2016 martínez alvarez et al 2017 3 3 crops toxicity by cl na and b soil and crops are directly exposed to toxicity by cl na and b in the case of the plants their accumulation over time above certain thresholds table 5 may harm tissues and negatively affect metabolic processes resulting in yield reductions grattan et al 2015 further information regarding the toxicity effects of these ions can be found in martinez alvarez et al 2017 one important aspect to consider is that tolerances vary among rootstocks due to differences in their ability to absorb and transport potentially toxic elements to their shoots levy and syvertsen 2004 this is the case of citrus where up to three different tolerances for cl in the irrigation water which ranged from 152 to 350 mg l have been reported table 5 in contrast in the case of seasonal crops muskmelon lettuce and tomato in this study expected specific ion effects are minimum due to the short cycle duration that prevents their accumulation over the toxic limits maas and grattan 1999 here we have compared ion toxicity thresholds table 5 with cl na and b concentrations in the rw at each wwtp table 1 in the case of cl the concentration in the rw ranged between 200 2 and 320 3 mg l only mazarron rw considerably exceeded this value reaching 763 7 mg l table 1 posing chlorosis risks for lemon and peach crops of toxicity thresholds for b have been only found in soil water except for tomato table 5 although relationships between b concentration in the irrigation water and in the soil solution are still poorly understood grattan et al 2015 suggested that the limits for orange trees can be increased over the long term from 0 3 0 5 mg l in the irrigation water to 0 5 0 75 mg l in the soil solution i e an increase between 50 and 66 assuming the later only negative effects are then expected in lemon orchards since maximum b concentration in soil water was established at 0 5 mg l in the case of na only a toxicity threshold has been found for lemon in the soil solution 115 mg l and as in the case of b no references have been found in irrigation water table 5 if assumptions like b are considered na in the soil water would be up to 60 higher than that in the irrigation water since na concentration in the rw in the study wwtps ranged between 146 3 and 252 5 mg l again only mazarron rw exceeded this value reaching 435 0 mg l table 1 na toxicity should only be a risk for lemon trees 3 4 soil sodicity risk high concentrations of na can also damage the soil physical properties causing clay dispersion which leads to i the structural collapse of soil aggregates ii decreased soil hydraulic conductivity iii erosion problems iv soil compaction v and decreased soil aeration mandal et al 2008 muyen et al 2011 all the study wwtps produced rw with large amounts of na and elevated sar values substantially higher than those observed in fw table 1 however the combination of sar and ecw of each wwtp rw mostly showed no sodicity risks fig 4 ayers and wetscot 1985 only rws from roldan and la union wwtps in area 1 presented slight to moderate sodicity risk that could cause in the medium to long term a drop in the soil infiltration rate ayers and wetscot 1985 as ecw in these two wwtps was not too high to produce significant yield reductions fig 3 mitigating sodicity risks could be tackled by adjusting the fertigation programs increasing the amount of ca and mg can displace na from the soil exchange complex and reduce the sar another possible option is to mitigate the soil sodicity risk by blending rw with other water resources of better quality in any case seasonal soil monitoring is strongly encouraged to detect any deterioration of the soil structure when rw is used for crop irrigation especially in soils with high clay content where the sodicity hazard may be more relevant martinez alvarez et al 2017 3 5 economic assessment table 8 shows for the study water scenarios the water cost and the income derived from the sale of the fruit the results showed that the fertigation with rw could potentially save from 436 ha cycle 37 2 of the fertigation with fw cost in the case of lettuce lg to 2 050 ha year 68 6 of the fertigation with fw cost in the case of peach table 8 however the yield losses due to the salinity of the rws led to notable economic losses that ranged from 29 5 in the case of peach 3 221 ha year to 0 in the case of muskmelon despite this the inflow outflow balance for muskmelon lettuce ic and lg and lemon was positive in the rw scenario making the irrigation with rw in the study area more viable that the fertigation with fw this was not the case for peach where yield reduction was 23 2 and for tomato where yield reduction was 19 1 offsetting any fertilization savings 4 conclusions this study has evidenced the possible agronomic and economic impacts of considering the nutritional value of reclaimed water rw for irrigation in southeast of spain firstly the study confirms that rw can supply a large part of the nutrient crop requirements especially in the case of woody crops however each crop phase must be analyzed independently due to temporal mismatches between the crops nutrient requirements and the nutrients supplied by water secondly the high concentration of cl na and b in the rw might produce chlorosis in lemon and peach and toxicity effects by na and b in lemon thirdly the relationship between the sodium adsorption rate and the electrical conductivity of the water ecw has shown no sodicity risk for most of the rws fourtly the high salinity of the rws compared to the fw led in most of the selected crops except muskmelon to considerable yield reductions in fact the analysis of the inflow outflow balance which considers both the use of fertilizers and the yield losses associated to water salinity has revealed the feasibility of the fertigation with rw only for muskmelon lettuce iceberg and little gem and lemon nonetheless for peach and tomato the high yield reduction associated to the ecw makes less viable the irrigation with rw despite the economic savings associated to the fertigation overall notwithstanding potential yield reductions due to salinity and soil sodicity and crop toxicity risks irrigation with rw accounting for available nutrients seems to be a good option from agronomical and economic perspectives for most crops in se spain the appropriate irrigation and soil management strategies such as salt leaching the introduction of calcium amendments or the mix with other conventional sources of water quality when sodicity is a problem are recommended in addition edible parts of rw irrigated crops must not pose any microbiological and toxicity hazards for farm animals and human health acknowledgments we thank esmaur entidad de saneamiento y depuración de aguas residuales de la región de murcia for providing the data of the
