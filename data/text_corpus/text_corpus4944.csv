24720,enhancing consideration of the ecosystem services concept within decision making calls for integration of local knowledge and data within assessments to capture context specific spatial and thematic detail this paper demonstrates how local knowledge and biophysical sociocultural economic data can be integrated within ecosystem service assessments by use of well established spatial quantification methods we hypothesise that ecosystem services can be spatially quantified at high spatial and thematic detail by integration of local knowledge and data within models contributing to identification of key factors that influence their delivery we demonstrate this by making use of local knowledge and data to assess ecosystem services in the hoeksche waard a dutch municipality characterised by historically rich cultural landscapes and predominant agriculture ecosystem services assessed include crop production air quality regulation human health pest control soil biodiversity sociocultural values property value quantification methods were selected based on their suitability for modelling ecosystem services given particular resource endowments i e time data knowledge methods implemented include look up tables causal relationships expert elicitation primary data extrapolation and regression models maps displaying the distribution of ecosystem services at high spatial resolution 10 10 m enabled identification of factors that influence their delivery including the distribution and typology of natural elements ecological pressures that require mitigation and the distribution of inhabitants that act as ecosystem service beneficiaries for instance the distribution and typology of field margins plays a key role in the suppression of pests aphids by natural enemies hoverflies carabids coccinellids air quality regulation i e particulate matter retention is highest in the northeast sector of the municipality given higher concentrations of particulate matter that require mitigation due to the area s proximity to the cities of rotterdam and dordrecht contributions by natural elements to human health and property value are prominent in villages where most inhabitants and thus built up property are concentrated keywords field margins ecosystem services modelling local information biophysical sociocultural monetary 1 introduction ecosystem services are the direct and indirect benefits that ecosystems provide humans with costanza et al 2017 mea 2005 according to the common international classification of ecosystem services cices haines young and potschin 2018 ecosystem services can be classified as provisioning regulation and maintenance also regulating mea 2005 teeb 2010 and cultural services provisioning services are the material contributions that natural capital endows humans with such as crop and groundwater production for human consumption and animal feed mea 2005 regulating services are ecological processes that directly or indirectly contribute to human well being mea 2005 examples include the retention of atmospheric concentrations of harmful pollutants by vegetation and water remme et al 2018 janhäll 2015 the potential contribution of biological pest control to final crop yield and ecosystem resilience tschumi et al 2016 and climate regulation through carbon sequestration by vegetation and soils díaz et al 2009 breure et al 2018 cultural services are non material benefits that ecosystems provide for humans such as the spiritual recreational or intrinsic value people assign to natural elements and landscapes mea 2005 the ecosystem services concept provides an opportunity for incorporating scientific knowledge within spatial management haase et al 2014 walsh et al 2015 it can serve as a language through which science communicates to society shedding light on the various mechanisms by which ecosystems generate value for humans potschin and haines young 2016 breure et al 2012 recognising the concept s potential recent years have seen an upsurge in the number of initiatives calling for integration of ecosystem services within environmental decision making díaz et al 2015 ec 2011 cbd 2010 to meet their common objectives a number of standardised modelling approaches have been developed e g invest aries estimap tallis and polaski 2011 villa et al 2014 zulian et al 2014 maes et al 2016 their aim is to contribute to the standardisation and harmonisation of the ecosystem service spatial quantification process thereby facilitating the comparability of results across space and time despite these initiatives consideration of the ecosystem services concept within decision making remains limited haase et al 2014 walsh et al 2015 this partly results from a limited integration of spatial and thematic detail central to particular socioecological systems within assessments derkzen et al 2015 martínez lópez et al 2019 as well as challenges in the communication of complex models and their outputs to non scientist end users villa et al 2014 this limits confidence in assessment output and thereby its uptake to support spatial planning lilburne and tarantola 2009 schuwirth et al 2019 to address this challenge enhanced integration of local knowledge and data within ecosystem service models is needed martínez lópez et al 2019 orchard webb et al 2016 consideration of local knowledge and data where available is instrumental for capturing site specific sociocultural and ecological factors that influence the access to and use of ecosystem services by beneficiaries díaz et al 2018 paulin et al 2020a it also contributes to the democratisation and legitimisation of the assessment process supporting the integration of final results within decision making orchard webb et al 2016 despite these benefits standardised ecosystem service assessment models often incorporate non site specific knowledge and data as input petz et al 2017 this leads to the underrepresentation of fundamental characteristics of particular socioecological systems at the local scale martínez lópez et al 2019 in general ecosystem services research is often performed within the field of ecology luederitz et al 2015 carried out separately from economic studies and decision science rasmussen et al 2016 haase et al 2014 in addition local knowledge is often excluded from assessments oversimplifying the central role that culture plays in defining human nature interactions díaz et al 2018 incorporation of local knowledge and data within ecosystem service assessments often requires deviation from the use of standard ecosystem service models that are unsuited for capturing the spatial and thematic detail that define real world management situations villa et al 2014 martínez lópez et al 2019 in these instances the choice of suitable methods for quantifying and mapping local ecosystem services is complicated by the abundance of available methods seppelt et al 2011 methods refer to the way in which data sources are used to quantify and map ecosystem services martínez harms and balvanera 2012 the suitability of these methods may vary depending on various factors these include but are not limited to the type of ecosystem service under consideration the expertise of assessors the type of data available and time constraints eppink et al 2012 schröter et al 2015 the aim of this study is to demonstrate how local knowledge and data i e biophysical sociocultural economic data can be included within ecosystem service assessments by integration of well established spatial quantification methods conceptualisations of ecosystem service spatial quantification methods vary throughout the literature for clarity and consistency a number of studies reviewed publications mapping ecosystem services in order to identify and conceptualise commonly implemented spatial quantification methods martínez harms and balvanera 2012 grêt regamey et al 2017 lavorel et al 2017 we demonstrate how well established methods can be integrated to spatially quantify seven ecosystem services in the hoeksche waard incorporating local knowledge and data section 3 the hoeksche waard is a dutch municipality characterised by historically rich cultural landscapes and predominant agriculture covering 40 of earth s terrestrial ecosystems agricultural landscapes comprise a range of ecosystem services and stakeholders making them some of the most interesting to analyse foley et al 2011 montoya et al 2020 the hoeksche waard is a particularly interesting study site given notable interest by local stakeholders to collaborate to meet their common objectives spatial quantification methods that were implemented in this study were conceptualised based on the seminal work of martínez harms balvanera 2012 and schröter et al 2015 who conducted extensive literature reviews to identify spatial quantification methods that are commonly implemented to map ecosystem services implemented methods include causal relationships expert elicitation primary data extrapolation regression models and look up tables we elaborate on these methods and how they can be integrated to spatially quantify ecosystem services given different resource endowments i e knowledge data time section 2 a key feature of this study s methodology is that all models incorporate local knowledge and data we hypothesise that ecosystem services can be spatially quantified at high spatial and thematic detail by integration of local knowledge and data within models contributing to identification of key factors that influence their delivery 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hoeksche waard is a municipality with a surface area of approximately 324 km2 distributed across croplands 49 grasslands 13 nature areas 13 small and large water bodies 17 and built up and paved areas 9 fig 1 it has a population of 86 656 inhabitants https opendata cbs nl and its economy is primarily agricultural focusing on the production of sugar beet and potato in rotation with a variety of other crops the spatial configuration of the area s natural elements is attributed to a long history of reclamation and cultivation the creation of the dike structure as we know it started in 1538 and the island reached its current extent in 1653 today the landscape contains different reclamation structures reflecting its history including vast polders large water bodies and protected natural areas over the years the desire to protect the landscape has given rise to a collaborative network between farmers local and regional governments and ngos http hwodka nl http www rietgorsinfo nl home https www cchw eu in 2004 the project functional agrobiodiversity hoeksche waard fab hw van alebeek and cleveling 2005 came to place aiming to increase biodiversity to enhance biological pest control thereby reducing the application of chemical pesticides van rijn et al 2008 this initiative has led to the large scale implementation 460 km of field margins and grassy and flower rich strips of land which surround parcels that provide habitat for plants birds and beneficial insects e g pollinators insects that prey upon pest organisms www hwl nl van rijn et al 2008 wratten et al 2012 in 2005 given its varied and valued cultural and ecological background the hoeksche waard was assigned as one of 20 dutch national landscapes this status is granted to areas characterised by unique cultural historical and natural elements https nationalelandschappen nl 2 2 scoping in the scoping phase of this assessment stakeholders and ecosystem services relevant to the hoeksche waard were identified the scoping consisted of two stages during the first stage a literature review was performed with two main purposes the first purpose was to obtain information on ecosystem services that are relevant in the area given current land use patterns the second purpose was to identify stakeholder groups that influence manage or benefit from the provision of ecosystem services in the area during the second stage semi structured interviews were carried out with representatives from each identified stakeholder group with two main purposes the first purpose was to obtain information on relevant ecosystem services the second purpose was to identify stakeholder groups that may have been overlooked by only assessing the literature interviewed stakeholder representatives included farmers members of local governments nature organisations the local water board and environmental organisations environmental organisations are entities that focus on the achievement of objectives shared by different stakeholder groups in this case related to nature management this stage was key for understanding stakeholder objectives and for identifying site specific ecosystem services the supplementary material appendix 1 lists identified stakeholder objectives and provides details on interviewed parties 2 3 modelling approach based on the literature review and semi structured interviews conducted during the scoping phase of the study seven ecosystem services were identified for their assessment table 1 the names ascribed to ecosystem services comprise user friendly terms that are instrumental when involving stakeholders and decision makers perhaps less knowledgeable on ecosystem services terminology and concepts paulin et al 2020a ecosystem services were operationalised into supply and use indicators capturing the biophysical and the socioeconomic aspects of ecosystem service delivery fig 2 supply captures the distribution and performance of ecosystem functions or the ecological structures and processes that contribute to human wellbeing burkard et al 2012 syrbe and walz 2012 hence it is best represented by use of biophysical indicators martín lópez et al 2014 castro et al 2014 vigl et al 2017 use captures the distribution and performance of the realised socioeconomic benefits that ecosystem functions underpin wolff et al 2015 syrbe and walz 2012 hence it can be best represented by use of sociocultural and economic indicators martín lópez et al 2014 castro et al 2014 vigl et al 2017 the supplementary material provides an overview of the operationalisation of all supply and use indicators modelled according to cices version 5 1 appendix 2 ecosystem services were modelled by use of social ecological assessment models in social ecological assessment models the relationship amongst measurable biophysical e g land cover remote sensed data spatially extrapolated field observations and socioeconomic variables e g population survey data statistical data is modelled to spatially quantify ecosystem service proxy indicators martinez harms and balvanera 2012 all ecosystem service models integrate local knowledge and data which enabled the development of ecosystem service maps at a high spatial resolution 10 10 m and the identification of key factors that influence their delivery to couple local knowledge and data various spatial quantification methods are integrated within models spatial quantification methods applied in this study are presented and described in table 2 these methods are conceptualised based on the work of martinez harms balvanera 2012 and schröter et al 2015 the selection of methods that are implemented within each model can be based on their suitability given particular resource endowments i e knowledge data time models based on causal relationships are suitable in situations where the use of readily available knowledge and data is sufficient to adequately capture local ecosystem service delivery where literature based and data based causal relationships are insufficient to adequately capture ecosystem service supply and use regression models can be implemented in doing so it may be possible to identify causal relationships amongst biophysical and socioeconomic variables however this method is considerably more time consuming compared to the use of readily available causal relationships expert elicitation provides a practical solution where causal relationships are insufficient to adequately capture local supply and use and where our mechanistic understanding of the system is insufficient jacobs and burkhard 2017 it is also key for understanding local stakeholder preferences e g motivations perceptions knowledge principles virtues that determine which ecosystem services are valued in an area santos martín et al 2017 information based on causal relationships can be directly linked to spatial variable categories to capture ecosystem service delivery through their incorporation within aggregated statistics look up tables lut information that has been obtained through expert elicitation can be linked to spatial classification typologies through their incorporation within qualitative lut multiple layer lut are useful for linking various lut which may include a combination of binary qualitative and aggregated statistics lut in this study primary data extrapolation took place through incorporation of primary data within lut in addition the models air quality regulation human health and property value incorporate results from regression models that have been published in peer reviewed literature paulin et al 2020b ecosystem services were modelled by combining spatial data and reference values that capture relationships between variables within algorithms reference values can be obtained from various sources such as statistical databases regression models expert elicitation and published empirical studies algorithms were written in python programming language https www python org using the pcraster software to perform spatial calculations http pcraster geo uu nl all codes and model outputs are available from the authors upon request a number of ecosystem services were modelled by use of local models from the natural capital model nc model a spatially explicit set of models for quantifying and mapping ecosystem services within the netherlands at various scales paulin et al 2020b remme et al 2018 models from the nc model implemented in this study include the air quality regulation human health pest control and property value models spatial datasets that have been used as input throughout the modelling process are presented in table 3 selected input datasets include their most recent available version or versions that align well with the general dates of all datasets the supplementary material provides detailed descriptions of the spatial data that were used as input as well as stepwise procedures for the direct replication of all models appendices 3 and 4 for all output maps descriptive statistics i e minimum maximum mean standard deviation and pearson correlation coefficients were calculated by use of the arcgis 10 6 1 geospatial processing program https www arcgis com supplementary material appendix 5 as all codes data and steps required for the implementation of models are publicly available their direct replication principally requires a thorough understanding of spatial modelling and coding techniques customisation of models for their application at different sites is possible provided i that spatial data used as input for models is available at the location under assessment and ii that reference values e g obtained from previous studies or through expert elicitation are tailored to values that are relevant at the particular ecological and socioeconomic context in particular implementation of the sociocultural values model at a different site would require executing surveys with stakeholders which is a time demanding process 2 4 ecosystem services 2 4 1 crop production the crop production model captures the yearly volume of harvested crops per spatial unit as well as its associated monetary value data on average harvested volumes of different crops per spatial unit kg ha average output per unit of volume kg and average value added per unit of volume kg were obtained from the central databank of the netherlands https opendata cbs nl to model ecosystem service supply and use spatial data providing information on the distribution of different crop types agricultural crop parcels map was reclassified by use of aggregated statistics lut lut link different crop types to their average production volumes and their equivalent monetary units i e net output and value added per spatial unit fig 3 presents a schematic diagram displaying how input data was modelled by use of two spatial quantification methods to quantify and map ecosystem service supply and use 2 4 2 air quality regulation particulate matter e g from agriculture industry cars is one of the most harmful components of air pollution for human health it is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as mortality derkzen et al 2015 santibañez et al 2013 due to the roughness of their surface different vegetation types contribute to the retention of particulate matter remme et al 2018 janhäll 2015 in this paper the natural capital model nc model paulin et al 2020b was implemented to model the contribution by different vegetation types to reductions in atmospheric pm10 i e particulate matter with a diameter of up to 10 µm concentrations as well as associated contributions to human health ecosystem service supply displays actual pm10 retention by vegetation it is modelled by reclassifying spatial data displaying the distribution of natural elements land use vegetation maps by use of aggregated statistics lut lut link different vegetation typologies with their capacity for pm10 retention subsequently an overlay is performed with spatial data displaying the actual distribution of atmospheric pm10 pm10 concentration map ecosystem service use links pm10 reductions to associated reductions in health costs from avoided pm10 related mortalities ecosystem service use is modelled by combining the output layer displaying distribution of pm10 retention with a layer displaying the distribution of inhabitants population map as well as with causal reference values obtained from the literature reference values integrate regression model results linking pm10 concentrations to mortality with national statistics to calculate associated reductions in health costs ce delft 2017 2 4 3 human health through its mitigation of environmental pressures e g noise pollution air pollution and temperature extremes green space i e vegetation abundance contributes to improvements in overall human health and reductions in all cause mortality staatsen et al 2017 hartig et al 2014 kondo et al 2018 to model the contributions of green space to human health in the hoeksche waard the nc model paulin et al 2020b was implemented the model captures the relationship between vegetation abundance surrounding households and its contribution to the health of household inhabitants contributions to human health reflect in reduced visits to the general practitioners reduced health costs i e from reductions in the incidence of nine disease groups and reduced labour costs i e from reduced absenteeism increased labour productivity and avoided job losses it does so by combining spatial information on the distribution of natural elements vegetation map and the distribution of inhabitants population map with causal reference values obtained from the literature remme et al 2018 reference values include regression model results that link the percentage vegetated cover surrounding households 1 km buffer to reductions in individual health costs visits to general practitioners absenteeism and job losses as well as increased labour productivity kpmg 2012 maas 2008 regression model results on absenteeism job losses and labour productivity are combined with national statistics to calculate reduced labour costs associated with green space availability kpmg 2012 2 4 4 pest control as the negative side effects of widespread pesticide use becomes increasingly apparent e g increased resistance of pests to pesticide treatment suppression of non target wildlife and beneficial insects surface water contamination deteriorated human health köhler and triebskorn 2013 gooijer et al 2019 policies are emerging calling for drastic reductions in pesticide use in order to protect humans and the environment ez 2013 ep 2009 this can be achieved by implementing agricultural measures that protect and enhance populations of pest suppressing organisms e g creation of field margins van rijn et al 2008 pest suppression by natural enemy populations i e insects that suppress pest populations was modelled by use of the nc model paulin et al 2020b remme et al 2018 the main pest population considered in this paper consists of aphids natural enemy populations considered include hoverflies coccinellids and carabids as field margins constitute a key habitat for natural enemy populations the model was customised to include a local spatial dataset capturing the distribution of field margins in the hoeksche waard field margins map to model ecosystem service supply spatial data displaying the distribution of natural elements crop parcels field margins vegetation maps is reclassified by use of binary lut lut are used to determine which vegetation types may act as potential habitat for individual pest and natural enemy insect populations the distribution of insect populations is not only determined by the distribution of their habitat but also by insect mobility based on the distribution of pest and natural enemy populations a score determined by experts i e scientists is assigned to each cell capturing the effectiveness of pest control by biological agents 0 no effectiveness 1 5 high effectiveness within each spatial unit the effectiveness of pest control is determined by potential interactions between predator and prey as well as potential intraguild interactions complementarity or predation amongst biological control agents hindayana et al 2001 alhmedi et al 2010 fig 4 presents a schematic diagram displaying how input data was modelled by use of various methods to spatially quantify ecosystem service supply 2 4 5 soil biodiversity soil biodiversity underpins vital soil functions such as nutrient cycling moderation of greenhouse gas emissions carbon sequestration water storage and water purification wall et al 2012 montanarella et al 2015 this paper modelled the performance of soil biodiversity by adapting the soil biodiversity model from the soil navigator http www soilnavigator eu into a spatial model integrating local reference values and spatial data developed as part of the horizon 2020 project landmark http landmark2020 eu the soil navigator is an expert based decision tree approach that incorporates physical chemical and biological attributes i e measurable data for modelling the performance of soil functions in agricultural areas van leeuwen et al 2019 it does so by classifying attributes that define system characteristics i e soil environmental management characteristics into overarching classes at various tier levels attribute values are initially assigned performance scores e g poor moderate good based on thresholds assigned by technical scientific experts attributes are then grouped into overarching classes at higher tier levels and assigned performance levels based on expert based qualitative luts overall soil biodiversity performance i e poor moderate good performance for a particular test site is determined at the highest tier level the soil navigator comprises two models for quantifying the performance of soil biodiversity one for grasslands and one for croplands van leeuwen et al 2019 these models were adapted into a spatial model by replacing field measurements for individual attributes e g ph bulk density earthworm abundance with spatial data displaying the distribution of said attributes soil characteristics soil biophysical units maps where available where spatial data was unavailable or inadequate e g due to low spatial heterogeneity attributes were assigned reference scores e g overall poor moderate good performance by experts the supplementary material provides a detailed description of the way the model was adapted appendix 4 section 4 5 it also presents maps displaying the distribution of soil biotic and abiotic attributes which were used as input for the model appendix 6 2 4 6 sociocultural values the sociocultural values model captures the perceived importance of sociocultural values by local stakeholders in the hoeksche waard and how they experience these values through their interaction with natural landscape elements natural landscape elements and sociocultural values were identified during the scoping phase of this study based on the literature and semi structured interviews conducted with stakeholders identified sociocultural values that are considered in this model include cultural identity and heritage habitability intrinsic values landscape aesthetics and recreation a survey was subsequently developed and distributed by interviewed local representatives number of respondents 87 the survey enabled local stakeholders to assign a score to sociocultural values based on their perceived level of importance 0 not important 5 very important a low standard deviation was considered a robust choice for consideration of a proxy indicator rutgers et al 2012 respondents were then requested to link each sociocultural value to natural landscape elements to which they have been exposed linkages were made based on stakeholders perceived importance of natural elements for experiencing each sociocultural value respondents were allowed to choose a maximum number of three elements per sociocultural value maps displaying the distribution of natural landscape elements typologies were developed by use of multiple layer lut lut combine spatial datasets displaying the distribution of natural landscape elements vegetation land use agricultural crop parcels maps into individual layers displaying the distribution of each natural landscape element typology considered for this ecosystem service for each sociocultural value natural landscape elements were assigned a score each score is based on the average level of importance assigned to the sociocultural value and the average number of times each element was linked to it these scores were integrated within qualitative lut linking natural landscape elements to sociocultural values table 4 all calculations are available in the supplementary material appendix 4 section 4 6 2 4 7 property value natural elements increase the amenity of residential areas which reflects in property values czembrowski and kronenberg 2016 franco and macdonald 2018 the contribution of the configuration and composition of natural elements to property values was modelled by use of the nc model paulin et al 2020b the model combines spatial information on average property prices in different areas key statistical figures map and on the distribution of natural elements vegetation topographic land use maps with causal reference values obtained from the literature remme et al 2018 reference values include regression model results linking different natural element typologies e g park open water tree line and their configurations i e size distance from property with property prices daams et al 2016 ruijgrok and de groot 2006 luttik and zijlstra 1997 3 results for a comprehensive assessment of results maps displaying the spatial distribution of ecosystem services fig 5 are analysed alongside total supply and use values calculated for the municipality of the hoeksche waard table 5 maps display one supply or use indicator for each ecosystem service based on the indicators presented in table 1 in the supplementary material maps displaying the distribution of indicators modelled by use of the sociocultural values model are found appendix 7 as well as descriptive statistics and correlations for all output maps appendix 5 results from the crop production model reveal production volumes that are substantially fragmented and heterogeneous across space due to the presence of crop rotations that include a variety of cover crops while the net output of harvested crops is valued at approximately 107 million year 6800 year productive ha the value added of harvested crops net output once labour and capital costs have been deducted is estimated at less than 70 of net output results from the air quality regulation model reveal substantially higher pm10 retention levels in the northeast of the hoeksche waard an area adjacent to the cities of rotterdam and dordrecht benefits that were modelled by use of the human health and property value models are mainly visible within villages where most of the municipality s inhabitants and built up property are concentrated see built up and paved areas in fig 1 results from the pest control model illustrate the degree of suppression of pests by natural enemy populations areas in yellow score 0 comprise areas where pests are present but no biological pest control takes place while areas in dark blue score 1 5 comprise areas where pest control is most effective results from the soil biodiversity model disclose that on average soil biodiversity performs at moderate to good levels results from the sociocultural values model capture the importance of natural landscape elements for the delivery of five locally relevant cultural services in general average values for the entire area are often relatively low for indicators whose units are based on score systems pest control sociocultural values as they bundle up high and low values across the entire area an exception includes results from the soil biodiversity model where the area s average score was high as the performance of soil biodiversity is relatively high across the evaluated extent on instances where averaging ecosystem service delivery scores leads to bias towards lower values maps provide more indicative results as maps display the distribution of ecosystem service supply and use they facilitate the comparison of relative values across space 4 discussion 4 1 ecosystem services 4 1 1 crop production within the crop production model production volumes and accrued monetary values are influenced by the type of crop under production for instance on average the production kg ha of sugar beets is higher than the production of brown beans by a factor of 40 https opendata cbs nl however the market price of brown beans is higher than the price of sugar beets by a factor of 10 https www agrimatie nl in addition a number of cover crops e g english ryegrass red and white clover are less profitable but support the maintenance of soil quality within crop rotations munkholm et al 2013 all these factors ultimately influence the net output ha for each crop type since a variety of crops with different profitability levels are combined within rotation systems the net output for all crops produced 107 million year is a more adequate indication of the profitability of farming systems than net output per crop type an even more adequate measure of the sector s profitability is the value added of harvested crops 72 million year as it considers net output once labour and capital costs have been deducted 4 1 2 air quality regulation within the air quality regulation model pm10 retention is influenced by the vegetation typology and its configuration as well as the distribution of atmospheric concentrations of pm10 since land cover is relatively homogeneous across the hoeksche waard i e mainly croplands and grasslands the capacity for pm10 retention does not vary significantly instead overall pm10 retention is mainly determined by atmospheric concentrations of pm10 pm10 concentration map displayed in appendix 8 this explains why significant uptake takes place in the northeast sector of the municipality given its proximity to the cities of rotterdam and dordrecht it also reveals that while agriculture may act as a source of pm10 emissions lagerwerf et al 2019 it may also behave as a sink in this case natural elements in the hoeksche waard act as sinks for urban pollution spill overs 4 1 3 human health in the hoeksche waard total reductions in health costs and health related labour costs amount to 3 4 million and 17 million respectively these values are substantially lower than values obtained by application of the nc model in the municipality of amsterdam health costs 18 2 million health related labour costs 90 million paulin et al 2020a this can be explained by the fact that amsterdam s population is larger by a factor of 10 comprising a larger number of beneficiaries compared to the hoeksche waard despite this considerable difference the total per capita contribution of green space to reductions in health costs and health related labour costs is higher in the hoeksche waard than in amsterdam by a factor of two this can be explained by the abundance of vegetation that characterises predominant agricultural areas relative to predominantly urban areas in general human health maps share a weak correlation with other output maps r 0 0 1 with the exception of the use map modelled by use of the property value model r 0 5 this is likely the case since the contributions to human health and property value by natural elements are restricted to areas where inhabitants and built up property are concentrated which is not the case for other indicators considered 4 1 4 pest control within the pest control model pest suppression by natural enemy populations i e insects that suppress pest populations is determined by i the distribution of natural elements that act as habitat for pest organisms i e aphids and natural enemy populations i e hoverflies carabids coccinellids ii intraguild interactions predation or complementarity between natural enemy populations and iii the mobility of individual pest or natural enemy populations in the hoeksche waard the landscape is predominantly fragmented into crop fields which often serve as a habitat for aphids langoya and van rijn 2008 crop parcels are commonly surrounded by field margins and wood walls which provide habitat for aphids and their natural enemies in various combinations van rijn 2014 hence effective pest control mainly takes place inside and in the proximity of field margins and wood walls surrounding crop parcels areas where no effective pest control takes place score 0 mainly comprise extensive grasslands or croplands that are too remote from woody elements and field margins to be reached by natural enemy populations pest control seems to be most effective in the south eastern island of tiengemeten which mainly comprises natural protected areas as such it comprises a higher diversity of vegetation hosting a more diverse distribution of pest and natural enemy populations than the predominantly agricultural landscape 4 1 5 soil biodiversity on average soils in the hoeksche waard receive a performance score of good the highest achievable score that can be obtained by implementation of the soil navigator in general soil biodiversity seems to be moderately correlated with crop productivity r 0 5 this may result in part from the harmonised management style that defines the area as well as the many initiatives that seek to enhance soil biodiversity and overall quality high performance is most prominent in grasslands and non cropland natural areas see fig 1 which comprise a number of protected areas managed by nature organisations and farmer s collectives e g natuurmonumenten staatsbosbeheer rietgors foundation https www natuurmonumenten nl https www staatsbosbeheer nl www rietgorsinfo nl 4 1 6 sociocultural values on average the perceived contribution of the hoeksche waard s natural landscape elements is highest for the sociocultural value landscape aesthetics which receives a score of 3 7 table 5 on a scale of 0 to 5 unimportant to very important this occurs since a strong perceived linkage was identified between the sociocultural value and the grasslands and shrubs typology score 4 4 table 4 and as all natural landscape element typologies considered received a score no lower than 3 2 table 4 hence the score assigned to grasslands and shrubs 26 of evaluated areas and other natural landscape elements led to an average score of 3 7 meanwhile the average perceived contribution of the hoeksche waard s natural landscape elements is lowest for the sociocultural value habitability score 1 5 table 5 this is the case since the highest valued natural element typology i e large water bodies receives an intermediate score of 3 6 table 4 and has a relatively low spatial extent 6 of evaluated areas while all other typologies received lower scores leading to a relatively low average score for evaluated areas these observations shed light on the fact that average values may overlook natural element typologies that receive high scores but which do not cover large spatial extents for instance for the intrinsic values indicator ditches and creeks 17 of evaluated areas are perceived as important score 4 7 table 4 while for recreational potential trees hedges and woodwalls 9 of evaluated areas are perceived as important score 4 6 table 4 this accentuates the need to evaluate not only average values but also the spatial distribution of these values across the landscape 4 1 7 property value the contribution of natural elements to property value is estimated at 920 million this value is substantially lower than the value estimated by application of the nc model in the municipality of amsterdam 6 billion paulin et al 2020a this may occur in part due to amsterdam s larger population size and consequently higher density of built up property however the contribution of natural elements to property values is additionally influenced by the typology configuration and proximity of these elements to households in dutch cities households are often concentrated in areas which are highly sealed and surrounded by substantially lower vegetation abundance while villages in rural areas are commonly surrounded by abundant nature this explains why even though the population size in the hoeksche waard is smaller than that of amsterdam by a factor of 10 the contribution of its natural elements to property value is smaller by a factor of six in general the use map produced by implementation of the property value model is weakly correlated with other output maps r 0 0 1 with the exception of maps modelled by use of the human health model r 0 5 as with results obtained by implementation of the human health model this may occur in part since the contribution to property value by natural elements is restricted to areas where built up property is concentrated which is not the case for other indicators considered 4 2 local relevance in the hoeksche waard stakeholders share an intimate relationship with the natural landscape farmers seek to become more innovative to maintain and enhance the quality of the soils that sustain their crops while enjoying the cultural and aesthetic value of the landscape the local water board aims for safe and clean waterways https www wshd nl influenced by different drivers local governments ez 2013 south holland province 2013 and environmental organisations https www natuurmonumenten nl https www staatsbosbeheer nl www hwl nl strive to maintain and enhance the ecological and cultural value of the landscape locals value the aesthetics of grasslands and find educational and scientific potential in agricultural fields these interests are epitomised in a history of collaboration between stakeholder groups that has led to a continuous search for innovative and multifunctional agriculture van alebeek and cleveling 2005 van rijn et al 2008 agriculture defines and fragments the landscape into agricultural parcels driving the economy of the area but threatening ecosystem resilience e g soil compaction by use of heavy machinery water quality soil quality and biodiversity degradation from pesticide use to address this threat the large scale implementation of field margins seeks to suppress the use of pesticides and its negative impacts results from this study reveal effectiveness in suppression of local pests due to the presence of field margins in alignment with empirical research van rijn and wäckers 2016 it also emphasises the importance of the configuration and composition of field margins and other natural enemy habitats for effective pest suppression this may partially explain why despite substantial agriculture taking place in the area soils continue to enjoy moderate to good performance of soil biodiversity in alignment with virtually all stakeholder objectives supplementary material appendix 1 villages enjoy enhanced property values and improved health due to the abundance of vegetation in their near surroundings meanwhile this abundance of vegetation acts as a sink for atmospheric pm10 released in urban areas at the northeast of the municipality moreover the assessment of sociocultural values reveals that locals value natural elements differently based on the particular sociocultural value under consideration these values are maximised when highly valued natural landscape elements comprise large extents accentuating the spatial trade offs that exist amongst sociocultural values in the area 4 3 methodological relevance limited consideration of ecosystem service assessment results within decision making often results from the use of standardised models that are ill suited for capturing context specific spatial and thematic detail villa et al 2014 to advance consideration of the ecosystem services concept within decision making there is a need for integrating local knowledge and data within assessments to capture context specific spatial and thematic detail martínez lópez et al 2019 this study provided insights on how local knowledge and data can be incorporated to assess local ecosystem services assessing a diverse suite of locally relevant ecosystem services while integrating local knowledge and data called for integration of various well established spatial quantification methods these methods vary in suitability given particular resource endowments a key methodological advantage of considering local knowledge and data within assessments is that it enables the spatial quantification of ecosystem services at high spatial and thematic detail flexibility in the selection of spatial quantification methods is instrumental as knowledge and data availability vary across spatiotemporal gradients and may come in various forms which requires adaptability for a number of ecosystem services i e air quality regulation human health property value models from the nc model were available for their quantification making use of best available local spatial data and reference values obtained from regression models for remaining ecosystem services readily available spatial data statistical data and knowledge from empirical studies were analysed to determine how spatial quantification methods could be integrated for their assessment for the ecosystem service crop production it was possible to develop a model based on readily available local spatial data and statistics on crop production volumes and prices the abundance of spatial data on soil characteristics and the aid of technical experts i e scientists made it possible to adapt the expert based model underlying the soil navigator to model the performance of soil biodiversity for the pest control model it was difficult to obtain reference values based on regression models due to time and data constraints hence with the aid of technical experts a model was developed capturing the interactions between aphids and natural enemy populations based on the distribution of their habitats recognising that sociocultural values are largely context dependant proxy indicators for the sociocultural values model were identified and modelled through semi structured interviews and participatory exercises with stakeholders from a thematic perspective incorporating local knowledge within assessments can generate a better understanding of the socioeconomic and ecological context under assessment this facilitates the process of selecting ecosystem services that will be assessed in a way that aligns with the needs and preferences of local stakeholders as well as with local environmental characteristics the consideration of socioeconomic and ecological characteristics that define spatiotemporal gradients within models can serve as a means to enhance the legitimacy of assessment results supporting their uptake within decision making orchard webb et al 2016 in this study ecosystem services were not selected a priori but were rather identified by conducting semi structured interviews with local stakeholders and by reviewing local literature sources this led to a selection and assessment of ecosystem services of central importance in the hoeksche waard including site specific cultural services from a spatial perspective the integration of local data at a high spatial resolution where available within ecosystem service models can enable their quantification at high spatial detail this is useful for visualising the heterogeneity that characterises the distribution of ecosystem services at the local scale such level of detail is often difficult to obtain by implementing large scale standardised models that link secondary data to land use land cover these models often contribute to a binary view of what are in fact continuous and heterogeneous landscapes malinga et al 2015 sacrificing the level of spatial detail that is necessary to manage ecosystem services at the local level derkzen et al 2015 martínez lópez et al 2019 visualising the spatial distribution of ecosystem services at a high resolution enables the identification of spatial matches and mismatches between supply and use as well as potential factors that influence their distribution paulin et al 2020a in this study all models implemented made use of best available spatial data that is accepted and endorsed by dutch local governments enabling the assessment of ecosystem services at a high spatial resolution 10 10 m this was key for identifying potential drivers that influence the distribution of assessed ecosystem services drivers include but are not limited to pressures that require mitigation e g pm10 as well as the distribution of ecosystem service beneficiaries 4 4 limitations and recommendations in this study we demonstrated how local knowledge and data can be incorporated within ecosystem service models by use of well established spatial quantification methods thereby capturing locally relevant spatial and thematic detail while instrumental a number of limitations should be articulated to users of the approach and receptors of its results first coupled human natural systems comprise a range of ecosystem services that interact with each other in a synergistic and antagonistic fashion however the difficulty of assessing multiple ecosystem services given limited resource endowments may lead to over or underestimation of ecosystem service values for instance assessed ecosystem services in this study comprise only those which were prioritised based on the literature review and semi structured interviews performed during this study s scoping phase this may lead to an underestimation of ecosystem services not considered in this study e g climate regulation by vegetation runoff reduction by field margins by potential end users second ecosystem services are not always produced and consumed in situ syrbe and walz 2012 which may lead to over or underestimation of ecosystem service production and use taking place outside of the assessed domain for instance results obtained by implementation of the air quality regulation model revealed that the hoeksche waard acts as a sink for urban pollution spill overs hence the contribution by natural elements to health is likely to be higher than the estimated value as beneficiaries residing outside of the municipality were not considered in general it is not possible to consider all elements of a system and their interactions paulin et al 2020b instead ecosystem service models can be implemented to portray a depiction of reality third this study does not deal with model uncertainty and validation uncertainty has often been overlooked within ecosystem service modelling studies haase et al 2014 due to difficulty in its examination when considering large spatial datasets schuwirth et al 2019 abily et al 2016 lilburne and tarantola 2009 moreover validation of ecosystem service indicators is often challenging due to difficulties in obtaining observations in this study obtaining observations for some ecosystem service indicators was limited due to privacy concerns e g the reduction of seven disease groups the amount of time cycled by individuals or due to their subjectivity e g the contribution of natural elements to property value in other instances obtaining the observations necessary for validation would have entailed a time consuming and expensive process e g pm10 retention by vegetation and water water storage for these reasons uncertainty analysis and validation were not considered in this study despite this limitation the act of including local data and perceptions within the ecosystem service modelling process supports its veracity and adds legitimacy to the assessment 5 conclusions in this paper an integrated approach for the spatially explicit quantification of local ecosystem services was presented we demonstrated how six well established ecosystem service assessment methods can be integrated to quantify and map locally relevant ecosystem services enabling incorporation of best available local knowledge and data in integrating various ecosystem service assessment methods we successfully quantified and mapped a diverse suite of ecosystem service supply and use indicators that span across different value domains i e ecological economic social domains even in situations where models knowledge or data were limited high resolution maps integrating local knowledge and data enabled identification of potential factors that influence ecosystem service delivery these factors include but are not limited to the typology and configuration of natural elements the presence of ecological pressures that require mitigation e g pm10 concentrations generated in urban areas and the distribution of villages that are home to ecosystem service beneficiaries total values quantified provided a glimpse of the magnitude of ecosystem service delivery in the area in units that speak to end users from various knowledge backgrounds in addition they emphasised the importance of the extent of natural elements for total ecosystem service delivery e g the effect of the extent of particular natural elements on the total delivery of sociocultural values and shed light on trade offs that exist amongst ecosystem services e g trade offs amongst sociocultural values due to their reliance on different natural landscape elements information obtained from implementation of such an approach is useful for a number of reasons it facilitates communication of the complex mechanism by which ecosystems generate value for humans to decision makers in doing so it can provide decision makers with the tools to further communicate this information to other stakeholders this information can empower stakeholders who wish to partake in the process of shaping the landscape in a way that considers their preferences and objectives by considering these preferences and objectives decision makers can set priority areas to implement measures that optimise ecosystem service delivery in an inclusive manner decision makers can additionally set ecosystem service targets for supply and use indicators given the appropriate assessment of uncertainties associated with each model to assess potential changes in ecosystem service delivery given the realisation of plausible futures e g changes in natural element distribution from implementation of spatial strategies population growth input data can be altered to reflect changes and then incorporated within models while the potential of ecosystem service modelling for integration of scientific knowledge into decision making is latent it is necessary to continue to produce biophysical and socioeconomic data relevant at various scales for their integration within models this is instrumental for increasing the accuracy of assessments and systematically articulating model uncertainties in doing so it may enhance the effectiveness of model output to support spatial planning thereby stimulating confidence in model response and hence uptake credit authorship contribution statement m j paulin methodology investigation visualization software data curation

24720,enhancing consideration of the ecosystem services concept within decision making calls for integration of local knowledge and data within assessments to capture context specific spatial and thematic detail this paper demonstrates how local knowledge and biophysical sociocultural economic data can be integrated within ecosystem service assessments by use of well established spatial quantification methods we hypothesise that ecosystem services can be spatially quantified at high spatial and thematic detail by integration of local knowledge and data within models contributing to identification of key factors that influence their delivery we demonstrate this by making use of local knowledge and data to assess ecosystem services in the hoeksche waard a dutch municipality

high spatial resolution 10 10 m enabled identification of factors that influence their delivery including the distribution and typology of natural elements ecological pressures that require mitigation

natural enemies hoverflies carabids coccinellids air quality regulation i e particulate matter retention is highest in the northeast sector of the municipality given higher concentrations of

ecosystem services are the direct and indirect benefits that ecosystems provide humans with costanza et al 2017 mea 2005 according to the common international classification of ecosystem services cices haines young and potschin 2018 ecosystem services can be classified as provisioning regulation and maintenance also regulating mea 2005 teeb 2010 and cultural services provisioning services are the material contributions that natural capital endows humans with such as crop and groundwater production for human consumption and animal feed mea 2005 regulating services are ecological processes that directly or indirectly contribute to human well being mea 2005 examples include the retention of atmospheric concentrations of harmful pollutants by vegetation and water remme et al 2018 janhäll

díaz et al 2009 breure et al 2018 cultural services are non material benefits that ecosystems provide for humans such as the spiritual recreational or intrinsic value people assign to natural elements and landscapes mea 2005 the ecosystem services concept provides an opportunity for incorporating scientific knowledge within spatial management haase et al 2014 walsh et al 2015 it can serve as a language through which science communicates to society shedding light on the various mechanisms by which ecosystems generate value for humans potschin and haines young 2016 breure et al 2012 recognising the concept s potential recent years have seen an upsurge in the number of initiatives calling for integration of ecosystem services within environmental decision making díaz et al 2015 ec 2011 cbd 2010 to meet their common objectives a number of standardised modelling approaches have been developed e g invest aries estimap tallis and polaski 2011 villa et al 2014 zulian et al 2014 maes et al 2016 their aim is to contribute to the standardisation and harmonisation of the ecosystem service spatial quantification process thereby facilitating the comparability of results across space and time despite these initiatives consideration of the ecosystem services concept within decision making remains limited haase et al 2014 walsh et al 2015 this partly results from a limited integration of spatial and thematic detail central to particular socioecological systems within assessments derkzen et al 2015 martínez lópez et al 2019 as well as challenges in the communication of complex models and their outputs to non scientist end users villa et al 2014 this limits confidence in assessment output and thereby its uptake to support spatial planning lilburne and tarantola 2009 schuwirth et al 2019 to address this challenge enhanced integration of local knowledge and data within ecosystem service models is needed martínez lópez et al 2019 orchard webb et al 2016 consideration of local knowledge and data where available is instrumental for capturing site specific sociocultural and ecological factors that influence the access to and use of ecosystem services by beneficiaries díaz et al 2018 paulin et al 2020a it also contributes to the democratisation and legitimisation of the assessment process supporting the integration of final results within decision making orchard webb et al 2016 despite these benefits standardised ecosystem service assessment models often incorporate non site specific knowledge and data as input petz et al 2017 this leads to the underrepresentation of fundamental characteristics of particular socioecological systems at the local scale martínez lópez et al 2019 in general ecosystem services research is often performed within the field of ecology luederitz et al 2015 carried out separately from economic studies and decision science rasmussen et al 2016 haase et al 2014 in addition local knowledge is often excluded from assessments oversimplifying the central role that culture plays in defining human nature interactions díaz et al 2018 incorporation of local knowledge and data within ecosystem service assessments often requires deviation from the use of standard ecosystem service models that are unsuited for capturing the spatial and thematic detail that define real world management situations villa et al 2014 martínez lópez et al 2019 in these instances the choice of suitable methods for quantifying and mapping local ecosystem services is complicated by the abundance of available methods seppelt et al 2011 methods refer to the way in which data sources are used to quantify and map ecosystem services martínez harms and balvanera 2012 the suitability of these methods may vary depending on various factors these include but are not limited to the type of ecosystem service under consideration the expertise of assessors the type of data available and time constraints eppink et al 2012 schröter et al 2015 the aim of this study is to demonstrate how local knowledge and data i e biophysical sociocultural economic data can be included within ecosystem service assessments by integration of well established

interest by local stakeholders to collaborate to meet their common objectives spatial quantification methods that were implemented in this study were conceptualised based on the seminal work of martínez harms balvanera 2012 and schröter et al 2015 who conducted extensive literature reviews to identify spatial quantification methods that are commonly implemented to map ecosystem services

agricultural focusing on the production of sugar beet and potato in rotation with a variety of other crops the spatial configuration of the area s natural elements is attributed to a long history of reclamation and cultivation the creation of the dike structure as we know it started in 1538 and the island reached its current extent in 1653 today the landscape contains different reclamation

assessment stakeholders and ecosystem services relevant to the hoeksche waard were identified the scoping consisted of two stages during the first stage a literature review was performed with two main purposes the first purpose was to obtain information on ecosystem services that are relevant in the area given current land use patterns the second purpose was to identify stakeholder groups that influence manage or benefit from the provision of ecosystem services in the area during the second stage semi structured interviews were carried out with representatives from each identified stakeholder group with two main purposes the first purpose was to obtain information on relevant ecosystem services the second purpose was to identify stakeholder groups that may have been overlooked by only assessing the literature interviewed stakeholder representatives included farmers members of local governments nature organisations the local water board and environmental organisations environmental organisations are entities that focus on the achievement of objectives shared by different stakeholder groups in this case related to nature management this stage was key for understanding stakeholder objectives and for identifying site specific ecosystem services the supplementary material appendix 1 lists identified stakeholder objectives and provides details on interviewed parties 2 3 modelling approach based on the literature review and semi structured interviews conducted during the scoping phase of the study seven ecosystem services were identified for their assessment table 1 the names ascribed to ecosystem services comprise user friendly terms that are instrumental when involving stakeholders and decision makers perhaps less knowledgeable on ecosystem services terminology and concepts paulin et al 2020a ecosystem services were operationalised into supply and use indicators capturing the biophysical and the socioeconomic aspects of ecosystem service delivery fig 2 supply captures the distribution and performance of ecosystem functions or the ecological structures and processes that contribute to human wellbeing burkard et al

are presented and described in table 2 these methods are conceptualised based on the work of martinez harms balvanera 2012 and schröter et al 2015 the selection of methods that are implemented within each model can be based on their suitability given particular resource endowments i e knowledge data time models based on causal relationships are suitable in situations where the use of readily available knowledge and data is sufficient to adequately capture local ecosystem service delivery where literature based and data based causal relationships are insufficient to adequately capture ecosystem service supply and use regression models can be implemented in doing so it may be possible to identify causal relationships amongst biophysical and socioeconomic variables however this method is considerably more time consuming compared to the use of readily available causal relationships expert elicitation provides a practical solution where causal relationships are insufficient to adequately capture local supply and use and where our mechanistic understanding of the system is insufficient jacobs and burkhard 2017 it is also key for understanding local stakeholder preferences e

ii that reference values e g obtained from previous studies or through expert elicitation are tailored to values that are relevant at the particular ecological and socioeconomic context in particular implementation of the sociocultural values model at a different site would require executing surveys with stakeholders which is a time demanding process 2 4 ecosystem services 2 4 1 crop production

harmful components of air pollution for human health it is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as mortality derkzen et al 2015 santibañez et al 2013 due to the roughness of their surface different vegetation types contribute to the retention of particulate matter remme et al 2018 janhäll 2015 in this paper the natural capital model nc model paulin et al 2020b was implemented to model the contribution by different vegetation types to reductions in atmospheric pm10 i e particulate matter with a diameter of up to 10 µm concentrations as well as associated

performance of soil biodiversity by adapting the soil biodiversity model from the soil navigator http www soilnavigator eu into a spatial model integrating local reference values and spatial data developed as part of the horizon 2020 project landmark http landmark2020 eu the soil navigator is an expert based decision tree approach that incorporates physical chemical and biological attributes i

environmental management characteristics into overarching classes at various tier levels attribute values are initially assigned performance scores e g poor moderate good based on thresholds assigned by technical scientific experts attributes are then grouped into overarching classes at higher tier levels and assigned performance levels based on expert based qualitative luts overall soil biodiversity performance i e poor moderate good performance for a particular test site is determined at the highest tier level the soil navigator comprises two models for quantifying the performance of soil biodiversity one for grasslands and one for croplands van leeuwen et al 2019 these models were adapted into a spatial model by replacing field measurements for individual attributes e g ph bulk density earthworm abundance with spatial data displaying the distribution of said attributes soil characteristics soil biophysical units maps where available where spatial data was unavailable or inadequate e g due to low spatial heterogeneity attributes were assigned reference scores e g overall poor moderate good performance by experts the supplementary material provides a detailed description of the way the model was adapted appendix 4 section 4 5 it also presents maps displaying the distribution of soil biotic and abiotic attributes which were used as input for the model

values through their interaction with natural landscape elements natural landscape elements and sociocultural values were identified during the scoping phase of this study based on the literature and semi structured interviews conducted with stakeholders identified sociocultural values that are considered in this model include cultural identity and heritage habitability intrinsic values landscape aesthetics and recreation a survey was subsequently developed and distributed by interviewed local representatives number of respondents 87 the survey enabled local stakeholders to assign a score to sociocultural values based on their perceived level of importance 0 not important 5 very important a low standard deviation was considered a robust choice for consideration of a proxy indicator rutgers et al 2012 respondents were then requested to link each sociocultural value to natural landscape elements to which they have been exposed linkages were made based on stakeholders perceived importance of natural elements for experiencing each sociocultural value respondents were allowed to choose a maximum number of three elements per sociocultural value maps displaying the distribution of natural landscape elements typologies were developed by use of multiple layer lut lut combine spatial datasets displaying the distribution of natural landscape elements vegetation land use agricultural crop parcels maps into individual layers displaying the distribution of each natural landscape element typology considered for this ecosystem service for each sociocultural value natural landscape elements were assigned a score each score is based on the average level of importance assigned to the sociocultural value and the average number of times each element was linked to it these scores were integrated within qualitative lut linking natural landscape elements to sociocultural values table 4 all calculations are available in the supplementary material appendix 4 section 4 6 2 4 7 property value natural elements increase the amenity of residential areas which reflects in property values czembrowski and kronenberg 2016 franco and macdonald 2018 the contribution of the configuration and composition of natural elements to property values was modelled by use of the nc model paulin et al 2020b the model combines spatial information on average property prices in different areas key statistical figures map and on the distribution of natural elements vegetation topographic land use maps with causal reference values obtained from the literature remme et al 2018 reference values include regression model results linking different natural element typologies e g park open water tree line and their configurations i e size distance from property with property prices daams et al 2016 ruijgrok and de groot 2006 luttik and zijlstra 1997 3 results for a comprehensive assessment of results maps displaying the spatial distribution of ecosystem services fig 5 are analysed alongside total supply and use values calculated for the municipality of the hoeksche waard table 5 maps display one supply or use indicator for each ecosystem service based on the indicators presented in table 1 in the supplementary material maps displaying the distribution of indicators modelled by use of the sociocultural values model are found appendix 7 as well as descriptive statistics and correlations for all output maps appendix 5 results from the crop production model reveal production volumes that are substantially fragmented and heterogeneous across space due to the presence of crop rotations that include a variety of cover crops while the net output of harvested crops is valued at approximately 107 million year 6800 year productive ha the value added of harvested crops net output once labour and capital costs have been deducted is estimated at less than 70 of net output results from the air quality regulation model reveal substantially higher pm10 retention levels in the northeast of the hoeksche waard an area adjacent to the cities of rotterdam and dordrecht benefits that were modelled by use of the human health and property value models are mainly visible within villages where most of the municipality s inhabitants and built up property are concentrated see built up and paved areas in fig 1 results from the pest control model illustrate the degree of suppression of pests by natural enemy populations areas in yellow score 0 comprise areas where pests are present but no biological pest control takes place while areas in dark blue score 1 5 comprise areas where pest control is most effective results from the soil biodiversity model disclose that on average soil biodiversity performs at moderate to good levels results from the sociocultural values model capture the importance of natural landscape elements for the delivery of five locally relevant cultural services in general average values for the entire area are often relatively low for indicators whose units are based on score systems pest control sociocultural values as they bundle up high and low values across the entire area an exception includes results from the soil biodiversity model where the area s average score was high as the performance of soil biodiversity is relatively high across the evaluated extent on instances where averaging ecosystem service delivery scores leads to bias towards lower values maps provide more indicative results as maps display the distribution of ecosystem service supply and use they facilitate the comparison of relative values across space 4 discussion 4 1 ecosystem services 4 1 1 crop production within the crop production model production volumes and accrued monetary values are influenced by the type of crop under production for instance on average the production kg ha of sugar beets is higher than the production of brown beans by a factor of 40 https opendata cbs nl however the market price of brown beans is higher than the price of sugar beets by a factor of 10 https www agrimatie nl in addition a number of cover crops e g english ryegrass red and white clover are less profitable but support the maintenance of soil quality within crop rotations munkholm et al 2013 all these factors ultimately influence the net output ha for each crop type since a variety of crops with different profitability levels are combined within rotation systems the net output for all crops produced 107 million year is a more adequate indication of the profitability of farming systems than net output per crop type an even more adequate measure of the sector s profitability is the value added of harvested crops 72 million year as it considers net output once labour and capital costs have been deducted 4 1 2 air quality regulation within the air quality regulation model pm10 retention is influenced by the vegetation typology and its configuration as well as the distribution of atmospheric concentrations of pm10 since land cover is relatively homogeneous across the hoeksche waard i e mainly croplands and grasslands the capacity for pm10 retention does not vary significantly instead overall pm10 retention is mainly determined by atmospheric concentrations of pm10 pm10 concentration map displayed in appendix 8 this explains why significant uptake takes place in the northeast sector of the municipality given its proximity to the cities of rotterdam and dordrecht it also reveals that while agriculture may act as a source of pm10 emissions lagerwerf et al 2019 it may also behave as a sink in this case natural elements in the hoeksche waard act as sinks for urban pollution spill overs 4 1 3 human health in the hoeksche waard total reductions in health costs and health related labour costs amount to 3 4 million and 17 million respectively these values are substantially lower than values obtained by application of the nc model in the municipality of amsterdam health costs 18 2 million health related labour costs 90 million paulin et al 2020a this can be explained by the fact that amsterdam s population is larger by a factor of 10 comprising a larger number of beneficiaries compared to the hoeksche waard despite this considerable difference the total per capita contribution of green space to reductions in health costs and health related labour costs is higher in the hoeksche waard than in amsterdam by a factor of two this can be explained by the abundance of vegetation that characterises predominant agricultural areas relative to predominantly urban areas in general human health maps share a weak correlation with other output maps r 0 0 1 with the exception of the use map modelled by use of the property value model r 0 5 this is likely the case since the contributions to human health and property value by natural elements are restricted to areas where inhabitants and built up property are concentrated which is not the case for other indicators considered 4 1 4 pest control within the pest control model pest suppression by natural enemy populations i e insects that suppress pest populations is determined by i the distribution of natural elements that act as habitat for pest organisms i e aphids and natural enemy populations i e hoverflies carabids coccinellids ii intraguild interactions predation or complementarity between natural enemy populations and iii the mobility of individual pest or natural enemy populations in the hoeksche waard the landscape is predominantly fragmented into crop fields which often serve as a habitat for aphids langoya and van rijn 2008 crop parcels are commonly surrounded by field margins and wood walls which provide habitat for aphids and their natural enemies in various combinations van rijn 2014 hence effective pest control mainly takes place inside and in the proximity of field margins and wood walls surrounding crop parcels areas where no effective pest control takes place score 0 mainly comprise extensive grasslands or croplands that are too remote from woody elements and field margins to be reached by natural enemy populations pest control seems to be most effective in the south eastern island of tiengemeten which mainly comprises natural protected areas as such it comprises a higher diversity of vegetation hosting a more diverse distribution of pest and natural enemy populations than the predominantly agricultural landscape 4 1 5 soil biodiversity on average soils in the hoeksche waard receive a performance score of good the highest achievable score that can be obtained by implementation of the soil navigator in general soil biodiversity seems to be moderately correlated with crop productivity r 0 5 this may result in part from the harmonised management style that defines the area as well as the many initiatives that seek to enhance soil biodiversity and overall quality high performance is most prominent in grasslands and non cropland natural areas see fig 1 which comprise a number of protected areas managed by nature organisations and farmer s collectives e g natuurmonumenten staatsbosbeheer rietgors foundation https www natuurmonumenten nl https www staatsbosbeheer nl www rietgorsinfo nl 4 1 6 sociocultural values on average the perceived contribution of the hoeksche waard s natural landscape elements is highest for the sociocultural value landscape aesthetics which receives a score of 3 7 table 5 on a scale of 0 to 5 unimportant to very important this occurs since a strong perceived linkage was identified between the sociocultural value and the grasslands and shrubs typology score 4 4 table 4 and as all natural landscape element typologies considered received a score no lower than 3 2 table 4 hence the score assigned to grasslands and shrubs 26 of evaluated areas and other natural landscape elements led to an average score of 3 7 meanwhile the average perceived contribution of the hoeksche waard s natural landscape elements is lowest for the sociocultural value habitability score 1 5 table 5 this is the case since the highest valued natural element typology i e large water bodies receives an intermediate score of 3 6 table 4 and has a relatively low spatial extent 6 of evaluated areas while all other typologies received lower scores leading to a relatively low average score for evaluated areas these observations shed light on the fact that average values may overlook natural element typologies that receive high scores but which do not cover large spatial extents for instance for the intrinsic values indicator ditches and creeks 17 of evaluated areas are perceived as important score 4 7 table 4 while for recreational potential trees hedges and woodwalls 9 of evaluated areas are perceived as important score 4 6 table 4 this accentuates the need to evaluate not only average values but also the spatial distribution of these values across the landscape 4 1 7 property value the contribution of natural elements to property value is estimated at 920 million this value is substantially lower than the value estimated by application of the nc model in the municipality of amsterdam 6 billion paulin et al 2020a this may occur in part due to amsterdam s larger population size and consequently higher density of built up property however the contribution of natural elements to property values is additionally influenced by the typology configuration and proximity of these elements to households in dutch cities households are often concentrated in areas which are highly sealed and surrounded by substantially lower vegetation abundance while villages in rural areas are commonly surrounded by abundant nature this explains why even though the population size in the hoeksche waard is smaller than that of amsterdam by a factor of 10 the contribution of its natural elements to property value is smaller by a factor of six in general the use map produced by implementation of the property value model is weakly correlated with other output maps r 0 0 1 with the exception of maps modelled by use of the human health model r 0 5 as with results obtained by implementation of the human health model this may occur in part since the contribution to property value by natural elements is restricted to areas where built up property is concentrated which is not the case for other indicators considered 4 2 local relevance in the hoeksche waard stakeholders share an intimate relationship with the natural landscape farmers seek to become more innovative to maintain and enhance the quality of the soils that sustain their crops while enjoying the cultural and aesthetic value of the landscape the local water board aims for safe and clean waterways https www wshd nl influenced by different drivers local governments ez 2013 south holland province 2013 and environmental organisations https www natuurmonumenten nl https www staatsbosbeheer nl www hwl nl strive to maintain and enhance the ecological and cultural value of the landscape locals value the aesthetics of grasslands and find educational and scientific potential in agricultural fields these interests are epitomised in a history of collaboration between stakeholder groups that has led to a continuous search for innovative and multifunctional agriculture van alebeek and cleveling 2005 van rijn et al 2008 agriculture defines and fragments the landscape into agricultural parcels driving the economy of the area but threatening ecosystem resilience e g soil compaction by use of heavy machinery water quality soil quality and biodiversity degradation from pesticide use to address this threat the large scale implementation of field margins seeks to suppress the use of pesticides and its negative impacts results from this study reveal effectiveness in suppression of local pests due to the presence of field margins in alignment with empirical research van rijn and wäckers 2016 it also emphasises the importance of the configuration and composition of field margins and other natural enemy habitats for effective pest suppression this may partially explain why despite substantial agriculture taking place in the area soils continue to enjoy moderate to good performance of soil biodiversity in alignment with virtually all stakeholder objectives supplementary material appendix 1 villages enjoy enhanced property values and improved health due to the abundance of vegetation in their near surroundings meanwhile this abundance of vegetation acts as a sink for atmospheric pm10 released in urban areas at the northeast of the municipality moreover the assessment of sociocultural values reveals that locals value natural elements differently based on the particular sociocultural value under consideration these values are maximised when highly valued natural landscape elements comprise large extents accentuating the spatial trade offs that exist amongst sociocultural values in the area 4 3 methodological relevance limited consideration of ecosystem service assessment results within decision making often results from the use of standardised models that are ill suited for capturing context specific spatial and thematic detail villa et al 2014 to advance consideration of the ecosystem services concept within decision making there is a need for integrating local knowledge and data within assessments to capture context specific spatial and thematic detail martínez lópez et al 2019 this study provided insights on how local knowledge and data can be incorporated to assess local ecosystem services assessing a diverse suite of locally relevant ecosystem services while integrating local knowledge and data called for integration of various well established spatial quantification methods these methods vary in suitability given particular resource endowments a key methodological advantage of considering local knowledge and data within assessments is that it enables the spatial quantification of ecosystem services at high spatial and thematic detail flexibility in the selection of spatial quantification methods is instrumental as knowledge and data availability vary across spatiotemporal gradients and may come in various forms which requires adaptability for a number of ecosystem services i e air quality regulation human health property value models from the nc model were available for their quantification making use of best available local spatial data and reference values obtained from regression models for remaining ecosystem services readily available spatial data statistical data and knowledge from empirical studies were analysed to determine how spatial quantification methods could be integrated for their assessment for the ecosystem service crop production it was possible to develop a model based on readily available local spatial data and statistics on crop production volumes and prices the abundance of spatial data on soil characteristics and the aid of technical experts i e scientists made it possible to adapt the expert based model underlying the soil navigator to model the performance of soil biodiversity for the pest control model it was difficult to obtain reference values based on regression models due to time and data constraints hence with the aid of technical experts a model was developed capturing the interactions between aphids and natural enemy populations based on the distribution of their habitats recognising that sociocultural values are largely context dependant proxy indicators for the sociocultural values model were identified and modelled through semi structured interviews and participatory exercises with stakeholders from a thematic perspective incorporating local knowledge within assessments can generate a better understanding of the socioeconomic and ecological context under assessment this facilitates the process of selecting ecosystem services that will be assessed in a way that aligns with the needs and preferences of local stakeholders as well as with local environmental characteristics the consideration of socioeconomic and ecological characteristics that define spatiotemporal gradients within models can serve as a means to enhance the legitimacy of assessment results supporting their uptake within decision making orchard webb et al 2016 in this study ecosystem services were not selected a priori but were rather identified by conducting semi structured interviews with local stakeholders and by reviewing local literature sources this led to a selection and assessment of ecosystem services of central importance in the hoeksche waard including site specific cultural services from a spatial perspective the integration of local data at a high spatial resolution where available within ecosystem service models can enable their quantification at high spatial detail this is useful for visualising the heterogeneity that characterises the distribution of ecosystem services at the local scale such level of detail is often difficult to obtain by implementing large scale standardised models that link secondary data to land use land cover these models often contribute to a binary view of what are in fact continuous and heterogeneous landscapes malinga et al 2015 sacrificing the level of spatial detail that is necessary to manage ecosystem services at the local level derkzen et al 2015 martínez lópez et al 2019 visualising the spatial distribution of ecosystem services at a high resolution enables the identification of spatial matches and mismatches between supply and use as well as potential factors that influence their distribution paulin et al 2020a in this study all models implemented made use of best available spatial data that is accepted and endorsed by dutch local governments enabling the assessment of ecosystem services at a high spatial resolution 10 10 m this was key for identifying potential drivers that influence the distribution of assessed ecosystem services drivers include but are not limited to pressures that require mitigation e g pm10 as well as the distribution of ecosystem service beneficiaries 4 4 limitations and recommendations in this study we demonstrated how local knowledge and data can be incorporated within ecosystem service models by use of well established spatial quantification methods thereby capturing locally relevant spatial and thematic detail while instrumental a number of limitations should be articulated to users of the approach and receptors of its results first coupled human natural systems comprise a range of ecosystem services that interact with each other in a synergistic and antagonistic fashion however the difficulty of assessing multiple ecosystem services given limited resource endowments may lead to over or underestimation of ecosystem service values for instance assessed ecosystem services in this study comprise only those which were prioritised based on the literature review and semi structured interviews performed during this study s scoping phase this may lead to an underestimation of ecosystem services not considered in this study e g climate regulation by vegetation runoff reduction by field margins by potential end users second ecosystem services are not always produced and consumed in situ syrbe and walz 2012 which may lead to over or underestimation of ecosystem service production and use taking place outside of the assessed domain for instance results obtained by implementation of the air quality regulation model revealed that the hoeksche waard acts as a sink for urban pollution spill overs hence the contribution by natural elements to health is likely to be higher than the estimated value as beneficiaries residing outside of the municipality were not considered in general it is not possible to consider all elements of a system and their interactions paulin et al 2020b instead ecosystem service models can be implemented to portray a depiction of reality third this study does not deal with model uncertainty and validation uncertainty has often been overlooked within ecosystem service modelling studies haase et al 2014 due to difficulty in its examination when considering large spatial datasets schuwirth et al 2019 abily et al 2016 lilburne and tarantola 2009 moreover validation of ecosystem service indicators is often challenging due to difficulties in obtaining observations in this study obtaining observations for some ecosystem service indicators was limited due to privacy concerns e g the reduction of seven disease groups the amount of time cycled by individuals or due to their subjectivity e g the contribution of natural elements to property value in other instances obtaining the observations necessary for validation would have entailed a time consuming and expensive process e g pm10 retention by vegetation and water water storage for these reasons uncertainty analysis and validation were not considered in this study despite this limitation the act of including local data and perceptions within the ecosystem service modelling process supports its veracity and adds legitimacy to the assessment 5 conclusions in this paper an integrated approach for the spatially explicit quantification of local ecosystem services was presented we demonstrated how six well established ecosystem service assessment methods can be integrated to quantify and map locally relevant ecosystem services enabling incorporation of best available local knowledge and data in integrating various ecosystem service assessment methods we successfully quantified and mapped a diverse suite of ecosystem service supply and use indicators that span across different value domains i e ecological economic social domains even in situations where models knowledge or data were limited high resolution maps integrating local knowledge and data enabled identification of potential factors that influence ecosystem service delivery these factors include but are not limited to the typology and configuration of natural elements the presence of ecological pressures that require mitigation e g pm10 concentrations generated in urban areas and the distribution of villages that are home to ecosystem service beneficiaries total values quantified provided a glimpse of the magnitude of ecosystem service delivery in the area in units that speak to end users from various knowledge backgrounds in addition they emphasised the importance of the extent of natural elements for total ecosystem service delivery e g the effect of the extent of particular natural elements on the total delivery of sociocultural values and shed light on trade offs that exist amongst ecosystem services e g trade offs amongst sociocultural values due to their reliance on different natural landscape elements information obtained from implementation of such an approach is useful for a number of reasons it facilitates communication of the complex mechanism by which ecosystems generate value for humans to decision makers in doing so it can provide decision makers with the tools to further communicate this information to other stakeholders this information can empower stakeholders who wish to partake in the process of shaping the landscape in a way that considers their preferences and objectives by considering these preferences and objectives decision makers can set priority areas to implement measures that optimise ecosystem service delivery in an inclusive manner decision makers can additionally set ecosystem service targets for supply and use indicators given the appropriate assessment of uncertainties associated with each model to assess potential changes in ecosystem service delivery given the realisation of plausible futures e g changes in natural element distribution from implementation of spatial strategies population growth input data can be altered to reflect changes and then incorporated within models while the potential of ecosystem service modelling for integration of scientific knowledge into decision making is latent it is necessary to continue to produce biophysical and socioeconomic data relevant at various scales for their integration within models this is instrumental for increasing the accuracy of assessments and systematically articulating model uncertainties in doing so it may enhance the effectiveness of model output to support spatial planning thereby stimulating confidence in model response and hence uptake credit authorship contribution statement m j paulin methodology investigation visualization software data curation

24721,as a crucial primary producer of the earth terrestrial plants play important functions in energy flow and biogeochemical cycles of the planet however their real wealth contributions to human society are not properly evaluated because of their widespread distribution and limitations in evaluation methods this study used the emergy methodology to evaluate the ecological economic value of global terrestrial plants terrestrial plants were divided into three groups of bryophytes gymnosperms and angiosperms for the emergy evaluation the area of the system boundary for terrestrial plants was 13 5 e 9 ha total annual emergy use of the terrestrial plants was 10 29 e 24 sej yr 1 which consisted of 9 19 e 24 sej yr 1 by angiosperms 1 00 e 24 sej yr 1 used by gymnosperms and 0 09 e 24 sej yr 1 by bryophytes the total emergy stored in the terrestrial plants was 648 50 e 24 sej with 550 28 e 24 sej stored in angiosperms 91 64 e 24 sej in gymnosperms and 6 58e 24 sej in bryophytes the unit emergy values uevs of the net primary production npp of terrestrial plants was calculated as 183 31 e 6 sej gc 1 for each plant group uevs were 189 00 e 6 sej gc 1 for angiosperms 145 54 e 6 sej j 1 for gymnosperms and 159 63 e 06 sej gc 1 for bryophytes the emdollar values were calculated to determine approximate monetary values for production and storage of the terrestrial plants the ecological values of the annual plant production were 5 14 trillion em for the all terrestrial plants with 4 59 trillion 0 50 trillion and 0 05 trillion em for angiosperm gymnosperm and bryophytes respectively the ecological values stored in the plant biomasses were 324 25 trillion em for all the terrestrial plans with 275 14 trillion 45 82 trillion and 3 29 trillion em for angiosperm gymnosperm and bryophytes respectively keywords ecological economic value terrestrial plant emergy analysis uev npp 1 introduction terrestrial plants are autotrophs that take the energy from the sun and initiate the carbon and energy cycle in the process of photosynthesis these primary producers store part of its generated carbon which act as a source of energy flow through the herbivores to the predators they also provide oxygen to aerobic organisms in the process of photosynthesis balvanera et al 2006 faucon et al 2017 gamfeldt et al 2013 lavorel 2013 quijas et al 2010 therefore the terrestrial plants can be considered as a foundation organism however even with these important roles the terrestrial plants are often under appreciated because of its wide and abundant distribution with on going loss of global terrestrial plants due to human driven development and climate changes hansen et al 2010 liu et al 2015 it is important to acknowledge the importance of the terrestrial plants by assessing the quantitative values until now most of valuation studies were based on the market values or surveys on wiliness to pay alexander et al 1998 boumans et al 2002 costanza et al 2014 1997 de groot et al 2012 kubiszewski et al 2017 patterson 2002 sutton and costanza 2002 while these values represent the human s appreciation of ecosystem they can also vary significantly and convey subjective values as they are based on survey results also since the economic values are assigned base on the contribution of people the contributions of the environment are often underestimated or disregarded odum 1996 to answer the question what is the real value of a tree a forest or an ecosystem it is necessary to build a robust base for valuing the ecosystem since 1950 there have been efforts to estimate the value of ecosystem of many scales base on the ecosystem energy in 1960s it was determined possible to estimate the economic and environmental values in a single unit emergy odum 1971 odum and odum 1976 the emergy accounting method uses the thermodynamic basis on materials and energy and convert them into a single form of energy the emergy accounting method produces objective results by assessing the donor value in the process of producing services or materials odum 1996 since the introduction of the emergy accounting method it was applied on various fields including nations cities industries constructions and ecosystem functions and services bisbee et al 2001 burgos et al 2017 clark et al 1998 duru et al 2015 enríquez 2017 lopes 2018 patterson 2002 pulselli et al 2011 turcato et al 2015 turetsky et al 2012 in this study we have estimate the value of terrestrial plants in global scale on taxonomic level to provide a global baseline for further plant analysis terrestrial plants have evolved into bryophytes pteridophytes gymnosperm and angiosperm since the green algae inhabited the sea between the paleozoic ordovician period and the silurian period riding and fan 2001 and have recorded about 300 000 varieties to date wang and ran 2014 they live in all parts of the earth s land and provide important ecological roles and services for each taxa in floral structures in the case of bryophytes their ecological value is relatively underestimated due to their small size and their presence on soil rocks and bark however they adapt very well in cold and high latitude regions and play a variety of ecological roles such as nutrient cycling soil erosion control microclimate control micro shelter and water retention and food supply for large animals in the tundra pakeman et al 2019 turetsky et al 2012 2010 wirth 2010 gymnosperm is a long lived evergreen tree farjon 2010 that is extremely resistant to cold dry or poorly nutrient soil environments cañas et al 2015 ellenberg and strutt 1988 wang and ran 2014 the gymnosperm also plays important roles in carbon sequestration watershed protection soil erosion protection dry habitat stabilization and food supply for wildlife coomes et al 2005 keeley 2012 susaeta et al 2016 angiosperm is currently the overwhelmingly predominated taxon accounting for 80 of the global land plant diversity providing most of the ecological services that terrestrial plants do on earth in particular about 90 of flowering plants have plant animal pollinator relationships which play the most important role in maintaining the global terrestrial ecosystem through animal plant interaction blowers et al 2017 coomes et al 2005 ollerton et al 2011 simpson and neff 1981 the plants are rapidly being destroyed by anthropogenic factors such as climate change forest damage urbanization etc as these terrestrial plants provide important ecological roles and services protection starting from the appreciation by acknowledging their value is very necessary kirilenko and sedjo 2007 laurance 1999 su et al 2012 in this study the emergy accounting method was used to estimate the value of global terrestrial plants because each taxonomic group provides different combinations of services and functions the value was estimated in not only as whole global value but also individually as in each taxonomic group bryophytes gymnosperms and angiosperms however the values expressed in emergy units i e sej yr 1 are very hard to understand for the readers outside of the emergy society therefore the results from emergy analysis can be converted into monetary units using the emergy money ratio for better comparison and understanding on the other hand the unit emergy values uevs is an important factor that represents the quality of energy therefore in this study the uevs of productivity of each taxonomic group were also estimated the ecological value of terrestrial plants estimated in global scale in this study could be a baseline for further researches on the precise local scale species level analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 system boundary olson et al 2001 delineated the terrestrial ecosystem into 14 biomes we have used this delineation with a total of 13 5 e 9 ha excluding major lakes and polar area since it is nearly impossible to precisely distinguish each taxonomic group of terrestrial vegetations we made an assumption and assigned taxonomic group to each biome based on the dominating vegetations bisbee et al 2001 bliss 1962 bliss and matveyeva 1992 gower et al 1994 hadley and szarek 1981 melillo et al 1993 nadelhoffer et al 1985 roy et al 2001 vogt 1991 whittaker and likens 1975 using the polygons of boundaries based on these assigned taxonomic groups in arcgis the emergy inputs productivity and the surface area were calculated to check the reliability of these assumption we compared the annual net primary production from our results and other previous studies since our results express production in gc we have multiplied it by the factor of 2 to get dried biomass schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 2 2 renewable emergy inputs lee and brown lee and brown 2020 estimated the value of ecosystem functions and biotic natural capital of each biome using global renewable emergy input coverages from satellite based spatial data lee and brown 2019 in this study we have used the results from these studies to estimate the value of terrestrial vegetations of each taxonomic group the emergy coverages of driving sources of biomes such as solar tidal geothermal wind evapotranspiration geopotential of runoff and chemical potential of runoff were derived from the result of lee and brown 2019 the renewable emergy inputs to each biome were computed by clipping each coverage with the boundaries of biomes the spatial distribution of biomes was derived from the terrestrial ecosystem of world teow olson et al 2001 see supplemental materials figure s 1 for the coverages to minimize the effect of double counting the total emergy was estimated by taking the largest of sum of tripartite secondary and tertiary renewable sources brown and ulgiati 2016 also to minimize the double counting effect each taxonomic group was evaluated individually and the total terrestrial plants was also evaluated individually as a single group according to lee and brown 2019 also while all of the external resources are considered in the valuing process internal processes such as nutrient cycle are not included in the valuation as they are co products of overall inputs 2 3 emergy of net primary production and stored biomass of terrestrial plants since the terrestrial plants used the renewable emergy inputs to each biome to produce the emergy value of annual production of each taxonomic group is equal to its annual emergy input the renewable emergy inputs to each biome were estimated by clipping the emergy coverages lee and brown 2019 with the biome boundaries olson et al 2001 with arcgis software the global npp data was derived from the terra modis npp and gpp product mod17a3 by nasa s land processes distributed active archive center lp daac this dataset provides yearly average global npp and gpp in 30 resolution zhao et al 2005 see supplemental materials for the coverages the productivity of each biome was computed by clipping the npp coverage with the boundaries of biomes emergy of biomass of each biome was computed by multiplying each biome s annual emergy input by its turn over time the annual emergy input was computed by using

which they are not dominating however when compared with previous studies ajtay 1979 roy et al 2001 whittaker and likens 1975 the total production amounts are well within the range as shown in table 4 therefore despite the uncertainty it is still reasonable to use the assumptions we made on the other hand the pteridophytes were the most dominant plant group in the carboniferous period and still are abundant globally however due to the limitation on data availability the pteridophytes were not included in this study further development in data availability would allow more accurate estimations of the global value of terrestrial plants 3 2 renewable emergy inputs also shown in table 3 are emergy inputs to each taxonomic group of terrestrial plants annually terrestrial plants receive about 10 29

in average the aei of global terrestrial plants is 761 62 e 12 sej ha 1 yr 1 3 3 emergy of net primary production and stored biomass of terrestrial plants as shown in table 5 annually terrestrial plants produce total of 56 10 pgc with angiosperm being largest primary producer 48 60 pgc followed by gymnosperm 6 90 pgc and bryophyte 0 59 pgc by definition the emergy value of annual production is equal to the total of annual renewable emergy inputs which are 9 19 e 24 sej yr 1 1 00 e 24 sej yr 1 and 0 09 e 24 sej yr 1 for angiosperm gymnosperm and bryophyte respectively with global total of 10

pgc emergy value of stored biomass was estimated by multiplying annual emergy inputs by the turn over time of each biome which was estimated from macroscopic minimodels the emergy values were 550 208

em and 3 29 em for angiosperm gymnosperm and bryophyte respectively with global terrestrial plant total of 324 25 trillion em 3 4 unit emergy value of net primary production and stored biomass of terrestrial plants shown in table 6 are unit emergy value expressed in specific emergy of npp and stored biomass of each taxonomic group since the angiosperm is in the most advanced state in plant evolution it had the most value per biomass produced each year 189 00 e 6 sej gc 1 however while the bryophyte was expected to have the lowest emergy per biomass due to its early state in evolution the uev of bryophyte 159 63 e 6 sej gc 1 was higher than that of gymnosperm 145 54 e 6 sej gc 1 because of the limited production of bryophyte table 5 overall the average uev of npp of global terrestrial plants was 183 31 e 6 sej gc 1 multiple researches were conducted to estimate the value of ecosystem and natural capital using the emergy accounting among these studies researches regarding the net primary production showed the uevs ranging from 3561 sej j 1 to 46 894 sej j 1 with an average of 18 785 sej j 1 table 7 brown and bardi 2001 cohen et al 2006 franzese et al 2009 lu et al 2007 prado jatar and brown 1997 tilley 1999 since these results show a specific ecosystem or a specie there are differences in the uevs when compared with the results from this study the average global terrestrial plants estimated in this study 183 31 e 6 sej gc 1 or 20 114 sej j 1 was about 40 of the highest value and close to the average among other studies this shows that emergy analysis using global spatial data performs well in estimating the value of terrestrial plants however while checking with results from previous studies an interesting result of 10 to 20 times greater uev was found 2 16 e 6 sej j 1 and 4 75 e 05 sej j 1 for aboveground biomass increase for pine trees located in italy turcato et al 2015 the largest reason for such a large difference was from allocation of input emergy while turcato et al assigned each part of a plant as a co product this study assigned the input emergy to entire above and below ground production as a split also in the study of turcato et al nutrients were considered as independent inputs while this study considered nutrient cycle as a co product of larger inputs and disregarded in the calculation to minimize the double counting brown and ulgiati 2016 the differences in method are because of the scale of the analysis national park vs global forests for example in smaller scale nutrient can be brought in from outside of system so it is proper to consider in the analysis while in global scale the nutrients are cycling within the system however as stated in a previous research while the global values provide overall data it hides details in the process of aggregating and averaging on the other hand the spatially explicit uevs using spatial data would provide more accurate results therefore it should be the next step in emergy researches lee and brown 2019 in case of stored biomass despite the early stage in evolution the bryophytes had highest emergy value per biomass 1987 85 e 6 sej gc 1 due to its limited production combined with its long turn over time gymnosperm had second highest uev 1897 71 e 6 sej gc 1 and the angiosperm had lowest uev 933 71 e 6 sej gc 1 indicating its high efficiency of production due to its favorable environment for primary production overall the average uev of stored biomass of global terrestrial plants was 1011 78 e 6 sej gc 1 the uevs can be used as a measure of quality or efficiency in case of npp the uev of angiosperm was the highest this supports the fact that the angiosperms have the highest quality since they are the most advanced types of plants evolutionarily on the other hand the bryophyte showed the highest uev in stored biomass which means it costs more emergy to store same amount of biomass this most likely because of the harsh environment and slow turn over time of the taigas and tundras where bryophytes can be easily found making these biomes the least efficient ecosystem in term of stored biomass 4 conclusion in this dynamic world with climate changes diversity loss excessive development and more we should be aware of the importance of the ecosystem around us one way to raise the awareness is to put it in a form of money which most people can sense the magnitude easily based on our study the global annual terrestrial npp is worth about em 5 trillion this is close to the gdp of japan 5 15 trillion in 2019 which is the nation with 4th largest economy in the world the biomass stored in terrestrial plants is worth about 324 trillion em total which is about 4 times the amount of gross world product gwp in 2017 80 trillion cia 2019 in the previous researches costanza et al 2014 1997 the value of ecosystem service from global forest each year was first estimated as 6 5 trillion then updated to 16 2 trillion while they explain that the changes in values are due to better understandings of ecosystem the value estimated by assigning value to each service category based on surveys and market prices and summing it all is always vulnerable to changes changes happen when we discover new service categories make changes in our opinion or appreciation towards ecosystems due to personal experience or education or simply changes in market price due to dynamics of supply and demand this results in the survey based methods to be subjective on the other hand the value estimated by using emergy accounting method are robust to changes from the receiver side because this method estimates the value based on the energy that went into the process however the limitation of the emergy accounting method is that it only takes into account energetic values leaving non energetic values such as cultural or social values unaccounted the methods for assessing the value of ecosystem are still improving when the strengths of different methods get combined it will produce a better method in ecosystem evaluation whichever the methods are the goal of assessing the ecosystem is to show the value in an understandable form to raise awareness on importance of the ecosystem therefore interdisciplinary researches in multiple scales and approaches are needed to improve the method of estimating the value of ecosystem are necessary also using the results from this study as a baseline further researches in smaller spatial or taxonomical scale are necessary to increase the precision of estimating the value of the ecosystem credit authorship contribution statement dong joo lee conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft

24721,as a crucial primary producer of the earth terrestrial plants play important functions in energy flow and biogeochemical cycles of the planet however their real wealth contributions to human society are not properly evaluated because of their widespread distribution and limitations in evaluation methods this study used the emergy methodology to evaluate the ecological economic value of global terrestrial plants terrestrial plants were divided into three groups of bryophytes gymnosperms and angiosperms for the emergy evaluation the area of the system boundary for terrestrial plants was 13 5 e 9 ha total annual emergy use of the terrestrial plants was 10 29 e 24 sej yr 1 which consisted of 9 19 e 24 sej yr 1 by angiosperms 1 00 e 24 sej yr 1 used by gymnosperms and 0 09 e 24 sej yr 1 by bryophytes the total emergy stored in the terrestrial plants was 648 50 e 24 sej with 550 28 e 24 sej stored in angiosperms 91 64 e 24 sej in gymnosperms and 6 58e 24 sej in bryophytes the unit emergy values uevs of the net primary production npp of terrestrial plants was calculated as 183 31 e 6 sej gc 1 for each plant group uevs were 189 00 e 6 sej gc 1 for angiosperms 145 54 e 6 sej j 1 for gymnosperms and 159 63 e 06 sej gc 1 for bryophytes the emdollar values were calculated to determine approximate monetary values for production and storage of the terrestrial plants the ecological values of the annual plant production were 5 14 trillion em for the all terrestrial plants with 4 59 trillion 0 50 trillion and 0 05 trillion em for angiosperm gymnosperm and bryophytes respectively the ecological values stored in the plant biomasses were 324 25 trillion em for all the terrestrial plans with 275 14 trillion 45 82 trillion and 3 29 trillion em for angiosperm gymnosperm and bryophytes respectively keywords ecological economic value terrestrial plant emergy analysis uev npp 1 introduction terrestrial plants are autotrophs that take the energy from the sun and initiate the carbon and energy cycle in the process of photosynthesis these primary producers store part of its generated carbon which act as a source of energy flow through the herbivores to the predators they also provide oxygen to aerobic organisms in the process of photosynthesis balvanera et al 2006 faucon et al 2017 gamfeldt et al 2013 lavorel 2013 quijas et al 2010 therefore the terrestrial plants can be considered as a foundation organism however even with these important roles the terrestrial plants are often under appreciated because of its wide and abundant distribution with on going loss of global terrestrial plants due to human driven development and climate changes hansen et al 2010 liu et al 2015 it is important to acknowledge the importance of the terrestrial plants by assessing the quantitative values until now most of valuation studies were based on the market values or surveys on wiliness to pay alexander et al 1998 boumans et al 2002 costanza et al 2014 1997 de groot et al 2012 kubiszewski et al 2017 patterson 2002 sutton and costanza 2002 while these values represent the human s appreciation of ecosystem they can also vary significantly and convey subjective values as they are based on survey results also since the economic values are assigned base on the contribution of people the contributions of the environment are often underestimated or disregarded odum 1996 to answer the question what is the real value of a tree a forest or an ecosystem it is necessary to build a robust base for valuing the ecosystem since 1950 there have been efforts to estimate the value of ecosystem of many scales base on the ecosystem energy in 1960s it was determined possible to estimate the economic and environmental values in a single unit emergy odum 1971 odum and odum 1976 the emergy accounting method uses the thermodynamic basis on materials and energy and convert them into a single form of energy the emergy accounting method produces objective results by assessing the donor value in the process of producing services or materials odum 1996 since the introduction of the emergy accounting method it was applied on various fields including nations cities industries constructions and ecosystem functions and services bisbee et al 2001 burgos et al 2017 clark et al 1998 duru et al 2015 enríquez 2017 lopes 2018 patterson 2002 pulselli et al 2011 turcato et al 2015 turetsky et al 2012 in this study we have estimate the value of terrestrial plants in global scale on taxonomic level to provide a global baseline for further plant analysis terrestrial plants have evolved into bryophytes pteridophytes gymnosperm and angiosperm since the green algae inhabited the sea between the paleozoic ordovician period and the silurian period riding and fan 2001 and have recorded about 300 000 varieties to date wang and ran 2014 they live in all parts of the earth s land and provide important ecological roles and services for each taxa in floral structures in the case of bryophytes their ecological value is relatively underestimated due to their small size and their presence on soil rocks and bark however they adapt very well in cold and high latitude regions and play a variety of ecological roles such as nutrient cycling soil erosion control microclimate control micro shelter and water retention and food supply for large animals in the tundra pakeman et al 2019 turetsky et al 2012 2010 wirth 2010 gymnosperm is a long lived evergreen tree farjon 2010 that is extremely resistant to cold dry or poorly nutrient soil environments cañas et al 2015 ellenberg and strutt 1988 wang and ran 2014 the gymnosperm also plays important roles in carbon sequestration watershed protection soil erosion protection dry habitat stabilization and food supply for wildlife coomes et al 2005 keeley 2012 susaeta et al 2016 angiosperm is currently the overwhelmingly predominated taxon accounting for 80 of the global land plant diversity providing most of the ecological services that terrestrial plants do on earth in particular about 90 of flowering plants have plant animal pollinator relationships which play the most important role in maintaining the global terrestrial ecosystem through animal plant interaction blowers et al 2017 coomes et al 2005 ollerton et al 2011 simpson and neff 1981 the plants are rapidly being destroyed by anthropogenic factors such as climate change forest damage urbanization etc as these terrestrial plants provide important ecological roles and services protection starting from the appreciation by acknowledging their value is very necessary kirilenko and sedjo 2007 laurance 1999 su et al 2012 in this study the emergy accounting method was used to estimate the value of global terrestrial plants because each taxonomic group provides different combinations of services and functions the value was estimated in not only as whole global value but also individually as in each taxonomic group bryophytes gymnosperms and angiosperms however the values expressed in emergy units i e sej yr 1 are very hard to understand for the readers outside of the emergy society therefore the results from emergy analysis can be converted into monetary units using the emergy money ratio for better comparison and understanding on the other hand the unit emergy values uevs is an important factor that represents the quality of energy therefore in this study the uevs of productivity of each taxonomic group were also estimated the ecological value of terrestrial plants estimated in global scale in this study could be a baseline for further researches on the precise local scale species level analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 system boundary olson et al 2001 delineated the terrestrial ecosystem into 14 biomes we have used this delineation with a total of 13 5 e 9 ha excluding major lakes and polar area since it is nearly impossible to precisely distinguish each taxonomic group of terrestrial vegetations we made an assumption and assigned taxonomic group to each biome based on the dominating vegetations bisbee et al 2001 bliss 1962 bliss and matveyeva 1992 gower et al 1994 hadley and szarek 1981 melillo et al 1993 nadelhoffer et al 1985 roy et al 2001 vogt 1991 whittaker and likens 1975 using the polygons of boundaries based on these assigned taxonomic groups in arcgis the emergy inputs productivity and the surface area were calculated to check the reliability of these assumption we compared the annual net primary production from our results and other previous studies since our results express production in gc we have multiplied it by the factor of 2 to get dried biomass schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 2 2 renewable emergy inputs lee and brown lee and brown 2020 estimated the value of ecosystem functions and biotic natural capital of each biome using global renewable emergy input coverages from satellite based spatial data lee and brown 2019 in this study we have used the results from these studies to estimate the value of terrestrial vegetations of each taxonomic group the emergy coverages of driving sources of biomes such as solar tidal geothermal wind evapotranspiration geopotential of runoff and chemical potential of runoff were derived from the result of lee and brown 2019 the renewable emergy inputs to each biome were computed by clipping each coverage with the boundaries of biomes the spatial distribution of biomes was derived from the terrestrial ecosystem of world teow olson et al 2001 see supplemental materials figure s 1 for the coverages to minimize the effect of double counting the total emergy was estimated by taking the largest of sum of tripartite secondary and tertiary renewable sources brown and ulgiati 2016 also to minimize the double counting effect each taxonomic group was evaluated individually and the total terrestrial plants was also evaluated individually as a single group according to lee and brown 2019 also while all of the external resources are considered in the valuing process internal processes such as nutrient cycle are not included in the valuation as they are co products of overall inputs 2 3 emergy of net primary production and stored biomass of terrestrial plants since the terrestrial plants used the renewable emergy inputs to each biome to produce the emergy value of annual production of each taxonomic group is equal to its annual emergy input the renewable emergy inputs to each biome were estimated by clipping the emergy coverages lee and brown 2019 with the biome boundaries olson et al 2001 with arcgis software the global npp data was derived from the terra modis npp and gpp product mod17a3 by nasa s land processes distributed active archive center lp daac this dataset provides yearly average global npp and gpp in 30 resolution zhao et al 2005 see supplemental materials for the coverages the productivity of each biome was computed by clipping the npp coverage with the boundaries of biomes emergy of biomass of each biome was computed by multiplying each biome s annual emergy input by its turn over time the annual emergy input was computed by using the emergy coverages from lee and brown 2019 the turn over times of each biomes were derived from a macroscopic minimodel odum and odum 2000 that had an autocatalytic structure utilizing flow limited

found 2 16 e 6 sej j 1 and 4 75 e 05 sej j 1 for aboveground biomass increase for pine trees located in italy turcato et al 2015 the largest reason for such a large difference was from allocation of input emergy while turcato et al assigned each part of a plant as a co product this study assigned the input emergy to entire above and below ground production as a split also in the study of turcato et al nutrients were considered as independent inputs while this study considered nutrient cycle as a co product of larger inputs and disregarded in the calculation to minimize the double counting brown and ulgiati 2016 the differences in method are because of the scale of the analysis national park vs global forests for example in smaller scale nutrient can be brought in from outside of system so it is proper to consider in the analysis while in global scale the nutrients are cycling within the system however as stated in a previous research while the global values provide overall data it hides details in the process of aggregating and averaging on the other hand the spatially explicit uevs using spatial data would provide more accurate results therefore it should be the next step in emergy researches lee and brown 2019 in case of stored biomass despite the early stage in evolution the bryophytes had highest emergy value per biomass 1987 85 e 6 sej gc 1 due to its limited production combined with its long turn over time gymnosperm had second highest uev 1897 71 e 6 sej gc 1 and the angiosperm had lowest uev 933 71 e 6 sej gc 1 indicating its high efficiency of production due to its favorable environment for primary production overall the average uev of stored biomass of global terrestrial plants was 1011 78 e 6 sej gc 1 the uevs can be used as a measure of quality or efficiency in case of npp the uev of angiosperm was the highest this supports the fact that the angiosperms have the highest quality since they are the most advanced types of plants evolutionarily on the other hand the bryophyte showed the highest uev in stored biomass which means it costs more emergy to store same amount of biomass this most likely because of the harsh environment and slow turn over time of the taigas and tundras where bryophytes can be easily found making these biomes the least efficient ecosystem in term of stored biomass 4 conclusion in this dynamic world with climate changes diversity loss excessive development and more we should be aware of the importance of the ecosystem around us one way to raise the awareness is to put it in a form of money which most people can sense the magnitude easily based on our study the global annual terrestrial npp is worth about em 5 trillion this is close to the gdp of japan 5 15 trillion in 2019 which is the nation with 4th largest economy in the world the biomass stored in terrestrial plants is worth about 324 trillion em total which is about 4 times the amount of gross world product gwp in 2017 80 trillion cia 2019 in the previous researches costanza et al 2014 1997 the value of ecosystem service from global forest each year was first estimated as 6 5 trillion then updated to 16 2 trillion while they explain that the changes in values are due to better understandings of ecosystem the value estimated by assigning value to each service category based on surveys and market prices and summing it all is always vulnerable to changes changes happen when we discover new service categories make changes in our opinion or appreciation towards ecosystems due to personal experience or education or simply changes in market price due to dynamics of supply and demand this results in the survey based methods to be subjective on the other hand the value estimated by using emergy accounting method are robust to changes from the receiver side because this method estimates the value based on the energy that went into the process however the limitation of the emergy accounting method is that it only takes into account energetic values leaving non energetic values such as cultural or social values unaccounted the methods for assessing the value of ecosystem are still improving when the strengths of different methods get combined it will produce a better method in ecosystem evaluation whichever the methods are the goal of assessing the ecosystem is to show the value in an understandable form to raise awareness on importance of the ecosystem therefore interdisciplinary researches in multiple scales and approaches are needed to improve the method of estimating the value of ecosystem are necessary also using the results from this study as a baseline further researches in smaller spatial or taxonomical scale are necessary to increase the precision of estimating the value of the ecosystem credit authorship contribution statement dong joo lee conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft

24722,territorial behavior is a fundamental and conspicuous behavior within numerous species but the mechanisms driving territory selection remain uncertain theory and empirical precedent indicate that many animals select territories economically to satisfy resource requirements for survival and reproduction based on benefits of food resources and costs of competition and travel costs of competition may vary by competitive ability and costs of predation risk may also drive territory selection habitat structure resource requirements conspecific density and predator distribution and abundance are likely to further influence territorial behavior we developed a mechanistic spatially explicit individual based model to better understand how animals select particular territories the model was based on optimal selection of individual patches for inclusion in a territory according to their net value i e benefits food resources minus costs travel competition predation risk simulations produced predictions for what may be observed empirically if such optimization drives placement and characteristics of territories simulations consisted of sequential iterative selection of territories by simulated animals that interacted to defend and maintain territories results explain why certain patterns in space use are commonly observed and when and why these patterns may differ from the norm for example more clumped or abundant food resources are predicted to result on average in smaller territories with more overlap strongly different resource requirements for individuals or groups in a population will directly affect space use and are predicted to cause different responses under identical conditions territories are predicted to decrease in size with increasing population density which can enable a population s density of territories to change at faster rates than their spatial distribution due to competition less competitive territory holders are generally predicted to have larger territories in order to accumulate sufficient resources which could produce an ideal despotic distribution of territories interestingly territory size is predicted to often show a curvilinear response to increases in predator densities and territories are predicted to be larger where predators are more clumped in distribution predictions consistent with empirical observations provide support for optimal patch selection as a mechanism for the economical territories of animals commonly observed in nature keywords benefits and costs economical behavior individual based model mechanistic model optimality model territoriality 1 introduction territorial behavior is a fundamental and conspicuous feature observed in numerous species across diverse taxa adams 2001 brown and orians 1970 burt 1943 maher and lott 2000 territoriality occurs when an animal defends a portion of its home range the space it uses for foraging mating and raising young burt 1943 and is hypothesized to have evolved to protect limited resources brown 1964 or young wolff and peterson 1998 for territoriality to occur resources should be economically defendable i e benefits obtained should outweigh costs of ownership brown 1964 economic defendability may be influenced by factors related to population density and the quantity quality distribution or predictability of resources maher and lott 2000 the extent of competition for resources and their economic defendability likely help explain the range of territorial behaviors observed brown 1964 only some populations within a given species may exhibit territorial behavior if resources are not economically defendable range wide although many territories are defended seasonally e g during the breeding season animals may defend territories year round if economical where the entire home range is economically defendable territories may encompass most or all of the home range as observed e g for gray wolves canis lupus mech and boitani 2003 african lions panthera leo packer et al 1990 white throated magpie jays calocitta formosa langen and vehrencamp 1998 and red capped cardinals paroaria gularis eason 1992 conversely animals may defend a portion of their home range if only specific resources are economically defendable hixon 1980 as observed e g for hawaiian honey creepers vestiaria coccinea carpenter and macmillen 1976 rufous hummingbirds selasphorus rufus hixon et al 1983 and sanderlings calidris alba myers et al 1979 many territories are held by a solitary individual or breeding pair group territoriality is relatively uncommon but likely influences a territory s economic defendability e g larger packs of ethiopian wolves canis simensis sillero zubiri and macdonald 1998 and prides of lions packer et al 1990 appear more competitive in confrontations with smaller groups territoriality can strongly influence population dynamics by structuring the spatial distribution of individuals territoriality limits the number of individuals who can use an area limited space for territories can influence the number of individuals who can breed brown 1964 affecting reproductive rates as well as a population s social structure in some species individuals unable to claim their own territories e g due to lack of available space or adequate resources bide time within their natal territories affecting the spatial distribution of individuals and thus the population s social structure for cooperative breeders this also influences the number of helpers to the breeding pair e g in gray wolves mech and boitani 2003 which can affect recruitment rates ausband et al 2017 by influencing the spatial distribution of individuals territoriality can also influence disease transmission by potentially limiting the spread of pathogens among individuals or groups altizer et al 2003 craft et al 2011 a population s space use can furthermore affect the spatial distributions of other species including competitors predators and prey creel et al 2005 fortin et al 2005 hebblewhite and merrill 2008 kie 1999 proffitt et al 2009 1 1 hypothesized drivers of territorial behavior the specific mechanisms driving territory selection are widely hypothesized but poorly understood individuals presumably have been shaped by natural selection darwin 1859 to select economical territories that maximize benefits over costs of territorial behavior brown 1964 emlen and oring 1977 krebs and kacelnik 1991 economical territory selection could mean defending only enough area to provide the amount of resources necessary to survive and reproduce mitchell and powell 2004 2007 2012 a primary benefit of many territories is hypothesized to be exclusive access to food resources fig 1 brown 1964 hixon 1980 carpenter 1987 maher and lott 2000 adams 2001 the heterogeneous distribution and abundance of food resources should thus affect territory selection and resulting space use in other cases primary benefits of territories can be burrows den or nest sites or other limiting resources maher and lott 2000 an individual s resource requirements can also affect territory selection fig 1 resource requirements increase with body size gittleman and harvey 1982 mcnab 1963 tamburello et al 2015 which in turn can vary by sex and age because movement to access and defend territorial space requires energy travel costs should be a primary cost of maintaining territories mitchell and powell 2004 2007 2012 because territories partially or completely exclude conspecifics intraspecific competition e g maintaining boundary marks signaling fighting or responding to resource depression should be a primary cost of maintaining territories fig 1 brown 1964 hixon 1980 carpenter 1987 competition may have variable effects on territory selection at different competitor densities competitive ability could also influence costs of competition by causing less competitive territory holders to pay higher costs to compete for space when challenged by a stronger competitor costs of predation risk may influence territory selection for some animals especially where predation risk is high fig 1 sargeant et al 1987 whittington et al 2005 rich et al 2012 when animals avoid areas associated with predators e g whittington et al 2004 lesmerises et al 2012 the distribution and abundance of predators could affect how animals use space if these benefits and costs influence the economics of territory selection as hypothesized they are likely to have interacting effects for example low costs of competition may enable individuals to pay higher costs of travel enabling a larger territory to be held an increase in any one cost however will decrease a territory s economic value unless the territory holder can reduce other costs or increase benefits obtained for example an increase in population size can lead to rapid increases in costs of competition requiring the territory holder to reassess its territory boundaries these interacting effects add complexity to economical territories and merit further attention to better understand animal space use 1 2 objectives we sought to understand mechanisms driving territory selection we approached this by integrating optimality models with competitor interaction models these two theoretical approaches to studying territoriality have largely been developed independently adams 2001 optimality models entail analyzing costs and benefits of a single territory holder s decisions to discern fitness maximizing rules for behavior adams 2001 krebs and kacelnik 1991 and produce predictions for optimal territory size e g dill 1978 hixon et al 1983 optimality models generally omit explicit interactions among competitors however and can be difficult to test adams 2001 conversely competitor interaction models incorporate density dependent effects by focusing on decisions of individuals as they interact with competitors adams 2001 a model for optimal home ranges that also accounted for resource depression by conspecifics was presented by mitchell and powell 2004 the model was based on optimal selection of patches to include in a home range not optimal movements simulated animals sequentially selected patches in order of their realized value v equal to the resource value of a patch v divided by costs of regularly traveling to that patch represented by distance d until reaching a threshold where adding further patches would yield no further fitness benefit mitchell and powell 2007 2012 used the model to predict optimal home ranges of telemetered black bears ursus americanus in the appalachian mountains of north carolina usa independent of field data collected from the bears they found that optimal selection of home ranges to meet resource requirements in an area as small as possible i e area minimization fig 2 strongly predicted second order selection of home ranges johnson 1980 by telemetered bears although this model allowed for depression of v by conspecifics it did not more explicitly address competition by allowing agents to respond to conspecific home ranges and thus could not evaluate mechanisms of territoriality to understand space use of territorial animals we developed a mechanistic spatially explicit individual based model of optimal patch selection building on mitchell and powell 2004 s foundation we included additional costs of predation risk and competition which we hypothesized affect territorial space use importantly to understand space use of territorial animals we added dynamic competition among competitors where territory holders adapted their use of space to keep it as economical as possible each time an adjacent conspecific imposed new costs of competition by contesting territory borders we used the model to simulate territory selection for populations of animals with differing resource requirements in heterogeneous landscapes with variable food distributions and abundances competitor densities and predator distributions and abundances these simulations produced empirically testable predictions for patterns in relative territory size territory overlap and carrying capacity and enabled understanding the influence of individual factors and their interactions on territories of animals 2 methods we developed the mechanistic model for territory selection in

and details odd framework of individual based models grimm et al 2006 2010 2 1 simulated landscapes we represented each landscape as a continuous grid of 200 200 patches fig 3 each patch varied by its food resources b and presence of predators p to understand the effects of variable spatial distributions and abundances of food and predators landscapes varied in food distribution spatial distribution of patches with high b evenly distributed moderately clumped or highly clumped food abundance landscape wide σb low medium or high and across food distributions predator distribution spatial distribution of patches with high p evenly distributed moderately clumped or highly clumped and predator abundance landscape wide σp none low medium or high and across predator distributions with an abundance of none representing a landscape with no predators or scenario in which costs of predation risk were unimportant to how animals selected territories 2 2 agents agents represented either individuals for solitary species breeding pairs for species maintaining breeding territories or groups for group living species agents were assigned a threshold of food resources for survival and reproduction vt set to low medium or high all agents received the same vt within a given simulation agents were randomly assigned a competitive ability caagent 1 10 where 1 low competitive ability and 10 high competitive ability equal values could alternatively be applied to all agents if desired each agent s objective was to maximize fitness by pursuing an economical territory reproduction was implicit whereby acquiring a territory was assumed to yield reproduction opportunities 2 3 territory selection for each simulation territories and competition among agents emerged on the landscape fig 4 appendix a at the start of each simulation a landscape configuration and vt was specified a new focal agent ai was added to the landscape and moved to an unowned patch centered in a neighborhood of patches with high value quantified as having high b and low p this patch became ai s territory center the value of each patch vn relative to the territory center was calculated vn accounted for the benefit of food b contained within patch n discounted by cumulative costs of competition travel and predation risk to reach it from the territory center representing the average costs that would be incurred to reach patch n from any patch in the territory mitchell and powell 2004 1 v n b c σ t σ p σ c σ was the cumulative cost of competition competitors are more likely to be encountered with

patches with predators incurred costs of predation risk regardless of whether predators were present in the destination patch n after determining patch values patches were added to ai s territory in order of vn until σvn vt ai s territory consisted of selected patches patches selected for the territory to satisfy vt and travel corridors patches used to reach selected patches from the territory center but not selected to satisfy vt the territory center was then assessed if ai s selected territory center the territory s geographic center i e x and y coordinates of ai s patches ai s current territory was discarded ai was repositioned to this geographic center patch values were recalculated and a new territory was selected once the territory center its geographic center we summarized ai s of selected patches territory size of patches selected of travel corridors territory overlap percentage of the territory overlapped by other territories total resources acquired σvn and initial competitor density σar at territory establishment each ar next determined if there was overlap with neighbors for selected patches if yes the ar s territory was shifted if patches formerly selected had become uneconomical or patches formerly ignored had become economical e g due to less competition for those patches fig 5 effects of competition were thus dynamic i e changing continuously throughout a simulation and density dependent once all territories were shifted as needed to maintain economical territories a new ai was added to the landscape if sufficient resources remained for additional agents to form territories once the landscape was saturated e g fig 6 the simulation ended 2 4 simulation experiments and analyses we conducted simulation experiments to generate data for summarizing effects of food resource requirements competition competitive ability and predation risk on territorial space use we completed 25 simulations for each combination of input variable for landscape e g fig 3 and resource requirements 100 300 and 500 to represent low medium and high requirements totaling 8100 simulations conducting 25 simulations per combination captured variability in results we collected output summaries for each territory formed after initial establishment at a low population density once 10 territories were formed and after carrying capacity was reached i e ai could not successfully build more territories representing a high population density we recorded for each ar its final territory size territory overlap number of nearby competitors of other ar territory centers 25 patches from the agent s territory border and predator density encountered mean predator presence per territory patch we recorded the total abundance of territories as the landscape s carrying capacity we used program r version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 and packages dplyr wickham et al 2019 ggplot2 wickham 2016 cowplot wilke 2019 and egg auguie 2019 to summarize and display mean number of selected patches territory size and territory overlap as a function of food distribution food abundance resource requirements and population density we also summarized mean final territory size and overlap by number of nearby competitors initial competitor density competitive ability predator density and predator distribution we scaled each agent s number of nearby competitors by the agent s territory size because larger territories often have more neighbors we summarized the mean carrying capacity of each landscape because the importance of costs of competition travel and predation risk relative to one another and benefits of food resources is unknown we completed a sensitivity analysis with a range of potential relative costs appendix b 3 results agents formed 458 000 simulated territories in total territories were influenced by food resources resource requirements competition and predation risk as follows 3 1 effects of food resources and resource requirements resource requirements food distribution and food abundance affected mean number of patches selected territory size territory overlap and carrying capacity greater resource requirements led to greater number of selected patches larger territories and less overlap fig 7 table 1 more clumped or abundant food resources led to fewer selected patches and smaller territories at high population densities overlap was greater where food resources were more clumped increased food abundance led to less overlap for agents with low resource requirements and more overlap for agents with medium or high resource requirements carrying capacity was higher where food resources were more clumped or abundant and declined with increasing resource requirements fig 8 3 2 effects of competition competition caused each agent s territory to change throughout the simulation as population density increased e g fig 5 territory size decreased and overlap increased with each additional nearby competitor fig 9 table 1 as an exception however when agents had low resource requirements territories initially increased in size as the number of nearby competitors increased to low levels the competitor density an agent encountered at territory establishment also influenced its territory size and overlap fig 10 although nearly all territories compressed from initial sizes as competition increased territories first established at low levels of competition where food resources were highly clumped slightly expanded instead the same was true where food resources were moderately clumped if agents had low resource requirements average territory size and number of patches selected slightly changed as population density increased from low to high in any given landscape fig 7 table 1 at high population densities mean number of selected patches was often slightly greater mean territory size at high population densities was slightly greater if food resources were highly clumped but smaller if food resources were evenly distributed territory size and overlap varied by competitive ability fig 11 table 1 greater competitive ability led to smaller territories where food resources were moderately or highly clumped and had a limited effect where food resources were evenly distributed greater competitive ability led to less overlap when agents had high resource requirements the same was true for agents with medium resource requirements unless food resources were highly clumped for agents with low resource requirements overlap increased with competitive ability except where food resources were evenly distributed 3 3 effects of predation risk territory size often increased and then decreased curvilinearly with an increase in mean density of predators in the territory fig 12 table 1 this relationship was more linear however if food resources were evenly distributed or moderately clumped while predators were highly clumped at comparable predator densities territories were on average larger where predators were more clumped in distribution overlap had nuanced and variable relationships with predator distribution and this relationship interacted with the distribution of food resources encountered carrying capacity declined as predator abundance increased fig 8 3 4 sensitivity analyses in assessing patch values for agents we used low values for the relative costs of competition travel and predation risk c r e l a t i v e c o s t t r e l a t i v e c o s t and p r e l a t i v e c o s t this decision had limited effects on the model s predictions appendix b the main effect of increasing these values was to reduce and then eliminate overlap among territories additionally higher relative costs of travel and predation risk prevented agents with higher resource requirements from forming territories higher relative costs also increasingly eliminated differences in territory size among variable competitive abilities 4 discussion we developed a mechanistic spatially explicit individual based model to better understand mechanisms hypothesized to drive territory selection the model differed from existing mechanistic territory models by blending optimality and competitor interaction approaches to selecting patches for inclusion in a territory second order selection johnson 1980 rather than modeling third order animal movements as demonstrated e g by lewis and murray 1993 white et al 1996 moorcroft et al 1999 2006 giuggioli et al 2011 potts and lewis 2014 our model was based on a single decision rule do or do not select a patch based on its benefits and costs and produced spatially explicit predictions for territory location size overlap and carrying capacity model simulations conducted across a broad range of landscape conditions and using no field data produced predictions these predictions specify what may be observed empirically if the hypotheses explicit in our model explain selection of territories and how this process structures spatial distributions and carrying capacities on different landscapes 4 1 clumped and abundant food resources yield smaller territories if animals select territories economically based in part on benefits of food resources territories are predicted to be smaller and generally have more overlap with neighbors where food resources are more clumped or abundant fig 7 table 1 more clumped or abundant food resources provide economical territory sites by offering more resources close by minimizing travel costs and enabling acquisition of sufficient resources in smaller territories as vacant space becomes sparse competitors are likely to be attracted to these same clumped or abundant food resources yielding high densities of small overlapping territories this interaction of patch selection with landscape characteristics is predicted to cause carrying capacity to be greater in areas with more clumped or abundant food resources fig 8 fluctuations in a food resource can be expected to cause territory size territory overlap and carrying capacity of a dependent species to fluctuate in response these patterns are consistent with those observed empirically in numerous species table 2 supporting the hypothesis that many animals select territories economically based in part on benefits of food resources when different relationships are observed between food resources and territory size e g norman and jones 1984 the mechanisms driving territory selection may differ from those we modeled for example animals may attempt to maximize the resources they obtain by defending a territory to contain as many resources as possible if this increases survival and reproductive output schoener 1983 stephens and krebs 1986 krebs and kacelnik 1991 no relationship between food resources and territory size is expected where territoriality functions to defend non food resources such as water or denning sites macdonald and johnson 2015 mates macdonald 1983 or young wolff and peterson 1998 our results may apply to these scenarios however if the distribution and abundance of non food resources are similar to the food resources in our landscapes fig 3 inconsistency with our model predictions provides a rigorous platform for developing additional mechanistic hypotheses that could account for such differences e g including different or additional resources such as food and den sites because energetic requirements increase with body mass mcnab 1963 tamburello et al 2015 numerous predictions for territorial space use are tied to body size larger animals are predicted to have larger territories with less overlap and a smaller maximum population size figs 7 11 table 1 this pattern is well known table 2 predictions also mean that in solitary sexually dimorphic species territory size is likely to be larger for the larger sex fig 7 as has been observed table 2 although males in polygynous species are commonly thought to have large territories to gain access to multiple females macdonald 1983 greater resource requirements could also contribute to this pattern because resource requirements are also predicted to interact with effects of competition figs 9 11 larger individuals may respond differently to competition than smaller individuals within the same species for example as the number of nearby competitors increases territory size is predicted to initially increase for smaller individuals and decrease for larger individuals fig 9 a simplifying assumption of our model was that animals can determine the quality of patches when selecting territories even when quality fluctuates temporally e g due to seasonal food resources or competitor induced resource depression or depletion it is expected that natural selection has shaped animals to suitably detect patch quality if this assumption is violated observed patterns may be more variable have more outliers or mismatch the patterns predicted by our model because many food benefits shift seasonally animals that maintain year round territories would need to select a territory to account for seasonal shifts in food or adjust seasonal territories in such scenarios model predictions may be most applicable to seasonal patterns in territorial space use if defense becomes uneconomical due to too high variability in patch quality territories may be replaced by undefended home ranges or nomadism powell et al 1997 teitelbaum and mueller 2019 alternatively resource depression or depletion alone may strongly limit overlapping space use by imposing significant costs of competition even absent direct territorial defense mitchell and powell 2004 spencer 2012 our modeling approach can be adapted to evaluate temporal changes in food abundances and resulting patch quality 4 2 competition generally compresses territories as an outcome of economical territory selection territories are predicted to compress and increase in overlap as neighboring conspecifics pose increased competition figs 9 10 these patterns have commonly been observed empirically table 2 supporting the hypothesis that animals select territories economically with respect to costs of competition trade offs are likely to occur as the relative economic value of patches fluctuates with competition low levels of one cost e g competition can enable animals to pay higher levels of another cost e g travel without changing the territory s economic value accordingly when competition is low some patches may be used primarily as travel corridors to reach more remote high benefit patches mitchell and powell 2008 as competitors settle and impose greater costs along territory boundaries territory holders will favor more proximal patches if they become more economical causing territory compression compression will hit a limit however as territories will no longer be economical once limited resources prevent meeting minimum resource requirements intense competition that prohibits territories from fulfilling resource requirements would therefore lead to a breakdown of territoriality resulting in undefended home ranges or nomadic movements instead powell et al 1997 teitelbaum and mueller 2019 some predictions for the effects of competition may seem counterintuitive for example where resources are more clumped in distribution some of the first territories formed in a new population are predicted to expand as competition increases fig 10 territories selected economically at a cluster of resources will be small fig 7 and unable to compress without dropping below minimum resource requirements however necessitating expansion as intensifying costs of competition reduce the territory s economic value mean territory size is also predicted to remain fairly consistent fig 7 even as many territories compress with competition figs 9 10 if animals claim areas of high economic value first additional territories relegated to areas of lower value will be larger yielding a relatively consistent mean territory size mean territory size could decline in various circumstances however e g if a very low cost of travel such as for highly mobile species like coursing predators enables large territories at low population densities empirical estimates of a population s carrying capacity and past current or future population size and distribution are likely to be unreliable if trade offs in costs and resulting outcomes in space use are ignored through territory compression carrying capacity and territory densities may reach higher levels than would be estimated using a snapshot of averaged observed territory sizes from a new or rebounding population likewise territory densities would be overestimated for small populations if basing estimates on territory sizes observed at high densities a population s estimated distribution may furthermore be relatively stable or increase at a proportionally slower rate than the number of territories as animals adjust territories in response to competition accordingly a stable distribution of a population cannot be assumed to indicate a stable population size within 4 3 competitive ability influences space use if costs of competition vary inversely with competitive ability less competitive territory holders are predicted to have larger territories when population density is relatively high and food resources are at least moderately clumped fig 11 unequal competitive ability can arise among dominant versus subordinate individuals or larger versus smaller groups although we did not find empirical reports of how individual competitive ability affects territory size numerous observations for social species align with our model s predictions table 2 higher costs of competition may force less competitive territory holders to make trade offs in space use by either acquiring larger territories to offset these costs or settling for areas of lower value to avoid competition although it might be assumed that dominant individuals or larger groups would have larger territories more space does not necessarily provide more resources or greater territory quality particularly after accounting for energetic costs of maintaining a large territory the combined effects of competition and the distribution of food resources could influence animal behavior and distribution fig 11 dominant territory holders may have the greatest ability to outcompete subordinates where food resources are highly clumped given the pronounced effects of competitive ability in these areas social territorial species could also try to maintain larger groups to successfully compete where food resources are highly clumped whereas our model ceased adding new competitors once carrying capacity was reached in real life a sufficient influx of dominant conspecifics could displace less competitive territory holders entirely from areas with clumped food resources this could cause less competitive individuals to congregate where food resources are more evenly distributed and competitive ability is predicted to have limited effects fig 11 leading to sorting of individuals by competitive ability into different habitats it could also cause less competitive individuals to have lower fitness if pushed into less valuable habitat affecting demographic processes and source sink dynamics pulliam 1988 our assumptions that competitive ability does not correlate with resource requirements or vary over time could be modified in future iterations of the mechanistic model if smaller individuals or groups have lower resource requirements these less competitive territory holders could potentially continue to claim territories where too few resources remain available to support dominant individuals or groups leading to an even more compact territory mosaic and greater carrying capacity than achieved in our simulations e g fig 6 these assumptions also mean our model s predictions apply to groups with a contractionist strategy whereby territory holders limit group size to only what can be sustained in the territory loveridge et al 2009 macdonald and johnson 2015 empirical observations of positive correlations between territory size and group size table 2 i e contrasting our model s predictions are likely caused by an expansionist strategy whereby territory holders attempt to expand a territory to accommodate more group members when resource requirements increase with competitive ability or group size territory size should increase in response fig 7 4 4 predators may have nonlinear effects on space use if animals select territories economically based in part on costs of predation risk territories are predicted to often be largest at medium predator densities fig 12 table 1 this suggests that accepting a trade off in costs of travel enables avoiding costs of predators at medium predator densities trade offs likely become uneconomical at low or higher predator densities however or when predators are highly clumped but food resources are not fig 12 the predicted decline in carrying capacity as predator abundance increases fig 8 is understandable if costs of predation risk reduces the economic value of an area this complexity in predicted effects of predators means that a wide range of predator densities and resulting territory sizes would need to be measured to date such relationships appear to have been only sparsely investigated table 2 this deserves additional attention given opportunities to empirically measure territory size in response to a range of predator densities 4 5 interacting costs and benefits produce emergent effects many predictions reveal how interacting effects of costs and benefits produce density dependent effects figs 7 11 table 1 researchers have long sought to identify whether the effects of competition or food most influence territory size our model demonstrates how these effects are unlikely mutually exclusive and why the effects of food resources should be controlled to discern the variation in territory size attributable to competition and vice versa figs 9 11 our mechanistic approach uniquely enabled understanding the interacting influences of food and competition and predicted scenarios when identical conditions will produce different effects we suggest empirical studies continue to investigate and account for the effects of both food and competition e g as demonstrated by myers et al 1979 ewald et al 1980 norton et al 1982 norman and jones 1984 as both should be inherent to territory selection if animals select territories economically based on benefits of food resources and costs of competition the relative costs of competition travel and predation risk are unknown almost certainly variable by species and likely to affect a territory s overlap economic viability and relationship with competitive ability appendix b higher relative costs ultimately eliminated overlap among territories suggesting that if animals select territories economically these costs are not relatively high where territories overlap appendix b additionally territorial behavior was no longer economical for agents with higher resource requirements at high relative costs of travel or predation risk in species where some individuals are territorial and others are not locally high relative costs of travel or predation risk may contribute to this flexibility in spatial behavior differences in territory size across competitive abilities were also increasingly eliminated as relative costs increased accordingly where animals experience relatively high costs competitive ability is not predicted to affect territory size assuming equal resource requirements among competitors 5 conclusion our mechanistic spatially explicit individual based model aimed to increase understanding of how animals select particular territories the model uniquely centered on optimal selection of individual patches for inclusion in a territory according to their net value while also incorporating dynamic competition with neighboring conspecifics simulations produced numerous predictions for what may be observed empirically if such optimization drives placement and characteristics of territories figs 7 12 table 1 our approach furthermore offers extensive opportunity for future modifications and extensions of mechanistic models for space use our model can be used to predict the effects of conservation actions thereby linking theory with conservation in absence of data the model provides not only predictions but a mechanistic understanding of how territorial behavior is likely to vary spatiotemporally based on numerous factors conservationists can use this knowledge to influence a target population s behavior and resulting distribution abundance and carrying capacity e g by manipulating the distribution or abundance of food or predators such information may be particularly useful for predicting the potential success of future reintroductions and proposed conservation areas a mechanistic understanding of how a population will respond to prey and predator distributions and abundances can furthermore help predict the effects of a species on prey populations and vice versa our model can also be parameterized with empirical data to make

24722,territorial behavior is a fundamental and conspicuous behavior within numerous species but the mechanisms driving territory selection remain uncertain theory and empirical precedent indicate that many animals select territories economically to satisfy resource requirements for survival and reproduction based on benefits of food resources and costs of competition and travel costs of competition may vary by competitive ability and costs of predation risk may also drive territory selection habitat structure resource requirements conspecific density and predator distribution and abundance are likely to further influence territorial behavior we developed a mechanistic spatially explicit individual based model to better understand how animals select particular territories the model was based on optimal selection of individual patches for inclusion in a territory according to their net value i e benefits food resources minus costs travel competition predation risk simulations produced predictions for what may be observed empirically if such optimization drives placement and characteristics of territories simulations consisted of sequential iterative selection of territories by simulated animals that interacted to defend and maintain territories results explain why certain patterns in space use are commonly observed and when and why these patterns may differ from the norm for example more clumped or abundant food resources are predicted to result on average in smaller territories with more overlap strongly different resource requirements for individuals or groups in a population will directly affect space use and are predicted to cause different responses under identical conditions territories are predicted to decrease in size with increasing population density which can enable a population s density of territories to change at faster rates than their spatial distribution due to competition less competitive territory holders are generally predicted to have larger territories in order to accumulate sufficient resources which could produce an ideal despotic distribution of territories interestingly territory size is predicted to often show a curvilinear response to increases in predator densities and territories are predicted to be larger where predators are more clumped in distribution predictions consistent with empirical observations provide support for optimal patch selection as a mechanism for the economical territories of animals commonly observed in nature keywords benefits and costs economical behavior individual based model mechanistic model optimality model territoriality 1 introduction territorial behavior is a fundamental and conspicuous feature observed in numerous species across diverse taxa adams 2001 brown and orians 1970 burt 1943 maher and lott 2000 territoriality occurs when an animal defends a portion of its home range the space it uses for foraging mating and raising young burt 1943 and is hypothesized to have evolved to protect limited resources brown 1964 or young wolff and peterson 1998 for territoriality to occur resources should be economically defendable i e benefits obtained should outweigh costs of ownership brown 1964 economic defendability may be influenced by factors related to population density and the quantity quality distribution or predictability of resources maher and lott 2000 the extent of competition for resources and their economic defendability likely help explain the range of territorial behaviors observed brown 1964 only some populations within a given species may exhibit territorial behavior if resources are not economically defendable range wide although many territories are defended seasonally e g during the breeding season animals may defend territories year round if economical where the entire home range is economically defendable territories may encompass most or all of the home range as observed e g for gray wolves canis lupus mech and boitani 2003 african lions panthera leo packer et al 1990 white throated magpie jays calocitta formosa langen and vehrencamp 1998 and red capped cardinals paroaria gularis eason 1992 conversely animals may defend a portion of their home range if only specific resources are economically defendable hixon 1980 as observed e g for hawaiian honey creepers vestiaria coccinea carpenter and macmillen 1976 rufous hummingbirds selasphorus rufus hixon et al 1983 and sanderlings calidris alba myers et al 1979 many territories are held by a solitary individual or breeding pair group territoriality is relatively uncommon but likely influences a territory s economic defendability e g larger packs of ethiopian wolves canis simensis sillero zubiri and macdonald 1998 and prides of lions packer et al 1990 appear more competitive in confrontations with smaller groups territoriality can strongly influence population dynamics by structuring the spatial distribution of individuals territoriality limits the number of individuals who can use an area limited space for territories can influence the number of individuals who can breed brown 1964 affecting reproductive rates as well as a population s social structure in some species individuals unable to claim their own territories e g due to lack of available space or adequate resources bide time within their natal territories affecting the spatial distribution of individuals and thus the population s social structure for cooperative breeders this also influences the number of helpers to the breeding pair e g in gray wolves mech and boitani 2003 which can affect recruitment rates ausband et al 2017 by influencing the spatial distribution of individuals territoriality can also influence disease transmission by potentially limiting the spread of pathogens among individuals or groups altizer et al 2003 craft et al 2011 a population s space use can furthermore affect the spatial distributions of other species including competitors predators and prey creel et al 2005 fortin et al 2005 hebblewhite and merrill 2008 kie 1999 proffitt et al 2009 1 1 hypothesized drivers of territorial behavior the specific mechanisms driving territory selection are widely hypothesized but poorly understood individuals presumably have been shaped by natural selection darwin 1859 to select economical territories that maximize benefits over costs of territorial behavior brown 1964 emlen and oring 1977 krebs and kacelnik 1991 economical territory selection could mean defending only enough area to provide the amount of resources necessary to survive and reproduce mitchell and powell 2004 2007 2012 a primary benefit of many territories is hypothesized to be exclusive access to food resources fig 1 brown 1964 hixon 1980 carpenter 1987 maher and lott 2000 adams 2001 the heterogeneous distribution and abundance of food resources should thus affect territory selection and resulting space use in other cases primary benefits of territories can be burrows den or nest sites or other limiting resources maher and lott 2000 an individual s resource requirements can also affect territory selection fig 1 resource requirements increase with body size gittleman and harvey 1982 mcnab 1963 tamburello et al 2015 which in turn can vary by sex and age because movement to access and defend territorial space requires energy travel costs should be a primary cost of maintaining territories mitchell and powell 2004 2007 2012 because territories partially or completely exclude conspecifics intraspecific competition e g maintaining boundary marks signaling fighting or responding to resource depression should be a primary cost of maintaining territories fig 1 brown 1964 hixon 1980 carpenter 1987 competition may have variable effects on territory selection at different competitor densities competitive ability could also influence costs of competition by causing less competitive territory holders to pay higher costs to compete for space when challenged by a stronger competitor costs of predation risk may influence territory selection for some animals especially where predation risk is high fig 1 sargeant et al 1987 whittington et al 2005 rich et al 2012 when animals avoid areas associated with predators e g whittington et al 2004 lesmerises et al 2012 the distribution and abundance of predators could affect how animals use space if these benefits and costs influence the economics of territory selection as hypothesized they are likely to have interacting effects for example low costs of competition may enable individuals to pay higher costs of travel enabling a larger territory to be held an increase in any one cost however will decrease a territory s economic value unless the territory holder can reduce other costs or increase benefits obtained for example an increase in population size can lead to rapid increases in costs of competition requiring the territory holder to reassess its territory boundaries these interacting effects add complexity to economical territories and merit further attention to better understand animal space use 1 2 objectives we sought to understand mechanisms driving territory selection we approached this by integrating optimality models with competitor interaction models these two theoretical approaches to studying territoriality have largely been developed independently adams 2001 optimality models entail analyzing costs and benefits of a single territory holder s decisions to discern fitness maximizing rules for behavior adams 2001 krebs and kacelnik 1991 and produce predictions for optimal territory size e g dill 1978 hixon et al 1983 optimality models generally omit explicit interactions among competitors however and can be difficult to test adams 2001 conversely competitor interaction models incorporate density dependent effects by focusing on decisions of individuals as they interact with competitors adams 2001 a model for optimal home ranges that also accounted for resource depression by conspecifics was presented by mitchell and powell 2004 the model was based on optimal selection of patches to include in a home range not optimal movements simulated animals sequentially selected patches in order of their realized value v equal to the resource value of a patch v divided by costs of regularly traveling to that patch represented by distance d until reaching a threshold where adding further patches would yield no further fitness benefit mitchell and powell 2007 2012 used the model to predict optimal home ranges of telemetered black bears ursus americanus in the appalachian mountains of north carolina usa independent of field data collected from the bears they found that optimal selection of home ranges to meet resource requirements in an area as small as possible i e area minimization fig 2 strongly predicted second order selection of home ranges johnson 1980 by telemetered bears although this model allowed for depression of v by conspecifics it did not more explicitly address competition by allowing agents to respond to conspecific home ranges and thus could not evaluate mechanisms of territoriality to understand space use of territorial animals we developed a mechanistic spatially explicit individual based model of optimal patch selection building on mitchell and powell 2004 s foundation we included additional costs of predation risk and competition which we hypothesized affect territorial space use importantly to understand space use of territorial animals we added dynamic competition among competitors where territory holders adapted their use of space to keep it as economical as possible each time an adjacent conspecific imposed new costs of competition by contesting territory borders we used the model to simulate territory selection for populations of animals with differing resource requirements in heterogeneous landscapes with variable food distributions and abundances competitor densities and predator distributions and abundances these simulations produced empirically testable predictions for patterns in relative territory size territory overlap and carrying capacity and enabled understanding the influence of individual factors and their interactions on territories of animals 2 methods we developed the mechanistic model for territory selection in

and details odd framework of individual based models grimm et al 2006 2010 2 1 simulated landscapes we represented each landscape as a continuous grid of 200 200 patches fig 3 each patch varied by its food resources b and presence of predators p to understand the effects of variable spatial distributions and abundances of food and predators landscapes varied in food distribution spatial distribution of patches with high b evenly distributed moderately clumped or highly clumped food abundance landscape wide σb low medium or high and across food distributions predator distribution spatial distribution of patches with high p evenly distributed moderately clumped or highly clumped and predator abundance landscape wide σp none low medium or high and across predator distributions with an abundance of none representing a landscape with no predators or scenario in which costs of predation risk were unimportant to how animals selected territories 2 2 agents agents represented either individuals for solitary species breeding pairs for species maintaining breeding territories or groups for group living species agents were assigned a threshold of food resources for survival and reproduction vt set to low medium or high all agents received the same vt within a given simulation agents were randomly assigned a competitive ability caagent 1 10 where 1 low competitive ability and 10 high competitive ability equal values could alternatively be applied to all agents if desired each agent s objective was to maximize fitness by pursuing an economical territory reproduction was implicit whereby acquiring a territory was assumed to yield reproduction opportunities 2 3 territory selection for each simulation territories and competition among agents emerged on the landscape fig 4 appendix a at the start of each simulation a landscape configuration and vt was specified a new focal agent ai was added to the landscape and moved to an unowned patch centered in a neighborhood of patches with high value quantified as having high b and low p this patch became ai s territory center the value of each patch vn relative to the territory center was calculated vn accounted for the benefit of food b contained within patch n discounted by cumulative costs of competition travel and predation risk to reach it from the territory center representing the average costs that would be incurred to reach patch n from any patch in the territory mitchell and powell 2004 1 v n b c σ t σ p σ c σ was the cumulative cost of competition competitors are more likely to be encountered with distance trespassed and to respond more aggressively the farther inward a trespasser intrudes adams 2001 eason 1992 giraldeau and ydenberg 1987 mcnicol and noakes 1981 vines 1979 c σ was therefore the

order of vn until σvn vt ai s territory consisted of selected patches patches selected for the territory to satisfy vt and travel corridors patches used to reach selected patches from the territory center but not selected to satisfy vt the territory center was then assessed if ai s selected territory center the territory s geographic center i e x and y coordinates of ai s patches ai s current territory was discarded ai was repositioned to this geographic center patch values were recalculated and a new territory was selected once the territory center its geographic center we summarized ai s of selected patches territory size of patches selected of travel corridors territory overlap percentage of the territory overlapped by other territories total resources acquired σvn and initial competitor density σar at territory establishment each ar next determined if there was overlap with neighbors for selected patches if yes the ar s territory was shifted if patches formerly selected had become uneconomical or patches formerly ignored had become economical e g due to less competition for those patches fig 5 effects of competition were thus dynamic i e changing continuously throughout a simulation and density dependent once all territories were shifted as needed to maintain economical territories a new ai was added to the landscape if sufficient resources remained for additional agents to form territories once the landscape was saturated e g fig 6 the simulation ended 2 4 simulation experiments and analyses we conducted simulation experiments to generate data for summarizing effects of food resource requirements competition competitive ability and predation risk on territorial space use we completed 25 simulations for each combination of input variable for landscape e g fig 3 and resource requirements 100 300 and 500 to represent low medium and high requirements totaling 8100 simulations conducting 25 simulations per combination captured variability in results we collected output summaries for each territory formed after initial establishment at a low population density once 10 territories were formed and after carrying capacity was reached i e ai could not successfully build more territories representing a high population density we recorded for each ar its final territory size territory overlap number of nearby competitors of other ar territory centers 25 patches from the agent s territory border and predator density encountered mean predator presence per territory patch we recorded the total abundance of territories as the landscape s carrying capacity we used program r version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 and packages dplyr wickham et al 2019 ggplot2 wickham 2016 cowplot wilke 2019 and egg auguie 2019 to summarize and display mean number of selected patches territory size and territory overlap as a function of food distribution food abundance resource requirements and population density we also summarized mean final territory size and overlap by number of nearby competitors initial competitor density competitive ability predator density and predator distribution we scaled each agent s number of nearby competitors by the agent s territory size because larger territories often have more neighbors we summarized the mean carrying capacity of each landscape because the importance of costs of competition travel and predation risk relative to one another and benefits of food resources is unknown we completed a sensitivity analysis with a range of potential relative costs appendix b 3 results agents formed 458 000 simulated territories in total territories were influenced by food resources resource requirements competition and predation risk as follows 3 1 effects of food resources and resource requirements resource requirements food distribution and food abundance affected mean number of patches selected territory size territory overlap and carrying capacity greater resource requirements led to greater number of selected patches larger territories and less overlap fig 7 table 1 more clumped or abundant food resources led to fewer selected patches and smaller territories at high population densities overlap was greater where food resources were more clumped increased food abundance led to less overlap for agents with low resource requirements and more overlap for agents with medium or high resource requirements carrying capacity was higher where food resources were more clumped or abundant and declined with increasing resource requirements fig 8 3 2 effects of competition competition caused each agent s territory to change throughout the simulation as population density increased e g fig 5 territory size decreased and overlap increased with each additional nearby competitor fig 9 table 1 as an exception however when agents had low resource requirements territories initially increased in size as the number of nearby competitors increased to low levels the competitor density an agent encountered at territory establishment also influenced its territory size and overlap fig 10 although nearly all territories compressed from initial sizes as competition increased territories first established at low levels of competition where food resources were highly clumped slightly expanded instead the same was true where food resources were moderately clumped if agents had low resource requirements average territory size and number of patches selected slightly changed as population density increased from low to high in any given landscape fig 7 table 1 at high population densities mean number of selected patches was often slightly greater mean territory size at high population densities was slightly greater if food resources were highly clumped but smaller if food resources were evenly distributed territory size and overlap varied by competitive ability fig 11 table 1 greater competitive ability led to smaller territories where food resources were moderately or highly clumped and had a limited effect where food resources were evenly distributed greater competitive ability led to less overlap when agents had high resource requirements the same was true for agents with medium resource requirements unless food resources were highly clumped for agents with low resource requirements overlap increased with competitive ability except where food resources were evenly distributed 3 3 effects of predation risk territory size often increased and then decreased curvilinearly with an increase in mean density of predators in the territory fig 12 table 1 this relationship was more linear however if food resources were evenly distributed or moderately clumped while predators were highly clumped at comparable predator densities territories were on average larger where predators were more clumped in distribution overlap had nuanced and variable relationships with predator distribution and this relationship interacted with the distribution of food resources encountered carrying capacity declined as predator abundance increased fig 8 3 4 sensitivity analyses in assessing patch values for agents we used low values for the relative costs of competition travel and predation risk c r e l a t i v e c o s t t r e l a t i v e c o s t and p r e l a t i v e c o s t this decision had limited effects on the model s predictions appendix b the main effect of increasing these values was to reduce and then eliminate overlap among territories additionally higher relative costs of travel and predation risk prevented agents with higher resource requirements from forming territories higher relative costs also increasingly eliminated differences in territory size among variable competitive abilities 4 discussion we developed a mechanistic spatially explicit individual based model to better understand mechanisms hypothesized to drive territory selection the model differed from existing mechanistic territory models by blending optimality and competitor interaction approaches to selecting patches for inclusion in a territory second order selection johnson 1980 rather than modeling third order animal movements as demonstrated e g by lewis and murray 1993 white et al 1996 moorcroft et al 1999 2006 giuggioli et al 2011 potts and lewis 2014 our model was based on a single decision rule do or do not select a patch based on its benefits and costs and produced spatially explicit predictions for territory location size overlap and carrying capacity model simulations conducted across a broad range of landscape conditions and using no field data produced predictions these predictions specify what may be observed empirically if the hypotheses explicit in our model explain selection of territories and how this process structures spatial distributions and carrying capacities on different landscapes 4 1 clumped and abundant food resources yield smaller territories if animals select territories economically based in part on benefits of food resources territories are predicted to be smaller and generally have more overlap with neighbors where food resources are more clumped or abundant fig 7 table 1 more clumped or abundant food resources provide economical territory sites by offering more resources close by minimizing travel costs and enabling acquisition of sufficient resources in smaller territories as vacant space becomes sparse competitors are likely to be attracted to these same clumped or abundant food resources yielding high densities of small overlapping territories this interaction of patch selection with landscape characteristics is predicted to cause carrying capacity to be greater in areas with more clumped or abundant food resources fig 8 fluctuations in a food resource can be expected to cause territory size territory overlap and carrying capacity of a dependent species to fluctuate in response these patterns are consistent with those observed empirically in numerous species table 2 supporting the hypothesis that many animals select territories economically based in part on benefits of food resources when different relationships are observed between food resources and territory size e g norman and jones 1984 the mechanisms driving territory selection may differ from those we modeled for example animals may attempt to maximize the resources they obtain by defending a territory to contain as many resources as possible if this increases survival and reproductive output schoener 1983 stephens and krebs 1986 krebs and kacelnik 1991 no relationship between food resources and territory size is expected where territoriality functions to defend non food resources such as water or denning sites macdonald and johnson 2015 mates macdonald 1983 or young wolff and peterson 1998 our results may apply to these scenarios however if the distribution and abundance of non food resources are similar to the food resources in our landscapes fig 3 inconsistency with our model predictions provides a rigorous platform for developing additional mechanistic hypotheses that could account for such differences e g including different or additional resources such as food and den sites because energetic requirements increase with body mass mcnab 1963 tamburello et al 2015 numerous predictions for territorial space use are tied to body size larger animals are predicted to have larger territories with less overlap and a smaller maximum population size figs 7 11 table 1 this pattern is well known table 2 predictions also mean that in solitary sexually dimorphic species territory size is likely to be larger for the larger sex fig 7 as has been observed table 2 although males in polygynous species are commonly thought to have large territories to gain access to multiple females macdonald 1983 greater resource requirements could also contribute to this pattern because resource requirements are also predicted to interact with effects of competition figs 9 11 larger individuals may respond differently to competition than smaller individuals within the same species for example as the number of nearby competitors increases territory size is predicted to initially increase for smaller individuals and decrease for larger individuals fig 9 a simplifying assumption of our model was that animals can determine the quality of patches when selecting territories even when quality fluctuates temporally e g due to seasonal food resources or competitor induced resource depression or depletion it is expected that natural selection has shaped animals to suitably detect patch quality if this assumption is violated observed patterns may be more variable have more outliers or mismatch the patterns predicted by our model because many food benefits shift seasonally animals that maintain year round territories would need to select a territory to account for seasonal shifts in food or adjust seasonal territories in such scenarios model predictions may be most applicable to seasonal patterns in territorial space use if defense becomes uneconomical due to too high variability in patch quality territories may be replaced by undefended home ranges or nomadism powell et al 1997 teitelbaum and mueller 2019 alternatively resource depression or depletion alone may strongly limit overlapping space use by imposing significant costs of competition even absent direct territorial defense mitchell and powell 2004 spencer 2012 our modeling approach can be adapted to evaluate temporal changes in food abundances and resulting patch quality 4 2 competition generally compresses territories as an outcome of economical territory selection territories are predicted to compress and increase in overlap as neighboring conspecifics pose increased competition figs 9 10 these patterns have commonly been observed empirically table 2 supporting the hypothesis that animals select territories economically with respect to costs of competition trade offs are likely to occur as the relative economic value of patches fluctuates with competition low levels of one cost e g competition can enable animals to pay higher levels of another cost e g travel without changing the territory s economic value accordingly when competition is low some patches may be used primarily as travel corridors to reach more remote high benefit patches mitchell and powell 2008 as competitors settle and impose greater costs along territory boundaries territory holders will favor more proximal patches if they become more economical causing territory compression compression will hit a limit however as territories will no longer be economical once limited resources prevent meeting minimum resource requirements intense competition that prohibits territories from fulfilling resource requirements would therefore lead to a breakdown of territoriality resulting in undefended home ranges or nomadic movements instead powell et al 1997 teitelbaum and mueller 2019 some predictions for the effects of competition may seem counterintuitive for example where resources are more clumped in distribution some of the first territories formed in a new population are predicted to expand as competition increases fig 10 territories selected economically at a cluster of resources will be small fig 7 and unable to compress without dropping below minimum resource requirements however necessitating expansion as intensifying costs of competition reduce the territory s economic value mean territory size is also predicted to remain fairly consistent fig 7 even as many territories compress with competition figs 9 10 if animals claim areas of high economic value first additional territories relegated to areas of lower value will be larger yielding a relatively consistent mean territory size mean territory size could decline in various circumstances however e g if a very low cost of travel such as for highly mobile species like coursing predators enables large territories at low population densities empirical estimates of a population s carrying capacity and past current or future population size and distribution are likely to be unreliable if trade offs in costs and resulting outcomes in space use are ignored through territory compression carrying capacity and territory densities may reach higher levels than would be estimated using a snapshot of averaged observed territory sizes from a new or rebounding population likewise territory densities would be overestimated for small populations if basing estimates on territory sizes observed at high densities a population s estimated distribution may furthermore be relatively stable or increase at a proportionally slower rate than the number of territories as animals adjust territories in response to competition accordingly a stable distribution of a population cannot be assumed to indicate a stable population size within 4 3 competitive ability influences space use if costs of competition vary inversely with competitive ability less competitive territory holders are predicted to have larger territories when population density is relatively high and food resources are at least moderately clumped fig 11 unequal competitive ability can arise among dominant versus subordinate individuals or larger versus smaller groups although we did not find empirical reports of how individual competitive ability affects territory size numerous observations for social species align with our model s predictions table 2 higher costs of competition may force less competitive territory holders to make trade offs in space use by either acquiring larger territories to offset these costs or settling for areas of lower value to avoid competition although it might be assumed that dominant individuals or larger groups would have larger territories more space does not necessarily provide more resources or greater territory quality particularly after accounting for energetic costs of maintaining a large territory the combined effects of competition and the distribution of food resources could influence animal behavior and distribution fig 11 dominant territory holders may have the greatest ability to outcompete subordinates where food resources are highly clumped given the pronounced effects of competitive ability in these areas social territorial species could also try to maintain larger groups to successfully compete where food resources are highly clumped whereas our model ceased adding new competitors once carrying capacity was reached in real life a sufficient influx of dominant conspecifics could displace less competitive territory holders entirely from areas with clumped food resources this could cause less competitive individuals to congregate where food resources are more evenly distributed and competitive ability is predicted to have limited effects fig 11 leading to sorting of individuals by competitive ability into different habitats it could also cause less competitive individuals to have lower fitness if pushed into less valuable habitat affecting demographic processes and source sink dynamics pulliam 1988 our assumptions that competitive ability does not correlate with resource requirements or vary over time could be modified in future iterations of the mechanistic model if smaller individuals or groups have lower resource requirements these less competitive territory holders could potentially continue to claim territories where too few resources remain available to support dominant individuals or groups leading to an even more compact territory mosaic and greater carrying capacity than achieved in our simulations e g fig 6 these assumptions also mean our model s predictions apply to groups with a contractionist strategy whereby territory holders limit group size to only what can be sustained in the territory loveridge et al 2009 macdonald and johnson 2015 empirical observations of positive correlations between territory size and group size table 2 i e contrasting our model s predictions are likely caused by an expansionist strategy whereby territory holders attempt to expand a territory to accommodate more group members when resource requirements increase with competitive ability or group size territory size should increase in response fig 7 4 4 predators may have nonlinear effects on space use if animals select territories economically based in part on costs of predation risk territories are predicted to often be largest at medium predator densities fig 12 table 1 this suggests that accepting a trade off in costs of travel enables avoiding costs of predators at medium predator densities trade offs likely become uneconomical at low or higher predator densities however or when predators are highly clumped but food resources are not fig 12 the predicted decline in carrying capacity as predator abundance increases fig 8 is understandable if costs of predation risk reduces the economic value of an area this complexity in predicted effects of predators means that a wide range of predator densities and resulting territory sizes would need to be measured to date such relationships appear to have been only sparsely investigated table 2 this deserves additional attention given opportunities to empirically measure territory size in response to a range of predator densities 4 5 interacting costs and benefits produce emergent effects many predictions reveal how interacting effects of costs and benefits produce density dependent effects figs 7 11 table 1 researchers have long sought to identify whether the effects of competition or food most influence territory size our model demonstrates how these effects are unlikely mutually exclusive and why the effects of food resources should be controlled to discern the variation in territory size attributable to competition and vice versa figs 9 11 our mechanistic approach uniquely enabled understanding the interacting influences of food and competition and predicted scenarios when identical conditions will produce different effects we suggest empirical studies continue to investigate and account for the effects of both food and competition e g as demonstrated by myers et al 1979 ewald et al 1980 norton et al 1982 norman and jones 1984 as both should be inherent to territory selection if animals select territories economically based on benefits of food resources and costs of competition the relative costs of competition travel and predation risk are unknown almost certainly variable by species and likely to affect a territory s overlap economic viability and relationship with competitive ability appendix b higher relative costs ultimately eliminated overlap among territories suggesting that if animals select territories economically these costs are not relatively high where territories overlap appendix b additionally territorial behavior was no longer economical for agents with higher resource requirements at high relative costs of travel or predation risk in species where some individuals are territorial and others are not locally high relative costs of travel or predation risk may contribute to this flexibility in spatial behavior differences in territory size across competitive abilities were also increasingly eliminated as relative costs increased accordingly where animals experience relatively high costs competitive ability is not predicted to affect territory size assuming equal resource requirements among competitors 5 conclusion our mechanistic spatially explicit individual based model aimed to increase understanding of how animals select particular territories the model uniquely centered on optimal selection of individual patches for inclusion in a territory according to their net value while also incorporating dynamic competition with neighboring conspecifics simulations produced numerous predictions for what may be observed empirically if such optimization drives placement and characteristics of territories figs 7 12 table 1 our approach furthermore offers extensive opportunity for future modifications and extensions of mechanistic models for space use our model can be used to predict the effects of conservation actions thereby linking theory with conservation in absence of data the model provides not only predictions but a mechanistic understanding of how territorial behavior is likely to vary spatiotemporally based on numerous factors conservationists can use this knowledge to influence a target population s behavior and resulting distribution abundance and carrying capacity e g by manipulating the distribution or abundance of food or predators such information may be particularly useful for predicting the potential success of future reintroductions and proposed conservation areas a mechanistic understanding of how a population will respond to prey and predator distributions and abundances can furthermore help predict the effects of a species on prey populations and vice versa our model can also be parameterized with empirical data to make

24723,errors in the construction of matrix population models may lead to erroneous conclusions from modeling case studies and neglecting the seed bank as a stage in the stage structured model is a kind of persistent problem common to many models of plant species the problem arises due to uncertainties in the seed related parameters that cannot be reliably estimated from empirical data we investigate the consequences that including a seed bank into the underlying life cycle graph may have on λ 1 the dominant eigenvalue of the calibrated matrix in the no seeds model vital rates of that model were calibrated on a time series of data of the identified individuals type gained in our former 11 year case study on a local population of androsace albana a short lived perennial inhabiting alpine heaths the calibration has resulted in 10 successive population projection matrices expressed in rational numbers with a variety of λ1s distant from 1 by various amounts in both directions to include the seed bank we propose an integer valued formalism with the following three unknown s related parameters s t the number of dormant seeds able to germinate at the current year of observation t s p t the number of seeds produced this year and s m t the total number of seeds lost this year for various reasons these preserve the rational form of all the other vital rates and holding the calibration equations true in the integer numbers too some observable traits of a albana plants help establish certain finite ranges of the three s related parameters and they enable finding the ensuing ranges of model outcomes by merely enumerating all the feasible triples in this way we get answers to pertinent questions about the λ 1 of the seed model vs its no seeds counterpart and give a mathematical explanation of what we have obtained an important conclusion is that the seed bank can principally not change the population growth into decline nor vice versa within the feasible ranges

subject of profound discussion in the community of matrix modelers nguyen et al 2019 che castaldo et al 2020 yet the issue was raised long ago werner and caswell 1977 caswell 2001 example 4 1 the construction of matrix population models means essentially the construction of the life cycle graph lcg a condensed graphical representation of what is known of the species biology ontogenesis and how the local population is observed in equal time intervals time steps erroneous lcgs resulted in the correspondingly erroneous patterns of the population projection matrix ppm ibid hence errors in the estimation of its λ 1 the asymptotic growth rate or a quantitative measure of how the local population was adapted to its environment logofet et al 2018 although some construction errors may not dramatically affect estimates of demographic parameters in some cases they can be crucial in others che castaldo et al 2020 p 1 when modeled is a plant population with the generative mode of reproduction it would be logical to consider the dormant seed bank as the initial stage of ontogenesis however it is a kind of cryptic life stage nguyen et al 2019 that is difficult to detect and track in the field over time as a result a model incorporating the seed bank would also incorporate some uncertain vital rates e g seed production and germination rates hence the uncertainty in the model outcome excluding the seed bank may be justified if it is discovered the species or population does not possess dormant seeds see baskin and baskin 2014 for review on the presence of seed dormancy or if it is mathematically and empirically justified in a modified model ibid p 2 mathematically and empirically justified was the absence of a seed bank in a matrix population model of eritrichium caucasicum logofet et al 2017b appendix a a short lived perennial inhabiting alpine heaths and reproducing via seeds the mathematical proof concerned the possibility for the reduced population vector of the no seeds model to be expressed via uncertain vital rates of the original seed bank model while the unknown part of the expression was amenable to calibration from the observation data of the identified individuals type caswell 2001 p 134 the ensuing empirics resulted in a finite series of calibrated annual no seeds ppms logofet et al 2017b table 3 as a starting point for stochastic lambda estimation and a motivation for searching an average ppm however the question remained open whether and how much the quantitative outcome of the no seeds model would differ from that of the original seed bank model if the latter were directly and reliably calibrated in the present paper we give an answer to this question for a time series of annual no seeds ppms for androsace albana another short lived perennial inhabiting alpine heaths logofet et al 2020a neither the seed production rate nor the germination mortality rates are known for this species in the field but the model formalism with the dormant seeds incorporated enables us to reveal certain limits to uncertainty and compare the former no seeds model and illustrate the effects the seed stage exerts on the model outcome despite the seed related vital rates cannot be directly calibrated seed expansion of the no seeds model invokes certain mathematical issues to investigate and the results go beyond the limitations of a particular case study 2 androsace albana case study androsace albana stev is an alpine short lived perennial monocarpic plant a red book near threatened species red book 2007 2012

express all the vital rates in the form of rational numbers table 2 of these ten no seeds ppms five have λ 1 less and five greater than 1 thus postponing the issue of population survival forecast to matrix averaging and stochastic lambda estimation logofet et al 2020a 3 incorporating the seed bank the following questions arise with regard to the effect the seed bank exerts on the dominant eigenvalue λ 1 l of the calibrated no seeds ppm q1 can it invoke no change in λ 1 i e λ 1 l s λ 1 l q2 shall it increase or decrease λ 1 l q3 shall the increase decrease of λ 1 l s be dependent on whether λ 1 l was greater less than 1 q4 can it invoke the qualitative change in λ 1 e g from λ 1 l 1 to λ 1 l s 1 or vice versa 3 1 what is known about a albana seeds to contribute to the seed model seeds germinate to seedlings at the beginning of the vegetation period mid june which then mature successively to the juvenile and immature stages fig 1 to the virginal and generative stages by the next year generative plants flower and produce pods with seeds which ripen by the end of august the pod dries out by early september and opens thus pouring seeds out of the capsule seeds disperse due to generative shoots swinging with the wind and rain no facts of insect influence have yet been revealed but the evidence of pre and post dispersal seed predation by insects in other alpine species molau et al 1989 krushelnycky 2014 straka and starzomski 2015 makes such effects quite probable apparently small portions of annually produced seeds are retained in the local population as a potential for reproduction the type of seed dormancy is hypothetically physiological fresh a albana seed are not able to germinate adzhiev 2012 and they need cold stratification to break the dormancy ibid baskin and baskin 2014 table 3 presents some observable quantitative traits of a albana generative plants that are relevant to our further construction of a seed model 3 2 traditional formalism considering the dormant seed stage s as the explicit initial stage of ontogenesis expands the population vector x t 2 1 to y t s t x t with s t denoting the seed bank size at time moment t this expansion modifies the former lcg fig 2 to the graph shown in fig 3 three former recruitment arrows a b c are now replaced with a single one p corresponding to the annual seed production rate the average number of seeds produced per generative plant seed germination is naturally represented by the s pl transition with the germination rate r 0 and the recruited plants may also appear in the juvenile or immature stages at the moment of census the s j and s im transitions with the recruitment rates r j and r im respectively all the rest transitions represent the ontogenesis after the seedling stage thus being the same as those in the former lcg fig 2 matrix l s the corresponding ppm that defines the basic model equation 3 1 y t 1 l s t y t t 2009 2010 2019 has 6 6 size and the following pattern 3 2 with the vital rates having their standard meanings and depending on t the current year of census note that r s the seed bank residence rate i e a portion of dormant seeds that has remained dormant this year is bound with the germination recruitment rates as 3 3 r s 1 r r j r im r m where r m 0 is the annual rate of seed mortality for all kinds of reason while the transition rates d e m have exactly the same quantitative values as those in matrix 2 2 the recruitment rates r r j r im need recalculation to obey the calibration eqs 3 1 the corresponding terms of those equations representing the stage specific recruitment sizes are the products of the rate by s t the current seed bank size while these products are equal to a t g t b t g t and c t g t in eqs 2 3 thus we have the new germination recruitment rates equal to 3 4 r a t g t s t r j b t g t s t r im c t g t s t and they could be exactly calculated in the rational form from the data if the number s t were known otherwise matrices l s t remain dependent on s t as a positive integer valued parameter plant production in general hence seed production in particular is well known to depend upon environmental conditions therefore parameter p t the third uncertain parameter in the seed bank model 3 1 can hardly remain constant over time while the number of annually produced seeds equals p t s t the number of annually perished seeds equals r m t s t and the number of annually germinated seeds and registered at the pl j and im stages at the t 1 moment equals 3 5 a t b t c t g t o r f t x t 1 t 2009 2018 here 1 is the manhattan norm sum of all vector components in absolute values and the former fertility matrix is equal to 3 6 f t 0 0 0 0 a t 0 0 0 0 b t 0 0 0 0 c t 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 t 2009 2018 the seed bank size s t 1 at the next time moment consists of the current size s t increased due to the annual seed production p t g t and the loss due to seed mortality and germination i e we have 3 7 s t 1 s t p t g t s t r m t f t x t 1 s t 1 r m t f t x t p t g t it follows from 3 2 3 4 that the calibration eq 3 1 takes on the following 3 parameter form 3 8 y t 1 l s t y t s t 1 l t x t t 2009 2010 2019 where s t 1 obeys eq 3 7 for each t thus each calibrated no seeds annual ppm l t table 2 admits the whole 3 parameter family l s t s t r m t g t of the annual seed bank ppms each one of them obeying calibration eqs 3 7 3 8 in this family do there exist any matrices that have the same dominant eigenvalue as their single no seeds prototype question q1 the rational form of l t s the calibrated annual no seeds ppms table 2 enables quite a rigorous answer to this question as well as questions q2 to q4 3 3 integer valued parameters to get these answers we redefine the triple s t r m t p t of the conventional parameters to the following integer valued form 3 9 par s t s m t s p t where s m t r m t s t is the number of seeds lost for all kinds of reason from the bank before germination after the moment t s p t p t g t is the number of seeds produced by all the generative plants at the year t these uncertain natural numbers have however certain natural bounds 3 10 0 s min s t s max 0 s m t s max 1 0 p min g min s p t p max g max some of which can be reliably estimated from the a albana morphological generative traits table 4 while the seed production may vary from 105 to 171 per generative plant 90 to 99 of them can be lost onipchenko 2020 personal communication also the current seed bank size cannot be less than the observed number of seedlings recruited the next year plus the number of lost seeds i e 3 11 s t s m t f t x t 1 t 2009 2018 following 3 2 with due regard to representation 2 2 matrix l s t the seed bank ppm takes on the following form 3 12 where x x t is the observed population vector with x 5 t g g t the number of generative plants f f t is determined by 3 6 and t t t does not contain any of the s parameters inequality 3 11 provides for the element 1 1 to be always nonnegative r s t 1 f t x t 1 s m s t 0 searching for λ 1 l s t λ 1 l t question q1 over a bounded set of parameters 3 10 3 11 for each particular t represents a particular case of a more general task to find the least difference between λ 1 l s t and λ 1 l t over that very set the latter is a kind of nonlinear constraint minimization problem within bounds 3 10 and linear constraint 3 11 should the solution yield zero difference we get the particular case matlab has certain routines to solve the constraint minimization problem mathworks 2020a b c but the integer valued nature of three parameters 3 9 allows finding the solution s by enumerating merely a finite albeit huge number of all feasible triplets the next subsection presents a special function of a given matrix that helps arrange this enumeration 3 4 potential growth indicator as a tool to simplify the constraints as a special kind of function of a matrix argument the potential growth indicator pgi was defined logofet and belova 2008 to generalize r 0 a the popular net reproductive rate indicating by its value the position of λ 1 a relative to 1 cushing and yicang 1994 caswell 2001 li and schneider 2002 definition logofet and belova 2008 let a be a nonnegative irreducible matrix function r a is called a potential growth indicator if all the following conditions are pair wise equivalent 3 13 r a 1 λ 1 a 1 equivalence 3 13 is called the pgi property if a function of matrix argument has the pgi property then it is a pgi if a particular function r a is a pgi and r is a positive number then function r a r is a pgi too there exist many pgis for a matrix a but if a is a ppm then r 0 a the popular net reproductive rate is a pgi that has a particular demographic sense caswell 2001 another function pretending for the pgi role in matrix population models is 3 14 r 1 a 1 det i a with i diag 1 1 denoting the identity matrix logofet and belova 2008 it was proved that function r 1 l 3 14 does posses the pgi property if matrix l can be represented as l t f where t is substochastic each column sum does not exceed 1 and f has rank 1 i e as a rank 1 correction protasov and logofet 2014 of the nonnegative t both the seed bank ppms and their no seeds prototypes do meet these both conditions with their standard decompositions 2 2 and 3 2 into the transition and fertility parts if for example we are looking for a seed bank model with the qualitatively opposite outcome to that of the no seeds prototype then we have to restrict the search by the following constraint 3 15 r 1 l s t 1 when λ 1 l t 1 1 when λ 1 l t 1 in particular following 3 14 we have cf table 2 r 1 l s 2009 1 546 416 s m 2009 3605 s p 2009 39 888 368 1 666 665 s 2009 1 or equivalently 3 16 3605 s p 2009 546 416 s m 2009 39 888 368 for any feasible s 2009 it follows that even under zero seed mortality a seed bank could change the population decline into growth if s p 2009 were greater than 39 888 368 3605 11 065 seeds meaning quite unrealistic 11 065 g 2009 11 065 13 861 seeds per generative plant table 3 any nonzero seed mortality could only worsen this unrealistic estimate similarly condition 3 15 for r 1 l s 2010 is equivalent to 3 17 2052 s m 12 733 s p 102 600 for any positive s 2010 it means that a theoretically great enough seed mortality rate could change the population growth into decline in the seed bank model with a small enough seed production however the least feasible production s p totals 105 seeds table 4 hence the seed mortality s m cannot exceed 105 whereby 3 17 leads to 215 460 2052 105 2052 s m 12 733 105 102 600 1 234 365 which is false thus λ 1 l s cannot change qualitatively for t 2010 too direct enumeration of the feasible triples within certain bounds gives certain answers also to questions q2 q3 merely by finding the minimal and maximal values of λ 1 l s t over the constrained sets of parameters 3 9 for each t 2009 2018 the algorithm of direct enumeration is simple just three inserted cycles through certain finite ranges of the integer values the lowest cycle keeping the current extremal values 4 results table 5 summarizes the outcome of λ 1 calculations for all the ten ppms available from the no seeds model for different census years our questions q1 to q4 get certain answers from this table q1 to observe the equality λ 1 l s λ 1 l we should at least have λ 1 l falling within the range of λ 1 l s variations over the feasible set of parameters there are four exclusions from this rule in table 5 at t 2009 2010 2011 and 2014 so that the minimal difference between λ 1 l s and λ 1 l is significant in these four cases the rest cases feature the existence of such s triples that the approximate equality λ 1 l s λ 1 l holds true with the approximation error at the 7 8th digit after the decimal point such triples are not unique due to the monotone property of the dominant eigenvalue so the answer to q1 becomes certainly assertive q2 the four exclusion cases above just illustrate the both options for t 2009 2014 we have λ 1 l s always i e for all the feasible parameter values greater than λ 1 l for t 2010 2011 we have λ 1 l s always less than λ 1 l the other cases of t feature both options of λ 1 l s λ 1 l for different feasible values of s parameters q3 the four exclusion cases commented above do witness exactly this kind of dependence of the other six cases two have λ 1 l less than 1 and four have λ 1 l greater than 1 all the six having the s triples that result in both λ 1 l s greater and less than λ 1 l thus the q3 dependence may or may not exists q4 as regards question q4 we have not found any feasible case i e any particular triple s s m s p within the given ranges of their integer values where λ 1 l s would change the position of λ 1 l relative to 1 notation in table 5 means the empty set of such triples the neighboring samples outside the ranges illustrate just a mathematical possibility of qualitative changes in λ 1s thus the answer to q1 is certainly no within the feasible range of parameters 5 discussion seed dormancy has long been recognized as an important mechanism providing abundance and successional success in alpine species amen 1966 schwienbacher et al 2011 and references therein although we are unaware of any experiments certifying the type of seed dormancy in a albana it does exist in other species of the androsace genus to summarize all the instances we conclude that seeds of this genus tend to have a morpho physiological dormancy type nikolaeva et al 1985 baskin and baskin 2014 long persistence of the local a albana population in an alpine heath may also confirm the seed dormancy in that population thus the only excuse for not using seeds as a stage in the stage structured population models was the shortage of knowledge to reliably calibrate the seed related vital rates in those models in particular the release of dormancy is normally triggered by a complex of environmental stimuli schwienbacher et al 2011 adzhiev 2012 baskin and baskin 2014 so that the germination rate can hardly remain constant over time however when developing the seed model from its no seeds counterpart we have luckily avoided this kind of uncertainty as all the recruitment rates have already been calibrated from data those rates do vary with t indeed table 2 although experiments on the germination of dormant seeds under various laboratory conditions have a long history see adzhiev 2012 and references therein the dormant seeds in the field still serve as a source of great uncertainty nguyen et al 2019 and refs therein however the knowledge of some species specific morphological and reproductive traits such as those presented in table 3 for a albana enable us to establish certain bounds for the integer valued s related parameters table 4 in the form of the finite ranges the uncertain parameters can be in the behavior of λ 1 l s within the bounds turns out expectable more or less in view of the recent findings by nguyen et al 2019 in simulations of various seed bank models especially in the cases where inclusion of a seed bank and demographic uncertainty in seed bank parameters have little impact on stable populations λ 1 1 with high post seedling survival ibid p 1 see t 2015 2018 in table 5 also our answer to question q3 partly confirms the simulation where decreasing populations λ 1 1 benefit from the inclusion of a seed bank through increases in the growth rate and extinction times whereas increasing populations λ 1 1 are slowed down ibid p 1 comparing the results in table 5 to those in table 4 we see that λ 1 l s takes its minimal and maximal values at the extreme values of parameters s s m s p this fact has a mathematical explanation based on the monotone increasing property of the dominant eigenvalue as a function of matrix elements gantmacher 1967 p 372 horn and johnson 1990 ensuing from the classical perron frobenius theorem it means that if in the formal terms lij denotes the i j th element of matrix l s then we have 4 1 λ 1 l s l ij 0 for any i j 1 2 6 now following the chain rule of differentiation with regard to the lower level variables caswell 2001 p 218 s s s m s p we obtain 4 2 d λ 1 l s i j 1 6 λ 1 l s l ij l ij s ds and the same relationship holds approximately true for the finite differences δλ 1 and δs 1 instead of differentials it follows from 4 1 4 2 and 3 12 that 4 3 δ λ 1 s s s s m s s p s m 11 a g 11 21 b g 11 31 c g 11 41 s 2 16 1 g 0 11 1 s 0 where ij λ 1 l s li 1 i 1 4 6 j 1 6 the corresponding elements of the sensitivity matrix caswell 2001 p 210 for λ 1 l s the 2nd and 3rd inequalities in 4 3 are just the formal expressions of the common sense the less more the seed mortality production the faster growth should be however the sign of the 1st expression is not so obvious as it depends on the relations between i 1 i 1 4 and those relations may vary for various years t and parameter values table 5 therefore the extremal values of l s should always be attained at the extreme values of s m and s p the minimum at the highest mortality of seeds and the least seed production the maximum at the least mortality and highest production table 5 just illustrates this mathematical fact to find the extremal values of s we can analyze the sign of δλ 1 δs according to 4 3 but after the 2nd and 3rd extreme parameter values have been determined there remains only two options for the first one s either the upper or the lower bound of its feasible range the both can be checked up to attribute them to the minimal maximal values of λ 1 l s when searching for a triple of s parameters that change principally the position of λ 1 l relative to 1 we have efficiently used function r 1 l s the pgi which is readily calculated by formula 3 14 even when the matrix depends on uncertain parameters the ppm l t f with f being a rank 1 correction of a substochastic t is not the universal class of ppms though being fairly wide it does not contain lcgs with multiple generative and recruitment stages such as the lcgs in calamagrostis spp case studies logofet et al 2014 2016 2017a of age stage structured populations with both the seed and vegetative modes of reproduction however the single structured lcgs like those in figs 2 3 fit well the rank 1 correction class protasov and logofet 2014 of ppms so that the r 1 l does possess the pgi property and it has enabled revealing the parameter constraints in explicit numeric form table 5 last column it can do so due to the explicit algebraic form 3 14 of its expression via the matrix entries unlike the popular r 0 l ρ f i t 1 caswell 2001 li and schneider 2002 where ρ is the spectral radius a much more difficult computational task than the determinant calculation the condition of λ 1 l changing qualitatively from λ 1 l 1 to λ l s 1 or vice versa has turned out linear with regard to uncertain parameters 3 9 hence verifiable much faster for any particular integer valued triple than finding the spectral radius of the corresponding matrix l s s s m s p this gives one more merit of indication logofet 2013a d o b d o c instead of lambda calculation which is especially crucial in time consuming algorithms such as enumerating a huge number of all possible integer valued triples to find certain bounds for the model outcome further investigations of the s related parameters that could narrow their feasible ranges would make the outcome less variable for the species under study 6 concluding remarks although the present study concerns a particular plant species with specific lcgs for its seed fig 3 and no seeds fig 2 models the way we compare them bears certain traits of generality the transformation of the no seeds lcg into the seed one is general unless we distinguish between the ages of dormant seeds caswell 2001 example 4 1 were the knowledge available of seed bank inhomogeneity it would certainly prompt which seed stages should be added to the no seeds lcg and how they would specifically participate in population recruitment the corresponding components of the population vector such

24723,errors in the construction of matrix population models may lead to erroneous conclusions from modeling case studies and neglecting the seed bank as a stage in the stage structured model is a kind of persistent problem common to many models of plant species the problem arises due to uncertainties in the seed related parameters that cannot be reliably estimated from empirical data we investigate the consequences that including a seed bank into the underlying life cycle graph may have on λ 1 the dominant eigenvalue of the calibrated matrix in the no seeds model vital rates of that model were calibrated on a time series of data of the identified individuals type gained in our former 11 year case study on a local population of androsace albana a short lived perennial inhabiting alpine heaths the calibration has resulted in 10 successive population projection matrices expressed in rational numbers with a variety of λ1s distant from 1 by various amounts in both directions to include the seed bank we propose an integer valued formalism with the following three unknown s related parameters s t the number of dormant seeds able to germinate at the current year of observation t s p t the number of seeds produced this year and s m t the total number of seeds lost this year for various reasons these preserve the rational form of all the other vital rates and holding the calibration equations true in the integer numbers too some observable traits of a albana plants help establish certain finite ranges of the three s related parameters and they enable finding the ensuing ranges of model outcomes by merely enumerating all the feasible triples in this way we get answers to pertinent questions about the λ 1 of the seed model vs its no seeds counterpart and give a mathematical explanation of what we have obtained an important conclusion is that the seed bank can principally not change the population growth into decline nor vice versa within the feasible ranges of parameters graphical abstract incorporating the dormant seeds as a stage into the life cycle graph of androsace albana a short lived perennial increases the size of the population projection matrix simplifies its fertility part and retains the former transition part image graphical abstract keywords discrete structured population life cycle graph matrix population model dominant eigenvalue seed production mortality integer valued parameters potential growth indicator 1 introduction persistent problems in the construction of matrix population models kendall et al 2019 have recently become a subject of profound discussion in the community of matrix modelers nguyen et al 2019 che castaldo et al 2020 yet the issue was raised long ago werner and caswell 1977 caswell 2001 example 4 1 the construction of matrix population models means essentially the construction of the life cycle graph lcg a condensed graphical representation of what is known of the species biology ontogenesis and how the local population is observed in equal time intervals time steps erroneous lcgs resulted in the correspondingly erroneous patterns of the population projection matrix ppm ibid hence errors in the estimation of its λ 1 the asymptotic growth rate or a quantitative measure of how the local population was adapted to its environment logofet et al 2018 although some construction errors may not dramatically affect estimates of demographic parameters in some cases they can be crucial in others che castaldo et al 2020 p 1 when modeled is a plant population with the generative mode of reproduction it would be logical to consider the dormant seed bank as the initial stage of ontogenesis however it is a kind of cryptic life stage nguyen et al 2019 that is difficult to detect and track in the field over time as a result a model incorporating the seed bank would also incorporate some uncertain vital rates e g seed production and germination rates hence the uncertainty in the model outcome excluding the seed bank may be justified if it is discovered the species or population does not possess dormant seeds see baskin and baskin 2014 for review on the presence of seed dormancy or if it is mathematically and empirically justified in a modified model ibid p 2 mathematically and empirically justified was the absence of a seed bank in a matrix population model of eritrichium caucasicum logofet et al 2017b appendix a a short lived perennial inhabiting alpine heaths and reproducing via seeds the mathematical proof concerned the possibility for the reduced population vector of the no seeds model to be expressed via uncertain vital rates of the original seed bank model while the unknown part of the expression was amenable to calibration from the observation data of the identified individuals type caswell 2001 p 134 the ensuing empirics resulted in a finite series of calibrated annual no seeds ppms logofet et al 2017b table 3 as a starting point for stochastic lambda estimation and a motivation for searching an average ppm however the question remained open whether and how much the quantitative outcome of the no seeds model would differ from that of the original seed bank model if the latter were directly and reliably calibrated in the present paper we give an answer to this question for a time series of annual no seeds ppms for androsace albana another short lived perennial inhabiting alpine heaths logofet et al 2020a neither the seed production rate nor the germination mortality rates are known for this species in the field but the model formalism with the dormant seeds incorporated enables us to reveal certain limits to uncertainty and compare the former no seeds model and illustrate the effects the seed stage exerts on the model outcome despite the seed related vital rates cannot be directly calibrated seed expansion of the no seeds model invokes certain mathematical issues to investigate and the results go beyond the limitations of a particular case study 2 androsace albana case study androsace albana stev is an alpine short lived perennial monocarpic plant a red book near threatened species red book 2007 2012 the biology ecology and ontogenesis of the species fig 1 were described earlier kazantseva 2016 logofet et al 2018 and the no seeds lcg was constructed fig 2 along with consecutive transitions from stage to stage in 1 year the following were also observed delays in stages im and v explainable by the fact that the harsh conditions of the highlands force the plants to resort to the space holder strategy körner 2003 which means staying or growing in one place for so long as possible soil poorness results in some virginal plants accumulating resources for fruiting longer than one year rabotnov

calibration of matrices 2 2 from the observation data ibid of the identified individuals type caswell 2001 p 134 the discrete nature of all the recorded transition recruitment events enables us to express all the vital rates in the form of rational numbers table 2 of these ten no seeds ppms five have λ 1 less and five greater than 1 thus postponing the issue of population survival forecast to matrix averaging and stochastic lambda estimation logofet et al 2020a 3 incorporating the seed bank the following questions arise with regard to the effect the seed bank exerts on the dominant eigenvalue λ 1 l of the calibrated no seeds ppm q1 can it invoke no change in λ 1 i e λ 1 l s λ 1 l q2 shall it increase or decrease λ 1 l q3 shall the increase decrease of λ 1 l s be dependent on whether λ 1 l was greater less than 1 q4 can it invoke the qualitative change in λ 1 e g from λ 1 l 1 to λ 1 l s 1 or vice versa 3 1 what is known about a albana seeds to contribute to the seed model seeds germinate to seedlings at the beginning of the vegetation period mid june which then mature successively to the juvenile and immature stages fig 1 to the virginal and generative stages by the next year generative plants flower and produce pods with seeds which ripen by the end of august the pod dries out by early september and opens thus pouring seeds out of the capsule seeds disperse due to generative shoots swinging with the wind and rain no facts of insect influence have yet been revealed but the evidence of pre and post dispersal seed predation by insects in other alpine species molau et al 1989 krushelnycky 2014 straka and starzomski 2015 makes such effects quite probable apparently small portions of annually produced seeds are retained in the local population as a potential for reproduction the type of seed dormancy is hypothetically physiological fresh a albana seed are not able to germinate adzhiev 2012 and they need cold stratification to break the dormancy ibid baskin and baskin 2014 table 3 presents some observable quantitative traits of a albana generative plants that are relevant to our further construction of a seed model 3 2 traditional formalism considering the dormant seed stage s as the explicit initial stage of ontogenesis expands the population vector x t 2 1 to y t s t x t with s t denoting the seed bank size at time moment t this expansion modifies the former lcg fig 2 to the graph shown in fig 3 three former recruitment arrows a b c are now replaced with a single one p corresponding to the annual seed production rate the average number of seeds produced per generative plant seed germination is naturally represented by the s pl transition with the germination rate r 0 and the recruited plants may also appear in the juvenile or immature stages at the moment of census the s j and s im transitions with the recruitment rates r j and r im respectively all the rest transitions represent the ontogenesis after the seedling stage thus being the same as those in the former lcg fig 2 matrix l s the corresponding ppm that defines the basic model equation 3 1 y t 1 l s t y t t 2009 2010 2019 has 6 6 size and the following pattern 3 2 with the vital rates having their standard meanings and depending on t the current year of census note that r s the seed bank residence rate i e a portion of dormant seeds that has remained dormant this year is bound with the germination recruitment rates as 3 3 r s 1 r r j r im r m where r m 0 is the annual rate of seed mortality for all kinds of reason while the transition rates d e m have exactly the same quantitative values as those in matrix 2 2 the recruitment rates r r j r im need recalculation to obey the calibration eqs 3 1 the corresponding terms of those equations representing the stage specific recruitment sizes are the products of the rate by s t the current seed bank size while these products are equal to a t g t b t g t and c t g t in eqs 2 3 thus we have the new germination recruitment rates equal to 3 4 r a t g t s t r j b t g t s t r im c t g t s t and they could be exactly calculated in the rational form from the data if the number s t were known otherwise matrices l s t remain dependent on s t as a positive integer valued parameter plant production in general hence seed production in particular is well known to depend upon environmental conditions therefore parameter p t the third uncertain parameter in the seed bank model 3 1 can hardly remain constant over time while the number of annually produced seeds equals p t s t the number of annually perished seeds equals r m t s t and the number of annually germinated seeds and registered at the pl j and im stages at the t 1 moment equals 3 5 a t b t c t g t o r f t x t 1 t 2009 2018 here 1 is the manhattan norm sum of all vector components in absolute values and the former fertility matrix is equal to 3 6 f t 0 0 0 0 a t 0 0 0 0 b t 0 0 0 0 c t 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 t 2009 2018 the seed bank size s t 1 at the next time moment consists of the current size s t increased due to the annual seed production p t g t and the loss due to seed mortality and germination i e we have 3 7 s t 1 s t p t g t s t r m t f t x t 1 s t 1 r m t f t x t p t g t it follows from 3 2 3 4 that the calibration eq 3 1 takes on the following 3 parameter form 3 8 y t 1 l s t y t s t 1 l t x t t 2009 2010 2019 where s t 1 obeys eq 3 7 for each t thus each calibrated no seeds annual ppm l t table 2 admits the whole 3 parameter family l s t s t r m t g t of the annual seed bank ppms each one of them obeying calibration eqs 3 7 3 8 in this family do there exist any matrices that have the same dominant eigenvalue as their single no seeds prototype question q1 the rational form of l t s the calibrated annual no seeds ppms table 2 enables quite a rigorous answer to this question as well as questions q2 to q4 3 3 integer valued parameters to get these answers we redefine the triple s t r m t p t of the conventional parameters to the following integer valued form 3 9 par s t s m t s p t where s m t r m t s t is the number of seeds lost for all kinds of reason from the bank before germination after the moment t s p t p t g t is the number of seeds produced by all the generative plants at the year t these uncertain natural numbers have however certain natural bounds 3 10 0 s min s t s max 0 s m t s max 1 0 p min g min s p t p max g max some of which can be reliably estimated from the a albana morphological generative traits table 4 while the seed production may vary from 105 to 171 per generative plant 90 to 99 of them can be lost onipchenko 2020 personal communication also the current seed bank size cannot be less than the observed number of seedlings recruited the next year plus the number of lost seeds i e 3 11 s t s m t f t x t 1 t 2009 2018 following 3 2 with due regard to representation 2 2 matrix l s t the seed bank ppm takes on the following form 3 12 where x x t is the observed population vector with x 5 t g g t the number of generative plants f f t is determined by 3 6 and t t t does not contain any of the s parameters inequality 3 11 provides for the element 1 1 to be always nonnegative r s t 1 f t x t 1 s m s t 0 searching for λ 1 l s t λ 1 l t question q1 over a bounded set of parameters 3 10 3 11 for each particular t represents a particular case of a more general task to find the least difference between λ 1 l s t and λ 1 l t over that very set the latter is a kind of nonlinear constraint minimization problem within bounds 3 10 and linear constraint 3 11 should the solution yield zero difference we get the particular case matlab has certain routines to solve the constraint minimization problem mathworks 2020a b c but the integer valued nature of three parameters 3 9 allows finding the solution s by enumerating merely a finite albeit huge number of all feasible triplets the next subsection presents a special function of a given matrix that helps arrange this enumeration 3 4 potential growth indicator as a tool to simplify the constraints as a special kind of function of a matrix argument the potential growth indicator pgi was defined logofet and belova 2008 to generalize r 0 a the popular net reproductive rate indicating by its value the position of λ 1 a relative to 1 cushing and yicang 1994 caswell 2001 li and schneider 2002 definition logofet and belova 2008 let a be a nonnegative irreducible matrix function r a is called a potential growth indicator if all the following conditions are pair wise equivalent 3 13 r a 1 λ 1 a 1 equivalence 3 13 is called the pgi property if a function of matrix argument has the pgi property then it is a pgi if a particular function r a is a pgi and r is a positive number then function r a r is a pgi too there exist many pgis for a matrix a but if a is a ppm then r 0 a the popular net reproductive rate is a pgi that has a particular demographic sense caswell 2001 another function pretending for the pgi role in matrix population models is 3 14 r 1 a 1 det i a with i diag 1 1 denoting the identity matrix logofet and belova 2008 it was proved that function r 1 l 3 14 does posses the pgi property if matrix l can be represented as l t f where t is substochastic each column sum does not exceed 1 and f has rank 1 i e as a rank 1 correction protasov and logofet 2014 of the nonnegative t both the seed bank ppms and their no seeds prototypes do meet these both conditions with their standard decompositions 2 2 and 3 2 into the transition and fertility parts if for example we are looking for a seed bank model with the qualitatively opposite outcome to that of the no seeds prototype then we have to restrict the search by the following constraint 3 15 r 1 l s t 1 when λ 1 l t 1 1 when λ 1 l t 1 in particular following 3 14 we have cf table 2 r 1 l s 2009 1 546 416 s m 2009 3605 s p 2009 39 888 368 1 666 665 s 2009 1 or equivalently 3 16 3605 s p 2009 546 416 s m 2009 39 888 368 for any feasible s 2009 it follows that even under zero seed mortality a seed bank could change the population decline into growth if s p 2009 were greater than 39 888 368 3605 11 065 seeds meaning quite unrealistic 11 065 g 2009 11 065 13 861 seeds per generative plant table 3 any nonzero seed mortality could only worsen this unrealistic estimate similarly condition 3 15 for r 1 l s 2010 is equivalent to 3 17 2052 s m 12 733 s p 102 600 for any positive s 2010 it means that a theoretically great enough seed mortality rate could change the population growth into decline in the seed bank model with a small enough seed production however the least feasible production s p totals 105 seeds table 4 hence the seed mortality s m cannot exceed 105 whereby 3 17 leads to 215 460 2052 105 2052 s m 12 733 105 102 600 1 234 365 which is false thus λ 1 l s cannot change qualitatively for t 2010 too direct enumeration of the feasible triples within certain bounds gives certain answers also to questions q2 q3 merely by finding the minimal and maximal values of λ 1 l s t over the constrained sets of parameters 3 9 for each t 2009 2018 the algorithm of direct enumeration is simple just three inserted cycles through certain finite ranges of the integer values the lowest cycle keeping the current extremal values 4 results table 5 summarizes the outcome of λ 1 calculations for all the ten ppms available from the no seeds model for different census years our questions q1 to q4 get certain answers from this table q1 to observe the equality λ 1 l s λ 1 l we should at least have λ 1 l falling within the range of λ 1 l s variations over the feasible set of parameters there are four exclusions from this rule in table 5 at t 2009 2010 2011 and 2014 so that the minimal difference between λ 1 l s and λ 1 l is significant in these four cases the rest cases feature the existence of such s triples that the approximate equality λ 1 l s λ 1 l holds true with the approximation error at the 7 8th digit after the decimal point such triples are not unique due to the monotone property of the dominant eigenvalue so the answer to q1 becomes certainly assertive q2 the four exclusion cases above just illustrate the both options for t 2009 2014 we have λ 1 l s always i e for all the feasible parameter values greater than λ 1 l for t 2010 2011 we have λ 1 l s always less than λ 1 l the other cases of t feature both options of λ 1 l s λ 1 l for different feasible values of s parameters q3 the four exclusion cases commented above do witness exactly this kind of dependence of the other six cases two have λ 1 l less than 1 and four have λ 1 l greater than 1 all the six having the s triples that result in both λ 1 l s greater and less than λ 1 l thus the q3 dependence may or may not exists q4 as regards question q4 we have not found any feasible case i e any particular triple s s m s p within the given ranges of their integer values where λ 1 l s would change the position of λ 1 l relative to 1 notation in table 5 means the empty set of such triples the neighboring samples outside the ranges illustrate just a mathematical possibility of qualitative changes in λ 1s thus the answer to q1 is certainly no within the feasible range of parameters 5 discussion seed dormancy has long been recognized as an important mechanism providing abundance and successional success in alpine species amen 1966 schwienbacher et al 2011 and references therein although we are unaware of any experiments certifying the type of seed dormancy in a albana it does exist in other species of the androsace genus to summarize all the instances we conclude that seeds of this genus tend to have a morpho physiological dormancy type nikolaeva et al 1985 baskin and baskin 2014 long persistence of the local a albana population in an alpine heath may also confirm the seed dormancy in that population thus the only excuse for not using seeds as a stage in the stage structured population models was the shortage of knowledge to reliably calibrate the seed related vital rates in those models in particular the release of dormancy is normally triggered by a complex of environmental stimuli schwienbacher et al 2011 adzhiev 2012 baskin and baskin 2014 so that the germination rate can hardly remain constant over time however when developing the seed model from its no seeds counterpart we have luckily avoided this kind of uncertainty as all the recruitment rates have already been calibrated from data those rates do vary with t indeed table 2 although experiments on the germination of dormant seeds under various laboratory conditions have a long history see adzhiev 2012 and references therein the dormant seeds in the field still serve as a source of great uncertainty nguyen et al 2019 and refs therein however the knowledge of some species specific morphological and reproductive traits such as those presented in table 3 for a albana enable us to establish certain bounds for the integer valued s related parameters table 4 in the form of the finite ranges the uncertain parameters can be in the behavior of λ 1 l s within the bounds turns out expectable more or less in view of the recent findings by nguyen et al 2019 in simulations of various seed bank models especially in the cases where inclusion of a seed bank and demographic uncertainty in seed bank parameters have little impact on stable populations λ 1 1 with high post seedling survival ibid p 1 see t 2015 2018 in table 5 also our answer to question q3 partly confirms the simulation where decreasing populations λ 1 1 benefit from the inclusion of a seed bank through increases in the growth rate and extinction times whereas increasing populations λ 1 1 are slowed down ibid p 1 comparing the results in table 5 to those in table 4 we see that λ 1 l s takes its minimal and maximal values at the extreme values of parameters s s m s p this fact has a mathematical explanation based on the monotone increasing property of the dominant eigenvalue as a function of matrix elements gantmacher 1967 p 372 horn and johnson 1990 ensuing from the classical perron frobenius theorem it means that if in the formal terms lij denotes the i j th element of matrix l s then we have 4 1 λ 1 l s l ij 0 for any i j 1 2 6 now following the chain rule of differentiation with regard to the lower level variables caswell 2001 p 218 s s s m s p we obtain 4 2 d λ 1 l s i j 1 6 λ 1 l s l ij l ij s ds and the same relationship holds approximately true for the finite differences δλ 1 and δs 1 instead of differentials it follows from 4 1 4 2 and 3 12 that 4 3 δ λ 1 s s s s m s s p s m 11 a g 11 21 b g 11 31 c g 11 41 s 2 16 1 g 0 11 1 s 0 where ij λ 1 l s li 1 i 1 4 6 j 1 6 the corresponding elements of the sensitivity matrix caswell 2001 p 210 for λ 1 l s the 2nd and 3rd inequalities in 4 3 are just the formal expressions of the common sense the less more the seed mortality production the faster growth should be however the sign of the 1st expression is not so obvious as it depends on the relations between i 1 i 1 4 and those relations may vary for various years t and parameter values table 5 therefore the extremal values of l s should always be attained at the extreme values of s m and s p the minimum at the highest mortality of seeds and the least seed production the maximum at the least mortality and highest production table 5 just illustrates this mathematical fact to find the extremal values of s we can analyze the sign of δλ 1 δs according to 4 3 but after the 2nd and 3rd extreme parameter values have been determined there remains only two options for the first one s either the upper or the lower bound of its feasible range the both can be checked up to attribute them to the minimal maximal values of λ 1 l s when searching for a triple of s parameters that change principally the position of λ 1 l relative to 1 we have efficiently used function r 1 l s the pgi which is readily calculated by formula 3 14 even when the matrix depends on uncertain parameters the ppm l t f with f being a rank 1 correction of a substochastic t is not the universal class of ppms though being fairly wide it does not contain lcgs with multiple generative and recruitment stages such as the lcgs in calamagrostis spp case studies logofet et al 2014 2016 2017a of age stage structured populations with both the seed and vegetative modes of reproduction however the single structured lcgs like those in figs 2 3 fit well the rank 1 correction class protasov and logofet 2014 of ppms so that the r 1 l does possess the pgi property and it has enabled revealing the parameter constraints in explicit numeric form table 5 last column it can do so due to the explicit algebraic form 3 14 of its expression via the matrix entries unlike the popular r 0 l ρ f i t 1 caswell 2001 li and schneider 2002 where ρ is the spectral radius a much more difficult computational task than the determinant calculation the condition of λ 1 l changing qualitatively from λ 1 l 1 to λ l s 1 or vice versa has turned out linear with regard to uncertain parameters 3 9 hence verifiable much faster for any particular integer valued triple than finding the spectral radius of the corresponding matrix l s s s m s p this gives one more merit of indication logofet 2013a d o b d o c instead of lambda calculation which is especially crucial in time consuming algorithms such as enumerating a huge number of all possible integer valued triples to find certain bounds for the model outcome further investigations of the s related parameters that could narrow their feasible ranges would make the outcome less variable for the species under study 6 concluding remarks although the present study concerns a particular plant species with specific lcgs for its seed fig 3 and no seeds fig 2 models the way we compare them bears certain traits of generality the transformation of the no seeds lcg into the seed one is general unless we distinguish between the ages of dormant seeds caswell 2001 example 4 1 were the knowledge available of seed bank inhomogeneity it would certainly prompt which seed stages should be added to the no seeds lcg and how they would specifically participate in population recruitment the corresponding components of the population vector such as s t in our case should always be of the dual variable vs parameter nature due to the uncertainty in their actual sizes the integer valued seed parameters are applicable everywhere the data are of the identified individuals type caswell 2001 p 134 function r 1 l s 3 14 can always be calculated in the parametric form and it does possess the pgi property logofet and belova 2008 when the fertility part f s of the pgm l s t s f s represents a rank one correction of the transition part t s protasov and logofet 2014 it does so when in particular there is either a single reproductive stage our current case or a single recruiting stage in the lcg like in an eritrichium caucasicum case study logofet et al 2017b in more general cases where f has a greater than one rank a polynomial function r l can still be algorithmically constructed that does possess the pgi property razzhevaikin and tyrtyshnikov 2020 as regards the results we have obtained using the integer valued formalism they are now concentrated on questions q1 to q4 i e the effects the seed bank inclusion exerts on the ppm s dominant eigenvalue but can be easily expanded to other standard characteristics of the matrix population model we believe that our findings might be typical for the other cases where a seed bank would be incorporated into a well calibrated no seeds model credit author statement dmitrii logofet

24724,this study investigated the coordination between maritime economies and marine carrying capacity a prerequisite for high quality sustainable development in 17 cities of the bohai rim in china metric systems were constructed to evaluate the capacity and efficiency of the coordinated development of the maritime economy and the marine carrying capacity of these cities spatiotemporal weighting matrices the coupling coordination relative development ccrd model and the slacks based measure sbm model were used to evaluate each city in terms of its degree of coordination and development efficiency additionally the spatiotemporal evolution of the cities coordination capacities was assessed using a grey forecasting model gm 1 1 estimated in matlab based on a spatial gravity model the results indicate that 1 the capacity of the 17 cities in the bohai rim to coordinate their maritime economy and marine carrying capacity generally increased throughout the 2007 2016 period however their coordination capacities varied significantly as the spatial distribution of coordination capacity was dispersed over a wide area but concentrated in a few small zones 2 the efficiency of coordinated development in the bohai rim generally increased over time although small fluctuations were observed the maximum increase in average coordination capacity was observed in the central cities followed by the southern cities and finally the northern cities 3 the lines of maximum gravitation between these cities form a gravity circle that wraps around the bohai rim thus generating a multi region development network around it the connections between the northern central and southern cities strengthened over time thus causing these cities to become more integrated the coordination capacity prediction curve for 2017 2026 indicates that all the cities will improve their coordination capacities over time albeit with significant intercity differences since the development of the bohai rim is still in a run in period keywords maritime economies marine carrying capacity efficiency of coordinated development spatial gravity models china 1 introduction for many years humanity has recognised the finite nature of the earth s space and resources as well as the importance of achieving harmony between humanity and the environment tremendous efforts have been dedicated to develop the understanding of the resource environment we live in in 1920 the concept of carrying capacity was defined in ecological studies for the first time there is a maximum number of biological populations and individuals that can be supported by a certain set of environmental conditions lowie 2010 research on carrying capacity has flourished in various areas and the idea that carrying capacity is a cornerstone for the sustainable development of resource environments has gained widespread acceptance this awareness has led to the introduction of concepts such as biological carrying capacity zhao et al 2019a resource carrying capacity hariyanto and bambang 2017 and environmental carrying capacity swiader et al 2019 therefore studies about carrying capacity have extended far beyond their original purview which pertained to the laws governing the growth of non human biological populations the results of these studies have often been employed to treat the problems that affect the socioeconomic development of human society the global maritime economy has grown rapidly since the beginning of the 21st century and maritime economies now play a significant role in the economic political and cultural developments of many regions around the world jiang et al 2014 pascali 2017 ulrike 2018 the maritime economies of china have developed at an extremely rapid pace since the 1990s although coastal provinces and cities account for only 13 4 of china s landmass they are home to 40 of the national population and account for more than 60 of china s gross domestic product gdp zhang et al 2005 the gdp of china s maritime economies reached 7 7611 trillion cny in 2017 9 4 of national gdp which corresponds to a year over year increase of 6 9 stata oceanic administration 2018 however the rapid development of china s maritime economies was overly reliant on resource utilisation and it often involved inappropriate resource exploitation this phenomenon has led to various problems in the resource environment to the detriment of china s overall economic development issues like the discrepancy between supply and demand marine resource depletion and marine environment degradation are now becoming increasingly severe across china jia et al 2019 maestro et al 2019 in this context research on the carrying capacity of marine areas marine carrying capacity has assumed particular significance in other countries most studies about marine carrying capacity focused on the evaluation of single factors and were mainly concerned with the carrying capacity and sustainability of marine fisheries shellfish species and coastal resources chadenas et al 2008 dame and prins 1997 filgueira and grant 2009 vasconcellos and gasalla 2001 in china di and han 2005 proposed the concept of marine carrying capacity for the first time they also conducted systematic analyses about the definition scope characteristics and quantitative metrics of marine carrying capacity subsequently several researchers have conducted investigations on the carrying capacity of marine habitats coastal areas and coastal environments and proposed methods for the study of marine carrying capacity samanta et al 2019 ma et al 2017 yang 2016 although important results have been achieved concerning marine carrying capacity most existing studies have solely focused on carrying capacity thus leading to a scarcity of comprehensive research examining carrying capacity alongside other related dimensions marine carrying capacity is a specific variant of regional carrying capacity and is defined as the maximum population environment and socioeconomic development that can be supported by a marine area within some period while maintaining the sustainability of its resources and the integrity of its ecological environment agmour et al 2018 bentley et al 2017 han et al 2018 the calculation of marine carrying capacity accounts for the material living standards associated with modern societal and cultural norms as well as the self regulating and self maintaining mechanisms of the sea fundamentally the carrying capacity of a resource environment is the maximum environmental capacity resource security and ecological service that can be provided by that geographical environment the key to achieving harmony between humanity and the environment is to coordinate the development intensity of a region with the carrying capacity of its resource environment cropp and norbury 2019 chevillot et al 2019 li et al 2017 in the current context the coordination of development intensity and marine carrying capacity involves two aspects the reliance of humanity on the marine environment and the agency of mankind on one hand humanity wishes to maximise the resources that can be obtained from the sea on the other hand humans also wish to improve the marine environment to enhance its productivity and satisfy their growing needs these factors make it necessary to apply the concept of sustainable development to build and maintain a mutually beneficial relationship between humanity and the sea feng and li 2018 studies about the coordinated development of marine carrying capacity and maritime economies contribute to broadening the knowledge about marine carrying capacity and facilitate the judgement of whether a coastal region s populations resources environments and societies are developing in harmony in addition the findings of these studies may provide necessary insights for the harmonious coordinated development of maritime economies building on the findings of previous research in this study we have integrated statistical methods efficiency analysis and geographic information system gis spatial analysis based on the concept of spatiotemporal weighting the stability of marine terrestrial relationships and the pressure support destructiveness resilience degradation promotion ps dr dp hexagonal interaction model we constructed a comprehensive system of metrics to assess a city s capacity to coordinate its maritime economy and marine carrying capacity henceforth denoted as coordination capacity wang and liu 2019 based on a geographical perspective and the aforementioned quantitative models a unique city level study was conducted in 17 cities in the bohai rim the coordination capacity and efficiency of these cities were observed during the period 2007 2016 and assessed using the coupling coordination relative development ccrd model and slacks based measure sbm model this approach provided a preliminary assessment of the spatiotemporal features of coordination capacity across the bohai rim a spatial gravity model was then used to analyse the strength of the connections between these cities in terms of coordination capacity the grey forecasting model gm 1 1 was then estimated in matlab to predict the evolution of the bohai rim s coordination capacity the study s results provided a detailed evaluation of the spatiotemporal evolution of the coordination capacity of the cities under analysis the findings of this study elucidate the speed mechanisms and scale of socioeconomic development in china s coastal areas and may serve as a guide for the sustainable development of their maritime economies furthermore these findings may help to resolve the imbalances between maritime development resource allocation and marine carrying capacity thus realising harmonious development in china s coastal cities 2 data and methodology 2 1 data sources the data sources used in this work include the 2007 2016 editions of the china marine statistical yearbook china city statistical yearbook shandong statistical yearbook liaoning statistical yearbook hebei economic yearbook tianjin statistical yearbook and the data reported in the statistical bulletins of the relevant national departments the seawater pollution tolerance index based on the grade iii water quality standard was calculated using the results of qiao et al 2008 2 2 research methodology the extreme difference method was used to normalise the raw data and eliminate the effects of dimensional differences on the results of this study the marine economy is an open large scale system with many components that have both influences and restrictions on each other it has the general characteristics of a complex system it is open dynamic real time and spatial the basic condition for the benign operation of a complex system is the coordinated development of each component di and han 2014 by using the ccrd and sbm evaluation models the coordination analysis is carried out scientifically and accurately from the perspective of system development and efficiency furthermore in consideration of time and space a spatial temporal weight matrix is added to build a measurement model addressing ocean economy and ocean carrying capacity 2 2 1 spatiotemporal weighting a spatiotemporal weighting matrix was constructed using the entropy method and the inverse distance weighting method first the entropy method was employed to calculate the time weights sherwin et al 2019 the range attenuation function was then used to determine the inverse distance weighting matrix and the strength of spatial effects was assumed to depend on distance i e the closer two spatial elements the stronger the spatial effect between them the spatial weighting matrix was then normalised so that the sum of the elements in each row was equal to one zhong and li 2010 since the temporal weighting matrix and inverse distance weighting matrix are separable huang et al 2010 a spatiotemporal weighting matrix was constructed for the metrics of each city by combining these matrices 1 h i j k i 1 n p i j ln p i j 2 e j 1 h i j

coordination capacity the coordination capacity of a city consists of two elements the intensity of maritime development and the marine area s carrying capacity the final metrics of each system were obtained by multiplying the two aforementioned metrics by their spatiotemporal weights and totalling the result the measurements were performed using the ccrd model liao 1999 the degree of dispersion between these two systems represents their degree of coupling although the degree of coupling reflects the coordination between the systems it does not reveal the level of development of each system or their overall function therefore we have constructed a coupling coordination equation wherein the higher the degree of coupling and coordination the better the capacity to coordinate between the two systems 7 f i j 1 m x i j w j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m xij standardised value of index j of the i th system wj spatiotemporal weighting 8 c f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 2 2 k c coupling degree k adjustment factor 0 5 9

also can show their development level it can summarise and synthesise the system s overall information extensive research in various fields has proved its strong practicability and maturity by adding a time space weight matrix it can break through the limitation of coordination degree analysis and can thus more scientifically evaluate the coordination ability of the marine economy and sea area carrying capacity gong 2019 zhong and li 2010 zhao et al 2019a 2019b 2 2 3 sbm model in conventional non parametric data envelopment analysis dea such as the charnes cooper rhodes ccr model and the banker chames and cooper bcc model charnes et al 1979 efficiency is simply evaluated from the radial perspective decreases or increases in the output to input ratio and the angular perspective input or output without accounting for slack to resolve this issue tone 2001 proposed a non radial non angular slacks based dea model the sbm model which directly introduces slacks into the target function the sbm model is superior to conventional dea models in terms of its discriminative capabilities zhou et al 2018 10 min ρ k 1 1 m i 1 m s i x i k 1 1 q r 1 q s r y r k s t x λ s x k y λ s y k λ s s 0 compared with the traditional dea analysis method this model goes beyond the limitations of radial and linear segmented form theory and effectively resolves the relaxation type problem of input output in this paper the ratio between the resource input and the coordination level of marine economy and sea area carrying capacity for a certain time period is calculated and the sbm model demonstrates stronger resolution and more accurate measurement value zhou et al 2018 gokgoz and erkul 2019 2 2 4 spatial gravity model and the gm 1 1 grey forecasting model the strength of each city s spatial connections was used to calculate an index quantifying intercity interactions in terms of their coupling coordination index this index was then used to indicate the capacity of a city to radiate its properties to nearby regions as well as the acceptance of such radiation effects by nearby regions keum 2010 the gravity model is widely used as a mathematical tool to analyse and predict spatial interactions hua et al 2016 qi et al 2018 in this model the city that has the strongest spatial ties with some other city is the latter s city of maximum gravitational force and the connection between these cities corresponds to the line of maximum gravitational force grey forecast models are used to search for patterns in the behaviour of data generating measurement systems based on the degree of similarity dissimilarity between systems javed and liu 2019 gm 1 1 is the most commonly used type of grey forecast model if the original time series exhibits exponential behaviours the gm 1 1 model can be used to infinitely approximate the exponential behaviours of the original time series through a first order linear differential equation since these predictions involve a large amount of data and factors a program was written in matlab to conduct the simulations kravchinsky et al 2019 since the simulations were performed using common methods the concepts and procedures used in these simulations will not be discussed further 11 r i j g t i t j d i j 2 rij spatial connection intensity of coordination degree of two cities ti tj coordination degree between the intensity of marine

of coordination capacity 3 1 1 establishing a system for assessing coordination capacity and its conceptual model to measure a city s coordination capacity to the utmost degree of accuracy a clear and comprehensive quantitative system of metrics needs to be constructed humanity has already achieved tremendous gains in maritime development although these developments impose a certain level of pressure on marine systems the sea can maintain a state of equilibrium and stability through its self regulating mechanisms as long as these developments are limited to a tolerable level nonetheless if the intensity of maritime development exceeds the sea s carrying capacity it is still possible for humanity to proactively increase the carrying capacity of a marine area by using methods that support the sea s rehabilitation fan et al 2017a eikeset et al 2018 at present the pressure state response psr and driving force pressure state impact response dpsir frameworks are widely used to simulate the carrying capacity of resource environments the psr framework can be used to elucidate causal relationships in a system however the parameterisation of the psr framework is highly subjective therefore the psr framework cannot provide insights into a system s structure and decision making processes and it performs poorly in complex feedback systems the dpsir framework provides a comprehensive analysis of various environmental problems by taking a holistic view of human and environmental factors and it is generally considered superior to the psr framework however the dpsir model is a specialised framework for the growth limits problem and is only able to provide response type measures for environmental conservation kazuva et al 2018 in this study we have constructed an early warning mechanism for evaluating the carrying capacity of resource environments which utilises the concept of carrying capacity in the ps dr dp hexagonal interaction model and accounts for growth limits and structural stability when simulating the dynamics of a resource environment s carrying capacity wang and liu 2019 based on the ps dr dp model the results of the studies conducted by di and han 2005 and ulrike 2018 and a thorough consideration of how stable marine terrestrial relationships and socioeconomic development affect the relationship between maritime economic development and marine carrying capacity we have formulated an approach that is both comprehensive and insightful fig 1 the proposed approach accounts for the resource societal and economic aspects of maritime development and marine carrying capacity and highlights the features and manifestations of these aspects furthermore the proposed approach also combines dynamism and stability by using temporally continuous metrics which provide an accurate assessment of the current situation and describe past events and future trends in this work four dimensions were used to characterise marine carrying capacity and the intensity of maritime economic development pressure destructiveness support and resilience pressure refers to the consumption of resources induced by socioeconomic activities while support refers to the available resource potential and support for development activities destructiveness indicates outcomes that are harmful to human life such as environmental pollution caused by economic development and natural disasters resilience is the ability of humanity to find a remedy for environmental pollution as well as to predict resist and repair the harm caused by natural disasters gerten et al 2018 s work on the water resources of terrestrial ecosystems prove their resilience marchese et al 2018 who examined sustainability and resilience develops a system that can express resilience as a component of sustainability sustainability as a component of resilience and sustainability as a single goal pressure and destructiveness represent the negative loads of the resource environment which is the maritime development system support and resilience represent the positive loads of the resource environment that is the marine carrying capacity system the metric selection process also accounted for marine terrestrial relationships and socioeconomic effects for instance the metrics in the pressure dimension include total seawater aquatic products and the mariculture area urbanisation rate population gross oceanic product and its share of gdp and the share of secondary and tertiary maritime industries which represent the socioeconomic dimension the destructiveness metric represents the number of inbound foreign domestic tourists which reflects the ecological damage caused by tourists this metric also considers the socioeconomic aspect of marine terrestrial relationships the metrics of the support and resilience dimensions include the area of green spaces the seawater pollution tolerance index as well as the standard of living infrastructure level and science and technology environments that are most conducive to socioeconomic and ecological development from a lateral viewpoint the selection of these metrics highlights the principles that guide the selection process comprehensiveness depth dynamism and stability a total of 26 metrics were selected to form a system for the evaluation of coordination capacity as shown in table 1 this system was used to provide a comprehensive assessment of the coordination capacity of 17 cities in the bohai rim over a period of 10 years the marine economy and sea area carrying capacity are open systems with multiple components due to their openness dynamics and uncertainty the relevant indicators are numerous and complex and the resources and environments are also unique so it is impossible to establish a unified quantitative indicator system it is easy to see that the indicator system is too large and difficult to calculate or too general and comprehensive due to these characteristics the conclusion is not accurate or scientific on the basis of reference to the existing literature research index system this paper mainly refers to index system of professors di and han 2005 with focus on the marine economy and sea area carrying capacity and utilising a technical method involving environmental carrying capacity early warning fan et al 2017a 2017b ultimately we try to build an evaluation system of 26 indexes combined with quantifiable and available data 3 1 2 the evaluation of coordination capacity the marine carrying capacity and maritime development intensity of each city were quantified using the system of metrics and spatiotemporal weighting matrix mentioned above the quantified values of the two systems i e marine carrying capacity and maritime development intensity were then substituted into the ccrd model to calculate the degree of coordination between these systems in bohai rim cities 3 2 measuring the efficiency of coordinated development in each city s maritime economy and marine carrying capacity 3 2 1 a system of metrics for evaluating the efficiency of coordinated development to elucidate the nuances and patterns that characterise the coordinated development of maritime economies and marine carrying capacity in each city we have analysed the development efficiency of each city in conjunction with its degree of coordination that is the efficiency of its coordinated development this measure reflects the inputs outputs and resource allocations of a maritime economy during its development and is a key reference for gauging the relationship between maritime economic development and marine carrying capacity in this work the efficiency of coordinated development is defined as the ratio between the input and output factors in each system a system of metrics for evaluating the efficiency of coordinated development was constructed by selecting available metrics that are representative of efficiency which are summarised in table 2 when selecting these metrics care was taken to avoid redundancies with the previously described system of metrics for evaluating coordination capacity contrasting outcomes when redundancy occurred was not avoided 3 2 2 evaluating the efficiency of coordinated development the sbm dea model in the maxdea software suite was used to evaluate the overall efficiency of coordinated development in 17 cities within the bohai rim during the 2007 2016 period based on the system of metrics described in section 3 2 1 4 results 4 1 the coordination capacities of cities in the bohai rim 4 1 1 temporal differentiation table 3 shows that the coordination capacity of the cities in the bohai rim as a whole has progressively increased throughout the 2007 2016 period however the improvements in coordination capacity vary significantly across cities improvements have been achieved as a result of growing environmental awareness about the sea improvements and upgrades in the development and management of marine economies and the conservation of marine resource environments these factors have worked together to promote the coordination of marine economic development and marine carrying capacity therefore a foundation has been established for high quality sustainable development in these maritime economies the bohai blue sea action plan and other economic development plans implemented across china and the bohai rim have also played a constructive role in the growth of the bohai rim s maritime economies and the promotion of harmonious and healthy maritime development 1 1 the bohai blue sea action plan was approved and implemented by the state council in 2001 and incorporated into the national environmental protection sections of the ninth five year plan and the tenth five year plan this phenomenon has also improved the coordination capacities of the cities in the bohai rim however the coordination capacity of these cities only ranges from 0 16 to 0 30 indicating that there is significant room for improvement in the coordination of economic development resource utilisation and environmental conservation across the bohai rim these cities also exhibit significant differences in coordination capacity when compared to one another for example the coordination capacities of tianjin and binzhou were 0 2375 and 0 1601 respectively a difference of 0 0774 in 2007 in 2016 the coordination capacities of tianjin and jinzhou were 0 3063 and 0 2267 respectively a difference of 0 0796 since the coordinating capacity of each city develops at a different rate their disparities in coordination capacity may widen over time in the future the development of coordination capacity should focus on the region as a whole in addition inter province cooperation should be enhanced so that better off provinces can assist the development of worse off ones thus achieving harmonious development across the entire bohai rim fig 1 4 1 2 spatial differentiation the average coordination capacity of each city in the bohai rim was visualised in arcgis 10 2 via natural breaks classification thus producing a map that characterises the spatial distribution of coordination capacity across the whole area fig 2 this figure highlights the bohai rim s spatial trends in terms of coordination capacity fig 2 shows that the distribution of coordination capacity between the cities of the bohai rim is widely dispersed but strongly concentrated in a few small zones which indicates a significant degree of spatial differentiation the coordination capacities of dalian tianjin yantai and qingdao were notably superior to those of other cities these cities are rich in marine resources and have highly developed maritime economies further their inputs in science and technology innovations industrial structure optimisation and ecological conservation are larger than those of other cities yingkou and panjin in liaoning qinhuangdao and tangshan in hebei and dongying weifang rizhao and weihai in shandong have moderate levels of coordination capacity these results imply that the coordination capacities of the bohai rim cities are not yet satisfactory although they are generally on the rise additionally since the marine resources maritime economic development and science technology ecology inputs of these cities are all at moderate levels there is significant room for further growth and development the coordination of their maritime economies and marine carrying capacities may improve significantly in future the coordination capacities of dandong jinzhou huludao cangzhou and binzhou are relatively low and their development is still inadequate in all aspects improvements and upgrades are urgently needed in these cities the cities with the highest coordination capacities dalian tianjin yantai and qingdao are located in the northern central and southern parts of the bohai rim together they form three extreme points characterised by significantly higher coordination capacities than their surrounding cities as a whole results indicate that a city s coordination capacity is positively correlated with its level of maritime economic development 4 2 the efficiency of coordinated development in the cities of the bohai rim fig 3 shows that the efficiency of coordinated development in each bohai rim city has changed significantly between 2007 and 2016 the average efficiency of coordinated development increased from 0 7487 in 2007 to 0 8089 in 2016 in 2007 eight cities had an optimal level of efficiency five cities had efficiencies between 0 5 and 0 9 moderate efficiency and four cities had efficiencies lower than 0 4 low efficiency in 2016 the number of cities with optimal efficiency levels was unchanged eight cities had moderate levels of efficiency and only one city had a low level of efficiency although the number of cities with an optimal level of efficiency did not change the cities that belong to this category have changed tianjin cangzhou panjin and yingkou remained in this category in 2007 and 2016 and tangshan dongying qingdao and weihai joined this category in 2016 the cities that dropped to a moderate level of efficiency in 2016 were huludao jinzhou rizhao and dandong and the cities that rose from a low to moderate level of efficiency were dalian and yantai as a whole the efficiency of coordinated development increased rapidly in the central and southern cities but slightly decreased in the northern cities which originally had a high level of efficiency northern central and southern cities have distinct development trends in coordination capacity the results reported in table 4 indicate that the average efficiency of coordinated development in the bohai rim generally increased over time despite a brief drop in 2010 the efficiency of the central cities steadily increased to their maximum in 2016 and exceeded the average efficiency of the bohai rim by 0 0979 in 2007 the efficiency of the northern cities exceeded the average efficiency of the bohai rim by 0 1448 whereas the efficiency of central and southern cities was lower than the average however the efficiency of the northern cities has fluctuated and somewhat decreased over time by contrast the southern cities have seen rapid growth in efficiency since 2013 and started to overtake the northern cities in 2016 as a whole the efficiency of coordinated development has increased across the bohai rim the rise in efficiency was the highest in the central cities followed by those in the south and finally the north this result implies that the connections and interactions amongst the cities of the bohai rim should be further strengthened so that the coordinated development of marine economies and marine carrying capacities can be improved across the area as a whole 5 discussion of the evolutionary trends in coordination capacity 5 1 spatial connections in coordination capacity 5 1 1 lines of maximum gravitational force between the cities the lines of maximum gravitational force between the bohai rim cities in terms of coordination capacity were calculated using a spatial gravity model based on the average coordination capacities of each city and the calculated strengths of their intercity connections fig 4 cities connected by a line of maximum gravitational force strongly affect each other in the development of coordination capacity the lines of maximum gravitational force between the cities of the bohai rim are generally stable and they appear to adhere to certain rules these lines can be divided into six parts 1 dandong yingkou and panjin 2 jinzhou and huludao 3 qinhuangdao tangshan tianjin and cangzhou 4 binzhou dongying and weifang 5 rizhao and qingdao 6 weihai yantai and dalian yingkou yantai dongying tianjin and tangshan have two connections and thus strongly affect the cities they are connected to as a whole the lines of maximum gravitational force between these cities form a gravitational circle that wraps around the bohai rim the lines with tianjin at their centre and the cross sea line that connects yantai dalian and weihai are essential for the bohai rim s overall connectivity on this basis we investigated the structure of the coordination capacity gravitational network between the cities of the bohai rim 5 1 2 coordination capacity gravitational network amongst the cities of the bohai rim fig 5 illustrates the state of the coordination capacity gravitational network amongst the bohai rim s cities in 2007 2010 2013 and 2016 arcgis software was used to classify the links into five grades according to their strength 0 01 0 01 0 03 0 03 0 06 0 06 0 09 and 0 09 fig 5 shows that the complexity of the gravitational network gradually increased over time which led to the formation of an interconnected development network encompassing multiple regions across the bohai rim the changes in the patterns of the gravitational network were also significant and the spatial connections amongst the northern central and southern cities have gradually strengthened over time to form a linked state of development in 2007 only a few weak spatial connections existed between the cities of the bohai rim which indicates that the development of each city was only weakly related to that of other cities between 2010 and 2013 a core region i e a region dense in intercity connections gradually took form around the dalian huludao and tianjin yantai dongying lines in 2016 the respective developments of dalian tianjin yantai and dongying became strongly linked to each other further a significant increase was observed in the number of core cities and the strength of intercity connections hence the bohai rim has gradually adopted an interconnected model of development that encompasses multiple regions this trend was generated by the development of the economy and transportation networks which increased the cities consolidation and economic radiation thus resulting in the spatial agglomeration of regional development the gradual regional joint development amongst cities not only has a great influence on regional economic development but also has a beneficial effect in improving regional ecological environment bearing capacity the sea area ecological bearing capacity is the basis of economic development the coordination of the marine economy and ecological environmental protection is related to the operation of the broader social economic system from the current local urban connections strength continues to increase the joint development of multiple areas will positively affect the whole region s ecological economy promoting the coordination of the overall marine economy and the ecological sea area load this result indicates that the evolution of the bohai rim s coordination capacity gravitational network is similar to that of the cities gravitational patterns 5 2 predicting trends in the development of coordination capacity the matlab 9 0 software suite was used to write a gm 1 1 model for predicting the degree of coordination of each bohai rim city the matlab program was verified and then executed in a matlab window the predictions were based on the data about the coordination capacity of the bohai rim s cities from table 3 the results for the predictions are depicted in fig 6 before making these predictions it was necessary to validate the data and the program was only executed after the modelling method s feasibility was verified the predictions indicate that the degree of coordination in the cities of the bohai rim will generally range within 0 2 0 45 from 2017 to 2026 as the considered time frame is a run in period that will see the continuation of previous rising trends in the bohai rim s coordination capacities this result also indicates that the measures that are currently being implemented to develop the bohai rim s maritime economies are beneficial for coordinated development however the improvements in coordination capacity vary across cities and the differences can be very large furthermore these disparities may grow larger over time for example jinzhou city is expected to exhibit the least improvement in coordination capacity amongst all the bohai rim s cities whereas the coordination capacities of dongying weihai and yingkou are predicted to improve tremendously the coordination of tianjin dalian yantai and qingdai are expected to increase steadily and remain at a high level therefore neglecting marine carrying capacity may lead to dangerous imbalances in the overall system a more constructive approach would be to focus on marine ecosystems and try to build a bridge to connect carrying capacity with socioeconomic developments to achieve steady progress that is truly beneficial for the bohai rim s maritime economies the degree of coordination across this region will need to stabilise at a high level and grow steadily over time 6 conclusion based on the modern needs of maritime economic development we have constructed systems of metrics to assess the coordination capacity and coordinated development efficiency of the bohai rim s cities which are excellent representatives of china s maritime economies these metric systems are based on the findings of other related studies and they account for the stability of marine terrestrial relationships and spatiotemporal weighting based on a spatial gravity model the gm 1 1 grey forecasting model was used to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the cities coordination capacities this unique study has employed novel research perspectives and methodologies to provide an accurate picture of the state of coordination amongst maritime economies and marine carrying capacities in the bohai rim s cities the findings of this study are of theoretical and practical significance especially for the formulation of measures to address regional disparities this study s results indicate that coordination capacities are generally rising across the bohai rim however the improvement in coordination capacity varies across cities and the differences can be quite large the spatial distribution of coordination capacity in the bohai rim is dispersed over a wide area but also concentrated in a few smaller areas the northern central and southern cities form three extreme points that have a strong effect on their surrounding cities although the efficiency of coordinated development in the bohai rim exhibited small fluctuations at certain points it has generally increased over time the increase in coordination capacity is greatest in the central cities followed by the southern cities and then the northern ones based on an analysis of the coordination capacity gravitational network formed by the lines of maximum gravitational force between the cities of the bohai rim this study found that these lines have formed a gravitational circle wrapping around the bohai rim and thus forming a multi region development network the spatial connections between the northern central and southern cities have gradually strengthened over time and this has caused their developmental states to become interconnected therefore the bohai rim is gradually becoming more integrated in terms of coordination capacities and the influence of time cost and distance factors is becoming more pronounced according to the state of development shown by the coordination capacity prediction curve the coordination capacities in all bohai rim cities will improve over time albeit with some disparities since the bohai rim is still in a run in period in terms of its development the development of maritime economies will inevitably involve resource exploitation and environmental pollution hence the key to high quality sustainable development lies in the balancing of costs and benefits for harmonising economic and environmental development to improve the coordination of maritime economies and marine carrying capacity in the bohai rim the development of new technology based industries needs to be promoted and efforts to construct an ecological civilisation should be strengthened holistic plans and measures should be implemented to ensure the rationality of resource development further the relationship between development and carrying capacity must be managed appropriately in this way harmonious development of maritime economies and marine carrying capacities can be gradually achieved credit author

24724,this study investigated the coordination between maritime economies and marine carrying capacity a prerequisite for high quality sustainable development in 17 cities of the bohai rim in china metric systems were constructed to evaluate the capacity and efficiency of the coordinated development of the maritime economy and the marine carrying capacity of these cities spatiotemporal weighting matrices the coupling coordination relative development ccrd model and the slacks based measure sbm model were used to evaluate each city in terms of its degree of coordination and development efficiency additionally the spatiotemporal evolution of the cities coordination capacities was assessed using a grey forecasting model gm 1 1 estimated in matlab based on a spatial gravity model the results indicate that 1 the capacity of the 17 cities in the bohai rim to coordinate their maritime economy and marine carrying capacity generally increased throughout the 2007 2016 period however their coordination capacities varied significantly as the spatial distribution of coordination capacity was dispersed over a wide area but concentrated in a few small zones 2 the efficiency of coordinated development in the bohai rim generally increased over time although small fluctuations were observed the maximum increase in average coordination capacity was observed in the central cities followed by the southern cities and finally the northern cities 3 the lines of maximum gravitation between these cities form a gravity circle that wraps around the bohai rim thus generating a multi region development network around it the connections between the northern central and southern cities strengthened over time thus causing these cities to become more integrated the coordination capacity prediction curve for 2017 2026 indicates that all the cities will improve their coordination capacities over time albeit with significant intercity differences since the development of the bohai rim is still in a run in period keywords maritime economies marine carrying capacity efficiency of coordinated development spatial gravity models china 1 introduction for many years humanity has recognised the finite nature of the earth s space and resources as well as the importance of achieving harmony between humanity and the environment tremendous efforts have been dedicated to develop the understanding of the resource environment we live in in 1920 the concept of carrying capacity was defined in ecological studies for the first time there is a maximum number of biological populations and individuals that can be supported by a certain set of environmental conditions lowie 2010 research on carrying capacity has flourished in various areas and the idea that carrying capacity is a cornerstone for the sustainable development of resource environments has gained widespread acceptance this awareness has led to the introduction of concepts such as biological carrying capacity zhao et al 2019a resource carrying capacity hariyanto and bambang 2017 and environmental carrying capacity swiader et al 2019 therefore studies about carrying capacity have extended far beyond their original purview which pertained to the laws governing the growth of non human biological populations the results of these studies have often been employed to treat the problems that affect the socioeconomic development of human society the global maritime economy has grown rapidly since the beginning of the 21st century and maritime economies now play a significant role in the economic political and cultural developments of many regions around the world jiang et al 2014 pascali 2017 ulrike 2018 the maritime economies of china have developed at an extremely rapid pace since the 1990s although coastal provinces and cities account for only 13 4 of china s landmass they are home to 40 of the national population and account for more than 60 of china s gross domestic product gdp zhang et al 2005 the gdp of china s maritime economies reached 7 7611 trillion cny in 2017 9 4 of national gdp which corresponds to a year over year increase of 6 9 stata oceanic administration 2018 however the rapid development of china s maritime economies was overly reliant on resource utilisation and it often involved inappropriate resource exploitation this phenomenon has led to various problems in the resource environment to the detriment of china s overall economic development issues like the discrepancy between supply and demand marine resource depletion and marine environment degradation are now becoming increasingly severe across china jia et al 2019 maestro et al 2019 in this context research on the carrying capacity of marine areas marine carrying capacity has assumed particular significance in other countries most studies about marine carrying capacity focused on the evaluation of single factors and were mainly concerned with the carrying capacity and sustainability of marine fisheries shellfish species and coastal resources chadenas et al 2008 dame and prins 1997 filgueira and grant 2009 vasconcellos and gasalla 2001 in china di and han 2005 proposed the concept of marine carrying capacity for the first time they also conducted systematic analyses about the definition scope characteristics and quantitative metrics of marine carrying capacity subsequently several researchers have conducted investigations on the carrying capacity of marine habitats coastal areas and coastal environments and proposed methods for the study of marine carrying capacity samanta et al 2019 ma et al 2017 yang 2016 although important results have been achieved concerning marine carrying capacity most existing studies have solely focused on carrying capacity thus leading to a scarcity of comprehensive research examining carrying capacity alongside other related dimensions marine carrying capacity is a specific variant of regional carrying capacity and is defined as the maximum population environment and socioeconomic development that can be supported by a marine area within some period while maintaining the sustainability of its resources and the integrity of its ecological environment agmour et al 2018 bentley et al 2017 han et al 2018 the calculation of marine carrying capacity accounts for the material living standards associated with modern societal and cultural norms as well as the self regulating and self maintaining mechanisms of the sea fundamentally the carrying capacity of a resource environment is the maximum environmental capacity resource security and ecological service that can be provided by that geographical environment the key to achieving harmony between humanity and the environment is to coordinate the development intensity of a region with the carrying capacity of its resource environment cropp and norbury 2019 chevillot et al 2019 li et al 2017 in the current context the coordination of development intensity and marine carrying capacity involves two aspects the reliance of humanity on the marine environment and the agency of mankind on one hand humanity wishes to maximise the resources that can be obtained from the sea on the other hand humans also wish to improve the marine environment to enhance its productivity and satisfy their growing needs these factors make it necessary to apply the concept of sustainable development to build and maintain a mutually beneficial relationship between humanity and the sea feng and li 2018 studies about the coordinated development of marine carrying capacity and maritime economies contribute to broadening the knowledge about marine carrying capacity and facilitate the judgement of whether a coastal region s populations resources environments and societies are developing in harmony in addition the findings of these studies may provide necessary insights for the harmonious coordinated development of maritime economies building on the findings of previous research in this study we have integrated statistical methods efficiency analysis and geographic information system gis spatial analysis based on the concept of spatiotemporal weighting the stability of marine terrestrial relationships and the pressure support destructiveness resilience degradation promotion ps dr dp hexagonal interaction model we constructed a comprehensive system of metrics to assess a city s capacity to coordinate its maritime economy and marine carrying capacity henceforth denoted as coordination capacity wang and liu 2019 based on a geographical perspective and the aforementioned quantitative models a unique city level study was conducted in 17 cities in the bohai rim the coordination capacity and efficiency of these cities were observed during the period 2007 2016 and assessed using the coupling coordination relative development ccrd model and slacks based measure sbm model this approach provided a preliminary assessment of the spatiotemporal features of coordination capacity across the bohai rim a spatial gravity model was then used to analyse the strength of the connections between these cities in terms of coordination capacity the grey forecasting model gm 1 1 was then estimated in matlab to predict the evolution of the bohai rim s coordination capacity the study s results provided a detailed evaluation of the spatiotemporal evolution of the coordination capacity of the cities under analysis the findings of this study elucidate the speed mechanisms and scale of socioeconomic development in china s coastal areas and may serve as a guide for the sustainable development of their maritime economies furthermore these findings may help to resolve the imbalances between maritime development resource allocation and marine carrying capacity thus realising harmonious development in china s coastal cities 2 data and methodology 2 1 data sources the data sources used in this work include the 2007 2016 editions of the china marine statistical yearbook china city statistical yearbook shandong statistical yearbook liaoning statistical yearbook hebei economic yearbook tianjin statistical yearbook and the data reported in the statistical bulletins of the relevant national departments the seawater pollution tolerance index based on the grade iii water quality standard was calculated using the results of qiao et al 2008 2 2 research methodology the extreme difference method was used to normalise the raw data and eliminate the effects of dimensional differences on the results of this study the marine economy is an open large scale system with many components that have both influences and restrictions on each other it has the general characteristics of a complex system it is open dynamic real time and spatial the basic condition for the benign operation of a complex system is the coordinated development of each component di and han 2014 by using the ccrd and sbm evaluation models the coordination analysis is carried out scientifically and accurately from the perspective of system development and efficiency furthermore in consideration of time and space a spatial temporal weight matrix is added to build a measurement model addressing ocean economy and ocean carrying capacity 2 2 1 spatiotemporal weighting a spatiotemporal weighting matrix was constructed using the entropy method and the inverse distance weighting method first the entropy method was employed to calculate the time weights sherwin et al 2019 the range attenuation function was then used to determine the inverse distance weighting matrix and the strength of spatial effects was assumed to depend on distance i e the closer two spatial elements the stronger the spatial effect between them the spatial weighting matrix was then normalised so that the sum of the elements in each row was equal to one zhong and li 2010 since the temporal weighting matrix and inverse distance weighting matrix are separable huang et al 2010 a spatiotemporal weighting matrix was constructed for the metrics of each city by combining these matrices 1 h i j k i 1 n p i j ln p i j 2 e j 1 h i j

coordination capacity the coordination capacity of a city consists of two elements the intensity of maritime development and the marine area s carrying capacity the final metrics of each system were obtained by multiplying the two aforementioned metrics by their spatiotemporal weights and totalling the result the measurements were performed using the ccrd model liao 1999 the degree of dispersion between these two systems represents their degree of coupling although the degree of coupling reflects the coordination between the systems it does not reveal the level of development of each system or their overall function therefore we have constructed a coupling coordination equation wherein the higher the degree of coupling and coordination the better the capacity to coordinate between the two systems 7 f i j 1 m x i j w j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m xij standardised value of index j of the i th system wj spatiotemporal weighting 8 c f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 2 2 k c coupling degree k adjustment factor 0 5 9

also can show their development level it can summarise and synthesise the system s overall information extensive research in various fields has proved its strong practicability and maturity by adding a time space weight matrix it can break through the limitation of coordination degree analysis and can thus more scientifically evaluate the coordination ability of the marine economy and sea area carrying capacity gong 2019 zhong and li 2010 zhao et al 2019a 2019b 2 2 3 sbm model in conventional non parametric data envelopment analysis dea such as the charnes cooper rhodes ccr model and the banker chames and cooper bcc model charnes et al 1979 efficiency is simply evaluated from the radial perspective decreases or increases in the output to input ratio and the angular perspective input or output without accounting for slack to resolve this issue tone 2001 proposed a non radial non angular slacks based dea model the sbm model which directly introduces slacks into the target function the sbm model is superior to conventional dea models in terms of its discriminative capabilities zhou et al 2018 10 min ρ k 1 1 m i 1 m s i x i k 1 1 q r 1 q s r y r k s t x λ s x k y λ s y k λ s s 0 compared with the traditional dea analysis method this model goes beyond the limitations of radial and linear segmented form theory and effectively resolves the relaxation type problem of input output in this paper the ratio between the resource input and the coordination level of marine economy and sea area carrying capacity for a certain time period is calculated and the sbm model demonstrates stronger resolution and more accurate measurement value zhou et al 2018 gokgoz and erkul 2019 2 2 4 spatial gravity model and the gm 1 1 grey forecasting model the strength of each city s spatial connections was used to calculate an index quantifying intercity interactions in terms of their coupling coordination index this index was then used to indicate the capacity of a city to radiate its properties to nearby regions as well as the acceptance of such radiation effects by nearby regions keum 2010 the gravity model is widely used as a mathematical tool to analyse and predict spatial interactions hua et al 2016 qi et al 2018 in this model the city that has the strongest spatial ties with some other city is the latter s city of maximum gravitational force and the connection between these cities corresponds to the line of maximum gravitational force grey forecast models are used to search for patterns in the behaviour of data generating measurement systems based on the degree of similarity dissimilarity between systems javed and liu 2019 gm 1 1 is the most commonly used type of grey forecast model if the original time series exhibits exponential behaviours the gm 1 1 model can be used to infinitely approximate the exponential behaviours of the original time series through a first order linear differential equation since these predictions involve a large amount of data and factors a program was written in matlab to conduct the simulations kravchinsky et al 2019 since the simulations were performed using common methods the concepts and procedures used in these simulations will not be discussed further 11 r i j g t i t j d i j 2 rij spatial connection intensity of coordination degree of two cities ti tj coordination degree between the intensity of marine

of coordination capacity 3 1 1 establishing a system for assessing coordination capacity and its conceptual model to measure a city s coordination capacity to the utmost degree of accuracy a clear and comprehensive quantitative system of metrics needs to be constructed humanity has already achieved tremendous gains in maritime development although these developments impose a certain level of pressure on marine systems the sea can maintain a state of equilibrium and stability through its self regulating mechanisms as long as these developments are limited to a tolerable level nonetheless if the intensity of maritime development exceeds the sea s carrying capacity it is still possible for humanity to proactively increase the carrying capacity of a marine area by using methods that support the sea s rehabilitation fan et al 2017a eikeset et al 2018 at present the pressure state response psr and driving force pressure state impact response dpsir frameworks are widely used to simulate the carrying capacity of resource environments the psr framework can be used to elucidate causal relationships in a system however the parameterisation of the psr framework is highly subjective therefore the psr framework cannot provide insights into a system s structure and decision making processes and it performs poorly in complex feedback systems the dpsir framework provides a comprehensive analysis of various environmental problems by taking a holistic view of human and environmental factors and it is generally considered superior to the psr framework however the dpsir model is a specialised framework for the growth limits problem and is only able to provide response type measures for environmental conservation kazuva et al 2018 in this study we have constructed an early warning mechanism for evaluating the carrying capacity of resource environments which utilises the concept of carrying capacity in the ps dr dp hexagonal interaction model and accounts for growth limits and structural stability when simulating the dynamics of a resource environment s carrying capacity wang and liu 2019 based on the ps dr dp model the results of the studies conducted by di and han 2005 and ulrike 2018 and a thorough consideration of how stable marine terrestrial relationships and socioeconomic development affect the relationship between maritime economic development and marine carrying capacity we have formulated an approach that is both comprehensive and insightful fig 1 the proposed approach accounts for the resource societal and economic aspects of maritime development and marine carrying capacity and highlights the features and manifestations of these aspects furthermore the proposed approach also combines dynamism and stability by using temporally continuous metrics which provide an accurate assessment of the current situation and describe past events and future trends in this work four dimensions were used to characterise marine carrying capacity and the intensity of maritime economic development pressure destructiveness support and resilience pressure refers to the consumption of resources induced by socioeconomic activities while support refers to the available resource potential and support for development activities destructiveness indicates outcomes that are harmful to human life such as environmental pollution caused by economic development and natural disasters resilience is the ability of humanity to find a remedy for environmental pollution as well as to predict resist and repair the harm caused by natural disasters gerten et al 2018 s work on the water resources of terrestrial ecosystems prove their resilience marchese et al 2018 who examined sustainability and resilience develops a system that can express resilience as a component of sustainability sustainability as a component of resilience and sustainability as a single goal pressure and destructiveness represent the negative loads of the resource environment which is the maritime development system support and resilience represent the positive loads of the resource environment that is the marine carrying capacity system the metric selection process also accounted for marine terrestrial relationships and socioeconomic effects for instance the metrics in the pressure dimension include total seawater aquatic products and the mariculture area urbanisation rate population gross oceanic product and its share of gdp and the share of secondary and tertiary maritime industries which represent the socioeconomic dimension the destructiveness metric represents the number of inbound foreign domestic tourists which reflects the ecological damage caused by tourists this metric also considers the socioeconomic aspect of marine terrestrial relationships the metrics of the support and resilience dimensions include the area of green spaces the seawater pollution tolerance index as well as the standard of living infrastructure level and science and technology environments that are most conducive to socioeconomic and ecological development from a lateral viewpoint the selection of these metrics highlights the principles that guide the selection process comprehensiveness depth dynamism and stability a total of 26 metrics were selected to form a system for the evaluation of coordination capacity as shown in table 1 this system was used to provide a comprehensive assessment of the coordination capacity of 17 cities in the bohai rim over a period of 10 years the marine economy and sea area carrying capacity are open systems with multiple components due to their openness dynamics and uncertainty the relevant indicators are numerous and complex and the resources and environments are also unique so it is impossible to establish a unified quantitative indicator system it is easy to see that the indicator system is too large and difficult to calculate or too general and comprehensive due to these characteristics the conclusion is not accurate or scientific on the basis of reference to the existing literature research index system this paper mainly refers to index system of professors di and han 2005 with focus on the marine economy and sea area carrying capacity and utilising a technical method involving environmental carrying capacity early warning fan et al 2017a 2017b ultimately we try to build an evaluation system of 26 indexes combined with quantifiable and available data 3 1 2 the evaluation of coordination capacity the marine carrying capacity and maritime development intensity of each city were quantified using the system of metrics and spatiotemporal weighting matrix mentioned above the quantified values of the two systems i e marine carrying capacity and maritime development intensity were then substituted into the ccrd model to calculate the degree of coordination between these systems in bohai rim cities 3 2 measuring the efficiency of coordinated development in each city s maritime economy and marine carrying capacity 3 2 1 a system of metrics for evaluating the efficiency of coordinated development to elucidate the nuances and patterns that characterise the coordinated development of maritime economies and marine carrying capacity in each city we have analysed the development efficiency of each city in conjunction with its degree of coordination that is the efficiency of its coordinated development this measure reflects the inputs outputs and resource allocations of a maritime economy during its development and is a key reference for gauging the relationship between maritime economic development and marine carrying capacity in this work the efficiency of coordinated development is defined as the ratio between the input and output factors in each system a system of metrics for evaluating the efficiency of coordinated development was constructed by selecting available metrics that are representative of efficiency which are summarised in table 2 when selecting these metrics care was taken to avoid redundancies with the previously described system of metrics for evaluating coordination capacity contrasting outcomes when redundancy occurred was not avoided 3 2 2 evaluating the efficiency of coordinated development the sbm dea model in the maxdea software suite was used to evaluate the overall efficiency of coordinated development in 17 cities within the bohai rim during the 2007 2016 period based on the system of metrics described in section 3 2 1 4 results 4 1 the coordination capacities of cities in the bohai rim 4 1 1 temporal differentiation table 3 shows that the coordination capacity of the cities in the bohai rim as a whole has progressively increased throughout the 2007 2016 period however the improvements in coordination capacity vary significantly across cities improvements have been achieved as a result of growing environmental awareness about the sea improvements and upgrades in the development and management of marine economies and the conservation of marine resource environments these factors have worked together to promote the coordination of marine economic development and marine carrying capacity therefore a foundation has been established for high quality sustainable development in these maritime economies the bohai blue sea action plan and other economic development plans implemented across china and the bohai rim have also played a constructive role in the growth of the bohai rim s maritime economies and the promotion of harmonious and healthy maritime development 1 1 the bohai blue sea action plan was approved and implemented by the state council in 2001 and incorporated into the national environmental protection sections of the ninth five year plan and the tenth five year plan this phenomenon has also improved the coordination capacities of the cities in the bohai rim however the coordination capacity of these cities only ranges from 0 16 to 0 30 indicating that there is significant room for improvement in the coordination of economic development resource utilisation and environmental conservation across the bohai rim these cities also exhibit significant differences in coordination capacity when compared to one another for example the coordination capacities of tianjin and binzhou were 0 2375 and 0 1601 respectively a difference of 0 0774 in 2007 in 2016 the coordination capacities of tianjin and jinzhou were 0 3063 and 0 2267 respectively a difference of 0 0796 since the coordinating capacity of each city develops at a different rate their disparities in coordination capacity may widen over time in the future the development of coordination capacity should focus on the region as a whole in addition inter province cooperation should be enhanced so that better off provinces can assist the development of worse off ones thus achieving harmonious development across the entire bohai rim fig 1 4 1 2 spatial differentiation the average coordination capacity of each city in the bohai rim was visualised in arcgis 10 2 via natural breaks classification thus producing a map that characterises the spatial distribution of coordination capacity across the whole area fig 2 this figure highlights the bohai rim s spatial trends in terms of coordination capacity fig 2 shows that the distribution of coordination capacity between the cities of the bohai rim is widely dispersed but strongly concentrated in a few small zones which indicates a significant degree of spatial differentiation the coordination capacities of dalian tianjin yantai and qingdao were notably superior to those of other cities these cities are rich in marine resources and have highly developed maritime economies further their inputs in science and technology innovations industrial structure optimisation and ecological conservation are larger than those of other cities yingkou and panjin in liaoning qinhuangdao and tangshan in hebei and dongying weifang rizhao and weihai in shandong have moderate levels of coordination capacity these results imply that the coordination capacities of the bohai rim cities are not yet satisfactory although they are generally on the rise additionally since the marine resources maritime economic development and science technology ecology inputs of these cities are all at moderate levels there is significant room for further growth and development the coordination of their maritime economies and marine carrying capacities may improve significantly in future the coordination capacities of dandong jinzhou huludao cangzhou and binzhou are relatively low and their development is still inadequate in all aspects improvements and upgrades are urgently needed in these cities the cities with the highest coordination capacities dalian tianjin yantai and qingdao are located in the northern central and southern parts of the bohai rim together they form three extreme points characterised by significantly higher coordination capacities than their surrounding cities as a whole results indicate that a city s coordination capacity is positively correlated with its level of maritime economic development 4 2 the efficiency of coordinated development in the cities of the bohai rim fig 3 shows that the efficiency of coordinated development in each bohai rim city has changed significantly between 2007 and 2016 the average efficiency of coordinated development increased from 0 7487 in 2007 to 0 8089 in 2016 in 2007 eight cities had an optimal level of efficiency five cities had efficiencies between 0 5 and 0 9 moderate efficiency and four cities had efficiencies lower than 0 4 low efficiency in 2016 the number of cities with optimal efficiency levels was unchanged eight cities had moderate levels of efficiency and only one city had a low level of efficiency although the number of cities with an optimal level of efficiency did not change the cities that belong to this category have changed tianjin cangzhou panjin and yingkou remained in this category in 2007 and 2016 and tangshan dongying qingdao and weihai joined this category in 2016 the cities that dropped to a moderate level of efficiency in 2016 were huludao jinzhou rizhao and dandong and the cities that rose from a low to moderate level of efficiency were dalian and yantai as a whole the efficiency of coordinated development increased rapidly in the central and southern cities but slightly decreased in the northern cities which originally had a high level of efficiency northern central and southern cities have distinct development trends in coordination capacity the results reported in table 4 indicate that the average efficiency of coordinated development in the bohai rim generally increased over time despite a brief drop in 2010 the efficiency of the central cities steadily increased to their maximum in 2016 and exceeded the average efficiency of the bohai rim by 0 0979 in 2007 the efficiency of the northern cities exceeded the average efficiency of the bohai rim by 0 1448 whereas the efficiency of central and southern cities was lower than the average however the efficiency of the northern cities has fluctuated and somewhat decreased over time by contrast the southern cities have seen rapid growth in efficiency since 2013 and started to overtake the northern cities in 2016 as a whole the efficiency of coordinated development has increased across the bohai rim the rise in efficiency was the highest in the central cities followed by those in the south and finally the north this result implies that the connections and interactions amongst the cities of the bohai rim should be further strengthened so that the coordinated development of marine economies and marine carrying capacities can be improved across the area as a whole 5 discussion of the evolutionary trends in coordination capacity 5 1 spatial connections in coordination capacity 5 1 1 lines of maximum gravitational force between the cities the lines of maximum gravitational force between the bohai rim cities in terms of coordination capacity were calculated using a spatial gravity model based on the average coordination capacities of each city and the calculated strengths of their intercity connections fig 4 cities connected by a line of maximum gravitational force strongly affect each other in the development of coordination capacity the lines of maximum gravitational force between the cities of the bohai rim are generally stable and they appear to adhere to certain rules these lines can be divided into six parts 1 dandong yingkou and panjin 2 jinzhou and huludao 3 qinhuangdao tangshan tianjin and cangzhou 4 binzhou dongying and weifang 5 rizhao and qingdao 6 weihai yantai and dalian yingkou yantai dongying tianjin and tangshan have two connections and thus strongly affect the cities they are connected to as a whole the lines of maximum gravitational force between these cities form a gravitational circle that wraps around the bohai rim the lines with tianjin at their centre and the cross sea line that connects yantai dalian and weihai are essential for the bohai rim s overall connectivity on this basis we investigated the structure of the coordination capacity gravitational network between the cities of the bohai rim 5 1 2 coordination capacity gravitational network amongst the cities of the bohai rim fig 5 illustrates the state of the coordination capacity gravitational network amongst the bohai rim s cities in 2007 2010 2013 and 2016 arcgis software was used to classify the links into five grades according to their strength 0 01 0 01 0 03 0 03 0 06 0 06 0 09 and 0 09 fig 5 shows that the complexity of the gravitational network gradually increased over time which led to the formation of an interconnected development network encompassing multiple regions across the bohai rim the changes in the patterns of the gravitational network were also significant and the spatial connections amongst the northern central and southern cities have gradually strengthened over time to form a linked state of development in 2007 only a few weak spatial connections existed between the cities of the bohai rim which indicates that the development of each city was only weakly related to that of other cities between 2010 and 2013 a core region i e a region dense in intercity connections gradually took form around the dalian huludao and tianjin yantai dongying lines in 2016 the respective developments of dalian tianjin yantai and dongying became strongly linked to each other further a significant increase was observed in the number of core cities and the strength of intercity connections hence the bohai rim has gradually adopted an interconnected model of development that encompasses multiple regions this trend was generated by the development of the economy and transportation networks which increased the cities consolidation and economic radiation thus resulting in the spatial agglomeration of regional development the gradual regional joint development amongst cities not only has a great influence on regional economic development but also has a beneficial effect in improving regional ecological environment bearing capacity the sea area ecological bearing capacity is the basis of economic development the coordination of the marine economy and ecological environmental protection is related to the operation of the broader social economic system from the current local urban connections strength continues to increase the joint development of multiple areas will positively affect the whole region s ecological economy promoting the coordination of the overall marine economy and the ecological sea area load this result indicates that the evolution of the bohai rim s coordination capacity gravitational network is similar to that of the cities gravitational patterns 5 2 predicting trends in the development of coordination capacity the matlab 9 0 software suite was used to write a gm 1 1 model for predicting the degree of coordination of each bohai rim city the matlab program was verified and then executed in a matlab window the predictions were based on the data about the coordination capacity of the bohai rim s cities from table 3 the results for the predictions are depicted in fig 6 before making these predictions it was necessary to validate the data and the program was only executed after the modelling method s feasibility was verified the predictions indicate that the degree of coordination in the cities of the bohai rim will generally range within 0 2 0 45 from 2017 to 2026 as the considered time frame is a run in period that will see the continuation of previous rising trends in the bohai rim s coordination capacities this result also indicates that the measures that are currently being implemented to develop the bohai rim s maritime economies are beneficial for coordinated development however the improvements in coordination capacity vary across cities and the differences can be very large furthermore these disparities may grow larger over time for example jinzhou city is expected to exhibit the least improvement in coordination capacity amongst all the bohai rim s cities whereas the coordination capacities of dongying weihai and yingkou are predicted to improve tremendously the coordination of tianjin dalian yantai and qingdai are expected to increase steadily and remain at a high level therefore neglecting marine carrying capacity may lead to dangerous imbalances in the overall system a more constructive approach would be to focus on marine ecosystems and try to build a bridge to connect carrying capacity with socioeconomic developments to achieve steady progress that is truly beneficial for the bohai rim s maritime economies the degree of coordination across this region will need to stabilise at a high level and grow steadily over time 6 conclusion based on the modern needs of maritime economic development we have constructed systems of metrics to assess the coordination capacity and coordinated development efficiency of the bohai rim s cities which are excellent representatives of china s maritime economies these metric systems are based on the findings of other related studies and they account for the stability of marine terrestrial relationships and spatiotemporal weighting based on a spatial gravity model the gm 1 1 grey forecasting model was used to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the cities coordination capacities this unique study has employed novel research perspectives and methodologies to provide an accurate picture of the state of coordination amongst maritime economies and marine carrying capacities in the bohai rim s cities the findings of this study are of theoretical and practical significance especially for the formulation of measures to address regional disparities this study s results indicate that coordination capacities are generally rising across the bohai rim however the improvement in coordination capacity varies across cities and the differences can be quite large the spatial distribution of coordination capacity in the bohai rim is dispersed over a wide area but also concentrated in a few smaller areas the northern central and southern cities form three extreme points that have a strong effect on their surrounding cities although the efficiency of coordinated development in the bohai rim exhibited small fluctuations at certain points it has generally increased over time the increase in coordination capacity is greatest in the central cities followed by the southern cities and then the northern ones based on an analysis of the coordination capacity gravitational network formed by the lines of maximum gravitational force between the cities of the bohai rim this study found that these lines have formed a gravitational circle wrapping around the bohai rim and thus forming a multi region development network the spatial connections between the northern central and southern cities have gradually strengthened over time and this has caused their developmental states to become interconnected therefore the bohai rim is gradually becoming more integrated in terms of coordination capacities and the influence of time cost and distance factors is becoming more pronounced according to the state of development shown by the coordination capacity prediction curve the coordination capacities in all bohai rim cities will improve over time albeit with some disparities since the bohai rim is still in a run in period in terms of its development the development of maritime economies will inevitably involve resource exploitation and environmental pollution hence the key to high quality sustainable development lies in the balancing of costs and benefits for harmonising economic and environmental development to improve the coordination of maritime economies and marine carrying capacity in the bohai rim the development of new technology based industries needs to be promoted and efforts to construct an ecological civilisation should be strengthened holistic plans and measures should be implemented to ensure the rationality of resource development further the relationship between development and carrying capacity must be managed appropriately in this way harmonious development of maritime economies and marine carrying capacities can be gradually achieved credit author
