10810,in areas with low availability of irrigation water it is necessary to improve water use efficiency in crops especially if their profitability is low this is the case of barley in the castilla la mancha region spain where farmers are demanding methods to achieve adequate harvests with a supply of low amounts of irrigation water to this particular crop the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology was developed to maximize the yield of annual crops under water scarce conditions the objective of this study was to determine the effect of ordi for a limited amount of available irrigation water on yield water productivity and water footprint of a barley crop shakira cv under semiarid conditions to this end five irrigation treatments were performed over three years 2015 2017 on an experimental farm located in albacete province no deficit nd control and four with different volumes of available irrigation water corresponding to 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of barley net irrigation requirements 2500 m3 ha 1 for the weather conditions of the intermediate typical meteorological year as expected yield decreased with deficit and nd was the treatment that achieved the highest average yield 9049 kg ha 1 while the average yield decreased by 19 4 and 29 9 with regard to nd the highest average irrigation water productivity was for t80 and t70 average 3 63 kg m 3 as these treatments reduced the average amount of irrigation water by 39 1 and 46 7 respectively nevertheless in terms of water use sustainability the most interesting treatment was t80 which achieved the lowest average water footprint 531 m3 mg 1 while nd showed the highest 9 5 greater consequently ordi yielded barley harvests with more efficient water use under limited volumes of available irrigation water and unknown climatic conditions which were drier than typical in the three experimental years keywords mopeco model ordi water footprint semiarid optimization irrigation scheduling 1 introduction barley hordeum vulgare l is the eleventh most produced crop in the world and the fifth in cultivated area with 147 million tons and 47 million of ha respectively around 49 of the surface area dedicated to barley in the world is located in europe accounting for 61 of total production faostat 2017 in spain 2 6 million ha of this species is cropped producing around 9 2 million tons of grain castilla la mancha clm is the second largest producing region with 28 of the national total cultivating around 0 78 million ha of which 12 2 is irrigated mapa 2018 in semiarid areas like clm winter barley rainfed is usually sown at the end of october while spring barley irrigated is normally sown in january irrigation depths of around 250 mm year 1 may triple the yield of barley jcrmo 2017 mapa 2018 barley requires a low depth of irrigation water compared to that applied to other annual crops such as onion maize or alfalfa 580 650 and 750 mm year 1 respectively however given the increased cost of the energy used by the irrigation systems the reduction of water availability for agriculture and the low profitability of barley farmers have shown interest in using regulated deficit irrigation rdi techniques on this crop carrillo cobo et al 2014 thus improving irrigation water productivity and coping with droughts is a priority objective in this sector to improve yield and profitability rdi techniques may allow water productivity to be increased english 1990 this methodology is based on crops different sensitivities to water deficit in their developing stages thus the effect of water stress on barley yield is conditioned by both the intensity of the deficit and the stage in which it occurs broadly speaking water deficit during plant development and around anthesis causes decreases in yield due to a reduction in the potential number of kernels per unit of area abrha et al 2012 cossani et al 2009 fischer 1985 giunta et al 1993 savin and slafer 1991 in addition water deficit together with high temperatures during grain formation reduce the mean weight of kernels abrha et al 2012 acevedo et al 2002 carter and stoker 1985 oweis et al 2000 ugarte et al 2007 the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology maximizes the yield of annual crops when the objective is to reach a certain deficit for the whole growing period domínguez et al 2012b or when the amount of available irrigation water is lower than the requirements of the crop leite et al 2015a this methodology was developed for the mopeco model ortega et al 2004 which has been calibrated for the main extensive annual crops in clm and others in different areas of the world carvalho et al 2014 domínguez et al 2012a 2012c 2013 leite et al 2015b léllis et al 2017 lópez urrea et al 2019 martínez romero et al 2019 the population s increasing concern about the environment has triggered the development of indicators able to measure the impact of productive sectors on natural resources the water footprint wf hoekstra et al 2009 determines the amount of water required to produce a certain good or service and may be improved by methodologies able to increase water use efficiency in mediterranean farms the most relevant component is the blue water footprint since spring and summer annual crops require irrigation due to the lack of rainfall and its irregular allocation during the cropping period aldaya et al 2010 moreover in modern farms pressurized irrigation implies the consumption of energy that increases the co2 emissions to the atmosphere and negatively affect to their profitability carrillo cobo et al 2014 the aim of this study was to determine the effect of the ordi methodology for a limited amount of available irrigation water on the yield water productivity and water footprint of a barley crop under the semiarid climatic conditions in clm 2 material and methods 2 1 description of irrigated lands in castilla la mancha agriculture in clm occupies an area of 3 773 029 ha of which 557 851 ha are irrigated lands mapa 2018 mainly with sprinkler and drip irrigation systems the use of irrigation in the area is the result of low average annual precipitation around 400 mm year 1 and high reference evapotranspiration 1100 mm year 1 characterizing the area as semi arid domínguez and de juan 2008 approximately 70 of the irrigable area in clm is located close to groundwater sources given that most surface water resources are used in other bordering regions fig 1 the most common crops in these areas are grapes cereals garlic onion melon watermelon pepper and others such as sunflower potato and alfalfa 2 2 field experiments the field trials were conducted in 2015 2016 and 2017 at the integrated centre for vocational training in aguas nuevas longitude 1 53 58 w latitude 38 56 42 n at an altitude of 695 m above sea level fig 1 the experiment was conducted using shakira barley cultivar that was sown 210 kg ha 1 in the same date january 12th 13th and 13th respectively by a seeder trisem 194 by sola with a separation between arms of 13 cm and a width of work of 2 5 m according to the köppen classification the climate is bsk semiarid cold climate the average annual temperature is around 14 c 4 c in january and 24 c in july and the average accumulated rainfall is 375 mm year 1 recorded mainly in spring and autumn the average annual reference evapotranspiration is around 1300 mm year 1 penman monteith fao method varying between 30 and 220 mm month 1 in january and july respectively the soil is classified as calcixerrollic petrocalcic xerochrepts usda ncrs 2006 the average soil depth is 40 cm being classified as clay loam texture 35 sand 35 silt and 30 clay bouyoucos 1962 therefore since barley would be able to reach deeper areas in this case the entire soil profile was considered as effective root depth the soil is basic ph 1 2 5 h2o 8 7 and has a suitable content of organic matter 2 4 walkley and black 1934 and nitrogen 0 14 0 16 kjeldahl 1883 and a high content of active limestone 21 7 25 3 and potassium 131 145 ppm the bulk density water content at field capacity and wilting point are 1 41 mg m 3 0 313 cm3 cm 3 and 0 189 cm3 cm 3 respectively the experimental area 4730 m2 is composed of four 51 m x 18 m plots fig 2 each year 18 subplots of 2 5 m x 18 m sampling area of 2 5 m x 12 m and another two of 3 m x 18 m buffer without space between subplots were defined fig 3 five irrigation treatments were performed no deficit nd control and four with different volumes of available irrigation water corresponding to 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of barley net irrigation requirements in in the weather conditions of the intermediate typical meteorological year domínguez et al 2013 four randomly distributed repetitions of each treatment were established in each plot except for no deficit and t100 treatments for which the number of repetitions was three fig 3 these two treatments should be the same under the conditions of intermediate and humid years and only in dry years would they be different at the end of the cropping period when the amount of irrigation water of t100 is depleted the water was applied by a square frame drip irrigation system 0 5 0 5 m between pipes and emitters equipped with self compensating emitters providing 3 8 l h 1 of nominal flow a high accuracy 2 flowmeter per treatment was installed in order to control the amount of irrigation water applied in this experiment the net irrigation water was considered to be the total amount of water supplied by the irrigation system as the drift and evaporation losses may be considered negligible ortíz et al 2009 tarjuelo et al 2000 the amount of fertilization applied to each treatment was determined according to the expected yield simulated by mopeco for a typical year fertilizers were applied twice as basal before sowing day and top dressing crop development table 1 during the field trials daily irrigation scheduling was performed by using the simplified water balance methodology in the root zone allen et al 1998 pereira and allen 1999 which is that used by mopeco domínguez et al 2011 as explained in section 2 4 the climatic data were collected from the albacete weather station located at the experimental farm fig 2 which belongs to the national network of the agroclimatic information system for irrigation siar 2018 managed by magrama http eportal magrama gob es websiar inicio aspx in three of the four repetitions of t90 t80 and t70 and in two of the three repetitions of nd and t100 sensors for monitoring the soil moisture content during the experiments were installed fig 3 watermark tensiometer sensors at 20 and 40 cm depth and delta t pr2 volumetric sensors at 10 20 30 and 40 cm depth this experiment was also used for the measurement of different physiological and growth parameters during the cropping season each 15 days approximately in two subplots of each treatment such as progression of accumulated dry biomass 2 samples of 0 5 0 5 m were collected per treatment and introduced in an oven at 70 c up to constant weight evolution of root depth photosynthetically active leaf area index of 2 biomass samples per treatment were measured by using a li cor 3100c device li cor inc leaf temperature stomatic conductance and photosynthesis rate were measured on the last fully developed leaf with no deformities nor diseases in 4 plants per treatment 2 per subplot under clear sky conditions between 10 00 a m and 2 00 p m by using a ap4 leaf porometer delta t devices ltd cambridge uk and a li 6400xt li cor inc to determine the final grain yield and its quality size humidity and protein content a sample of 0 5 m2 in the central part of each subplot was collected on 28th 25th and 22nd of june for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively 2 3 determination of the typical meteorological years tmys a typical meteorological year tmy hall et al 1978 represents the conditions considered typical over a long period and was adapted by domínguez et al 2013 for forecasting irrigation schedules being used also by other authors martínez romero et al 2019 a tmy consists of 12 months selected from individual years and concatenated to form a complete year with daily values in this study the tmys dry intermediate and wet determined by leite et al 2015b were used which were calculated by using the 1951 2004 climatic series generated by los llanos weather station located 3 km from the experimental area table 2 2 4 optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi mopeco uses the equation proposed by stewart et al 1977 to estimate crop yield ya as a function of the actual versus maximum evapotranspiration ratio eta etm in the different growth stages the potential yield in the area ym and the crop yield response factor ky by growing stage in the case of barley vegetative period flowering yield formation and ripening doorenbos and kassam 1979 1 y a y m k 1 4 1 k y k 1 e t a k e t m k daily etm is calculated by multiplying daily crop coefficient kc by daily reference evapotranspiration eto values determined by the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 while daily eta under water stress conditions is calculated using the equation proposed by the same authors which requires a daily balance of water in the soil domínguez et al 2011 thus if the soil water content is higher than p defined as the fraction of total available water taw that a crop can extract without suffering water stress then the crop is not subjected to water stress conditions according to allen et al 1998 daily eta may be estimated as follows if t a w d r 1 p taw then e t a e t m 2 otherwise e t a t a w d r 1 p t a w e t m where p 1 a 1 b e c e t m where taw is the total available water soil water content at field capacity minus soil water content at wilting point mm dr is the root zone depletion at a given time mm a b and c for barley being 0 692 6 657 and 0 542 dimensionless respectively are et group coefficients doorenbos and kassam 1979 danuso et al 1995 the net irrigation requirements of a barley crop under the tmy intermediate conditions were estimated by using the mopeco model which was calibrated for this crop in the area by lópez urrea et al 2019 table 3 the resulting amount of water was considered as the reference and was assigned to the t100 treatment then three ordi strategies were performed to three different volumes of available irrigation water which correspond to 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 of net irrigation requirements t100 in addition one treatment under no deficit conditions nd was carried out the no deficit and the t100 treatments received the same irrigation schedule up to harvest or until the depletion of the amount of irrigation water available for the t100 treatment the irrigation schedules of the three ordi treatments followed the methodology established by leite et al 2015a fig 4 in order to maximize yield the methodology determines the deficit in terms of eta etm to be applied to the crop at each ky stage and estimates the amount of irrigation water required to reach that level of deficit by using the tmy climatic data and the mopeco simulation model 1 st optimization thus during the first ky stage the objective is to apply the irrigation schedule that reaches the eta etm objective determined by the methodology for that stage under real management conditions at the end of the first stage the eta etm reached by the crop estimated by mopeco should be similar to the target in the first stage there is enough irrigation water or higher if the climatic conditions and or the soil water availability do not allow that level of deficit to be generated however the amount of irrigation water applied to the crop will likely be different to that forecast by the model consequently after the first ky stage the methodology determines new eta etm targets for the following ky stages taking into account the actual remaining irrigation water 2nd optimization the same methodology is followed at the end of each ky stage during the optimizations a portion of irrigation water is saved for the last stage ky iv that determined in the 2nd optimization in order to avoid the total depletion of irrigation water during ky iii moreover the tmy used may be changed to the wet intermediate or dry series depending on the progression of the climatic conditions in order to better fit the optimizations to the characteristics of the actual year 2 5 irrigation water productivity for each irrigation strategy nd t100 t90 t80 and t70 the irrigation water productivity yield per unit of net irrigation water applied to the crop was analyzed as the main factor affecting the agricultural activity in the area 3 y w p y a t w g where ywp yield irrigation water productivity kg m 3 ya actual yield kg ha 1 twg gross irrigation water m3 ha 1 2 6 water footprint the water footprint of the process for cropping barley wfprocess was analyzed as the sum of the blue wfblue green wfgreen and grey wfgrey components the blue water footprint wfblue refers to consumption of blue water resources surface and groundwater along the supply chain of a product consumption refers to loss of water from the available ground surface water body in a catchment area which happens when water evaporates returns to another catchment area or the sea or is incorporated into a product in this case etablue is the irrigation water evapotranspirated by the crop according to the mopeco simulations ec 2 the green water footprint wfgreen refers to consumption of green water resources rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture thus by using the soil water balance of the mopeco model green water was differentiated from blue water to determine this parameter in which etagreen is the effective precipitation evapotranspirated by the crop the grey water footprint wfgrey is an indicator of the degree of freshwater pollution that can be associated with the process it is defined as the volume of fresh water that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on existing ambient water quality standards in agriculture it is calculated as the volume of water that is required to dilute pollutants to such an extent that the quality of the ambient water remains above agreed water quality standards franke et al 2013 hoekstra

differences p 0 01 among the observed results by using the duncan s test westfall and stanley 1993 moreover the standard deviation sd and the coefficient of variation cv were used to analyze the variability of the collected samples within the treatments for the relationship between observed and simulated results the root mean square error rmse and the normalized root mean square error nrmse were performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation schedules for the climatic conditions of the tmy intermediate table 2 and using the parameters in table 3 the simulated reference net irrigation requirements of barley t100 were 2500 m3 ha 1 this value was used to calculate the amount of irrigation water available for the ordi strategies table 4 for the three years under study the accumulated eto at the end of the growing cycle was higher than that corresponding to tmy intermediate fig 5 however the accumulated rainfall in 2015 and 2016 was lower than tmy intermediate while in 2017 rainfall was slightly higher 11 5 nevertheless accumulated precipitation between 72 and 74 julian days in 2017 was 72 mm which likely caused the percolation soil water sensors were not installed in that moment due to the crop being in a very initial stage of an important percentage of the rainfall that could not be used by the crop 32 mm in the nd treatment according to the simulations of mopeco consequently the climatology conditioned the eta etm objectives of each stage as well as the amount of irrigation water applied at each ky stage the three experimental years were adverse in terms of irrigation water requirements because initially the climatology was similar 2015 and 2016 or even better 2017 than the reference conditions tmy intermediate but the three seasons progressed to dry year conditions table 5 therefore the crop was under higher water deficit conditions than expected in all the treatments excepting nd involving a greater challenge for the ordi methodology the adverse progression of the climatic conditions caused eta etm objectives to be higher in the first optimization than subsequently excepting nd which was 1 in all the years and ky stages fig 6 consequently the irrigation requirements of barley nd were higher 14 2 33 4 and 47 2 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively than those for the intermediate year 2500 m3 ha 1 table 6 and t100 was unable to fulfill the irrigation requirements of the crop in the last stage 2015 or in the last two stages 2016 and 2017 fig 6 note the deficit appearing in the nd treatment in 2016 was caused by a pump fault during the ky iii stage which also affected t100 in the other treatments the deficit distribution was quite different from that expected at the beginning of the irrigation season because of the progression of the climatic conditions nd was the only treatment that reached the target eta etm rates proposed at the beginning of the season while t70 was the only one that reached a global eta etm rate higher than expected 0 70 in the three years in other words the higher the proposed deficit the lower was the effect of adverse climatic conditions on the final deficit suffered by the crop table 6 therefore t70 was the most efficient strategy using the water stored in the soil and the water provided by the rainfall according to the deficit distribution shown in fig 6 ordi attempted to avoid a deficit or generate a minimal one during flowering ky ii highest sensitivity to water deficit table 3 compensating for the greater use of water in this stage with a higher deficit in maturity ky iv and crop development ky i respectively nevertheless due to the season having initially been considered intermediate or wet table 5 ordi estimated a higher availability of rainfall water during the irrigation season decreasing the deficit objective in ky i consequently the amount of irrigation water used in this stage was higher than the optimal level for a dry year reducing the availability of irrigation water for subsequent more sensitive stages in any event the methodology was able to deal with the situation by recalculating the eta etm objectives per ky stage at each subsequent optimization fig 4 6 and reaching suitable yields and water productivities as described in the following sections table 6 in this sense the deficit distributions generated by the irrigation schedules proposed by ordi for the different treatments were in line with the recommendations published by other authors who have analyzed the effect of stress caused by water deficit on cereals abrha et al 2012 acevedo et al 2002 arisnabarreta and miralles 2008 giunta et al 1993 katerji et al 2009 oweis et al 2000 tavakoli 2014 as an example table 7 shows the progression of the main parameters considered by the ordi methodology for t80 in 2016 as expected the progression of the climatology conditioned the eta etm targets fig 6 which depended on the irrigation water availability at the beginning of each stage thus in the first stage ky i it was possible to reach the eta etm objective 1 by supplying 16 3 mm of unexpected irrigation water due to rainfall being lower than that forecast by tmy this changed the category of the tmy from intermediate to dry table 5 consequently in the 2nd optimization the lower availability of irrigation water and worse forecast climatic conditions caused a decrease in the eta etm objectives of ky ii and ky iii stages nevertheless during ky i rainfall was higher than expected reaching a higher eta etm ratio 0 87 than targeted 0 75 and saving 19 2 mm of irrigation water the same process was followed for the rest of stages up to the end of the season during ky iii the drier than expected climatic conditions made it necessary to provide the crop with a higher amount of irrigation water than predicted nevertheless it was not possible to reach the eta etm objective for that stage due to the available amount of irrigation water minus the volume reserved for the last stage having been exhausted leite et al 2015b included this restriction in the ordi methodology because they noticed that under certain climatic conditions such as those in 2016 it was possible to exhaust all or the majority of the available water before the beginning of the last stage in order to avoid great stress on the crop at the end of the growing period and as a way to reach a better distribution of deficit between the last two stages these authors proposed saving the amount of water determined by the optimizer for the last stage in the 2nd optimization despite conditions during the experiment being more adverse than expected at the beginning of the season accumulated etm 6 9 higher and total rainfall 18 6 lower the t80 treatment reached the eta etm objective in the first optimization thanks to the optimized distribution of deficit and irrigation water during the growing period and the initial content of soil water which was not considered by the methodology and increased the real availability of water for the crop 3 2 monitoring of the soil moisture progression in order to validate the simulations of soil moisture progression performed by mopeco the calculated values were compared with the readings of the soil water sensors located in the monitoring plots fig 3 for the comparison the average readings of the watermark tensiometer sensors and those of the delta t pr2 volumetric sensors were transformed to available water content as an example the progression of the simulated and observed soil moisture content for t80 in 2016 shows a suitable goodness of fit fig 7 in this figure it is possible to observe how the irrigation schedule maintained the crop under different levels of deficit aw line below 1 p line in order to reach the accumulated eta etm target striped line at the end of each ky stage similar results were obtained for the other treatments and years 3 3 effect of ordi on yield as expected yield decreased with deficit and nd was the treatment achieving the highest yield in all three years showing significant differences with the other strategies excepting t100 in 2015 due to this treatment suffering a very low deficit global eta etm 0 94 table 6 the climatic conditions in the three years did not affect the maximum yield obtained by the crop which was highly similar every season however the deficit treatments also showed very similar yields in all three years despite the irrigation requirements of nd in 2017 being 28 8 higher than in 2015 and 47 2 higher with regard to t100 in this sense t100 generated the highest difference between years 7 9 justified by the fact that it was the only non optimized deficit treatment in the case of the optimized treatments ordi maintained the global eta etm rate of the two most sensitive stages ky ii and iii at very similar levels achieving similar yields year by year table 6 across ordi treatments t90 and t80 showed no significant differences in terms of yield but t90 reached higher values in all three years with regards to nd the average yield in t80 decreased by 19 4 but saved 39 0 of irrigation water table 6 maximum yields obtained in this study are in line with those reported by domínguez et al 2017 in the same area for a scarlett cultivar for similar amounts of water supplied to a triumph cultivar jamieson et al 1995 and broner et al 1997 achieved slightly higher and lower yields respectively moreover several authors have reported the low sensitivity of barley to drought gonzález et al 2008 samarah et al 2009 thabet et al 2018 therefore this capability of barley combined with ordi may justify these results highlighting the suitability of applying this methodology to this crop in water scarce areas in order to save water that could be used for irrigating more profitable crops in order to validate the parameters used in the ordi methodology table 3 all the treatments were simulated with mopeco the differences between observed and simulated yields table 8 were lower than 10 in all the cases and years fulfilling the requirements established by domínguez et al 2012c to consider a model as suitably calibrated broadly speaking simulated yields were slightly lower than observed with average differences of up to 5 3 moreover the statistics used for analyzing the results root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse also showed a suitable goodness of fit 3 4 effect of ordi on water productivity the productivity of irrigation water in terms of yield ywp increased with deficit being maximum for t80 and t70 treatments with no significant differences between them table 6 the lowest ywp corresponded to nd in all the years showing significant differences with the other treatments during the drier years 2016 and 2017 and with regards to t70 and t80 in 2015 the ywp of t80 was 14 2 35 2 and 47 0 higher than nd in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively improved ywp in barley when applying rdi techniques has been reported by several authors cossani et al 2012 and singh and kumar 1981 reported improvements in ywp with regards to the nd treatment of 0 23 and 1 5 kg m 3 respectively these values are similar to the improvements in this study which ranged between 0 46 kg m 3 2015 and 1 16 kg m 3 2017 furthermore martínez romero et al 2017 reported higher ywp improvements between 1 38 and 2 69 kg m 3 in a research carried out under semiarid conditions in the treatment with the greatest deficit t70 the amount of irrigation water saved with regard to nd was 38 6 47 4 and 52 5 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively these values were higher than expected due to all three years being drier than the reference tmy intermediate table 5 fig 5 nevertheless the decrease in yield was just around 30 in all three years which justifies the improvement in ywp table 6 in addition the ywp of the optimized treatments t90 t80 and t70 were very similar across the years because yields were also similar and the amount of irrigation water used was kept constant in the case of nd both the climatic conditions and the amount of irrigation water supplied to the crop justify the variations in the ywp values obtained in this research finally ywp in t100 was highly conditioned by the fact that this treatment depleted the available volume of water before physiological maturity with the final yield being affected by the high stress occurring during the last ky stage maturity of the grain therefore ordi minimizes the decrease in yield under dry year conditions and stabilizes the ywp for a given volume of irrigation water 3 5 effect of ordi on the water footprint the lower the availability of irrigation water the greater is the value of the green water footprint wfgreen table 9 after each irrigation event high deficit treatments recharged a lower percentage of taw than nd or low deficit treatments thus in the case of abundant precipitation the percentage of rainwater retained in the root zone increased and reduced or avoided percolation which is an advantage of the ordi methodology the wfgreen is conditioned by the climatic conditions of the area mainly precipitation and by the water storage capacity of the soil the value of this indicator in the t70 treatments varied between 143 and 178 m3 mg 1 while in humid climate areas it may reach values of up to 1213 m3 mg 1 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 therefore the comparison of this indicator across areas with different climatology must be performed with caution as expected wfblue decreased with ywp being higher in the nd treatments and in the drier years table 9 in addition t70 and t80 treatments reduced this value by between 12 2015 and 30 2017 compared to nd regarding values obtained by other authors mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 determined an average worldwide value for this crop of 79 m3 mg 1 which is significantly lower than those in this study as in the case of wfgreen climatic conditions highly affect this indicator because in areas where rainfall supplies all or the major part of the water requirements of the crop this indicator should tend to zero wfblue is directly related to the carbon footprint in those cases where pressurized irrigation systems require conventional energy as in the majority of the irrigated lands in clm and other semiarid areas consequently reducing this indicator implies a lower impact of irrigation agriculture on global warming reducing the concentration of dissolved nitrogen in the percolated water is the main feature of wfgrey in the optimized treatments t70 t80 and t90 the indicator decreased with deficit table 9 thus ordi together with a suitable fertilization based on the expected yield lower for more deficit treatments allowed this value to be lowered broadly speaking t100 reached the highest values since the nitrogenous fertilization was the same as in the nd treatment potential yield but the final yield was lower the values for this treatment were similar to those established by mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 average 131 m3 mg 1 as in this case the amount of nitrogen fertilizer depends mainly on the crop not on the climatic conditions the estimated total water footprint of the process wfprocess ranged between 505 m3 mg 1 t80 2015 and 621 m3 mg 1 nd 2016 with t80 being the one that generated the lowest impact followed by t90 and t70 table 9 these values are lower than those estimated by mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 1423 m3 mg 1 due to the high weight of wfgreen in areas where precipitation is high in this sense the ordi methodology allows the impact of the water footprint in the environment to be reduced by increasing both the use of rainwater and ywp and by decreasing the pollution of groundwater resources this finding could represent a financial advantage in the future if the harvest price of barley were affected by the sustainability of agricultural practices 4 conclusions this study demonstrates it is possible to use ordi for limited volumes of irrigation water under real management conditions of a barley crop when the availability of water is lower than the crop requirements yields were conditioned by the amount of available irrigation water for each treatment and by the climatic conditions of each season as expected the nd treatment achieved the highest yields and t70 the lowest nevertheless the ordi methodology provided information for increased irrigation water productivity with t80 and t70 being the treatments that reached the highest ywp average 31 higher than nd consequently for a similar volume of irrigation water used on a farm where the limiting factor is water and not the cultivable area during the three irrigation seasons of this experiment it would have been possible to increase total production by 11 by using the t80 strategy instead of t100 this result would be possible by increasing the irrigated area of barley on the farm by 25 moreover ordi decreased the water footprint with t80 achieving the lowest value this treatment reduced the value of this indicator by up to 14 with regard to the nd in drier years methodologies like ordi combined with models such as mopeco may

10810,in areas with low availability of irrigation water it is necessary to improve water use efficiency in crops especially if their profitability is low this is the case of barley in the castilla la mancha region spain where farmers are demanding methods to achieve adequate harvests with a supply of low amounts of irrigation water to this particular crop the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology was developed to maximize the yield of annual crops under water scarce conditions the objective of this study was to determine the effect of ordi for a limited amount of available irrigation water on yield water productivity and water footprint of a barley crop shakira cv under semiarid conditions to this end five irrigation treatments were performed over three years 2015 2017 on an experimental farm located in albacete province no deficit nd control and four with different volumes of available irrigation water corresponding to 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of barley net irrigation requirements 2500 m3 ha 1 for the weather conditions of the intermediate typical meteorological year as expected yield decreased with deficit and nd was the treatment that achieved the highest average yield 9049 kg ha 1 while the average yield decreased by 19 4 and 29 9 with regard to nd the highest average irrigation water productivity was for t80 and t70 average 3 63 kg m 3 as these treatments reduced the average amount of irrigation water by 39 1 and 46 7 respectively nevertheless in terms of water use sustainability the most interesting treatment was t80 which achieved the lowest average water footprint 531 m3 mg 1 while nd showed the highest 9 5 greater consequently ordi yielded barley harvests with more efficient water use under limited volumes of available irrigation water and unknown climatic conditions which were drier than typical in the three experimental years keywords mopeco model ordi water footprint semiarid optimization irrigation scheduling 1 introduction barley hordeum vulgare l is the eleventh most produced crop in the world and the fifth in cultivated area with 147 million tons and 47 million of ha respectively around 49 of the surface area dedicated to barley in the world is located in europe accounting for 61 of total production faostat 2017 in spain 2 6 million ha of this species is cropped producing around 9 2 million tons of grain castilla la mancha clm is the second largest producing region with 28 of the national total cultivating around 0 78 million ha of which 12 2 is irrigated mapa 2018 in semiarid areas like clm winter barley rainfed is usually sown at the end of october while spring barley irrigated is normally sown in january irrigation depths of around 250 mm year 1 may triple the yield of barley jcrmo 2017 mapa 2018 barley requires a low depth of irrigation water compared to that applied to other annual crops such as onion maize or alfalfa 580 650 and 750 mm year 1 respectively however given the increased cost of the energy used by the irrigation systems the reduction of water availability for agriculture and the low profitability of barley farmers have shown interest in using regulated deficit irrigation rdi techniques on this crop carrillo cobo et al 2014 thus improving irrigation water productivity and coping with droughts is a priority objective in this sector to improve yield and profitability rdi techniques may allow water productivity to be increased english 1990 this methodology is based on crops different sensitivities to water deficit in their developing stages thus the effect of water stress on barley yield is conditioned by both the intensity of the deficit and the stage in which it occurs broadly speaking water deficit during plant development and around anthesis causes decreases in yield due to a reduction in the potential number of kernels per unit of area abrha et al 2012 cossani et al 2009 fischer 1985 giunta et al 1993 savin and slafer 1991 in addition water deficit together with high temperatures during grain formation reduce the mean weight of kernels abrha et al 2012 acevedo et al 2002 carter and stoker 1985 oweis et al 2000 ugarte et al 2007 the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology maximizes the yield of annual crops when the objective is to reach a certain deficit for the whole growing period domínguez et al 2012b or when the amount of available irrigation water is lower than the requirements of the crop leite et al 2015a this methodology was developed for the mopeco model ortega et al 2004 which has been calibrated for the main extensive annual crops in clm and others in different areas of the world carvalho et al 2014 domínguez et al 2012a 2012c 2013 leite et al 2015b léllis et al 2017 lópez urrea et al 2019 martínez romero et al 2019 the population s increasing concern about the environment has triggered the development of indicators able to measure the impact of productive sectors on natural resources the water footprint wf hoekstra et al 2009 determines the amount of water required to produce a certain good or service and may be improved by methodologies able to increase water use efficiency in mediterranean farms the most relevant component is the blue water footprint since spring and summer annual crops require irrigation due to the lack of rainfall and its irregular allocation during the cropping period aldaya et al 2010 moreover in modern farms pressurized irrigation implies the consumption of energy that increases the co2 emissions to the atmosphere and negatively affect to their profitability carrillo cobo et al 2014 the aim of this study was to determine the effect of the ordi methodology for a limited amount of available irrigation water on the yield water productivity and water footprint of a barley crop under the semiarid climatic conditions in clm 2 material and methods 2 1 description of irrigated lands in castilla la mancha agriculture in clm occupies an area of 3 773 029 ha of which 557 851 ha are irrigated lands mapa 2018 mainly with sprinkler and drip irrigation systems the use of irrigation in the area is the result of low average annual precipitation around 400 mm year 1 and high reference evapotranspiration 1100 mm year 1 characterizing the area as semi arid domínguez and de juan 2008 approximately 70 of the irrigable area in clm is located close to groundwater sources given that most surface water resources are used in other bordering regions fig 1 the most common crops in these areas are grapes cereals garlic onion melon watermelon pepper and others such as sunflower potato and alfalfa 2 2 field experiments the field trials were conducted in 2015 2016 and 2017 at the integrated centre for vocational training in aguas nuevas longitude 1 53 58 w latitude 38 56 42 n at an altitude of 695 m above sea level fig 1 the experiment was conducted using shakira barley cultivar that was sown 210 kg ha 1 in the same date january 12th 13th and 13th respectively by a seeder trisem 194 by sola with a separation between arms of 13 cm and a width of work of 2 5 m according to the köppen classification the climate is bsk semiarid cold climate the average annual temperature is around 14 c 4 c in january and 24 c in july and the average accumulated rainfall is 375 mm year 1 recorded mainly in spring and autumn the average annual reference evapotranspiration is around 1300 mm year 1 penman monteith fao method varying between 30 and 220 mm month 1 in january and july respectively the soil is classified as calcixerrollic petrocalcic xerochrepts usda ncrs 2006 the average soil depth is 40 cm being classified as clay loam texture 35 sand 35 silt and 30 clay bouyoucos 1962 therefore since barley would be able to reach deeper areas in this case the entire soil profile was considered as effective root depth the soil is basic ph 1 2 5 h2o 8 7 and has a suitable content of organic matter 2 4 walkley

and another two of 3 m x 18 m buffer without space between subplots were defined fig 3 five irrigation treatments were performed no deficit nd control and four with different volumes of available irrigation water corresponding to 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of barley net irrigation requirements in in the weather conditions of the intermediate typical meteorological year domínguez et al 2013 four randomly distributed repetitions of each treatment were established in each plot except for no deficit and t100 treatments for which the number of repetitions was three fig 3 these two treatments should be the same under the conditions of intermediate and humid years and only in dry years would they be different at the end of the cropping period when the amount of irrigation water of t100 is depleted the water was applied by a square frame drip irrigation system 0 5 0 5 m between pipes and emitters equipped with self compensating emitters providing 3 8 l h 1 of nominal flow a high accuracy 2 flowmeter per treatment was installed in order to control the amount of irrigation water applied in this experiment the net irrigation water was considered to be the total amount of water supplied by the irrigation system as the drift and evaporation losses may be considered negligible ortíz et al 2009 tarjuelo et al 2000 the amount of fertilization applied to each treatment was determined according to the expected yield simulated by mopeco for a typical year fertilizers were applied twice as basal before sowing day and top dressing crop development table 1 during the field trials daily irrigation scheduling was performed by using the simplified water balance methodology in the root zone allen et al 1998 pereira and allen 1999 which is that used by mopeco domínguez et al 2011 as explained in section 2 4 the climatic data were collected from the albacete weather station located at the experimental farm fig 2 which belongs to the national network of the agroclimatic information system for irrigation siar 2018 managed by magrama http eportal magrama gob es websiar inicio aspx in three of the four repetitions of t90 t80 and t70 and in two of the three repetitions of nd and t100 sensors for monitoring the soil moisture content during the experiments were installed fig 3 watermark tensiometer sensors at 20 and 40 cm depth and delta t pr2 volumetric sensors at 10 20 30 and 40 cm depth this experiment was also used for the measurement of different physiological and growth parameters during the cropping season each 15 days approximately in two subplots of each treatment such as progression of accumulated dry biomass 2 samples of 0 5 0 5 m were collected per treatment and introduced in an oven at 70 c up to constant weight evolution of root depth

1978 represents the conditions considered typical over a long period and was adapted by domínguez et al 2013 for forecasting irrigation schedules being used also by other authors martínez romero et al 2019 a tmy consists of 12 months selected from individual years and concatenated to form a complete year with daily values in this study the tmys dry intermediate and wet determined by leite et al 2015b were used which were calculated by using the 1951 2004 climatic series generated by los llanos weather station located 3 km from the experimental area table 2 2 4 optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi mopeco uses the equation proposed by stewart et al 1977 to estimate crop yield ya as a function of the actual versus maximum evapotranspiration ratio eta etm in the different growth stages the potential yield in the area ym and the crop yield response factor ky by growing stage in the case of barley vegetative period flowering yield formation and ripening doorenbos and kassam 1979 1 y a y m k 1 4 1 k y k 1 e t a k e t m k daily etm is calculated by multiplying daily crop coefficient kc by daily reference evapotranspiration eto values determined by the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 while daily eta under water stress conditions is calculated using the equation proposed by the same authors which requires a daily balance of water in the soil domínguez et al 2011 thus if the soil water content is higher than p defined as the fraction of total available water taw that a crop can extract without suffering water stress then the crop is not subjected to water stress conditions according to allen et al 1998 daily eta may be estimated as follows if t a w d r 1 p taw then e t a e t m 2 otherwise e t a t a w d r 1 p t a w e t m where p 1 a 1 b e c e t m where taw is the total available water soil water content at field capacity minus soil water content at wilting point mm dr is the root zone depletion at a given time mm a b and c for barley being 0 692 6 657 and 0 542 dimensionless respectively are et group coefficients doorenbos and kassam 1979 danuso et al 1995 the net irrigation requirements of a barley crop under the tmy intermediate conditions were estimated by using the mopeco model which was calibrated for this crop in the area by lópez urrea et al 2019 table 3 the resulting amount of water was considered as the reference and was assigned to the t100 treatment then three ordi strategies were performed to three different volumes of available irrigation water which correspond to 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 of net irrigation requirements t100 in addition one treatment under no deficit conditions nd was carried out the no deficit and the t100 treatments received the same irrigation schedule up to harvest or until the depletion of the amount of irrigation water available for the t100 treatment the irrigation schedules of the three ordi treatments followed the methodology established by leite et al 2015a fig 4 in order to maximize yield the methodology determines the deficit in terms of eta etm to be applied to the crop at each ky stage and estimates the amount of irrigation water required to reach that level of deficit by using the tmy climatic data and the mopeco simulation model 1 st optimization thus during the first ky stage the objective is to apply the irrigation schedule that reaches the eta etm objective determined by the methodology for that stage under real management conditions at the end of the first stage the eta etm reached by the crop estimated by mopeco should be similar to the target in the first stage there is enough irrigation water or higher if the climatic conditions and or the soil water availability do not allow that level of deficit to be generated however the amount of irrigation water applied to the crop will likely be different to that forecast by the model consequently after the first ky stage the methodology determines new eta etm targets for the following ky stages taking into account the actual remaining irrigation water 2nd optimization the same methodology is followed at the end of each ky stage during the optimizations a portion of irrigation water is saved for the last stage ky iv that determined in the 2nd optimization in order to avoid the total depletion of irrigation water during ky iii moreover the tmy used may be changed to the wet intermediate or dry series depending on the progression of the climatic conditions in order to better fit the optimizations to the characteristics of the actual year 2 5 irrigation water productivity for each irrigation strategy nd t100 t90 t80 and t70 the irrigation water productivity yield per unit of net irrigation water applied to the crop was analyzed as the main factor affecting the agricultural activity in the area 3 y w p y a t w g where ywp yield irrigation water productivity kg m 3 ya actual yield kg ha 1 twg gross irrigation water m3 ha 1 2 6 water footprint the water footprint of the process for cropping barley wfprocess was analyzed as the sum of the blue wfblue green wfgreen and grey wfgrey components the blue water footprint wfblue refers to consumption of blue water resources surface and groundwater along the supply chain of a product consumption refers to loss of water from the available ground surface water body in a catchment area which happens when water evaporates returns to another catchment area or the sea or is incorporated into a product in this case etablue is the irrigation water evapotranspirated by the crop according to the mopeco simulations ec 2 the green water footprint wfgreen refers to consumption of green water resources rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture thus by using the soil water balance of the mopeco model green water was differentiated from blue water to determine this parameter in which etagreen is the effective precipitation evapotranspirated by the crop the grey water footprint wfgrey is an indicator of the degree of freshwater pollution that can be associated with the process it is defined as the volume of fresh water that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on existing ambient water quality standards in agriculture it is calculated as the volume of water that is required to dilute pollutants to such an extent that the quality of the ambient water remains above agreed water quality standards franke et al 2013 hoekstra

differences p 0 01 among the observed results by using the duncan s test westfall and stanley 1993 moreover the standard deviation sd and the coefficient of variation cv were used to analyze the variability of the collected samples within the treatments for the relationship between observed and simulated results the root mean square error rmse and the normalized root mean square error nrmse were performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation schedules for the climatic conditions of the tmy intermediate table 2 and using the parameters in table 3 the simulated reference net irrigation requirements of barley t100 were 2500 m3 ha 1 this value was used to calculate the amount of irrigation water available for the ordi strategies table 4 for the three years under study the accumulated eto at the end of the growing cycle was higher than that corresponding to tmy intermediate fig 5 however the accumulated rainfall in 2015 and 2016 was lower than tmy intermediate while in 2017 rainfall was slightly higher 11 5 nevertheless accumulated precipitation between 72 and 74 julian days in 2017 was 72 mm which likely caused the percolation soil water sensors were not installed in that moment due to the crop being in a very initial stage of an important percentage of the rainfall that could not be used by the crop 32 mm in the nd treatment according to the simulations of mopeco consequently the climatology conditioned the eta etm objectives of each stage as well as the amount of irrigation water applied at each ky stage the three experimental years were adverse in terms of irrigation water requirements because initially the climatology was similar 2015 and 2016 or even better 2017 than the reference conditions tmy intermediate but the three seasons progressed to dry year conditions table 5 therefore the crop was under higher water deficit conditions than expected in all the treatments excepting nd involving a greater challenge for the ordi methodology the adverse progression of the climatic conditions caused eta etm objectives to be higher in the first optimization than subsequently excepting nd which was 1 in all the years and ky stages fig 6 consequently the irrigation requirements of barley nd were higher 14 2 33 4 and 47 2 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively than those for the intermediate year 2500 m3 ha 1 table 6 and t100 was unable to fulfill the irrigation requirements of the crop in the last stage 2015 or in the last two stages 2016 and 2017 fig 6 note the deficit appearing in the nd treatment in 2016 was caused by a pump fault during the ky iii stage which also affected t100 in the other treatments the deficit distribution was quite different from that expected at the beginning of the irrigation season because of the progression of the climatic conditions nd was the only treatment that reached the target eta etm rates proposed at the beginning of the season while t70 was the only one that reached a global eta etm rate higher than expected 0 70 in the three years in other words the higher the proposed deficit the lower was the effect of adverse climatic conditions on the final deficit suffered by the crop table 6 therefore t70 was the most efficient strategy using the water stored in the soil and the water provided by the rainfall according to the deficit distribution shown in fig 6 ordi attempted to avoid a deficit or generate a minimal one during flowering ky ii highest sensitivity to water deficit table 3 compensating for the greater use of water in this stage with a higher deficit in maturity ky iv and crop development ky i respectively nevertheless due to the season having initially been considered intermediate or wet table 5 ordi estimated a higher availability of rainfall water during the irrigation season decreasing the deficit objective in ky i consequently the amount of irrigation water used in this stage was higher than the optimal level for a dry year reducing the availability of irrigation water for subsequent more sensitive stages in any event the methodology was able to deal with the situation by recalculating the eta etm objectives per ky stage at each subsequent optimization fig 4 6 and reaching suitable yields and water productivities as described in the following sections table 6 in this sense the deficit distributions generated by the irrigation schedules proposed by ordi for the different treatments were in line with the recommendations published by other authors who have analyzed the effect of stress caused by water deficit on cereals abrha et al 2012 acevedo et al 2002 arisnabarreta and miralles 2008 giunta et al 1993 katerji et al 2009 oweis et al 2000 tavakoli 2014 as an example table 7 shows the progression of the main parameters considered by the ordi methodology for t80 in 2016 as expected the progression of the climatology conditioned the eta etm targets fig 6 which depended on the irrigation water availability at the beginning of each stage thus in the first stage ky i it was possible to reach the eta etm objective 1 by supplying 16 3 mm of unexpected irrigation water due to rainfall being lower than that forecast by tmy this changed the category of the tmy from intermediate to dry table 5 consequently in the 2nd optimization the lower availability of irrigation water and worse forecast climatic conditions caused a decrease in the eta etm objectives of ky ii and ky iii stages nevertheless during ky i rainfall was higher than expected reaching a higher eta etm ratio 0 87 than targeted 0 75 and saving 19 2 mm of irrigation water the same process was followed for the rest of stages up to the end of the season during ky iii the drier than expected climatic conditions made it necessary to provide the crop with a higher amount of irrigation water than predicted nevertheless it was not possible to reach the eta etm objective for that stage due to the available amount of irrigation water minus the volume reserved for the last stage having been exhausted leite et al 2015b included this restriction in the ordi methodology because they noticed that under certain climatic conditions such as those in 2016 it was possible to exhaust all or the majority of the available water before the beginning of the last stage in order to avoid great stress on the crop at the end of the growing period and as a way to reach a better distribution of deficit between the last two stages these authors proposed saving the amount of water determined by the optimizer for the last stage in the 2nd optimization despite conditions during the experiment being more adverse than expected at the beginning of the season accumulated etm 6 9 higher and total rainfall 18 6 lower the t80 treatment reached the eta etm objective in the first optimization thanks to the optimized distribution of deficit and irrigation water during the growing period and the initial content of soil water which was not considered by the methodology and increased the real availability of water for the crop 3 2 monitoring of the soil moisture progression in order to validate the simulations of soil moisture progression performed by mopeco the calculated values were compared with the readings of the soil water sensors located in the monitoring plots fig 3 for the comparison the average readings of the watermark tensiometer sensors and those of the delta t pr2 volumetric sensors were transformed to available water content as an example the progression of the simulated and observed soil moisture content for t80 in 2016 shows a suitable goodness of fit fig 7 in this figure it is possible to observe how the irrigation schedule maintained the crop under different levels of deficit aw line below 1 p line in order to reach the accumulated eta etm target striped line at the end of each ky stage similar results were obtained for the other treatments and years 3 3 effect of ordi on yield as expected yield decreased with deficit and nd was the treatment achieving the highest yield in all three years showing significant differences with the other strategies excepting t100 in 2015 due to this treatment suffering a very low deficit global eta etm 0 94 table 6 the climatic conditions in the three years did not affect the maximum yield obtained by the crop which was highly similar every season however the deficit treatments also showed very similar yields in all three years despite the irrigation requirements of nd in 2017 being 28 8 higher than in 2015 and 47 2 higher with regard to t100 in this sense t100 generated the highest difference between years 7 9 justified by the fact that it was the only non optimized deficit treatment in the case of the optimized treatments ordi maintained the global eta etm rate of the two most sensitive stages ky ii and iii at very similar levels achieving similar yields year by year table 6 across ordi treatments t90 and t80 showed no significant differences in terms of yield but t90 reached higher values in all three years with regards to nd the average yield in t80 decreased by 19 4 but saved 39 0 of irrigation water table 6 maximum yields obtained in this study are in line with those reported by domínguez et al 2017 in the same area for a scarlett cultivar for similar amounts of water supplied to a triumph cultivar jamieson et al 1995 and broner et al 1997 achieved slightly higher and lower yields respectively moreover several authors have reported the low sensitivity of barley to drought gonzález et al 2008 samarah et al 2009 thabet et al 2018 therefore this capability of barley combined with ordi may justify these results highlighting the suitability of applying this methodology to this crop in water scarce areas in order to save water that could be used for irrigating more profitable crops in order to validate the parameters used in the ordi methodology table 3 all the treatments were simulated with mopeco the differences between observed and simulated yields table 8 were lower than 10 in all the cases and years fulfilling the requirements established by domínguez et al 2012c to consider a model as suitably calibrated broadly speaking simulated yields were slightly lower than observed with average differences of up to 5 3 moreover the statistics used for analyzing the results root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse also showed a suitable goodness of fit 3 4 effect of ordi on water productivity the productivity of irrigation water in terms of yield ywp increased with deficit being maximum for t80 and t70 treatments with no significant differences between them table 6 the lowest ywp corresponded to nd in all the years showing significant differences with the other treatments during the drier years 2016 and 2017 and with regards to t70 and t80 in 2015 the ywp of t80 was 14 2 35 2 and 47 0 higher than nd in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively improved ywp in barley when applying rdi techniques has been reported by several authors cossani et al 2012 and singh and kumar 1981 reported improvements in ywp with regards to the nd treatment of 0 23 and 1 5 kg m 3 respectively these values are similar to the improvements in this study which ranged between 0 46 kg m 3 2015 and 1 16 kg m 3 2017 furthermore martínez romero et al 2017 reported higher ywp improvements between 1 38 and 2 69 kg m 3 in a research carried out under semiarid conditions in the treatment with the greatest deficit t70 the amount of irrigation water saved with regard to nd was 38 6 47 4 and 52 5 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively these values were higher than expected due to all three years being drier than the reference tmy intermediate table 5 fig 5 nevertheless the decrease in yield was just around 30 in all three years which justifies the improvement in ywp table 6 in addition the ywp of the optimized treatments t90 t80 and t70 were very similar across the years because yields were also similar and the amount of irrigation water used was kept constant in the case of nd both the climatic conditions and the amount of irrigation water supplied to the crop justify the variations in the ywp values obtained in this research finally ywp in t100 was highly conditioned by the fact that this treatment depleted the available volume of water before physiological maturity with the final yield being affected by the high stress occurring during the last ky stage maturity of the grain therefore ordi minimizes the decrease in yield under dry year conditions and stabilizes the ywp for a given volume of irrigation water 3 5 effect of ordi on the water footprint the lower the availability of irrigation water the greater is the value of the green water footprint wfgreen table 9 after each irrigation event high deficit treatments recharged a lower percentage of taw than nd or low deficit treatments thus in the case of abundant precipitation the percentage of rainwater retained in the root zone increased and reduced or avoided percolation which is an advantage of the ordi methodology the wfgreen is conditioned by the climatic conditions of the area mainly precipitation and by the water storage capacity of the soil the value of this indicator in the t70 treatments varied between 143 and 178 m3 mg 1 while in humid climate areas it may reach values of up to 1213 m3 mg 1 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 therefore the comparison of this indicator across areas with different climatology must be performed with caution as expected wfblue decreased with ywp being higher in the nd treatments and in the drier years table 9 in addition t70 and t80 treatments reduced this value by between 12 2015 and 30 2017 compared to nd regarding values obtained by other authors mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 determined an average worldwide value for this crop of 79 m3 mg 1 which is significantly lower than those in this study as in the case of wfgreen climatic conditions highly affect this indicator because in areas where rainfall supplies all or the major part of the water requirements of the crop this indicator should tend to zero wfblue is directly related to the carbon footprint in those cases where pressurized irrigation systems require conventional energy as in the majority of the irrigated lands in clm and other semiarid areas consequently reducing this indicator implies a lower impact of irrigation agriculture on global warming reducing the concentration of dissolved nitrogen in the percolated water is the main feature of wfgrey in the optimized treatments t70 t80 and t90 the indicator decreased with deficit table 9 thus ordi together with a suitable fertilization based on the expected yield lower for more deficit treatments allowed this value to be lowered broadly speaking t100 reached the highest values since the nitrogenous fertilization was the same as in the nd treatment potential yield but the final yield was lower the values for this treatment were similar to those established by mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 average 131 m3 mg 1 as in this case the amount of nitrogen fertilizer depends mainly on the crop not on the climatic conditions the estimated total water footprint of the process wfprocess ranged between 505 m3 mg 1 t80 2015 and 621 m3 mg 1 nd 2016 with t80 being the one that generated the lowest impact followed by t90 and t70 table 9 these values are lower than those estimated by mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 1423 m3 mg 1 due to the high weight of wfgreen in areas where precipitation is high in this sense the ordi methodology allows the impact of the water footprint in the environment to be reduced by increasing both the use of rainwater and ywp and by decreasing the pollution of groundwater resources this finding could represent a financial advantage in the future if the harvest price of barley were affected by the sustainability of agricultural practices 4 conclusions this study demonstrates it is possible to use ordi for limited volumes of irrigation water under real management conditions of a barley crop when the availability of water is lower than the crop requirements yields were conditioned by the amount of available irrigation water for each treatment and by the climatic conditions of each season as expected the nd treatment achieved the highest yields and t70 the lowest nevertheless the ordi methodology provided information for increased irrigation water productivity with t80 and t70 being the treatments that reached the highest ywp average 31 higher than nd consequently for a similar volume of irrigation water used on a farm where the limiting factor is water and not the cultivable area during the three irrigation seasons of this experiment it would have been possible to increase total production by 11 by using the t80 strategy instead of t100 this result would be possible by increasing the irrigated area of barley on the farm by 25 moreover ordi decreased the water footprint with t80 achieving the lowest value this treatment reduced the value of this indicator by up to 14 with regard to the nd in drier years methodologies like ordi combined with models such as mopeco may

10811,the effects of climate change have forced to search quickly new strategies to achieve sustainable agriculture in the context of a growing demand for food rootstocks have shown to have a key role in the resistance and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses in horticultural and fruit trees species being a way to incorporate these strengths to the cultivated varieties here we report the assessment of physiological parameters and growth responses of two commercial interspecific hybrid prunus rootstocks contrasting in their tolerance to water deficit rootpac 40 tolerant and rootpac 20 sensitive grafted with the almond cultivar non pareil or the japanese plum cultivar angeleno plants were subjected during 35 days to two irrigation treatments well watered and water deficit drought period followed by a recovery period of 44 days on each period biomass accumulation stomatal density water use efficiency at the whole plant level and root hydraulic conductivity were determined in both irrigation treatments also in the drought period the fraction of transpirable soil water when the relative transpiration drops and the expression of seven aquaporins belonging to plasma membrane intrinsic proteins subfamily was assessed in the drought period rootpac 20 had a decrease in the aquaporin gene expression in roots and also had an early decline in transpiration independent of the grafted scion also on this rootstock the biomass was more severely affected on the other hand rootpac 40 induced a late decline in transpiration and increased the water use efficiency keeping less affected the biomass accumulation contrasting with the above in the recovery period rootpac 20 improved the water use efficiency reaching higher biomass accumulation in the grafted plants also we observed some interesting interactions between rootstocks and scions rootpac 20 induced a higher stomatal density in both almond and plum scions and angeleno plum induced a bigger root hydraulic

increases water use efficiency wue because of a partial closing of the stomata which allows the maintenance of the co2 influx into the mesophyll but reducing transpiration chaves et al 2009 in plants and other organisms aquaporins are proteins that allow the transport of water and small molecules across the plasma membrane kaldenhoff and fischer 2006 maurel et al 2015 aquaporins are classified into five subfamilies where those known as plasma membrane intrinsic proteins pips have been widely studied for their role under water deficit chaumont et al 2005 maurel et al 2008 and might be involved in the control of plant transpiration under water deficit shekoofa and sinclair 2018 however there is still debate on the relation between aquaporin activity and the hydraulic conductance in plants and the effect that may have on the transpiration rate under water deficit conditions shekoofa and sinclair 2018 the technique of grafting has been known from the beginning of the first millennium bc mainly for propagating woody species difficult to root from cuttings such as apples pears and plums mudge et al 2009 only in the last two centuries the use of rootstocks has been rapidly increased to enhance productivity disease resistance adaptability to unfavorable soil conditions and to reduce productive costs of intensive high value agricultural species albacete et al 2015 although the key role played by both rootstock and scion is acknowledged their relative contribution on specific combinations of genotypes is not yet well understood tramontini et al 2013 it has been suggested that rootstocks can contribute to food security by increasing yield potential of elite varieties closing the yield gap under suboptimal growing conditions and increasing the efficiency of water and soil use among others albacete et al 2015 for this reason some researchers have highlighted the importance of the study of roots as the key factor to achieve a second green revolution in the agriculture gewin 2010 in the global context of climate change the selection of rootstocks as a mean for improving the water use efficiency has been proposed as an essential strategy to face this scenario berdeja et al 2015 in the last years the importance of rootstocks has been understood as a key component to face water deficit conditions rootstocks could strongly impact the gene expression in grapevine vitis vinifera l berries under water deficit berdeja et al 2015 it has been observed that the drought tolerant rootstock 4x of rangpur lime citrus limonia osbeck grafted with valencia delta sweet orange citrus sinensis l modiﬁed the gene expression patterns in rangpur lime citrus roots to regulate the adaptation to water defict allario et al 2013 the recent discovery of a small peptide synthesized in the root vascular tissues of arabidopsis thaliana l under drought conditions capable of moving from roots to the leaves and induced stomatal closure highlights the molecular root control on plant transpiration under drought condition takahashi et al 2018 the control of the threshold at which the plant transpiration drops in a drying soil determines the adaptive strategy used by a genotype more or less conservative and has been suggested as a key trait for predicting the success of a crop under water deficit condition belko et al 2012 vadez et al 2013 berger et al 2016 shekoofa and sinclair 2018 on this regard the control of the scion transpiration under wd has been observed to be determined by the rootstock in grapevines marguerit et al 2012 stone fruit crops prunus spp are the seventh largest group of fruit trees produced worldwide faostat 2017 and in the present study we propose the genus prunus as a model system for assessing the interaction between rootstock and scion on prunus species it is possible to graft different species of high economic importance with different degrees of drought tolerance like plum p salicina and p domestica peach p persica almond p dulcis cherry p avium and apricot p armeniaca directly or using an interstock taking into account the wide genetic diversity of interspecific rootstocks currently available additionally in general terms these prunus rootstocks are easy to propagate clonally and count with six full genomes availabile p persica verde et al 2017 p avium hirakawa et al 2017 p mume zhang et al 2012 p yedoensis baek et al 2018 p domestica zhebentyayeva et al 2019 and p dulcis sánchez pérez et al 2019 which is advantageous for comparative molecular studies species in the subgenus amygdalus especially almond tress are recognized as water deficit tolerant within genus prunus fußeder et al 1992 camposeo et al 2011 consequently the use of almond x peach hybrid rootstocks increases tolerance to water deficit in peach jiménez et al 2013 and almond trees ben yahmed et al 2016 in contrast species in the subgenus prunophora such as plums and p cerasifera have lower tolerance to water deficit duval 2015 in this study we aimed to determine the influence of rootstocks on physiological performance and growth parameters to water deficit on grafted plants for this purpose we have assessed the responses of almond and japanese plum grafted onto two contrasting rootstock genotypes under well watered and water deficit conditions in addition we evaluated such responses under a post stress long term recovery period 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions this study was conducted at the centro de estudios avanzados en fruticultura ceaf rengo chile 34 19 s 70 50

bailey prunus cerasifera ehrh r20 was used as a sensitive genotype jiménez et al 2013 table 1 both r20 and r40 rootstocks are considered as semi dwarfing rootstocks scalisi et al 2018 thereby four rootstock scion combinations were established r40 np r40 an r20 np and r20 an in spring plants ca 40 cm tall were transferred to 20 l containers filled with a mixture of 1 1 peat perlite supplemented with basacote plus 9 m at a 6 g l 1 as a controlled release fertilizer basf limburgerhof germany prior to transplant each container was saturated with tap water allowed to drain and covered with plastic bags to avoid evaporation during 24 h after that similar initial weight of each container was reached ca 11 kg and recorded this was established as a 100 of substrate water content swc and considered as field capacity plants were grown for 30 days in a shade house 50 sunlight and then were transferred to field condition full sunlight plants were acclimatized to this condition for two weeks prior to the start of the experiment containers were covered with plastic bags and irrigated using two drippers per plant with a flow rate of 2 l h 1 for 15 days after that 26 uniform and healthy plants with ca 60 cm tall of each rootstock scion combination were selected for all evaluations four plants were used to determine the initial biomass eight plants for final biomass and root hydraulic conductance at the end of the drought period eight plants for final biomass at the end of recovery period and physiological evaluations net photosynthesis stomatal conductance midday water potential and root hydraulic conductance along the drought and recovery periods and six plants were used for gene expression analysis in the drought period from december 28 2016 to february 1 2017 average day and night time temperature were 33 and 13 c and relative humidity ranged between 31 and 68 respectively during recovery period full irrigation in water deficit plants from february 2 2017 to march 18 2017 average day and night time temperature were 31 and 11 c and relative humidity ranged between 35 and 83 respectively 2 2 irrigation treatments plants were subjected to two irrigation treatments well watered ww and water deficit wd in a completely randomized experimental design plants under ww condition were irrigated three times per week adding as much water as to reach the corresponding 100 of the swc for each pot in wd condition on the other hand irrigation of plants was withheld for 33 days weighting each pot three times per week in order to determine the water consumption of every single plant then all the pots were filled with the volume of water necessary to reach the same water content of the plant with the lowest transpiration rate which in turn was not irrigated therefore after the irrigation all the wd pots contained the same soil water of the swc this irrigation schedule was maintained for 35 days the minimum water content in the pot 0 swc was determined at the end of the drought period using the average of 10 containers with the lowest substrate weight maximum water extraction on independent plants the swc supplementary fig 1 was calculated for each container as eq 1 1 swc sw amsw msw amsw where sw is the daily substrate weight amsw is the average minimum substrate weight of 10 containers with the lowest substrate weight and msw is the maximum substrate weight at field capacity after the drought period the recovery period was maintained for 44 days and all plants were allowed to reach the 100 of swc in each irrigation cycle the plant water uptake capacity under wd was calculated as the relationship between the relative transpiration rate rt and the fraction of transpirable substrate water ftsw for each container sinclair and ludlow 1986 rt corresponds to the daily amount of transpired water under wd divided by the average daily transpiration of the ww for each rootstock scion combination ftsw correspond to the fraction of water inside the container that plants can use to transpiration the rt of each plant was divided by the mean relative transpiration rate for that plant during the period when the soil was still well watered in order to normalize the initial values sinclair and ludlow 1986 according to bindi et al 2005 the initial point for stress ftswthreshold is around to a rt value of 0 9 then rt was adjusted to a logistic equation as in eq 2 2 rt 1 1 α exp β ftsw where α and β are constants to be determined for each plant related to the curvature of a logistic regression 2 3 stomatal density the stomatal density was determined at three different times on different leaves developed during each period before of the imposition of drought at the end of the drought and recovery periods four mature leaves were selected from each treatment and combination in order to assess the stomatal density stomatal imprint in attached leaves were made by applying a nail varnish on the abaxial surface of the leaves avoiding the midrib and the leaf margin after drying the nail varnish film was gently peeled off using transparent tape and was fixed on a clean labelled microscope slide kardel et al 2010 the stomatal imprints were analyzed with a light microscope olympus bx43 olympus hamburg germany for each imprint two images were taken in different zones stomatal density number of stomata per mm2 was made counting all the stomata of the image known area and extrapolating to 1 mm2 in total 8 images 4 leaves and 2 zones per leaf were analyzed to obtain an average stomatal density per plant in each experimental period drought and recovery 2 4 root hydraulic conductivity the root hydraulic conductivity lp was determined by a high pressure flow meter hpfm dynamax houston tx usa according to tyree et al 1995 the night before measurements wd plants were fully irrigated in order to recover the water columns reducing artifacts due to cavitation alsina et al 2011 the lp measurements were made in the whole root system below the rootstock scion junction at the end of the periods of drought and recovery twice per plant subsequently this value was normalized by the dry weight of the complete root system vandeleur et al 2014 2 5 stomatal conductance net photosynthesis and stem water potential stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthesis pn were measured after 1 8 15 22 29 and 35 days of water deficit and after 1 7 and 13 days of recovery these measurements were conducted on mature fully expanded leaves using a portable photosynthesis equipment model ciras 2 ppsystem hitchin uk equipped with a 2 5 cm2 led lighting cuvette model ciras plc ppsystem the temperature within the cuvette was maintained at 25 c with a radiation level of 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 400 μmol co2 mol 1 air and relative humidity of both gs and pn measurements were performed between 9 30 and 11 00 am on the day before irrigation midday stem water potential ψstem was measured on a mature leaf fifth leaf expanded from the apex in the same days that gs and pn measurements the leaves were covered with plastic bags coated with aluminum foil to stop transpiration and allow it to balance with the stem potential at least 2 h before measuring the measurement was made at solar noon between 13 00 and 15 00 pm with a schölander pressure chamber schölander et al 1965 2 6 whole plant water use efficiency and growth at the beginning and at the end of the periods of drought and recovery plants were harvested and split into leaves stem and roots the dry weight of each plant part was determined after placing the samples in an oven at 70 c until reaching a constant weight growth for each plant part was calculated by means of the difference between the final biomass of leaves stems and roots of each plant and the average initial biomass of each scion rootstock combination in the case of the drought period this difference was between the biomass at the end of the drought period and the average initial biomass and in the recovery period the difference was between the final biomass with the average biomass at the end of the drought period per treatment and plant part the leaf area stomatal density and stomata length of different commercial prunus leaves were analyzed prior to the experiment in order to select the two more contrasting scions supplementary table 1 leaf area and stomata length were obtained by scanned leaves and processing stomatal imprints respectively using the imagej software version 1 51j8 nih with a reference area o neal et al 2002 whole plant water use efficiency wuewp was calculated as the difference between the total biomass at the end of drought and recovery periods minus the average biomass at the beginning of drought and recovery periods respectively both divided by water consumption of the respective period as in eq 3 3 wuewp final dry biomass initial dry biomass total water consumption 2 7 transcriptional analysis at the end of the drought period plants of all the rootstock scion combination and irrigation treatments were selected for gene expression three root samples were collected from three different plants in order to assess the expression level of genes encoding for seven pips pip1 1 pip1 2 pip1 3 pip2 1 pip2 2 pip2 3 and pip2 4 total rna was extracted following the ctab methodology described by chang et al 1993 dnase i ambion austin usa was used to remove genomic dna contamination rna quality was tested using electrophoresis in agarose gel stained with redgel total rna concentration was determined by spectrophotometry infiniter m200 pro nanoquant tecan group ltd switzerland then cdna was synthesized from 2 μg rna using the maxima first strand cdna synthesis kit thermo scientific usa the obtained cdna was diluted in a 1 4 relation and using 2 μl of the solution qrt pcr reactions were run using specific primers designed with the primer premier 5 0 software premier biosoft international palo alto usa supplementary table 2 and synthesized by idt integrated dna technologies inc fermelo biotec all reactions were run in an mx3000 p qpcr system agilent technologies usa using maxima sybr green rox qpcr master mix thermo scientific usa as the fluorescent detector two technical replicates were run for each biological sample the specificity of the amplified products was confirmed by the registration of a single peak in the melting curves and the visualization of a single band in the agarose gels data was normalized using rpii rna polymerase subunit 2 genbank accession prupe 8g132000 1 tong et al 2009 well watered plants from each rootstock scion combination were used as calibration samples and the normalized values were used for the determination of the relative quantification pfaffl 2001 2 8 experimental design and statistical analysis differences in ftswthreshold stomatal density lp biomass wuewp and gene relative expression were tested using irrigation rootstock scion and their interactions as fixed factors stomatal conductance net photosynthesis and midday stem water potential were tested using repeated measure anova where leaves measured over time are the repeated measures heteroscedastic variance models were used when necessary followed by lsd mean separation when appropriate all the statistical analyses were made using infostat version 2016e universidad de córdoba córdoba argentina statistical software di rienzo et al 2011 3 results 3 1 water consumption and stomatal density two different rt vs ftsw relationship patterns were observed fig 1 the first with a late reduction of rt occurring when the ftsw reached values of 0 35 and 0 32 in r40 np and r40 an respectively fig 1a and b the second experiencing an earlier rt reduction when the ftsw values reached down to 0 44 and 0 47 in r20 np and r20 an respectively fig 1c and d the wd affected the internal plant water status in the different rootstock scion combinations being evidenced by time course ψstem measurements from 15 at 35 days of drought plants under wd condition had a lower ψstem value than the ww counterpart and these values were decreasing along this period in wd plants supplementary table 5 under ww condition the combinations using r20 rootstock reached higher values of gs and pn during the most part of the whole experiment in comparison to r40 grafted plants supplementary table 3 and 4 under wd condition the gs was similar between plants using the same scion supplementary table 3 however pn was higher in r40 an respect to r20 an supplementary table 4 the stomatal density on the other hand was always higher in plums as compared to almonds regardless of the rootstock fig 2 at the beginning of the experiment and before the drought period an and np grafted on r20 rootstock evidenced a higher stomatal density than those grafted onto r40 fig 2a after 35 days of drought a higher stomatal density was observed in an when grafted on r20 in comparison to r40 an fig 2b with no differences in np regardless the rootstock used after 44 days of post drought recovery np and an resulted with higher stomatal densities compared to those plants with continuous irrigation fig 2c also at the end of the recovery period a higher stomatal density was observed in r20 than r40 grafted with np and an fig 2d 3 2 root hydraulic conductivity and pip aquaporin genes expression after 35 days of drought a significant difference in lp was observed between the r40 and r20 rootstocks with a lower value for the former compared to the latter but with no differences in ww conditions between both rootstocks fig 3 a also compared to their respective ww counterpart only r40 reduced lp under wd in relation with the the interaction within the scion rootstock combination it is clear in the fig 3b that the scion affects the rootstock lp in particular both r40 and r20 grafted with an resulted in a significantly higher lp compared to those with np on the other hand at the end of the recovery period the values of lp were equal in all the irrigation and grafting treatments involving r40 fig 3c however the r20 np plants reached significantly lower lp values compared to both ww r20 np and ww r20 an plants fig 3c regarding the seven aquaporin genes assessed in the present study in general the r40 rootstock did not change their transcript abundance as a response to wd except for the pip 2 3 and pip 2 4 increasing the former and decreasing the later for the r40 np combination and also the pip 2 2 and pip 2 3 both increasing in the r40 an combination fig 4 a and b in contrast a general repression of pip genes in wd r20 rootstocks were observed except for pip 2 1 pip 2 2 and pip 2 3 with similar transcript abundance in wd compared to ww condition in the r20 np combination and the pip 2 3 which increased under water deficit in the r20 an combination fig 4c and d in fact it is noteworthy that nearly all the pip genes assessed in the present study were repressed under wd conditions in the r20 an combination with the exception of pip 2 3 which increased its mrna levels under water deficit in all rootstock scion combination 3 3 biomass accumulation and water use efficiency during the 35 days of drought the dry matter accumulation in leaves was significantly lower in all the rootstock scion combinations under wd compared to their ww counterparts except for the r40 an combination with no significant differences between the irrigation regimes fig 5 a at the end of the recovery period a greater leaf biomass accumulation was evidenced in an scion regardless of the rootstocks fig 5b in contrast after the recovery period the r40 np combination did not accumulate leaf biomass fig 5b as for the stems after the drought period plants grafted on the r40 rootstock maintained the biomass accumulation similarly in wd and ww conditions fig 5c in the r20 rootstock on the other hand the stem biomass accumulation was significantly lower in both the np and an under wd condition compared to ww fig 5c after the 44 days of post drought recovery the stem biomass accumulation in the r40 np combination were similar in the wd and ww treatments opposite to all the remaining treatments in which the stem biomass was significantly lower in plants previously exposed to wd than those well irrigated fig 5d the lowest stem biomass accumulation as compared to their well irrigated counterpart was observed in the wd r20 np plants fig 5d regarding the root biomass accumulation during drought higher values were observed in the r40 plants in the wd condition compared to their r20 counterparts fig 5e also and during this time the r20 np plants had the lowest root biomass accumulation fig 5f in general after the recovery period the plants that were under wd condition accumulated a lower root biomass compared to the ww plants fig 5g and in particular the r40 np plants accumulated a lower root biomass compared to the remaining combinations fig 5h as for the wuewp at the end of the drought period the plants grafted on the r40 rootstock increased their water use efficiency at the whole plant level up to significantly higher values compared to the ww condition contrary to that observed in plants grafted on r20 with similar wuewp values between the irrigation treatments fig 6 a also at the end of the drought period the r20 np combination resulted in the lowest wuewp values fig 6b when comparing the wuewp values for all the rootstock scion combinations as shown in fig 6c all the combinations previously exposed to drought reached lower values compared to the ww condition except for the r20 an combination which evidenced no significant differences between irrigation regimes 4 discussion studies regarding the root system have been rising in recent years due to their fundamental role in water deficit scenarios webster 1995 isaakidis et al 2004 also the use of drought tolerant rootstocks has been proposed as a convenient way to provide tolerance to the cultivated fruit trees varieties isaakidis et al 2004 marguerit et al 2012 cantero navarro et al 2016 several studies relate drought tolerance with the vigor induced by rootstocks in this sense vigorous plants are usually more tolerant due to a bigger root system atkinson et al 1998 serra et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 but at the same time with a higher consumption of water per plant atkinson et al 2000 however this trend has shown exceptions since some dwarfing rootstock have been reported as more wd tolerant di vaio et al 2012 tworkoski et al 2016 regarding to r40 and r20 rootstocks it has been observed in almond that r40 induced a higher vigor in in comparison to r20 rootstock ben yahmed et al 2016 in our experiment the ranking from the more to less vigorous combination under ww conditions in the drought period was r20 an average total dw 529 g r40 np average total dw 500 g r20 np average total dw 274 g and r40 an average total dw 250 g according to these results an influence of the rootstocks in the production of biomass in the different combinations is not evident thus such production under well watered conditions seems to be defined by the compatibility of the rootstock and graft since those combinations that involve more closely related taxonomically species accumulated more biomass however when the water deficit was imposed the influence of the rootstocks becomes clearly decisive in terms of biomass production in this regard the combinations involving the r40 rootstock an almond peach hybrid showed a lower decrease in their biomass fig 5 it is interesting to note that r40 and r20 rootstocks are considered as semi dwarfing prunus rootstocks therefore the differences of the biomass production reported should be explained by other traits distinct to plant vigor tolerance however is not necessarily related to a more conservative use of water for instance the grapevine tolerant rootstock m4 v vinifera v berlandieri v berlandieri cv resseguier had a higher transpiration rate under severe wd condition compared to the sensitive 101 14 v riparia v rupestris rootstock corso et al 2015 similarly the r40 grafted plants which proved to be more tolerant than r20 fig 5 and 6 are also those with higher transpiration rates at a low ftsw values as observed by the late rt reduction under wd fig 1 the ftswthreshold that is the ftsw value resulting in a rt value of 0 9 as proposed by bindi et al 2005 is clearly dependent of the rootstock but not of the grafted scion fig 1 despite the great morphological differences existing between almond and plums supplemental table 1 r40 rootstock had a lower ftswthreshold maintaining a higher rt at low swc in comparison to r20 fig 1 noteworthy in grapevine rootstocks the qtls suggested as having control on the scion transpiration were colocalized among others with aquaporin genes marguerit et al 2012 in these regard we observed a higher ftswthreshold for the rt drop in r20 grafted plants fig 1 and at the same time a reduction on the expression of several pip genes in roots under wd fig 4c and d but further studies are needed in order to prove a functional relationship between both traits the overexpression of pip genes seems to be involved in increments of root hydraulic conductance gambetta et al 2012 leading to the regulation of water flow at a whole plant level grondin et al 2016 and could be involved in the control of plant s transpiration under wd condition shekoofa and sinclair 2018 in the present study however no clear relationship between pip transcript abundance and lp was observed several pip genes were down regulated in r20 roots under wd condition fig 4c and d but no differences in lp between ww and wd conditions in the drought period were observed fig 3a in contrast to r20 genotype r40 roots showed few differences on pip genes expression between ww and wd conditions fig 4a and b but reduced lp values under wd were evident fig 3a the research on plant aquaporins has yielded contrasting results in terms of tolerance to water deficit pou et al 2013 xu et al 2014 brunner et al 2015 li et al 2015 reddy et al 2017 in this sense studies focused on their activity functional regulation and localization will be helpful to a better understanding of the relationship between pip aquaporins and lp in prunus species alsina et al 2011 reported that the tolerant grapevine rootstock 1103p vitis berlandieri x v rupestris has a higher root hydraulic conductance compared to sensitive genotypes under wd in field conditions by mean of the generation of deep roots that explore more soil layers to find water as for potted peach p persica olive olea europea l citrumelo poncirus trifoliata raf citrus paradisi macf and pistachio pistachia integerrima l rieger 1995 plants of these species have been observed to have a reduced lp when grown under wd the fact that r40 rootstocks reduce their lp under wd conditions fig 3a might be related to the volume of the container where the roots were confined in contrast to field conditions however no relationship has been observed between root hydraulic conductivity and wd tolerance in prunus genotypes with different levels of drought adaptation in pots assays rieger and duemmel 1992 it is possible that the container might modify the relationship between lp and drought tolerance but further studies are needed in order to clarify the extent of such effect tolerant wd cowpea vigna unguiculate l genotypes have been reported to have a rather late decline in plant transpiration and higher wue under wd conditions in comparison to sensitive genotypes belko et al 2012 similarly the low ftswthreshold induced by the r40 rootstock in the grafted an and np fig 1a and b is associated with an increase in the wuewp in wd plants fig 6a consequently during the drought period wd an plants grafted on r40 reached a leaf biomass equal to ww plants fig 5a an equal stem biomass in np and an scions fig 5c and an equal root biomass between ww and wd plants fig 5g in contrast the higher ftswthreshold induced by r20 rootstock fig 1 c and d but with similar wuewp between ww and wd plants fig 6a together with a lower wuewp on the r20 np plants fig 6b in the drought period implied a reduction in biomass accumulation additionally leaf and stem biomass in the np and an scions were reduced fig 5a and c respectively and also a low root biomass with np scion was observed using r20 rootstock fig 5g it has been suggested that a higher ftswthreshold for transpiration decline would have a negative consequence under water deficit conditions because of the negative effect on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis vadez et al 2013 this fact might explain the lower biomass accumulation in r20 grafted plants under wd the genetic background of r40 is composed by species from the amygdalus subgenus which have been described as drought tolerant species fußeder et al 1992 camposeo et al 2011 wild prunus species from arid regions like prunus ferganensis kost riab under water deficit conditions are characterized by a rapid use of all the available water in soil with a high efficiency in order to maintain their biomass rieger et al 2003 on the other hand one of the parents of r20 is composed by a specie of the prunophora subgenus p cerasifera which might reduce the tolerance to water deficit duval 2015 it is noteworthy that similar responses were observed in ungrafted r40 and r20 plants under wd condition in terms of ftswthreshold biomass accumulation wuewp and root pip aquaporin genes expression article under revision suggesting that rootstocks responses to wd might be a valuable prognostic for the performance of a grafted tree it is interesting to note that even though r40 grafted plants were more tolerant to wd they do not perform as good as r20 grafted plants after a post stress recovery period indeed r40 grafted plants previously water stressed maintained a significantly lower wuewp compared to ww plants fig 6c r20 np also reduced the wuewp but not as much as the r40 np plants fig 6c consequently the leaf biomass accumulation at the end of the recovery period was larger on r20 np and r20 an in comparison to r40 np and r40 an plants respectively fig 5b the stem biomass accumulation on the other hand was also larger on r20 an in comparison to r40 an in both ww and wd conditions fig 5d r20 np under ww condition had more stem biomass that r40 np under ww and wd but r20 np with a previous wd condition did not increased the stem accumulation in the recovery period fig 5d finally root biomass accumulation was reduced on r40 np plants in ww and wd condition fig 5h these contrasting effects induced by the rootstocks between drought and recovery periods highlights the importance of studying the recovery period in the long term a close interaction between shoot and roots lp have been observed in grapevine soybean glycine max l and maize zea mays l vandeleur et al 2009 from our results during the drought period an scion induced a high lp value on roots of both rootstocks in comparison to np scion fig 3b a possible explanation might be that plums might induce greater internal tension in the transpiratory stream given by a bigger transpiratory surface as a result of their high stomatal density as compared to almond leaves fig 2 in fact it has been reported before that lp in roots is likely to be increased under a high hydrostatic gradient steudle 2000 on the other hand r20 rootstock induced a greater stomatal density on an and np scions in comparison to r40 rootstock fig 2 besides both scions resulted in frequent higher stomatal conductance and photosynthetic co2 assimilation under ww condition when grafted onto r20 rootstock supplementary table 3 and 4 at the end of the experiment r20 grafted plants under ww condition were the more vigorous plants in comparison to r40 grafted plants these differences might be the consequence of a higher stomatal density induced by r20 rootstock implying an increase of the gas exchange surface increasing net photosynthesis in poplar populus trichocarpa torrey and gray p deltoides bartram stomatal density of new leaves were positively correlated with stomatal conductance of old leaves turpin et al 2005 in our study a higher stomatal density was observed on leaves developed on the recovery period in plants that had a previous wd condition fig 2c however in the case of our study mature leaves on wd plants had a lower stomatal conductance supplementary table 3 camposeo et al 2011 reported in almond that spring leaves had a higher stomatal density in comparison to leaves developed in summer additionally in prunus serotina ehrh a reduction in stomatal density was observed in response to drier environments abrams 1994 in both cases this reduction in stomatal density is a consequence of environmental water stress our results show that after a water deficit period new leaves developed on well watered conditions at the end of summer increase the stomatal density probably by the new optimum water status condition 5 conclusions the use of rootstocks as a mean for increasing the tolerance of species of agricultural importance to constraining environments is becoming a general trend worldwide especially in fruit tree orchards as for water deficit some genotypes have proven to be potentially useful because of their tolerance to drought and therefore their potential for conferring tolerance to grafted species indeed from our results plants grafted onto the r40 rootstock resulted in better physiological performance including a late reduction on rt an increase on wuewp and with lesser detrimental effects on the biomass as compared to those grafted on r20 however such response is not necessarily conserved after a recovery period when irrigation is resumed in this case plants grafted on the r20 resulted in a higher wuewp and growth this is relevant since in the productive context of commercial orchards in arid and semiarid zones plants are not necessarily at the risk of terminal water scarcity but to transient water shortages where the capacity of plants to recover is of great importance up to now it is clear that rootstocks affects morpho physiological traits on the grafted scions for instance the r20 rootstock induced a greater stomatal density in both np and an scion also r40 induced a low ftswthreshold together with an increased wuewp in wd condition both advantageous traits under controlled irrigation systems such as that practiced in fruit production in central chile interestingly our results suggest that there is a scion effect over the rootstocks also angeleno plum for instance induced a greater lp in comparison to non pareil almond in drought periods regardless of the rootstock used recently the principles underlying water movement and hydraulic responses under stress has become clearer the importance of the responses at the molecular level however is still under debate aquaporins have been argued to play a critical role at the whole plant level by allowing water re allocation and to sustain transpiration under stress vitali et al 2016 we have assessed the responses of seven pip genes on the root system of the r20 and r40 rootstock in combination with grafted an and np some trends are clear for instance such as the general reduction of the transcript abundance of pip s under stress when grafted onto r20 however the linkage of the comparative responses in r20 and r40 to the physiological changes found in terms of ftswthreshold wuewp biomass etc is rather elusive and further studies are needed in order to better understand the relevance of the function of aquaporins at the whole plant level finally we demonstrate that stone fruits fit well with a novel model to study the interaction between rootstocks and scions focused on physiological and molecular parameters to conduct research on drought tolerance future researches considering the use of interstocks needed to combine rootstocks and scions of prunus species usually incompatible will wide this type of studies to other stone fruits species such as sweet cherry apricot or peach which would help to improve our understanding about the adaption of grafted stone fruit trees to water deficit likely unraveling further interactions between rootstocks and scions 6 funding this work was supported by grant from project fondecyt nº 1150853 conicyt

10811,the effects of climate change have forced to search quickly new strategies to achieve sustainable agriculture in the context of a growing demand for food rootstocks have shown to have a key role in the resistance and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses in horticultural and fruit trees species being a way to incorporate these strengths to the cultivated varieties here we report the assessment of physiological parameters and growth responses of two commercial interspecific hybrid prunus rootstocks contrasting in their tolerance to water deficit rootpac 40 tolerant and rootpac 20 sensitive grafted with the almond cultivar non pareil or the japanese plum cultivar angeleno plants were subjected during 35 days to two irrigation treatments well watered and water deficit drought period followed by a recovery period of 44 days on each period biomass accumulation stomatal density water use efficiency at the whole plant level and root hydraulic conductivity were determined in both irrigation treatments also in the drought period the fraction of transpirable soil water when the relative transpiration drops and the expression of seven aquaporins belonging to plasma membrane intrinsic proteins subfamily was assessed in the drought period rootpac 20 had a decrease in the aquaporin gene expression in roots and also had an early decline in transpiration independent of the grafted scion also on this rootstock the biomass was more severely affected on the other hand rootpac 40 induced a late decline in transpiration and increased the water use efficiency keeping less affected the biomass accumulation contrasting with the above in the recovery period rootpac 20 improved the water use efficiency reaching higher biomass accumulation in the grafted plants also we observed some interesting interactions between rootstocks and scions rootpac 20 induced a higher stomatal density in both almond and plum scions and angeleno plum induced a bigger root hydraulic

increases water use efficiency wue because of a partial closing of the stomata which allows the maintenance of the co2 influx into the mesophyll but reducing transpiration chaves et al 2009 in plants and other organisms aquaporins are proteins that allow the transport of water and small molecules across the plasma membrane kaldenhoff and fischer 2006 maurel et al 2015 aquaporins are classified into five subfamilies where those known as plasma membrane intrinsic proteins pips have been widely studied for their role under water deficit chaumont et al 2005 maurel et al 2008 and might be involved in the control of plant transpiration under water deficit shekoofa and sinclair 2018 however there is still debate on the relation between aquaporin activity and the hydraulic conductance in plants and the effect that may have on the transpiration rate under water deficit conditions shekoofa and sinclair 2018 the technique of grafting has been known from the beginning of the first millennium bc mainly for propagating woody species difficult to root from cuttings such as apples pears and plums mudge et al 2009 only in the last two centuries the use of rootstocks has been rapidly increased to enhance productivity disease resistance adaptability to unfavorable soil conditions and to reduce productive costs of intensive high value agricultural species albacete et al 2015 although the key role played by both rootstock and scion is acknowledged their relative contribution on specific combinations of genotypes is not yet well understood tramontini et al 2013 it has been suggested that rootstocks can contribute to food security by increasing yield potential of elite varieties closing the yield gap under suboptimal growing conditions and increasing the efficiency of water and soil use among others albacete et al 2015 for this reason some researchers have highlighted the importance of the study of roots as the key factor to achieve a second green revolution in the agriculture gewin 2010 in the global context of climate change the selection of rootstocks as a mean for improving the water use efficiency has been proposed as an essential strategy to face this scenario berdeja et al 2015 in the last years the importance of rootstocks has been understood as a key component to face water deficit conditions rootstocks could strongly impact the gene expression in grapevine vitis vinifera l berries under water deficit berdeja et al 2015 it has been observed that the drought tolerant rootstock 4x of rangpur lime citrus limonia osbeck grafted with valencia delta sweet orange citrus sinensis l modiﬁed the gene expression patterns in rangpur lime citrus roots to regulate the adaptation to water defict allario et al 2013 the recent discovery of a small peptide synthesized in the root vascular tissues of arabidopsis thaliana l under drought conditions capable of moving from roots to the leaves and induced stomatal closure highlights the molecular root control on plant transpiration under drought condition takahashi et al 2018 the control of the threshold at which the plant transpiration drops in a drying soil determines the adaptive strategy used by a genotype more or less conservative and has been suggested as a key trait for predicting the success of a crop under water deficit condition belko et al 2012 vadez et al 2013 berger et al 2016 shekoofa and sinclair 2018 on this regard the control of the scion transpiration under wd has been observed to be determined by the rootstock in grapevines marguerit et al 2012 stone fruit crops prunus spp are the seventh largest group of fruit trees produced worldwide faostat 2017 and in the present study we propose the genus prunus as a model system for assessing the interaction between rootstock and scion on prunus species it is possible to graft different species of high economic importance with different degrees of drought tolerance like plum p salicina and p domestica peach p persica almond p dulcis cherry p avium and apricot p armeniaca directly or using an interstock taking into account the wide genetic diversity of interspecific rootstocks currently available additionally in general terms these prunus rootstocks are easy to propagate clonally and count with six full genomes availabile p persica verde et al 2017 p avium hirakawa et al 2017 p mume zhang et al 2012 p yedoensis baek et al 2018 p domestica zhebentyayeva et al 2019 and p dulcis sánchez pérez et al 2019 which is advantageous for comparative molecular studies species in the subgenus amygdalus especially almond tress are recognized as water deficit tolerant within genus prunus fußeder et al 1992 camposeo et al 2011 consequently the use of almond x peach hybrid rootstocks increases tolerance to water deficit in peach jiménez et al 2013 and almond trees ben yahmed et al 2016 in contrast species in the subgenus prunophora such as plums and p cerasifera have lower tolerance to water deficit duval 2015 in this study we aimed to determine the influence of rootstocks on physiological performance and growth parameters to water deficit on grafted plants for this purpose we have assessed the responses of almond and japanese plum grafted onto two contrasting rootstock genotypes under well watered and water deficit conditions in addition we evaluated such responses under a post stress long term recovery period 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions this study was conducted at the centro de estudios avanzados en fruticultura ceaf rengo chile 34 19 s 70 50 w non pareil np almond prunus dulcis mill da webb and angeleno an japanese plum prunus salicina l were selected as scion because they are genetically distant differing in leaf morphology size individual leaf area 12 vs 25 cm2 in np and an respectively supplementary table 1 and stomatal density 230 vs 820 stomata per mm2 in np and an respectively supplementary table 1 during winter of 2016

bailey prunus cerasifera ehrh r20 was used as a sensitive genotype jiménez et al 2013 table 1 both r20 and r40 rootstocks are considered as semi dwarfing rootstocks scalisi et al 2018 thereby four rootstock scion combinations were established r40 np r40 an r20 np and r20 an in spring plants ca 40 cm tall were transferred to 20 l containers filled with a mixture of 1 1 peat perlite supplemented with basacote plus 9 m at a 6 g l 1 as a controlled release fertilizer basf limburgerhof germany prior to transplant each container was saturated with tap water allowed to drain and covered with plastic bags to avoid evaporation during 24 h after that similar initial weight of each container was reached ca 11 kg and recorded this was established as a 100 of substrate water content swc and considered as field capacity plants were grown for 30 days in a shade house 50 sunlight and then were transferred to field condition full sunlight plants were acclimatized to this condition for two weeks prior to the start of the experiment containers were covered with plastic bags and irrigated using two drippers per plant with a flow rate of 2 l h 1 for 15 days after that 26 uniform and healthy plants with ca 60 cm tall of each rootstock scion combination were selected for all evaluations four plants were used to determine the initial biomass eight plants for final biomass and root hydraulic conductance at the end of the drought period eight plants for final biomass at the end of recovery period and physiological evaluations net photosynthesis stomatal conductance midday water potential and root hydraulic conductance along the drought and recovery periods and six plants were used for gene expression analysis in the drought period from december 28 2016 to february 1 2017 average day and night time temperature were 33 and 13 c and relative humidity ranged between 31 and 68 respectively during recovery period full irrigation in water deficit plants from february 2 2017 to march 18 2017 average day and night time temperature were 31 and 11 c and relative humidity ranged between 35 and 83 respectively 2 2 irrigation treatments plants were subjected to two irrigation treatments well watered ww and water deficit wd in a completely randomized experimental design plants under ww condition were irrigated three times per week adding as much water as to reach the corresponding 100 of the swc for each pot in wd condition on the other hand irrigation of plants was withheld for 33 days weighting each pot three times per week in order to determine the water consumption of every single plant then all the pots were filled with the volume of water necessary to reach the same water content of the plant with the lowest transpiration rate which in turn was not irrigated therefore after the irrigation all the wd pots contained the same soil water of the swc this irrigation schedule was maintained for 35 days the minimum water content in the pot 0 swc was determined at the end of the drought period using the average of 10 containers with the lowest substrate weight maximum water extraction on independent plants the swc supplementary fig 1 was calculated for each container as eq 1 1 swc sw amsw msw amsw where sw is the daily substrate weight amsw is the average minimum substrate weight of 10 containers with the lowest substrate weight and msw is the maximum substrate weight at field capacity after the drought period the recovery period was maintained for 44 days and all plants were allowed to reach the 100 of swc in each irrigation cycle the plant water uptake capacity under wd was calculated as the relationship between the relative transpiration rate rt and the fraction of transpirable substrate water ftsw for each container sinclair and ludlow 1986 rt corresponds to the daily amount of transpired water under wd divided by the average daily transpiration of the ww for each rootstock scion combination ftsw correspond to the fraction of water inside the container that plants can use to transpiration the rt of each plant was divided by the mean relative transpiration rate for that plant during the period when the soil was still well watered in order to normalize the initial values sinclair and ludlow 1986 according to bindi et al 2005 the initial point for stress ftswthreshold is around to a rt value of 0 9 then rt was adjusted to a logistic equation as in eq 2 2 rt 1 1 α exp β ftsw where α and β are constants to be determined for each plant related to the curvature of a logistic regression 2 3 stomatal density the stomatal density was determined at three different times on different leaves developed during each period before of the imposition of drought at the end of the drought and recovery periods four mature leaves were selected from each treatment and combination in order to assess the stomatal density stomatal imprint in attached leaves were made by applying a nail varnish on the abaxial surface of the leaves avoiding the midrib and the leaf margin after drying the nail varnish film was gently peeled off using transparent tape and was fixed on a clean labelled microscope slide kardel et al 2010 the stomatal imprints were analyzed with a light microscope olympus bx43 olympus hamburg germany for each imprint two images were taken in different zones stomatal density number of stomata per mm2 was made counting all the stomata of the image known area and extrapolating to 1 mm2 in total 8 images 4 leaves and 2 zones per leaf were analyzed to obtain an average stomatal density per plant in each experimental period drought and recovery 2 4 root hydraulic conductivity the root hydraulic conductivity lp was determined by a high pressure flow meter hpfm dynamax houston tx usa according to tyree et al 1995 the night before measurements wd plants were fully irrigated in order to recover the water columns reducing artifacts due to cavitation alsina et al 2011 the lp measurements were made in the whole root system below the rootstock scion junction at the end of the periods of drought and recovery twice per plant subsequently this value was normalized by the dry weight of the complete root system vandeleur et al 2014 2 5 stomatal conductance net photosynthesis and stem water potential stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthesis pn were measured after 1 8 15 22 29 and 35 days of water deficit and after 1 7 and 13 days of recovery these measurements were conducted on mature fully expanded leaves using a portable photosynthesis equipment model ciras 2 ppsystem hitchin uk equipped with a 2 5 cm2 led lighting cuvette model ciras plc ppsystem the temperature within the cuvette was maintained at 25 c with a radiation level of 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 400 μmol co2 mol 1 air and relative humidity of both gs and pn measurements were performed between 9 30 and 11 00 am on the day before irrigation midday stem water potential ψstem was measured on a mature leaf fifth leaf expanded from the apex in the same days that gs and pn measurements the leaves were covered with plastic bags coated with aluminum foil to stop transpiration and allow it to balance with the stem potential at least 2 h before measuring the measurement was made at solar noon between 13 00 and 15 00 pm with a schölander pressure chamber schölander et al 1965 2 6 whole plant water use efficiency and growth at the beginning and at the end of the periods of drought and recovery plants were harvested and split into leaves stem and roots the dry weight of each plant part was determined after placing the samples in an oven at 70 c until reaching a constant weight growth for each plant part was calculated by means of the difference between the final biomass of leaves stems and roots of each plant and the average initial biomass of each scion rootstock combination in the case of the drought period this difference was between the biomass at the end of the drought period and the average initial biomass and in the recovery period the difference was between the final biomass with the average biomass at the end of the drought period per treatment and plant part the leaf area stomatal density and stomata length of different commercial prunus leaves were analyzed prior to the experiment in order to select the two more contrasting scions supplementary table 1 leaf area and stomata length were obtained by scanned leaves and processing stomatal imprints respectively using the imagej software version 1 51j8 nih with a reference area o neal et al 2002 whole plant water use efficiency wuewp was calculated as the difference between the total biomass at the end of drought and recovery periods minus the average biomass at the beginning of drought and recovery periods respectively both divided by water consumption of the respective period as in eq 3 3 wuewp final dry biomass initial dry biomass total water consumption 2 7 transcriptional analysis at the end of the drought period plants of all the rootstock scion combination and irrigation treatments were selected for gene expression three root samples were collected from three different plants in order to assess the expression level of genes encoding for seven pips pip1 1 pip1 2 pip1 3 pip2 1 pip2 2 pip2 3 and pip2 4 total rna was extracted following the ctab methodology described by chang et al 1993 dnase i ambion austin usa was used to remove genomic dna contamination rna quality was tested using electrophoresis in agarose gel stained with redgel total rna concentration was determined by spectrophotometry infiniter m200 pro nanoquant tecan group ltd switzerland then cdna was synthesized from 2 μg rna using the maxima first strand cdna synthesis kit thermo scientific usa the obtained cdna was diluted in a 1 4 relation and using 2 μl of the solution qrt pcr reactions were run using specific primers designed with the primer premier 5 0 software premier biosoft international palo alto usa supplementary table 2 and synthesized by idt integrated dna technologies inc fermelo biotec all reactions were run in an mx3000 p qpcr system agilent technologies usa using maxima sybr green rox qpcr master mix thermo scientific usa as the fluorescent detector two technical replicates were run for each biological sample the specificity of the amplified products was confirmed by the registration of a single peak in the melting curves and the visualization of a single band in the agarose gels data was normalized using rpii rna polymerase subunit 2 genbank accession prupe 8g132000 1 tong et al 2009 well watered plants from each rootstock scion combination were used as calibration samples and the normalized values were used for the determination of the relative quantification pfaffl 2001 2 8 experimental design and statistical analysis differences in ftswthreshold stomatal density lp biomass wuewp and gene relative expression were tested using irrigation rootstock scion and their interactions as fixed factors stomatal conductance net photosynthesis and midday stem water potential were tested using repeated measure anova where leaves measured over time are the repeated measures heteroscedastic variance models were used when necessary followed by lsd mean separation when appropriate all the statistical analyses were made using infostat version 2016e universidad de córdoba córdoba argentina statistical software di rienzo et al 2011 3 results 3 1 water consumption and stomatal density two different rt vs ftsw relationship patterns were observed fig 1 the first with a late reduction of rt occurring when the ftsw reached values of 0 35 and 0 32 in r40 np and r40 an respectively fig 1a and b the second experiencing an earlier rt reduction when the ftsw values reached down to 0 44 and 0 47 in r20 np and r20 an respectively fig 1c and d the wd affected the internal plant water status in the different rootstock scion combinations being evidenced by time course ψstem measurements from 15 at 35 days of drought plants under wd condition had a lower ψstem value than the ww counterpart and these values were decreasing along this period in wd plants supplementary table 5 under ww condition the combinations using r20 rootstock reached higher values of gs and pn during the most part of the whole experiment in comparison to r40 grafted plants supplementary table 3 and 4 under wd condition the gs was similar between plants using the same scion supplementary table 3 however pn was higher in r40 an respect to r20 an supplementary table 4 the stomatal density on the other hand was always higher in plums as compared to almonds regardless of the rootstock fig 2 at the beginning of the experiment and before the drought period an and np grafted on r20 rootstock evidenced a higher stomatal density than those grafted onto r40 fig 2a after 35 days of drought a higher stomatal density was observed in an when grafted on r20 in comparison to r40 an fig 2b with no differences in np regardless the rootstock used after 44 days of post drought recovery np and an resulted with higher stomatal densities compared to those plants with continuous irrigation fig 2c also at the end of the recovery period a higher stomatal density was observed in r20 than r40 grafted with np and an fig 2d 3 2 root hydraulic conductivity and pip aquaporin genes expression after 35 days of drought a significant difference in lp was observed between the r40 and r20 rootstocks with a lower value for the former compared to the latter but with no differences in ww conditions between both rootstocks fig 3 a also compared to their respective ww counterpart only r40 reduced lp under wd in relation with the the interaction within the scion rootstock combination it is clear in the fig 3b that the scion affects the rootstock lp in particular both r40 and r20 grafted with an resulted in a significantly higher lp compared to those with np on the other hand at the end of the recovery period the values of lp were equal in all the irrigation and grafting treatments involving r40 fig 3c however the r20 np plants reached significantly lower lp values compared to both ww r20 np and ww r20 an plants fig 3c regarding the seven aquaporin genes assessed in the present study in general the r40 rootstock did not change their transcript abundance as a response to wd except for the pip 2 3 and pip 2 4 increasing the former and decreasing the later for the r40 np combination and also the pip 2 2 and pip 2 3 both increasing in the r40 an combination fig 4 a and b in contrast a general repression of pip genes in wd r20 rootstocks were observed except for pip 2 1 pip 2 2 and pip 2 3 with similar transcript abundance in wd compared to ww condition in the r20 np combination and the pip 2 3 which increased under water deficit in the r20 an combination fig 4c and d in fact it is noteworthy that nearly all the pip genes assessed in the present study were repressed under wd conditions in the r20 an combination with the exception of pip 2 3 which increased its mrna levels under water deficit in all rootstock scion combination 3 3 biomass accumulation and water use efficiency during the 35 days of drought the dry matter accumulation in leaves was significantly lower in all the rootstock scion combinations under wd compared to their ww counterparts except for the r40 an combination with no significant differences between the irrigation regimes fig 5 a at the end of the recovery period a greater leaf biomass accumulation was evidenced in an scion regardless of the rootstocks fig 5b in contrast after the recovery period the r40 np combination did not accumulate leaf biomass fig 5b as for the stems after the drought period plants grafted on the r40 rootstock maintained the biomass accumulation similarly in wd and ww conditions fig 5c in the r20 rootstock on the other hand the stem biomass accumulation was significantly lower in both the np and an under wd condition compared to ww fig 5c after the 44 days of post drought recovery the stem biomass accumulation in the r40 np combination were similar in the wd and ww treatments opposite to all the remaining treatments in which the stem biomass was significantly lower in plants previously exposed to wd than those well irrigated fig 5d the lowest stem biomass accumulation as compared to their well irrigated counterpart was observed in the wd r20 np plants fig 5d regarding the root biomass accumulation during drought higher values were observed in the r40 plants in the wd condition compared to their r20 counterparts fig 5e also and during this time the r20 np plants had the lowest root biomass accumulation fig 5f in general after the recovery period the plants that were under wd condition accumulated a lower root biomass compared to the ww plants fig 5g and in particular the r40 np plants accumulated a lower root biomass compared to the remaining combinations fig 5h as for the wuewp at the end of the drought period the plants grafted on the r40 rootstock increased their water use efficiency at the whole plant level up to significantly higher values compared to the ww condition contrary to that observed in plants grafted on r20 with similar wuewp values between the irrigation treatments fig 6 a also at the end of the drought period the r20 np combination resulted in the lowest wuewp values fig 6b when comparing the wuewp values for all the rootstock scion combinations as shown in fig 6c all the combinations previously exposed to drought reached lower values compared to the ww condition except for the r20 an combination which evidenced no significant differences between irrigation regimes 4 discussion studies regarding the root system have been rising in recent years due to their fundamental role in water deficit scenarios webster 1995 isaakidis et al 2004 also the use of drought tolerant rootstocks has been proposed as a convenient way to provide tolerance to the cultivated fruit trees varieties isaakidis et al 2004 marguerit et al 2012 cantero navarro et al 2016 several studies relate drought tolerance with the vigor induced by rootstocks in this sense vigorous plants are usually more tolerant due to a bigger root system atkinson et al 1998 serra et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 but at the same time with a higher consumption of water per plant atkinson et al 2000 however this trend has shown exceptions since some dwarfing rootstock have been reported as more wd tolerant di vaio et al 2012 tworkoski et al 2016 regarding to r40 and r20 rootstocks it has been observed in almond that r40 induced a higher vigor in in comparison to r20 rootstock ben yahmed et al 2016 in our experiment the ranking from the more to less vigorous combination under ww conditions in the drought period was r20 an average total dw 529 g r40 np average total dw 500 g r20 np average total dw 274 g and r40 an average total dw 250 g according to these results an influence of the rootstocks in the production of biomass in the different combinations is not evident thus such production under well watered conditions seems to be defined by the compatibility of the rootstock and graft since those combinations that involve more closely related taxonomically species accumulated more biomass however when the water deficit was imposed the influence of the rootstocks becomes clearly decisive in terms of biomass production in this regard the combinations involving the r40 rootstock an almond peach hybrid showed a lower decrease in their biomass fig 5 it is interesting to note that r40 and r20 rootstocks are considered as semi dwarfing prunus rootstocks therefore the differences of the biomass production reported should be explained by other traits distinct to plant vigor tolerance however is not necessarily related to a more conservative use of water for instance the grapevine tolerant rootstock m4 v vinifera v berlandieri v berlandieri cv resseguier had a higher transpiration rate under severe wd condition compared to the sensitive 101 14 v riparia v rupestris rootstock corso et al 2015 similarly the r40 grafted plants which proved to be more tolerant than r20 fig 5 and 6 are also those with higher transpiration rates at a low ftsw values as observed by the late rt reduction under wd fig 1 the ftswthreshold that is the ftsw value resulting in a rt value of 0 9 as proposed by bindi et al 2005 is clearly dependent of the rootstock but not of the grafted scion fig 1 despite the great morphological differences existing between almond and plums supplemental table 1 r40 rootstock had a lower ftswthreshold maintaining a higher rt at low swc in comparison to r20 fig 1 noteworthy in grapevine rootstocks the qtls suggested as having control on the scion transpiration were colocalized among others with aquaporin genes marguerit et al 2012 in these regard we observed a higher ftswthreshold for the rt drop in r20 grafted plants fig 1 and at the same time a reduction on the expression of several pip genes in roots under wd fig 4c and d but further studies are needed in order to prove a functional relationship between both traits the overexpression of pip genes seems to be involved in increments of root hydraulic conductance gambetta et al 2012 leading to the regulation of water flow at a whole plant level grondin et al 2016 and could be involved in the control of plant s transpiration under wd condition shekoofa and sinclair 2018 in the present study however no clear relationship between pip transcript abundance and lp was observed several pip genes were down regulated in r20 roots under wd condition fig 4c and d but no differences in lp between ww and wd conditions in the drought period were observed fig 3a in contrast to r20 genotype r40 roots showed few differences on pip genes expression between ww and wd conditions fig 4a and b but reduced lp values under wd were evident fig 3a the research on plant aquaporins has yielded contrasting results in terms of tolerance to water deficit pou et al 2013 xu et al 2014 brunner et al 2015 li et al 2015 reddy et al 2017 in this sense studies focused on their activity functional regulation and localization will be helpful to a better understanding of the relationship between pip aquaporins and lp in prunus species alsina et al 2011 reported that the tolerant grapevine rootstock 1103p vitis berlandieri x v rupestris has a higher root hydraulic conductance compared to sensitive genotypes under wd in field conditions by mean of the generation of deep roots that explore more soil layers to find water as for potted peach p persica olive olea europea l citrumelo poncirus trifoliata raf citrus paradisi macf and pistachio pistachia integerrima l rieger 1995 plants of these species have been observed to have a reduced lp when grown under wd the fact that r40 rootstocks reduce their lp under wd conditions fig 3a might be related to the volume of the container where the roots were confined in contrast to field conditions however no relationship has been observed between root hydraulic conductivity and wd tolerance in prunus genotypes with different levels of drought adaptation in pots assays rieger and duemmel 1992 it is possible that the container might modify the relationship between lp and drought tolerance but further studies are needed in order to clarify the extent of such effect tolerant wd cowpea vigna unguiculate l genotypes have been reported to have a rather late decline in plant transpiration and higher wue under wd conditions in comparison to sensitive genotypes belko et al 2012 similarly the low ftswthreshold induced by the r40 rootstock in the grafted an and np fig 1a and b is associated with an increase in the wuewp in wd plants fig 6a consequently during the drought period wd an plants grafted on r40 reached a leaf biomass equal to ww plants fig 5a an equal stem biomass in np and an scions fig 5c and an equal root biomass between ww and wd plants fig 5g in contrast the higher ftswthreshold induced by r20 rootstock fig 1 c and d but with similar wuewp between ww and wd plants fig 6a together with a lower wuewp on the r20 np plants fig 6b in the drought period implied a reduction in biomass accumulation additionally leaf and stem biomass in the np and an scions were reduced fig 5a and c respectively and also a low root biomass with np scion was observed using r20 rootstock fig 5g it has been suggested that a higher ftswthreshold for transpiration decline would have a negative consequence under water deficit conditions because of the negative effect on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis vadez et al 2013 this fact might explain the lower biomass accumulation in r20 grafted plants under wd the genetic background of r40 is composed by species from the amygdalus subgenus which have been described as drought tolerant species fußeder et al 1992 camposeo et al 2011 wild prunus species from arid regions like prunus ferganensis kost riab under water deficit conditions are characterized by a rapid use of all the available water in soil with a high efficiency in order to maintain their biomass rieger et al 2003 on the other hand one of the parents of r20 is composed by a specie of the prunophora subgenus p cerasifera which might reduce the tolerance to water deficit duval 2015 it is noteworthy that similar responses were observed in ungrafted r40 and r20 plants under wd condition in terms of ftswthreshold biomass accumulation wuewp and root pip aquaporin genes expression article under revision suggesting that rootstocks responses to wd might be a valuable prognostic for the performance of a grafted tree it is interesting to note that even though r40 grafted plants were more tolerant to wd they do not perform as good as r20 grafted plants after a post stress recovery period indeed r40 grafted plants previously water stressed maintained a significantly lower wuewp compared to ww plants fig 6c r20 np also reduced the wuewp but not as much as the r40 np plants fig 6c consequently the leaf biomass accumulation at the end of the recovery period was larger on r20 np and r20 an in comparison to r40 np and r40 an plants respectively fig 5b the stem biomass accumulation on the other hand was also larger on r20 an in comparison to r40 an in both ww and wd conditions fig 5d r20 np under ww condition had more stem biomass that r40 np under ww and wd but r20 np with a previous wd condition did not increased the stem accumulation in the recovery period fig 5d finally root biomass accumulation was reduced on r40 np plants in ww and wd condition fig 5h these contrasting effects induced by the rootstocks between drought and recovery periods highlights the importance of studying the recovery period in the long term a close interaction between shoot and roots lp have been observed in grapevine soybean glycine max l and maize zea mays l vandeleur et al 2009 from our results during the drought period an scion induced a high lp value on roots of both rootstocks in comparison to np scion fig 3b a possible explanation might be that plums might induce greater internal tension in the transpiratory stream given by a bigger transpiratory surface as a result of their high stomatal density as compared to almond leaves fig 2 in fact it has been reported before that lp in roots is likely to be increased under a high hydrostatic gradient steudle 2000 on the other hand r20 rootstock induced a greater stomatal density on an and np scions in comparison to r40 rootstock fig 2 besides both scions resulted in frequent higher stomatal conductance and photosynthetic co2 assimilation under ww condition when grafted onto r20 rootstock supplementary table 3 and 4 at the end of the experiment r20 grafted plants under ww condition were the more vigorous plants in comparison to r40 grafted plants these differences might be the consequence of a higher stomatal density induced by r20 rootstock implying an increase of the gas exchange surface increasing net photosynthesis in poplar populus trichocarpa torrey and gray p deltoides bartram stomatal density of new leaves were positively correlated with stomatal conductance of old leaves turpin et al 2005 in our study a higher stomatal density was observed on leaves developed on the recovery period in plants that had a previous wd condition fig 2c however in the case of our study mature leaves on wd plants had a lower stomatal conductance supplementary table 3 camposeo et al 2011 reported in almond that spring leaves had a higher stomatal density in comparison to leaves developed in summer additionally in prunus serotina ehrh a reduction in stomatal density was observed in response to drier environments abrams 1994 in both cases this reduction in stomatal density is a consequence of environmental water stress our results show that after a water deficit period new leaves developed on well watered conditions at the end of summer increase the stomatal density probably by the new optimum water status condition 5 conclusions the use of rootstocks as a mean for increasing the tolerance of species of agricultural importance to constraining environments is becoming a general trend worldwide especially in fruit tree orchards as for water deficit some genotypes have proven to be potentially useful because of their tolerance to drought and therefore their potential for conferring tolerance to grafted species indeed from our results plants grafted onto the r40 rootstock resulted in better physiological performance including a late reduction on rt an increase on wuewp and with lesser detrimental effects on the biomass as compared to those grafted on r20 however such response is not necessarily conserved after a recovery period when irrigation is resumed in this case plants grafted on the r20 resulted in a higher wuewp and growth this is relevant since in the productive context of commercial orchards in arid and semiarid zones plants are not necessarily at the risk of terminal water scarcity but to transient water shortages where the capacity of plants to recover is of great importance up to now it is clear that rootstocks affects morpho physiological traits on the grafted scions for instance the r20 rootstock induced a greater stomatal density in both np and an scion also r40 induced a low ftswthreshold together with an increased wuewp in wd condition both advantageous traits under controlled irrigation systems such as that practiced in fruit production in central chile interestingly our results suggest that there is a scion effect over the rootstocks also angeleno plum for instance induced a greater lp in comparison to non pareil almond in drought periods regardless of the rootstock used recently the principles underlying water movement and hydraulic responses under stress has become clearer the importance of the responses at the molecular level however is still under debate aquaporins have been argued to play a critical role at the whole plant level by allowing water re allocation and to sustain transpiration under stress vitali et al 2016 we have assessed the responses of seven pip genes on the root system of the r20 and r40 rootstock in combination with grafted an and np some trends are clear for instance such as the general reduction of the transcript abundance of pip s under stress when grafted onto r20 however the linkage of the comparative responses in r20 and r40 to the physiological changes found in terms of ftswthreshold wuewp biomass etc is rather elusive and further studies are needed in order to better understand the relevance of the function of aquaporins at the whole plant level finally we demonstrate that stone fruits fit well with a novel model to study the interaction between rootstocks and scions focused on physiological and molecular parameters to conduct research on drought tolerance future researches considering the use of interstocks needed to combine rootstocks and scions of prunus species usually incompatible will wide this type of studies to other stone fruits species such as sweet cherry apricot or peach which would help to improve our understanding about the adaption of grafted stone fruit trees to water deficit likely unraveling further interactions between rootstocks and scions 6 funding this work was supported by grant from project fondecyt nº 1150853 conicyt

10812,the increasing pressure on water resources in nebraska us and other agricultural areas requires the implementation of innovative tools and solutions for the governance of water resources and the analysis of water use efficiency in this vein this paper presents the application of a remote sensing based soil water balance for the study of water use in agricultural areas the specific objectives were the identification of the temporal and spatial behavior of the irrigation water use based on the quantification of the water use deviation irrigation water applied minus irrigation water requirements as the main indicator and the comparative analysis of the irrigation productivity crop yield under irrigated field minus crop yield under rainfed condition per volume of water applied by irrigation wpi water productivity harvestable grain per total volume of water applied considering precipitation plus irrigation wp and finally water productivity based on evapotranspiration harvested grain per total volume of water evapotranspired wpet in the various management zones analyzed additionally we examined the impact of soil types local weather and irrigation system center pivot and furrow irrigation on these indicators the study was carried out in three natural resources district tri basin central platte and lower niobrara across central nebraska for the period 2004 2012 and comprised over 2000 irrigated corn fields per year crop water requirements were estimated using the reflectance based crop coefficient approach developed in previous research see campos et al 2017 and the field data were reported for each field monitored through cropland data layer by national agricultural statistics service of usda the difference between modeled irrigation water requirements and field level irrigation application was significant p 0 001 being the water use deviation in generally positive over irrigation these results were consistently higher for furrow irrigated fields during the whole analyzed period reaching up to three times more water applied compared to the required amount this was expected as surface irrigation systems typically require a higher application depth this trend changed for the central pivot irrigated fields depending on the climatic conditions especially in dry years the analysis of the water use deviation with respect to soil types and weather conditions revealed that the water use deviation is not justified by the biophysical conditions alone the estimated values of wp and wpi for furrow system was lower compared to center pivot in both nrd s reaching the maximum value of 1 37 kg m 3 and 3 06 kg m 3 for wp and wpi in tri basin respectively for center pivot in general the results suggested potential to improve water management in these nrds in central nebraska and reduce pumping potentially saving groundwater resources for drought years and other uses monitoring soil type weather data and switching to sprinklers system keywords satellite imagery basal crop coefficient water productivity 1 introduction nebraska us ne harvested in 2017 nearly 3 800 000 ha of corn for grain over 95 of total planted corn area with an average yield of 12 mg ha 1 up 1 over 2016 yields being the number one state in irrigated area in the us with almost 60 of the fields under irrigation with an approximate area of 3 4 million hectares usda 2018 water resources to supply this irrigation demand is mainly pumped from the underlying high plains aquifer nebraska has more than 100 thousand active irrigation wells and every decade ten thousand wells are added increasing the pressure on the freshwater resources becoming one the most intensive irrigated regions the world although nebraska is considered a groundwater rich state and the ground water levels are fairly stable the total water stored in the high plains aquifer which is also present in kansas colorado oklahoma and texas has been declining over the recent years steward and andrew 2016 the local water authorities in nebraska are the natural resources districts nrds https www nrdnet org and the main tool for the management of the water resources at the nrd scale is water allocations based on policies limiting water use for irrigation kelly 2010 the optimization of water use in irrigated agriculture has an important role facing the economic and environmental challenges of guaranteeing profitability of the agricultural activity and the sustainability of freshwater resources this context requires the estimation of indicators of water use and efficiency for the implementation of benchmarking analysis or comparative studies identifying the inefficiencies of the systems as a first step toward the proposition of solutions previous studies analyzed the performance of water management in terms of the relative water supply rws considering the ratio between applied water by irrigation and rainfall to crop water demand or related indicators along this line droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 and karatas et al 2009 analyzed the irrigation performance at the scale of irrigation scheme in turkey similar studies had been published by lorite et al 2004 in shenkut 2015 and gibson et al 2018 another important indicator widely analyzed in the scientific literature is the water productivity that defines the relationship between net benefits from the crop and the amount of water required to produce those benefits molden et al 2010 for biophysical water productivity it is the amount of water used for producing a given quantity of crop generally yield water productivity is mostly expressed by either evapotranspiration as a measurement of water consumption by plants or by the total amount of water applied to the field including soil stored water at sowing time plus irrigation and precipitation registered during the growing season some analyses have already demonstrated the impact of the farmer s water management soil type and weather conditions on the water productivity to maize in nebraska carr et al 2016 found that mainly due to large amounts of irrigation used in central nebraska the water productivity was not at an optimal level according to grassini et al 2011 applied irrigation was 41 less under pivot than under surface irrigation simulation analysis showed that up to 32 of the annual water volume allocated to irrigated maize in the region could be saved by switching current surface systems to pivot one of the most critical causes of low application efficiency in furrow irrigation system is the need to apply larger volumes of water to fill the crop root zone along the furrow resulting in excessive deep percolation at the head of the field zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 based on a review literature concluded that globally the range of crop water productivity values is very large for maize 1 1 2 7 kg m 3 and thus offers tremendous opportunities for maintaining or increasing agricultural production with 20 40 less application of water resources the most significant conclusion is that crop water productivity can be increased significantly if irrigation application is reduced and or crop water deficit is induced deficit irrigation some of the above mentioned studies demonstrated the convenience of using remote sensing methodologies in the assessment of key variables in water accounting and crop evapotranspiration both potential and in water limited situations in this research we estimate corn irrigation water requirements through a remote sensing approach and use field level crop yield and applied metered water pumping data to compare and analyze water application and crop water productivity in thousands of fields in three natural resources districts nrds in nebraska namely tri basin central platte and lower niobrara from 2004 to 2012 these estimates allowed us to identify fields where significant over and under irrigation has occurred examine potential reasons and the impact of existing water management practices on crop yield additional analyses considered the possible effect of soil types weather conditions and irrigation systems in the deviations detected the strength of the results obtained relies on the unique and extensive database analyzed including pumpinn records and in situ yield data for a representative sample of each nrd and for a long study period including dry and wet weather conditions and considering two different types of irrigation systems center pivot and furrow irrigation systems the innovative aspects of the current study is thus the use of net irrigation requirement derived from remote sensing combined with measured field level irrigation application rate to compare and identify fields that apply above the average level of irrigation in addition the study tries to identify the potential contribution of difference in soil types irrigation systems and climate to the large variation in irrigation application rate among fields within the same nrd and across the three nrds 2 material and methods 2 1 locations of sites and characterization this research was carried out using data collected from irrigated corn fields in three nrd lower niobrara central platte and tri basin in nebraska midwestern united states fig 1 according to köppen climate types peel et al 2007 all three nrds have a humid continental climate with hot summer and cold winter thot 10 c and tcold 0 c with the coldest month in january and the hottest in july precipitation varies widely across nebraska from a low of 400 mm in western nebraska to a high of 800 mm in eastern nebraska the average precipitation at the approximate longitude of all three nrds is around 600 mm annually considering the three nrd s with respect to regulation only tri basin is under an irrigation water allocation of 685 8 mm 3 years accord to national cooperative soil survey of usda usda ncss 2017 the soil series in lower niobrara is typically very deep and well drained central platte presents gibbon is also very deep but somewhat from poorly drained to well drained moderately permeable soils while tri basin has mostly the very deep well drained soils 2 2 irrigation requirements estimation based on remote sensing a possible line of analysis is the estimation of the irrigation water requirements defined as the water that must be supplied through irrigation to satisfy crop water demand leaching and miscellaneous water supply that it is not provided by stored soil water and precipitation that infiltrates the soil jensen et al 1990 one of the best ways to analyse irrigation water use over large scales is through satellite based remote sensing the two main approaches are energy balance models and water balance models using reflectance based basal crop coefficients kcb neale et al 1989 derived from canopy reflectance vegetation indices vi such as the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete et al 1984 this crop coefficient derived from remote sensing can be used in water balance models rswb for estimation of water requirements and biomass as demonstrated in campos et al 2017 combined with the water balance method described in fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 the use of remote sensing rs methodologies to assess crop water demand has been used in many studies neale et al 1989 campos et al 2016 duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 hunsaker et al 2005 jayanthi et al 2007 neale et al 2012 describing the capability of vegetation indices to measure crop temporal evolution and relating to crop coefficients in the rswb methodology the product between kcb and etr reference evapotranspiration accumulated over time represents the potential water requirement of the crop over the crop growing season these requirements should be satisfied by the water stored in the root zone the eventual precipitation and applied irrigation water thus irrigation requirements crop water demand are estimated in a simple and precise approach and adapted to the actual spatially distributed field crop development through the reflectance based crop coefficients this approach has been widely evaluated and applied to herbaceous and woody crops by combining airborne or satellite mutltispectral imagery with biophysical and ground based weather data for a precise description of the kcb curve for many agricultural areas in the world using freely available datasets water runoff after watering events deep percolation the capillary rise to from water tables the evaporation of water from the bare soil and the water intercepted by the plant canopy are other fundamental components of the root zone water balance irrigation water requirements were generated using the basal crop coefficient estimated with the savi obtained from landsat 5 tm and 7 etm multispectral imagery between april 1 and october 31 for the period from 2004 to 2012 over the three nrd study sites the images were obtained from the atmospherically corrected reflectance provided by the surface reflectance climate data record cdr of the usgs platform glovis usgs gov app fullscreen 1 the savi values were calculated on a pixel by pixel basis and averaged at the field scale using an irrigated field s shapefile vector layer that included a buffer of more than 20 m from the edge the time discrete savi values derived from the remote sensing data were interpolated to daily time series as a function of accumulated growing degree days gdds as proposed by campos et al 2017 and converted to estimate the daily kcb for each pivot and season accord to linear relationship given in eq 1 for modern high yielding corn hybrids grown in nebraska campos et al 2017 1 kcb 1 414 x savi 0 02 gdds were calculated using a base temperature tbase equal to 10 c for maize the kcb data reached its maximum value 0 93 at a savi of 0 68 the minimum value of savi 0 12 bare soil the analyses performed in this research are based on the asce tall crop reference evapotranspiration therefore the minimum kcb for bare soil was set to 0 12 subsequently kcb time series were used as inputs to a soil water balance model to simulate daily actual crop evapotranspiration and irrigation water use for each field and year the soil water balance model tracks daily changes in soil water storage as a function of inflows from effective rainfall and irrigation and outflows from deep percolation and actual evapotranspiration based on the widely used and documented fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 this research considered an irrigation efficiency of 0 85 and 0 65 for center pivot and furrow system respectively based on an extension survey in nebraska irmak et al 2011 the methodology used was essentially the one layer soil water balance proposed in the fao 56 manual with additions to simulate the soil to surface evaporation and assimilate the temporal evolution of kcb derived from vis in addition other parameters related to plant growth such as ground cover and rooting depth are rescaled between their maximum and the minimum values proposed in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 and considering the kcb values derived from remote sensing irrigation events were triggered on any day when cumulative soil water depletion is greater than the readily available soil water raw of the root zone which is calculated as the product of the total available soil water in the root zone taw and the fraction of taw that can be depleted p from the root zone before the crop experience water stress management allowed depletion mad the value of p was set equal to 0 55 consistent with the onset of water stress conditions for corn campos et al 2017 allen et al 1998 assuming implicitly that irrigation events to maintain maximum crop evapotranspiration and avoid crop stresses occurred for each field and season irrespective of soil available water irrigation will not occur until kcb exceeds a value of 0 2 indicative of the start of crop development after emergence and will cease once kcb declines below 0 4 as at this point the crop has reached physiological maturity consequently model simulations account for variability in the duration of the irrigation season between fields years e g due to planting date variety etc with an average start date of mid may and end date of mid september consistent with typical practices in nebraska soil properties such as soil water content at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting point used to define the available water holding capacity awhc for each field are obtained from ssurgo 2 2 database soil survey staff nrcs usda 2017 shown in table 1 considering a maximum crop rooting depth of 1 5 m typical of varieties grown in nebraska among the three nrd s there is large soil heterogeneity with respect to awhc across sampled fields in our study ranging from 89 7 mm for lower niobrara to 204 6 mm for tri basin on average tri basin also has the lowest standard deviation for awhc 8 3 mm with central platte presenting highest heterogeneity 46 5 mm and the greatest range of awhc from a maximum of 218 9 to a minimum of 44 8 mm these values have a huge impact on the variability of the irrigation management and must be considered the soil moisture data at planting were obtained from the high plains regional climate center at the university of nebraska lincoln hprcc unl edu and daily savi values before crop emergence period were set equal to 0 12 bare soil campos et al 2017 finally daily weather data minimum and maximum temperature rainfall and reference evapotranspiration for the study period were obtained from two hundred stations of the high plains regional climate center hprcc 2018 hprcc unl edu awdn php through automated weather data network and interpolated using inverse distance weighing to achieve the required spatial coverage for each field we focus the comparison of actual and modeled irrigation water requirements and water productivity on fields growing corn the main irrigated crop type in our study region the analysis was based on nine years data 2004 2012 and on irrigation depth applications obtained from pumping records and corn yield data from 2175 fields collected by the three nrds the data underwent quality control to ensure data accuracy urnrd 2015 the irrigated field s polygon was verified using the cropland data layer by the national agricultural statistics service of usda usda 2018 average corn yield per irrigation system and rainfed conditions in the three nrds is presented in table 2 fields were discarded from the analysis if supervised classification at the time of peak crop development identified that more than 5 of pixels within the field area were classified as non vegetated given indicative savi values for bare soil 0 12 and corn at full cover 0 68 used to train classification algorithms in erdas imagine software additionally we also remove fields from our analysis where in any given year there were an insufficient number or frequency of cloud free landsat images to accurately interpolate daily savi curves considering a minimum r2 value for interpolated curves of 0 9 given the formulation of the relationship between savi and accumulated growing degree days proposed by campos et al 2017 irrigation requirements based on remote sensing was performed considering two different irrigation systems involving almost 1500 irrigated fields per year center pivot and furrow irrigation systems from 2004 to 2009 except lower niobrara consisting of center pivot irrigation system only 2 3 crop water productivity crop water productivity wp based on total

and the capacity of the plants to convert total water applied into biomass and et the results were submitted to analysis of variance by f test anova at 1 probability to assess potential differences between irrigations systems at field and modeled data based on rs 3 results and discussion fig 2 shows that 2012 was the driest year for all nrds with precipitation reaching maximum of 385 9 mm for lower niobrara and etr nearly 2000 mm for tri basin considering all nrd s and years the average precipitation was 654 7 155 6 mm with central platte having the lowest precipitation of 605 6 150 2 mm and lower niobrara the highest with 727 7 158 3 mm according to fao 56 allen et al 1998 maize water demand ranges from 500 to 800 mm for the entire season from may to september in nebraska depending on the weather soil type and variety grown typically the precipitation distribution throughout the season and amounts are not enough to meet maize water requirements so irrigation is required to guarantee high yields especially in seasons when droughts occur such as 2012 when a severe flash drought occurred applied irrigation depths for both surface irrigation and center pivot systems were compared to modeled irrigation water requirements based on the remote sensing methodology for all nrds over nine years and are shown in fig 3 considerable variability can be observed in water depth applications for both furrow surface irrigation and center pivot systems through the variability in the latter was better distributed around the 1 1 line not surprisingly surface irrigation systems require a larger application depth to advance the water and fill the root zone at the tail end of the field and is inherent to the design of these systems this explains the large seasonal application depths observed but also shows the potential for reducing pumping from the aquifer and saving energy if surface irrigation fields were converted to center pivot irrigation some high application depths can also be observed for center pivot systems in all three nrd s indicating variability in farmer behavior possibly resulting from in field variability of soils and physical characteristics and limitations of the irrigation system nevertheless there is a potential to decrease application depths to better match the demands but this would have to be evaluated on a field by field basis we also observed similar deviation of observed irrigation application depths to the modeled irrigation requirement when considering seasonal climatic conditions wet dry or average precipitation separately with a tendency to apply more water in surface irrigation systems and better management with sprinkler systems improved irrigation scheduling soil moisture monitoring and good weather prediction would help to minimize the over application of irrigation water reducing pumping and saving energy there was also significant difference p 0 01 between irrigation systems used furrow system showed more scatter in the data and larger application depth differences between applied and modeled results being on average 88 mm and 115 mm in central platte and tri basin fig 4 both sites 200 more than pivot this is not surprising as surface irrigation systems inherently require larger application depths to fill the root zone at the tail end of the field with center pivot systems it is easier to control the amount of water applied than with furrow system because most surface irrigation projects are built and operated without the use of proper techniques such as laser land leveling resulting in low uniformity and water application efficiency between 30 and 60 due to deep percolation and or runoff thus growers need to apply more water than crop water demand to guarantee higher yields what is encouraging is that the number of furrow irrigated hectares in nebraska has decreased from almost 1 million to approximately 0 60 million hectares in the past ten years regardless of the precipitation amounts furrow irrigation systems apply more water than the irrigation requirements in all nrd s fig 5 during the drought year 2012 highlighted in red both irrigation systems applied less water than plant irrigation requirement in wetter years water availability is plentiful for most farmers and as a result there are few incentives for producers to adopt efficient irrigation management practices to conserve water however in drought years higher costs of groundwater pumping and irrigation system physical limitations likely force farmers to reduce water use even in the absence of any binding regulatory limits to water supply as is the case of central platte and lower niobrara non use water allocation water use allocations in tri basin are not differentiated by soil type therefore growers whose fields have coarser soils will have greater incentive to adopt more efficient irrigation management practices especially during drought years due to the higher gross water demands on these fields foster et al 2019 found similar results in upper republic district in nebraska with large variability in individual irrigation behavior even after accounting for biophysical drivers of water use such as weather soil type crop choice and irrigation technology over irrigation in wet years and under irrigation in drier years was observed gibson et al 2018 investigating sources of variation for irrigation across producer fields in nebraska for nine years found high variability on applied irrigation depth due to soil and weather variability and also that producer behavior likely played a significant role in irrigation decisions bretreger et al 2019 also found high variability between applied and modeled irrigation in australia using climate data and landsat observations for thousand fields in a short period of analyze demonstrating the ability of certain remote sensing technique for irrigation water use and monitoring irrigation our results demonstrate that there are significant opportunities to reduce agricultural water pumping on fields for both types of irrigation systems to support regional level conservation of groundwater resources as a buffer against future drought foster et al 2017 cotterman et al 2017 and to minimize negative impacts of drawdown on freshwater ecosystems perkin et al 2017 sometimes even the irrigation system as the case of center pivot is not able to supply the high evapotranspiration demand during the entire season when the precipitation is deficient becoming an additional challenge facing the growers to manage the water resources through scarcity conditions the impact of water management on wps is shown in the fig 6 and 7 for both irrigation systems in all nrd s there was no difference in wpet between irrigations systems for all nrd s wpet of furrow was slightly larger than the pivot for tri basin because of the slightly larger simulated et for center pivot 768 mm compared to furrow 754 mm see table 3 center pivot showed greater wp and wpi than furrow system in all nrds due the smaller amount of water applied through the irrigation system tri basin had the greatest wp value for both irrigation systems due to less total amount of applied water 247 and 356 mm for pivot and furrow respectively at field and highest grain yield 13 3 t ha 1 these values can be related to the soil type being very deep and showing the highest values of available water holding capacity 204 6 mm which allows for maintaining a higher water content in the root zone after irrigation or rain and minimizing water stress hence increasing crops yields similar results were found in ethiopia in large scale analysis of water applied where the difference between water pumped and required was mainly due to differences in characteristics of soil water holding capacity of each region asres 2016 lower niobrara had the lowest wp values due to greatest amount of applied water 416 mm a result of the sandier soils requiring more frequent irrigation events regarding to wpi the rainfed yield to all the sites were very similar however smaller yields compared to irrigated for tri basin the irrigated yield is 7 1 t ha 1 over rainfed and considering all the nrds 6 2 t ha 1 on average showing how the irrigation is important to maintain high yields and food security as tri basin presented the greater difference between irrigated and rainfed yields and also lower irrigation amount applied consequently had the greatest wpi values for both irrigation systems 3 06 for center pivot and 2 28 kg m 3 for furrow system respectively regarding to wpet between irrigation systems within the same nrds the values were very similar however analyzing the wp over all the years we can see that center pivot system always had greater wp and wpi for all the years and highest values in 2012 due to driest year tri basin again showed the greatest values for wp and wpi over the seasons reaching the maximum of 3 26 kg m 3 for center pivot in 2012 table 4 one of the ways to improve water management in nebraska according to the results obtained would be to invest in improved irrigation management by switching from furrow irrigation to center pivot irrigation system or improved irrigation scheduling the main barrier is the high cost of implementation however simulation analysis showed that up to 32 of the annual water volume allocated to irrigated maize in the region could be saved by switching current surface systems to pivot grassini et al 2011 and along the years of this study the number of the furrow system has decreased year by year similar results for wp were observed by carr et al 2016 in nebraska with values from 1 30 to 1 91 kg m 3 in irrigated areas considering nine years of analyses and revealed that in most cases the same level of corn yields could be achieved using less irrigation according to the comparison between the simulation results and the observations similar conclusions were made in a two year large scale study conducted in farmer s fields across nebraska by irmak et al 2012 in that study farmers used 32 34 more irrigation than the necessary amount the average applied irrigation rate and water productivities presented above can be considered an initial benchmark levels that producers could use as a target to aim at and improve their irrigation application rate and water productivity a full understanding of the spatial patterns of water productivity and setting benchmark level will support the effort to make irrigation water use more productive and sustainable 4 conclusion irrigation amounts used in the three nrds exceeded the crop water requirement amounts to achieve optimal corn yield rates in general center pivots showed better results for all study sites and seasons in 2012 drought year center pivots showed under irrigation for all nrds and furrow systems had similar results due mainly to capacity of water pumping to supply the crop water demand furrow system presented more variability than center pivots for the entire study period considering all nrd s central platte had the highest average applications depth difference between applied and modeled considering the entire period with 88 mm by furrow irrigation followed by tri basin with 115 mm center pivot had lower average applied water depth differences with 37 mm in central platte and 48 mm for tri basin due to higher irrigation depth difference and larger variability in the results central nebraska has a larger potential to improve water management especially with conversion of furrow systems to center pivot wpet was not different between irrigations systems however wp and wpi for center pivot was greater than furrow system due to better system water use efficiency reaching the maximum value of 1 37 and 3 06 kg m3 for wp and wpi respectively in tri basin according to the analyses it is not clear whether irrigator s behavior is influenced by the weather conditions or soil type variability however the large variability indicates potential for reducing pumping and saving energy if surface irrigation fields were converted to center pivot irrigation also irrigation scheduling can be improved monitoring soil moisture and including weather predictions would help to minimize the over application of irrigation water reducing pumping and saving energy this research applied over a large area a new reflectance based crop coefficient relationship to estimate water requirements for modern high yielding corn hybrids grown in nebraska following campos et al 2017 as this research was carried out in one of the most intensely irrigated areas of the world our findings might be a reference to irrigated corn worldwide when center pivot and furrow irrigation systems are used the current study showed for remote sensing techniques can used to estimate optimum irrigation requirement in large scales over one thousand fields and longer period the analysis also allowed to identify for both furrow and pivot systems to what extent the field level irrigation application differs to the net irrigation water requirement by doing such analysis the current work contributes to on how to improve the irrigation management with low cost and accurate estimate of net irrigation requirements declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

10812,the increasing pressure on water resources in nebraska us and other agricultural areas requires the implementation of innovative tools and solutions for the governance of water resources and the analysis of water use efficiency in this vein this paper presents the application of a remote sensing based soil water balance for the study of water use in agricultural areas the specific objectives were the identification of the temporal and spatial behavior of the irrigation water use based on the quantification of the water use deviation irrigation water applied minus irrigation water requirements as the main indicator and the comparative analysis of the irrigation productivity crop yield under irrigated field minus crop yield under rainfed condition per volume of water applied by irrigation wpi water productivity harvestable grain per total volume of water applied considering precipitation plus irrigation wp and finally water productivity based on evapotranspiration harvested grain per total volume of water evapotranspired wpet in the various management zones analyzed additionally we examined the impact of soil types local weather and irrigation system center pivot and furrow irrigation on these indicators the study was carried out in three natural resources district tri basin central platte and lower niobrara across central nebraska for the period 2004 2012 and comprised over 2000 irrigated corn fields per year crop water requirements were estimated using the reflectance based crop coefficient approach developed in previous research see campos et al 2017 and the field data were reported for each field monitored through cropland data layer by national agricultural statistics service of usda the difference between modeled irrigation water requirements and field level irrigation application was significant p 0 001 being the water use deviation in generally positive over irrigation these results were consistently higher for furrow irrigated fields during the whole analyzed period reaching up to three times more water applied compared to the required amount this was expected as surface irrigation systems typically require a higher application depth this trend changed for the central pivot irrigated fields depending on the climatic conditions especially in dry years the analysis of the water use deviation with respect to soil types and weather conditions revealed that the water use deviation is not justified by the biophysical conditions alone the estimated values of wp and wpi for furrow system was lower compared to center pivot in both nrd s reaching the maximum value of 1 37 kg m 3 and 3 06 kg m 3 for wp and wpi in tri basin respectively for center pivot in general the results suggested potential to improve water management in these nrds in central nebraska and reduce pumping potentially saving groundwater resources for drought years and other uses monitoring soil type weather data and switching to sprinklers system keywords satellite imagery basal crop coefficient water productivity 1 introduction nebraska us ne harvested in 2017 nearly 3 800 000 ha of corn for grain over 95 of total planted corn area with an average yield of 12 mg ha 1 up 1 over 2016 yields being the number one state in irrigated area in the us with almost 60 of the fields under irrigation with an approximate area of 3 4 million hectares usda 2018 water resources to supply this irrigation demand is mainly pumped from the underlying high plains aquifer nebraska has more than 100 thousand active irrigation wells and every decade ten thousand wells are added increasing the pressure on the freshwater resources becoming one the most intensive irrigated regions the world although nebraska is considered a groundwater rich state and the ground water levels are fairly stable the total water stored in the high plains aquifer which is also present in kansas colorado oklahoma and texas has been declining over the recent years steward and andrew 2016 the local water authorities in nebraska are the natural resources districts nrds https www nrdnet org and the main tool for the management of the water resources at the nrd scale is water allocations based on policies limiting water use for irrigation kelly 2010 the optimization of water use in irrigated agriculture has an important role facing the economic and environmental challenges of guaranteeing profitability of the agricultural activity and the sustainability of freshwater resources this context requires the estimation of indicators of water use and efficiency for the implementation of benchmarking analysis or comparative studies identifying the inefficiencies of the systems as a first step toward the proposition of solutions previous studies analyzed the performance of water management in terms of the relative water supply rws considering the ratio between applied water by irrigation and rainfall to crop water demand or related indicators along this line droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 and karatas et al 2009 analyzed the irrigation performance at the scale of irrigation scheme in turkey similar studies had been published by lorite et al 2004 in shenkut 2015 and gibson et al 2018 another important indicator widely analyzed in the scientific literature is the water productivity that defines the relationship between net benefits from the crop and the amount of water required to produce those benefits molden et al 2010 for biophysical water productivity it is the amount of water used for producing a given quantity of crop generally yield water productivity is mostly expressed by either evapotranspiration as a measurement of water consumption by plants or by the total amount of water applied to the field including soil stored water at sowing time plus irrigation and precipitation registered during the growing season some analyses have already demonstrated the impact of the farmer s water management soil type and weather conditions on the water productivity to maize in nebraska carr et al 2016 found that mainly due to large amounts of irrigation used in central nebraska the water productivity was not at an optimal level according to grassini et al 2011 applied irrigation was 41 less under pivot than under surface irrigation simulation analysis showed that up to 32 of the annual water volume allocated to irrigated maize in the region could be saved by switching current surface systems to pivot one of the most critical causes of low application efficiency in furrow irrigation system is the need to apply larger volumes of water to fill the crop root zone along the furrow resulting in excessive deep percolation at the head of the field zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 based on a review literature concluded that globally the range of crop water productivity values is very large for maize 1 1 2 7 kg m 3 and thus offers tremendous opportunities for maintaining or increasing agricultural production with 20 40 less application of water resources the most significant conclusion is that crop water productivity can be increased significantly if irrigation application is reduced and or crop water deficit is induced deficit irrigation some of the above mentioned studies demonstrated the convenience of using remote sensing methodologies in the assessment of key variables in water accounting and crop evapotranspiration both potential and in water limited situations in this research we estimate corn irrigation water requirements through a remote sensing approach and use field level crop yield and applied metered water pumping data to compare and analyze water application and crop water productivity in thousands of fields in three natural resources districts nrds in nebraska namely tri basin central platte and lower niobrara from 2004 to 2012 these estimates allowed us to identify fields where significant over and under irrigation has occurred examine potential reasons and the impact of existing water management practices on crop yield additional analyses considered the possible effect of soil types weather conditions and irrigation systems in the deviations detected the strength of the results obtained relies on the unique and extensive database analyzed including pumpinn records and in situ yield data for a representative sample of each nrd and for a long study period including dry and wet weather conditions and considering two different types of irrigation systems center pivot and furrow irrigation systems the innovative aspects of the current study is thus the use of net irrigation requirement derived from remote sensing combined with measured field level irrigation application rate to compare and identify fields that apply above the average level of irrigation in addition the study tries to identify the potential contribution of difference in soil types irrigation systems and climate to the large variation in irrigation application rate among fields within the same nrd and across the three nrds 2 material and methods 2 1 locations of sites and characterization this research was carried out using data collected from irrigated corn fields in three nrd lower niobrara central platte and tri basin in nebraska midwestern united states fig 1 according to köppen climate types peel et al 2007 all three nrds have a humid continental climate with hot summer and cold winter thot 10 c and tcold 0 c with the coldest month in january and the hottest in july precipitation varies widely across nebraska from a low of 400 mm in western nebraska to a high of 800 mm in eastern nebraska the average precipitation at the approximate longitude of all three nrds is around 600 mm annually considering the three nrd s with respect to regulation only tri basin is under an irrigation water allocation of 685 8 mm 3 years accord to national cooperative soil survey of usda usda ncss 2017 the soil series in lower niobrara is typically very deep and well drained central platte presents gibbon is also very deep but somewhat from poorly drained to well drained moderately permeable soils while tri basin has mostly the very deep well drained soils 2 2 irrigation requirements estimation based on remote sensing a possible line of analysis is the estimation of the irrigation water requirements defined as the water that must be supplied through irrigation to satisfy crop water demand leaching and miscellaneous water supply that it is not provided by stored soil water and precipitation that infiltrates the soil jensen et al 1990 one of the best ways to analyse irrigation water use over large scales is through satellite based remote sensing the two main approaches are energy balance models and water balance models using reflectance based basal crop coefficients kcb neale et al 1989 derived from canopy reflectance vegetation indices vi such as the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete et al 1984 this crop coefficient derived from remote sensing can be used in water balance models rswb for estimation of water requirements and biomass as demonstrated in campos et al 2017 combined with the water balance method described in fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 the use of remote sensing rs methodologies to assess crop water demand has been used in many studies neale et al 1989 campos et al 2016 duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 hunsaker et al 2005 jayanthi et al 2007 neale et al 2012 describing the capability of vegetation indices to measure crop temporal evolution and relating to crop coefficients in the rswb methodology the product between kcb and etr reference evapotranspiration accumulated over time represents the potential water requirement of the crop over the crop growing season these requirements should be satisfied by the water stored in the root zone the eventual precipitation and applied irrigation water thus irrigation requirements crop water demand are estimated in a simple and precise approach and adapted to the actual spatially distributed field crop development through the reflectance based crop coefficients this approach has been widely evaluated and applied to herbaceous and woody crops by combining airborne or satellite mutltispectral imagery with biophysical and ground based weather data for a precise description of the kcb curve for many agricultural areas in the world using freely available datasets water runoff after watering events deep percolation the capillary rise to from water tables the evaporation of water from the bare soil and the water intercepted by the plant canopy are other fundamental components of the root zone water balance irrigation water requirements were generated using the basal crop coefficient estimated with the savi obtained from landsat 5 tm and 7 etm multispectral imagery between april 1 and october 31 for the period from 2004 to 2012 over the three nrd study sites the images were obtained from the atmospherically corrected reflectance provided by the surface reflectance climate data record cdr of the usgs platform glovis usgs gov app fullscreen 1 the savi values were calculated on a pixel by pixel basis and averaged at the field scale using an irrigated field s shapefile vector layer that included a buffer of more than 20 m from the edge the time discrete savi values derived from the remote sensing data were interpolated to daily time series as a function of accumulated growing degree days gdds as proposed by campos et al 2017 and converted to estimate the daily kcb for each pivot and season accord to linear relationship given in eq 1 for modern high yielding corn hybrids grown in nebraska campos et al 2017 1 kcb 1 414 x savi 0 02 gdds were calculated using a base temperature tbase equal to 10 c for maize the kcb data reached its maximum value 0 93 at a savi of 0 68 the minimum value of savi 0 12 bare soil the analyses performed in this research are based on the asce tall crop reference evapotranspiration therefore the minimum kcb for bare soil was set to 0 12 subsequently kcb time series were used as inputs to a soil water balance model to simulate daily actual crop evapotranspiration and irrigation water use for each field and year the soil water balance model tracks daily changes in soil water storage as a function of inflows from effective rainfall and irrigation and outflows from deep percolation and actual evapotranspiration based on the widely used and documented fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 this research considered an irrigation efficiency of 0 85 and 0 65 for center pivot and furrow system respectively based on an extension survey in nebraska irmak et al 2011 the methodology used was essentially the one layer soil water balance proposed in the fao 56 manual with additions to simulate the soil to surface evaporation and assimilate the temporal evolution of kcb derived from vis in addition other parameters related to plant growth such as ground cover and rooting depth are rescaled between their maximum and the minimum values proposed in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 and considering the kcb values derived from remote sensing irrigation events were triggered on any day when cumulative soil water depletion is greater than the readily available soil water raw of the root zone which is calculated as the product of the total available soil water in the root zone taw and the fraction of taw that can be depleted p from the root zone before the crop experience water stress management allowed depletion mad the value of p was set equal to 0 55 consistent with the onset of water stress conditions for corn campos et al 2017 allen et al 1998 assuming implicitly that irrigation events to maintain maximum crop evapotranspiration and avoid crop stresses occurred for each field and season irrespective of soil available water irrigation will not occur until kcb exceeds a value of 0 2 indicative of the start of crop development after emergence and will cease once kcb declines below 0 4 as at this point the crop has reached physiological maturity consequently model simulations account for variability in the duration of the irrigation season between fields years e g due to planting date variety etc with an average start date of mid may and end date of mid september consistent with typical practices in nebraska soil properties such as soil water content at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting point used to define the available water holding capacity awhc for each field are obtained from ssurgo 2 2 database soil survey staff nrcs usda 2017 shown in table 1 considering a maximum crop rooting depth of 1 5 m typical of varieties grown in nebraska among the three nrd s there is large soil heterogeneity with respect to awhc across sampled fields in our study ranging from 89 7 mm for lower niobrara to 204 6 mm for tri basin on average tri basin also has the lowest standard deviation for awhc 8 3 mm with central platte presenting highest heterogeneity 46 5 mm and the greatest range of awhc from a maximum of 218 9 to a minimum of 44 8 mm these values have a huge impact on the variability of the irrigation management and must be considered the soil moisture data at planting were obtained from the high plains regional climate center at the university of nebraska lincoln hprcc unl edu and daily savi values before crop emergence period were set equal to 0 12 bare soil campos et al 2017 finally daily weather data minimum and maximum temperature rainfall and reference evapotranspiration for the study period were obtained from two hundred stations of the high plains regional climate center hprcc 2018 hprcc unl edu awdn php through automated weather data network and interpolated using inverse distance weighing to achieve the required spatial coverage for each field we focus the comparison of actual and modeled irrigation water requirements and water productivity on fields growing corn the main irrigated crop type in our study region the analysis was based on nine years data 2004 2012 and on irrigation depth applications obtained from pumping records and corn yield data from 2175 fields collected by the three nrds the data underwent quality control to ensure data accuracy urnrd 2015 the irrigated field s polygon was verified using the cropland data layer by the national agricultural statistics service of usda usda 2018 average corn yield per irrigation system and rainfed conditions in the three nrds is presented in table 2 fields were discarded from the analysis if supervised classification at the time of peak crop development identified that more than 5 of pixels within the field area were classified as non vegetated given indicative savi values for bare soil 0 12 and corn at full cover 0 68 used to train classification algorithms in erdas imagine software additionally we also remove fields from our analysis where in any given year there were an insufficient number or frequency of cloud free landsat images to accurately interpolate daily savi curves considering a minimum r2 value for interpolated curves of 0 9 given the formulation of the relationship between savi and accumulated growing degree days proposed by campos et al 2017 irrigation requirements based on remote sensing was performed considering two different irrigation systems involving almost 1500 irrigated fields per year center pivot and furrow irrigation systems from 2004 to 2009 except lower niobrara consisting of center pivot irrigation system only 2 3 crop water productivity crop water productivity wp based on total

yield data and modeled evapotranspiration it is important to measure wp wp i and wpet to understand not only the impact of the irrigation and precipitation on the yield but the relationship among them and the capacity of the plants to convert total water applied into biomass and et the results were submitted to analysis of variance by f test anova at 1 probability to assess potential differences between irrigations systems at field and modeled data based on rs 3 results and discussion fig 2 shows that 2012 was the driest year for all nrds with precipitation reaching maximum of 385 9 mm for lower niobrara and etr nearly 2000 mm for tri basin considering all nrd s and years the average precipitation was 654 7 155 6 mm with central platte having the lowest precipitation of 605 6 150 2 mm and lower niobrara the highest with 727 7 158 3 mm according to fao 56 allen et al 1998 maize water demand ranges from 500 to 800 mm for the entire season from may to september in nebraska depending on the weather soil type and variety grown typically the precipitation distribution throughout the season and amounts are not enough to meet maize water requirements so irrigation is required to guarantee high yields especially in seasons when droughts occur such as 2012 when a severe flash drought occurred applied irrigation depths for both surface irrigation and center pivot systems were compared to modeled irrigation water requirements based on the remote sensing methodology for all nrds over nine years and are shown in fig 3 considerable variability can be observed in water depth applications for both furrow surface irrigation and center pivot systems through the variability in the latter was better distributed around the 1 1 line not surprisingly surface irrigation systems require a larger application depth to advance the water and fill the root zone at the tail end of the field and is inherent to the design of these systems this explains the large seasonal application depths observed but also shows the potential for reducing pumping from the aquifer and saving energy if surface irrigation fields were converted to center pivot irrigation some high application depths can also be observed for center pivot systems in all three nrd s indicating variability in farmer behavior possibly resulting from in field variability of soils and physical characteristics and limitations of the irrigation system nevertheless there is a potential to decrease application depths to better match the demands but this would have to be evaluated on a field by field basis we also observed similar deviation of observed irrigation application depths to the modeled irrigation requirement when considering seasonal climatic conditions wet dry or average precipitation separately with a tendency to apply more water in surface irrigation systems and better management with sprinkler systems improved irrigation scheduling soil moisture monitoring and good weather prediction would help to minimize the over application of irrigation water reducing pumping and saving energy there was also significant difference p 0 01 between irrigation systems used furrow system showed more scatter in the data and larger application depth differences between applied and modeled results being on average 88 mm and 115 mm in central platte and tri basin fig 4 both sites 200 more than pivot this is not surprising as surface irrigation systems inherently require larger application depths to fill the root zone at the tail end of the field with center pivot systems it is easier to control the amount of water applied than with furrow system because most surface irrigation projects are built and operated without the use of proper techniques such as laser land leveling resulting in low uniformity and water application efficiency between 30 and 60 due to deep percolation and or runoff thus growers need to apply more water than crop water demand to guarantee higher yields what is encouraging is that the number of furrow irrigated hectares in nebraska has decreased from almost 1 million to approximately 0 60 million hectares in the past ten years regardless of the precipitation amounts furrow irrigation systems apply more water than the irrigation requirements in all nrd s fig 5 during the drought year 2012 highlighted in red both irrigation systems applied less water than plant irrigation requirement in wetter years water availability is plentiful for most farmers and as a result there are few incentives for producers to adopt efficient irrigation management practices to conserve water however in drought years higher costs of groundwater pumping and irrigation system physical limitations likely force farmers to reduce water use even in the absence of any binding regulatory limits to water supply as is the case of central platte and lower niobrara non use water allocation water use allocations in tri basin are not differentiated by soil type therefore growers whose fields have coarser soils will have greater incentive to adopt more efficient irrigation management practices especially during drought years due to the higher gross water demands on these fields foster et al 2019 found similar results in upper republic district in nebraska with large variability in individual irrigation behavior even after accounting for biophysical drivers of water use such as weather soil type crop choice and irrigation technology over irrigation in wet years and under irrigation in drier years was observed gibson et al 2018 investigating sources of variation for irrigation across producer fields in nebraska for nine years found high variability on applied irrigation depth due to soil and weather variability and also that producer behavior likely played a significant role in irrigation decisions bretreger et al 2019 also found high variability between applied and modeled irrigation in australia using climate data and landsat observations for thousand fields in a short period of analyze demonstrating the ability of certain remote sensing technique for irrigation water use and monitoring irrigation our results demonstrate that there are significant opportunities to reduce agricultural water pumping on fields for both types of irrigation systems to support regional level conservation of groundwater resources as a buffer against future drought foster et al 2017 cotterman et al 2017 and to minimize negative impacts of drawdown on freshwater ecosystems perkin et al 2017 sometimes even the irrigation system as the case of center pivot is not able to supply the high evapotranspiration demand during the entire season when the precipitation is deficient becoming an additional challenge facing the growers to manage the water resources through scarcity conditions the impact of water management on wps is shown in the fig 6 and 7 for both irrigation systems in all nrd s there was no difference in wpet between irrigations systems for all nrd s wpet of furrow was slightly larger than the pivot for tri basin because of the slightly larger simulated et for center pivot 768 mm compared to furrow 754 mm see table 3 center pivot showed greater wp and wpi than furrow system in all nrds due the smaller amount of water applied through the irrigation system tri basin had the greatest wp value for both irrigation systems due to less total amount of applied water 247 and 356 mm for pivot and furrow respectively at field and highest grain yield 13 3 t ha 1 these values can be related to the soil type being very deep and showing the highest values of available water holding capacity 204 6 mm which allows for maintaining a higher water content in the root zone after irrigation or rain and minimizing water stress hence increasing crops yields similar results were found in ethiopia in large scale analysis of water applied where the difference between water pumped and required was mainly due to differences in characteristics of soil water holding capacity of each region asres 2016 lower niobrara had the lowest wp values due to greatest amount of applied water 416 mm a result of the sandier soils requiring more frequent irrigation events regarding to wpi the rainfed yield to all the sites were very similar however smaller yields compared to irrigated for tri basin the irrigated yield is 7 1 t ha 1 over rainfed and considering all the nrds 6 2 t ha 1 on average showing how the irrigation is important to maintain high yields and food security as tri basin presented the greater difference between irrigated and rainfed yields and also lower irrigation amount applied consequently had the greatest wpi values for both irrigation systems 3 06 for center pivot and 2 28 kg m 3 for furrow system respectively regarding to wpet between irrigation systems within the same nrds the values were very similar however analyzing the wp over all the years we can see that center pivot system always had greater wp and wpi for all the years and highest values in 2012 due to driest year tri basin again showed the greatest values for wp and wpi over the seasons reaching the maximum of 3 26 kg m 3 for center pivot in 2012 table 4 one of the ways to improve water management in nebraska according to the results obtained would be to invest in improved irrigation management by switching from furrow irrigation to center pivot irrigation system or improved irrigation scheduling the main barrier is the high cost of implementation however simulation analysis showed that up to 32 of the annual water volume allocated to irrigated maize in the region could be saved by switching current surface systems to pivot grassini et al 2011 and along the years of this study the number of the furrow system has decreased year by year similar results for wp were observed by carr et al 2016 in nebraska with values from 1 30 to 1 91 kg m 3 in irrigated areas considering nine years of analyses and revealed that in most cases the same level of corn yields could be achieved using less irrigation according to the comparison between the simulation results and the observations similar conclusions were made in a two year large scale study conducted in farmer s fields across nebraska by irmak et al 2012 in that study farmers used 32 34 more irrigation than the necessary amount the average applied irrigation rate and water productivities presented above can be considered an initial benchmark levels that producers could use as a target to aim at and improve their irrigation application rate and water productivity a full understanding of the spatial patterns of water productivity and setting benchmark level will support the effort to make irrigation water use more productive and sustainable 4 conclusion irrigation amounts used in the three nrds exceeded the crop water requirement amounts to achieve optimal corn yield rates in general center pivots showed better results for all study sites and seasons in 2012 drought year center pivots showed under irrigation for all nrds and furrow systems had similar results due mainly to capacity of water pumping to supply the crop water demand furrow system presented more variability than center pivots for the entire study period considering all nrd s central platte had the highest average applications depth difference between applied and modeled considering the entire period with 88 mm by furrow irrigation followed by tri basin with 115 mm center pivot had lower average applied water depth differences with 37 mm in central platte and 48 mm for tri basin due to higher irrigation depth difference and larger variability in the results central nebraska has a larger potential to improve water management especially with conversion of furrow systems to center pivot wpet was not different between irrigations systems however wp and wpi for center pivot was greater than furrow system due to better system water use efficiency reaching the maximum value of 1 37 and 3 06 kg m3 for wp and wpi respectively in tri basin according to the analyses it is not clear whether irrigator s behavior is influenced by the weather conditions or soil type variability however the large variability indicates potential for reducing pumping and saving energy if surface irrigation fields were converted to center pivot irrigation also irrigation scheduling can be improved monitoring soil moisture and including weather predictions would help to minimize the over application of irrigation water reducing pumping and saving energy this research applied over a large area a new reflectance based crop coefficient relationship to estimate water requirements for modern high yielding corn hybrids grown in nebraska following campos et al 2017 as this research was carried out in one of the most intensely irrigated areas of the world our findings might be a reference to irrigated corn worldwide when center pivot and furrow irrigation systems are used the current study showed for remote sensing techniques can used to estimate optimum irrigation requirement in large scales over one thousand fields and longer period the analysis also allowed to identify for both furrow and pivot systems to what extent the field level irrigation application differs to the net irrigation water requirement by doing such analysis the current work contributes to on how to improve the irrigation management with low cost and accurate estimate of net irrigation requirements declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

10813,prediction of vegetation transpiration t is of increasing importance in water resources management and agricultural practices in particular to facilitate precision irrigation traditional evapotranspiration et partitioning dual source modeling requires an extensive array of ground level parameters and needs model correction and calibration to attain model certainty in response a quick and low cost method is described to predict t using artificial intelligence ai modeling based on meteorological factors status of crop growth factors and soil parameters this study compares random forest rf and support vector regression svr in building ai models using three years 2014 2017 of continuous high resolution monitoring data in a cabbage farmland input data included air temperature ta solar radiation ra relative humidity rh vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed ws soil moisture sm vegetation height h and leaf area index lai the results show that soil surface resistance calculations by monte carlo iterative method and vegetation stomatal resistance calculations and carbon dioxide concentration and emission improve performance of the original shuttleworth wallace s w model in addition the ai model indicates ta and ra are essential inputs for both model types when there are sufficient observation data or only lacking soil and vegetation data the rf model is recommended for use when there are only limited data or lack of critical ta and ra data the svr model is the preferred model scientific guidance is provided for agriculture precision irrigation indicating which ai model can best estimate t and water demand for irrigation planning and water management keywords shuttleworth wallace model vegetation transpiration random forest support vector regression 1 introduction evapotranspiration et consists of the soil evaporation e and vegetation transpiration t which are important components of the surface energy cycle and the water cycle connecting soil vegetation and atmosphere fan and thomas 2018 zhao et al 2013 jung et al 2010 as a part of the regional et t is closely related to vegetation type crop growth soil factors and climatic factors where the latter have an impact on plant productivity and water use efficiency kite 2000 zhao et al 2013 previous studies have also shown that t can account for 40 90 of the total et and hence is the dominant part of et kang et al 2007 heilman et al 1994 li et al 2010 sauer et al 2007 therefore t plays an important role in guidance for precision agriculture irrigation direct measurement of t includes sap flow heat pulse and constant heat method čermák and deml 1973 green et al 2003 chambers denmead et al 1993 and biomass transpiration relationship method zegada lizarazu and berliner 2011 methods to estimate t include the shuttleworth wallace s w shuttleworth and wallace 1985 model energy and water balance enwatbal model lascano et al 1987 and soil water energy and transpiration sweat model daamen and simmonds 1996 among them the s w model is based on the improved penman formula to divide the surface into soil and vegetation layers and introduces five resistances to describe the processes by which water vapor reaches the reference height from the soil and the vegetation the s w model has been widely used to simulate the et of different vegetation types and has been validated over the years on field crops lund and soegaard 2003 kang et al 2007 row crops zegada lizarazu and berliner 2011 sauer et al 2007 orchards and vineyards li et al 2010 poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2012 and natural vegetation close et al 2012 cavanaugh et al 2011 however there remain a number of problems in the s w model including 1 there is large uncertainty in the determination of the soil surface resistance parameter 2 the vegetation stomata resistance does not take into account the effects of co2 concentration and emissions 3 only a few studies have verified the s w model for vegetable farmland ashktorab et al 1994 estimated e and t in a tomato farmland and showed that when vegetation coverages were 43 and 85 the e et values were between 0 28 and 0 05 respectively until now no report study has been identified that verified s w model in a cabbage farmland using the s w model to separate e and t requires large numbers of meteorological parameters soil parameters and vegetation parameters to calibrate the model a process which results in real hindrance and causes uncertainty in recent years with the development of ai technology ai has been successfully employed in many areas of application including ecological hydrology such as prediction of river sedimentation afan et al 2015 yitian and roy 2003 precipitation kumar et al 2005 nourani et al 2011 water quality hameed et al 2016 liu et al 2013a b and massive attention by research scholars in the prediction of et0 due to the highly nonlinear feature the artificial neural network ann model is well suited for et0 simulations after zanetti et al 2007 successful application of ann to simulate et0 ann has been extensively studied in the prediction of et0 based on observed station meteorological data such as air temperature radiation and wind speed data trajkovic et al 2003 used the ann forecasting of et0 at nisserbia and montenegro with good results zanetti et al 2007 tested ann for estimating the et0 as a function of the air temperature and found good results using just temperature data to estimate et0 traore et al 2010 evaluated the performance of back propagation neural network bpnn temperature based models in bobo dioulasso region the ann model requires adjustment of a large number of parameters including network topology regularization parameters the number of layers and number of neurons in each hidden layer in addition the learning process cannot be observed and the output results are difficult to interpret which influences the credibility and acceptability of the prediction results therefore many new ai models have been proposed tabari et al 2012 found adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis model gave better et0 estimates than the traditional regression models and meteorological data based models shiri et al 2012 compared the several ai models for estimating et0 with the results showing that the gene expression programming gep model had the best performance in recent years the random forest rf model because of its ability to process high dimensional data without the need for feature selection has prevented over fitting because of these characteristics of the rf model many research scholars have selected the rf model for et0 prediction for example feng et al 2017 used rf and generalized regression neural network grnn to predict et0 reporting that rf had some advantages than grnn gonzalo martin et al 2017 combined rf with remote sensing data and concluded that the daily et etd estimated by the rf would be feasible for real applications when the thermal band is not available the support vector machine svm was originally proposed by vapnik 1995 to solve the classification problem svms can also be applied to regression problems with the advantage that support vector regression svr model solves a convex quadratic programming problem and the global optimal solution will be obtained solving the local extremum problem in the ann kişi 2016 compared three ai models in prediction of et0 found least squares svr is the best model kişi 2009 investigated the accuracy of svm in prediction et0 revealing that svm could be employed successfully in modelling almost all previous studies have focused on ai models to predict et0 but there has been no identified research using ai to predict vegetation transpiration combined with meteorological data soil data and vegetation data in fact for the guidance of farmland level precision irrigation prediction of vegetation transpiration is more meaningful than et0 therefore the purpose of this research was to use the vegetation transpiration results simulation by the s w model to train the ai model and predict vegetation transpiration the article contains the following 1 verification of the accuracy of a modified s w model in a southern china vegetable farmland within the six planting seasons from 2014 to 2017 based on the eddy correlation measured et data 2 using vegetation transpiration data simulated by s w model training and verified the svr and rf model and comparison of the performance of the two models 3 the prediction accuracy of the two models is provided by inputting different types of data and recommendations of input data type for different scenarios when applying the two models 2 methods and materials 2 1 study site the experimental site

harvest date from field surveys were obtained 2 2 shuttleworth wallace model in the s w model total et is divided into two layers the soil layer and the vegetation layer the specific calculation method for the s w model can be found in shuttleworth and wallace 1985 and allen et al 1998 the key to separating et using s w model is the calculation of five resistance parameters 2 2 1 calculation

resistance r a s vegetation stomatal resistance was modeled using jarvis algorithm jarvis 1976 where the minimum r a s is defined and corrected for various environmental factors at present the research on farmland et does not take into account the synergistic effect of atmospheric co2 concentration and emissions since vegetation stomatal water transport is closely related to vegetation photosynthesis and this effect is negligible for vegetation water vapor diffusion the co2 concentration and emissions is taken into account and thereby jarvis model improved the specific expression is

mcbean 2014a matin and chelgani 2016 rf combines multiple classifications with regression trees to develop the advantages of classification regression trees in the process of constructing random forests the bootstrap method is used to randomize the use of variables columns and the use of data rows the new sample is classified using the trained set of classifiers and then the classification results for all classifiers are counted by the majority or the mean of the output the highest category is the final tag rf algorithm can effectively reduce bias and reduce variance rf regression only needs to set three parameters min sample leaf the number of decision trees and feature attributes we set the number of min sample leaf between 50 150 the number of decision trees to 100 the number of

only when the absolute value of the difference between f x and y is greater than ε the loss is calculated this means on both sides of f x a space band with width ε is constructed when the training

and analysis 3 1 s w model performances we calibrated the original and improved s w models with measured et data using four cropping seasons and validated the model with two other cropping seasons with measured et data shown in table 3 in the s w model there are five resistance parameters to be determined a large number of previous studies have shown that r a s and r s s are the more sensitive parameters in the five resistance parameters zhu et al 2013 leuning et al 2008 sellers et al 1992 so we focused on optimizing these two resistance parameters for r s s we used montero s iterative method estimates α and β as shown in 2 2 3 and table 2 the mean value at the three observation sites are α 8 6 and β 4 3 compared with other reported values our results were closest to kustas and norman 1999 for r a s the new model coupled the effect of co2 concentration and emissions and used four cropping season measured et data to calibrate the uncertainty parameter k results show that k can vary between 0 12 0 31 depending on the concentration and flux of co2 table 2 since the absorption peaks of h2o and co2 are both measured at about the wavelength of 2200 cm 1 the eddy related device can monitor h2o and co2 emissions simultaneously the coupled co2 model is very practical for the s w model based on the eddy correlation method figs 2 and 3 compare verification results of simulated daily et accuracy at three eddy covariance observation sites using modified and original s w model during six plant seasons the original s w model was used to simulate the total et in three

r2 0 80 rmse 0 41 mm day r2 0 78 rmse 0 46 mm day r2 0 81 rmse 0 39 mm day respectively shown in table 2 and fig 3 this indicates that the model performance has some improvement compared to the original s w model however the model has a slight overestimation in the five cropping seasons from 2015 to 2017 compared with the measured et slope was 1 03 1 02 1 1 1 06 1 03 respectively in the five cropping seasons table 3 previous studies have shown that when constant parameters are applied to the model systematic overestimation and underestimation may occur hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2011 as a result these overestimations are likely arising from five resistance parameters such as in calculating the r a s using the jarvis 1976 type model underestimating the maximum stomatal resistance r c max and thus resulting in an underestimate of r a s and lead to overestimation of et the ratio of vegetation transpiration to evapotranspiration t et reflects the utilization coefficient of farmland water the larger the t et the more water is transpired into the air through plant stomata and hence effectively utilized studies have shown that changes in t et are mainly affected by lai r a s and sm zhu et al 2013 kang et al 2007 hu et al 2009 identified the factors affecting t et change at different time scales the change of r a s caused by ra change plays a major role in controlling e et during a daily scale during the growing season scale the change of e et is affected by the combination of lai r a s and sm in our study according to the simulation results of t et the change of t et has a similar trend in all six growing seasons fig 4 because each planting season lasts for the same duration generally about four months the cabbage height reaches 45 cm at its maturity from s w model results the change of t et ranges from 0 to 1 with cabbage growth in the pre growth t et is between 0 21 and 0 38 0 lai 1 5 the growth medium t et is between 0 45 and 0 79 1 5 lai 3 and the growth end period is between 0 81 and 0 96 3 lai 4 and the average value is 0 78 for the six cropping seasons zhang et al 2011 used the isotope and eddy covariance method to estimate t et in a winter wheat field with the results showing that t et was between 0 60 0 83 agam et al 2012 calculated t et in a cotton field as 0 75 1 08 based on tseb model raz yaseef et al 2012 using the chamber method evaluated t et in forest reported the ratio of t et between 0 44 0 57 cavanaugh et al 2011 reported the t et with 0 42 0 47 for shrubland compared with previous studies we estimate the results of t et in the cabbage field are higher than the forest and shrubland closer to field crops and row crops 3 2 ai model performance rf can process high dimensional data without feature selection in addition when creating rf unqualified estimates are used for generalization errors and model generalization ability is strong the ability of machine learning algorithms to adapt to new samples the purpose of learning is to identify the laws behind the data for data other than the learning set with the same law the trained network may also give appropriate output called generalization ability finally due to rf model training independent trees the training speed is fast and easy to make as a parallelization method fig 5 shows the performance of six rf models at three sites it can be seen that the rf1 model of all data input can be selected as the best model for t estimation in the study region r2 0 95 rmse 0 22 mm day the second rank is the rf2 model lacking sm r2 0 86 rmse 0 31 mm day followed by rf3 model lacking ws vpd and rh r2 0 83 rmse 0 36 mm day and rf4 model lacking vegetation data r2 0 76 rmse 0 50 mm day the worst performance is rf5 model lacking ra r2 0 61 rmse 0 80 mm day and rf6 model lacking ta r2 0 43 rmse 1 23 mm day when the model lacks ra and ta the model is unable to predict t and t is significantly underestimated rf5 model and rf6 model underestimated 40 3 and 45 2 respectively these results are due to ta and ra being the dominant factor driving the t process and with the absence of these two types of data this may lead to underestimation when predicting et0 feng et al 2017 also arrived at the same conclusion they reported that the lack of ta and ra can lead to serious underestimation further from rf4 model missing vegetation data t will be overestimated by 16 3 indicating that vegetation data are important factors in partitioning the total et in contrast the effects of sm are relatively insignificant this may be due to the sm mainly affecting the size of e while the impact on t is relatively small finally the model performance is remains good even when there is a lack of vpd ws and rh r2 0 83 rmse 0 31 mm day indicating that the atmospheric related parameters are not very impactful to the model however some previous et0 studies have shown that ws is a more sensitive parameter traore et al 2010 kişi and ozturk 2007 the rf results show that the ws is not very sensitive which may be due to the vegetable farmland being not very dry because studies have shown that the ws has a greater impact on et0 only in arid windy areas therefore based on the above results we suggest when using the rf model to estimate t prioritizing the input of the ta ra and the vegetation data lai and vegetation height and then the sm atmospheric related parameters are considered fig 6 table 4 the key for using regression with svm is to choose the appropriate kernel function usually given a random data set obtained by simple mapping and then using more complex mapping if the data set is linearly separable the linear kernel function is generally used but if the data set is linearly inseparable the kernel function is obviously not working previous studies have shown that when linearly separable the linear kernel function is recommended and when the linearity is inseparable the rbf kernel function is used mohandes et al 2004 mohandes et al 2004 we compared the performance of three kernel functions in svr shown in table 3 and chose the radial basis function in the six svm models kişi and çimen 2009 mohandes et al 2004 based on statistical parameters table 5 the best performance was obtained using the svr1 model with all data input r2 0 92 rmse 0 24 mm day however different from the rf model the svr3 model lacking meteorological data performs better than the svr2 model r2 0 82 rmse 0 39 mm day vs r2 0 78 rmse 0 41 mm day similar to the rf model the svr4 model lacking vegetation data also showed some overestimation ranking fourth r2 0 69 rmse 0 62 mm day finally the svr5 model r2 0 52 rmse 0 98 mm day and the svr6 model r2 0 37 rmse 1 38 mm day which lacks both ta and ra data performs the worst and shows significant overestimation 3 3 comparison of rf and svr models comparison of the r2 values in the six planting seasons of daily t indicates that the rf model performs slightly better than the svr model in most of the plant seasons r2 with 0 84 of rf1 vs 0 83 of svr1 mae with 0 19 mm d of rf1vs 0 19 mm d of svr1 when the ws rh and vpd data are missing the two models perform quite well r2 with 0 79 of rf2 vs 0 79 of svr2 mae with 0 23 mm d of rf2vs 0 24 mm d of svr2 in addition the rf model performs better than the svr model when there is a lack of sm and vegetation data in the absence of ra and ta data both models are resulting in significant underestimation compared with s w model and the accuracies of the two models are very low but in this case the svr model outperforms the rf model r2 with 0 52 of rf5 vs 0 58 of svr5 mae with 0 81 mm d of rf5 vs 0 84 mm d of svr5 r2 with 0 46 of rf6 vs 0 50 of svr6 mae with 1 12 mm d of rf6 vs 0 92 mm d of svr6 therefore when there is sufficient observation data or only a lack of soil and vegetation data the use of the rf model is recommended in the case of missing or only short term a few months ra and ta data the svr is recommended however in this study the accuracy of both models is very low due to minimum data availability resulting in a serious underestimation figs 7 and fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 s w model performances and uncertainties the results from the s w model indicate that after improving the model the average r2 can be increased from 0 73 to 0 80 and rmse is reduced to less than 0 5 mm day which was better than most of reported studies e g gong et al 2019 zhao et al 2015 cleugh et al 2007 gong et al 2019 compared the performance of s w model and dual crop coefficient dual kc model in a drip irrigated tomato farmland the rmse of the s w model was between 0 61 0 63 mm d zhao et al 2015 used the s w model in et partition for a vineyard in arid region results show rmse was larger than 0 59 mm d the better performance of s w model in this study due to the two reasons 1 when calculating the r a s take into account the co2 concentration the influence of atmospheric co2 concentration is of great significance for revealing crop water consumption and improving water use efficiency several previous studies have proposed to couple the gross primary productivity gpp model considering co2 concentration into the s w model hu et al 2013 compared to this model our model is easier to operate and requires fewer parameters our proposed r a s correction method considering co2 concentration and emission shows a certain robustness in vegetable farmland but the uncertainty of the new model is concentrated on the correction parameter k therefore it is recommended to use the long term observation data to repeatedly correct k when using the model at present there are more than 500 eddy related observation sites in the world http fluxnet ornl gov so it is important to make full use of these data to further verify the performance of the proposed model on different underlying surfaces this greatly reduces the uncertainty of these parameters however there are still many uncertain parameters in the s w model such as the determination of maximum stomatal resistance r c max where the jarvis model is very empirical and select of extinction coefficient σ b still have many arguments e g krinner et al 2005 sitch et al 2003 in the future the model could be further improved by determination of constant and empirical parameters since these parameters still has significant uncertainty from the t et results the t et in cabbage farmland was higher than forest and shrubland closer to field crops and row crops and showed strong relationship with lai this conclusion is the consistent with previous studies e g stoy et al 2008 indicated seasonal variation of t et was mainly governed by ra vpd and lai huang et al 2010 found ta vpd and lai are both of the sensitive parameters to t et the ta ra vpd and lai will affect the size of r a s and thus affect the t et the higher and widely ranging change of t et in cabbage farmland due to the higher planting density and relatively short growing season make for faster speed of growth usually three months however it is necessary to further analyze the effect of different parameter combinations to t et and develop a deep understanding of the t et in cabbage farmland which is still lacking in previous studies 4 2 ai model performances and uncertainties in general t involves photosynthesis and respiration of vegetation is a complex bio hydrological process closely related to vegetation types vegetation growth stages meteorological and environmental factors allen et al 1998 zhao et al 2013 traditional physical models provide a very good description of the water vapor transport process but these parameterization schemes are too complex and need large numbers of ground observation data and limit their application in practice our research proves that it is feasible to use ai models after training to predict t using only a limited set of meteorological parameters this provides new possibilities for the study of vegetation transpiration and et partitioning which are very practical in some developing countries which lack ground observation in general both rf and svr have some advantages and disadvantages rf may have some advantages for data sets with more features such as 8 features in this study while rf will overfit in some noisy classification or regression problems but svr solves these problems very well the svr can select the key vector in the training process and remove the non support vectors so this makes svr very suitable for noisy problems while the disadvantage of svr is sensitive to missing data and it s also necessary to select the correct kernel function and require a lot of computing resources therefore in practical applications of the model in view of the difference performance between the two models in the difference scenarios it is strongly recommended to compare the performance of the two models to select the appropriate model in different situations in addition both rf and svr results indicate that ra and ta are more important factors in cabbage farmland which is different from some other scholars conclusions in et0 this is mainly due to two reasons 1 t and et0 have completely different control factors t has a stronger relationship with the vegetation respiration process so it s more sensitive to ra ta and lai while et0 characterizes the diffusion process of water vapor evaporation and is more closely related to aerodynamic factors such as rh and ws 2 different climate regions and surface condition lead to different influencing factors previously study found that et0 is more sensitive to ws and usually occurs in in arid regions traore et al 2010 kişi and ozturk 2007 but this study region is located in subtropical monsoon climate and surface condition is vegetable farmland therefore these reasons lead to differences in the sensitivity of ai model results to different input parameters with previous et0 study subsequent research can further analyze the sensitive parameters of ai model to predict t of other crop types 5 conclusions this study described an improved s w model using a new parameterization scheme to partition the e and t of a vegetable farmland in southern china between 2014 and 2017 it s also the first research attempt to predict t using ai models the conclusions are as follows 1 the improved r a s and r s s calculation module has an effect on the simulation of the total et the results from the s w model indicate that after improvement the average r2 can be increased from 0 73 to 0 80 and average rmse can be reduced from 0 54 mm day to 0 41 mm day in the six plant seasons 2 for the rf model the best simulation results are full input of vegetation data soil data and meteorological data the second best simulation results occurred when sm data were not available while lack of ws rh and vpd data ranked third lack of vegetation data will cause overestimation of t ranked fourth and the lack of ta and ra data can lead to significant underestimation and for this latter case the model performs very poorly for the svr model when the rh ws and vpd data are lacking the performance is better when only lacking sm data the results of the two models also indicate that basic meteorological data ta and ra are essential when using ai models to predict t and vegetation data is equally important while soil data and atmospheric data are relatively unimportant meaning the lack of these data still can provide reliable results in the modeling 3 through comparison between the two models the rf model is recommended when the input data are relatively complete or only lack soil and vegetation data when there is absence of atmospheric data and basic meteorological data ta and ra the svr model performs better and is

10813,prediction of vegetation transpiration t is of increasing importance in water resources management and agricultural practices in particular to facilitate precision irrigation traditional evapotranspiration et partitioning dual source modeling requires an extensive array of ground level parameters and needs model correction and calibration to attain model certainty in response a quick and low cost method is described to predict t using artificial intelligence ai modeling based on meteorological factors status of crop growth factors and soil parameters this study compares random forest rf and support vector regression svr in building ai models using three years 2014 2017 of continuous high resolution monitoring data in a cabbage farmland input data included air temperature ta solar radiation ra relative humidity rh vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed ws soil moisture sm vegetation height h and leaf area index lai the results show that soil surface resistance calculations by monte carlo iterative method and vegetation stomatal resistance calculations and carbon dioxide concentration and emission improve performance of the original shuttleworth wallace s w model in addition the ai model indicates ta and ra are essential inputs for both model types when there are sufficient observation data or only lacking soil and vegetation data the rf model is recommended for use when there are only limited data or lack of critical ta and ra data the svr model is the preferred model scientific guidance is provided for agriculture precision irrigation indicating which ai model can best estimate t and water demand for irrigation planning and water management keywords shuttleworth wallace model vegetation transpiration random forest support vector regression 1 introduction evapotranspiration et consists of the soil evaporation e and vegetation transpiration t which are important components of the surface energy cycle and the water cycle connecting soil vegetation and atmosphere fan and thomas 2018 zhao et al 2013 jung et al 2010 as a part of the regional et t is closely related to vegetation type crop growth soil factors and climatic factors where the latter have an impact on plant productivity and water use efficiency kite 2000 zhao et al 2013 previous studies have also shown that t can account for 40 90 of the total et and hence is the dominant part of et kang et al 2007 heilman et al 1994 li et al 2010 sauer et al 2007 therefore t plays an important role in guidance for precision agriculture irrigation direct measurement of t includes sap flow heat pulse and constant heat method čermák and deml 1973 green et al 2003 chambers denmead et al 1993 and biomass transpiration relationship method zegada lizarazu and berliner 2011 methods to estimate t include the shuttleworth wallace s w shuttleworth and wallace 1985 model energy and water balance enwatbal model lascano et al 1987 and soil water energy and transpiration sweat model daamen and simmonds 1996 among them the s w model is based on the improved penman formula to divide the surface into soil and vegetation layers and introduces five resistances to describe the processes by which water vapor reaches the reference height from the soil and the vegetation the s w model has been widely used to simulate the et of different vegetation types and has been validated over the years on field crops lund and soegaard 2003 kang et al 2007 row crops zegada lizarazu and berliner 2011 sauer et al 2007 orchards and vineyards li et al 2010 poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2012 and natural vegetation close et al 2012 cavanaugh et al 2011 however there remain a number of problems in the s w model including 1 there is large uncertainty in the determination of the soil surface resistance parameter 2 the vegetation stomata resistance does not take into account the effects of co2 concentration and emissions 3 only a few studies have verified the s w model for vegetable farmland ashktorab et al 1994 estimated e and t in a tomato farmland and showed that when vegetation coverages were 43 and 85 the e et values were between 0 28 and 0 05 respectively until now no report study has been identified that verified s w model in a cabbage farmland using the s w model to separate e and t requires large numbers of meteorological parameters soil parameters and vegetation parameters to calibrate the model a process which results in real hindrance and causes uncertainty in recent years with the development of ai technology ai has been successfully employed in many areas of application including ecological hydrology such as prediction of river sedimentation afan et al 2015 yitian and roy 2003 precipitation kumar et al 2005 nourani et al 2011 water quality hameed et al 2016 liu et al 2013a b and massive attention by research scholars in the prediction of et0 due to the highly nonlinear feature the artificial neural network ann model is well suited for et0 simulations after zanetti et al 2007 successful application of ann to simulate et0 ann has been extensively studied in the prediction of et0 based on observed station meteorological data such as air temperature radiation and wind speed data trajkovic et al 2003 used the ann forecasting of et0 at nisserbia and montenegro with good results zanetti et al 2007 tested ann for estimating the et0 as a function of the air temperature and found good results using just temperature data to estimate et0 traore et al 2010 evaluated the performance of back propagation neural network bpnn temperature based models in bobo dioulasso region the ann model requires adjustment of a large number of parameters including network topology regularization parameters the number of layers and number of neurons in each hidden layer in addition the learning process cannot be observed and the output results are difficult to interpret which influences the credibility and acceptability of the prediction results therefore many new ai models have been proposed tabari et al 2012 found adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis model gave better et0 estimates than the traditional regression models and meteorological data based models shiri et al 2012 compared the several ai models for estimating et0 with the results showing that the gene expression programming gep model had the best performance in recent years the random forest rf model because of its ability to process high dimensional data without the need for feature selection has prevented over fitting because of these characteristics of the rf model many research scholars have selected the rf model for et0 prediction for example feng et al 2017 used rf and generalized regression neural network grnn to predict et0 reporting that rf had some advantages than grnn gonzalo martin et al 2017 combined rf with remote sensing data and concluded that the daily et etd estimated by the rf would be feasible for real applications when the thermal band is not available the support vector machine svm was originally proposed by vapnik 1995 to solve the classification problem svms can also be applied to regression problems with the advantage that support vector regression svr model solves a convex quadratic programming problem and the global optimal solution will be obtained solving the local extremum problem in the ann kişi 2016 compared three ai models in prediction of et0 found least squares svr is the best model kişi 2009 investigated the accuracy of svm in prediction et0 revealing that svm could be employed successfully in modelling almost all previous studies have focused on ai models to predict et0 but there has been no identified research using ai to predict vegetation transpiration combined with meteorological data soil data and vegetation data in fact for the guidance of farmland level precision irrigation prediction of vegetation transpiration is more meaningful than et0 therefore the purpose of this research was to use the vegetation transpiration results simulation by the s w model to train the ai model and predict vegetation transpiration the article contains the following 1 verification of the accuracy of a modified s w model in a southern china vegetable farmland within the six planting seasons from 2014 to 2017 based on the eddy correlation measured et data 2 using vegetation transpiration data simulated by s w model training and verified the svr and rf model and comparison of the performance of the two models 3 the prediction accuracy of the two models is provided by inputting different types of data and recommendations of input data type for different scenarios when applying the two models 2 methods and materials 2 1 study site the experimental site

harvest date from field surveys were obtained 2 2 shuttleworth wallace model in the s w model total et is divided into two layers the soil layer and the vegetation layer the specific calculation method for the s w model can be found in shuttleworth and wallace 1985 and allen et al 1998 the key to separating et using s w model is the calculation of five resistance parameters 2 2 1 calculation

resistance r a s vegetation stomatal resistance was modeled using jarvis algorithm jarvis 1976 where the minimum r a s is defined and corrected for various environmental factors at present the research on farmland et does not take into account the synergistic effect of atmospheric co2 concentration and emissions since vegetation stomatal water transport is closely related to vegetation photosynthesis and this effect is negligible for vegetation water vapor diffusion the co2 concentration and emissions is taken into account and thereby jarvis model improved the specific expression is as follows 10 r s c r c max f 1 f 2 1 f 3 1 f 4 1 f 5 1 11 f 1 1 f f r c min r c max where 12 f 1 1 r s r sl lai in the expression 10 r c max is the maximum stomatal resistance value crow et al 2008

mcbean 2014a matin and chelgani 2016 rf combines multiple classifications with regression trees to develop the advantages of classification regression trees in the process of constructing random forests the bootstrap method is used to randomize the use of variables columns and the use of data rows the new sample is classified using the trained set of classifiers and then the classification results for all classifiers are counted by the majority or the mean of the output the highest category is the final tag rf algorithm can effectively reduce bias and reduce variance rf regression only needs to set three parameters min sample leaf the number of decision trees and feature attributes we set the number of min sample leaf between 50 150 the number of decision trees to 100 the number of feature attributes to 8 and used matlab7 0 software to train and verify the model for a given classifier set h1 x h2 x hk x the marginal functions can be written as 17 m g x y a v k i h k x y max j y a v k i h k x j in 17 i is the indicator function each tree will give a final result and the final prediction is determined by the average of the results from all trees therefore a larger boundary

years e g harvey and mcbean 2014b for the regression problem given the training samples d x1 y1 x2 y2 xn yn y r where xi is the input vector yi is the output value of interest is to find an f x as close as possible to y and determine the values of w and b in this model the loss is zero when f x is exactly the same as y but svr assumes that we can accept a maximum ε deviation between f x and y only when the absolute value of the difference between f x and y is greater than ε the loss is calculated this means on both sides of f x a space band with width ε is constructed when the training sample is falling in the space band this sample considered the correct prediction in our model the input vector xi represents ta ra rh vpd ws h lai and sm while the target value yi represents the t

and analysis 3 1 s w model performances we calibrated the original and improved s w models with measured et data using four cropping seasons and validated the model with two other cropping seasons with measured et data shown in table 3 in the s w model there are five resistance parameters to be determined a large number of previous studies have shown that r a s and r s s are the more sensitive parameters in the five resistance parameters zhu et al 2013 leuning et al 2008 sellers et al 1992 so we focused on optimizing these two resistance parameters for r s s we used montero s iterative method estimates α and β as shown in 2 2 3 and table 2 the mean value at the three observation sites are α 8 6 and β 4 3 compared with other reported values our results were closest to kustas and norman 1999 for r a s the new model coupled the effect of co2 concentration and emissions and used four cropping season measured et data to calibrate the uncertainty parameter k results show that k can vary between 0 12 0 31 depending on the concentration and flux of co2 table 2 since the absorption peaks of h2o and co2 are both measured at about the wavelength of 2200 cm 1 the eddy related device can monitor h2o and co2 emissions simultaneously the coupled co2 model is very practical for the s w model based on the eddy correlation method figs 2 and 3 compare verification results of simulated daily et accuracy at three eddy covariance observation sites using modified and original s w model during six plant seasons the original s w model was used to simulate the total et in three plots of the six planting seasons statistical parameters with r2 0 71 rmse 0 59 mm day r2 0 77 rmse 0 46 mm day r2 0 70 rmse 0 61 mm day r2 0 75 rmse 0 51 mm day r2 0 71 rmse 0 59 mm day r2 0 77 rmse 0 47 mm day respectively shown in table 2 and fig 2 while the result shows statistical parameters of improved s w model with r2 0 82 rmse 0 37 mm day r2 0 85 rmse 0 32 mm day r2 0 75 rmse 0 50 mm day r2 0 80 rmse 0 41 mm day r2 0 78 rmse 0 46 mm day r2 0 81 rmse 0 39 mm day respectively shown in table 2 and fig 3 this indicates that the model performance has some improvement compared to the original s w model however the model has a slight overestimation in the five cropping seasons from 2015 to 2017 compared with the measured et slope was 1 03 1 02 1 1 1 06 1 03 respectively in the five cropping seasons table 3 previous studies have shown that when constant parameters are applied to the model systematic overestimation and underestimation may occur hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2011 as a result these overestimations are likely arising from five resistance parameters such as in calculating the r a s using the jarvis 1976 type model underestimating the maximum stomatal resistance r c max and thus resulting in an underestimate of r a s and lead to overestimation of et the ratio of vegetation transpiration to evapotranspiration t et reflects the utilization coefficient of farmland water the larger the t et the more water is transpired into the air through plant stomata and hence effectively utilized studies have shown that changes in t et are mainly affected by lai r a s and sm zhu et al 2013 kang et al 2007 hu et al 2009 identified the factors affecting t et change at different time scales the change of r a s caused by ra change plays a major role in controlling e et during a daily scale during the growing season scale the change of e et is affected by the combination of lai r a s and sm in our study according to the simulation results of t et the change of t et has a similar trend in all six growing seasons fig 4 because each planting season lasts for the same duration generally about four months the cabbage height reaches 45 cm at its maturity from s w model results the change of t et ranges from 0 to 1 with cabbage growth in the pre growth t et is between 0 21 and 0 38 0 lai 1 5 the growth medium t et is between 0 45 and 0 79 1 5 lai 3 and the growth end period is between 0 81 and 0 96 3 lai 4 and the average value is 0 78 for the six cropping seasons zhang et al 2011 used the isotope and eddy covariance method to estimate t et in a winter wheat field with the results showing that t et was between 0 60 0 83 agam et al 2012 calculated t et in a cotton field as 0 75 1 08 based on tseb model raz yaseef et al 2012 using the chamber method evaluated t et in forest reported the ratio of t et between 0 44 0 57 cavanaugh et al 2011 reported the t et with 0 42 0 47 for shrubland compared with previous studies we estimate the results of t et in the cabbage field are higher than the forest and shrubland closer to field crops and row crops 3 2 ai model performance rf can process high dimensional data without feature selection in addition when creating rf unqualified estimates are used for generalization errors and model generalization ability is strong the ability of machine learning algorithms to adapt to new samples the purpose of learning is to identify the laws behind the data for data other than the learning set with the same law the trained network may also give appropriate output called generalization ability finally due to rf model training independent trees the training speed is fast and easy to make as a parallelization method fig 5 shows the performance of six rf models at three sites it can be seen that the rf1 model of all data input can be selected as the best model for t estimation in the study region r2 0 95 rmse 0 22 mm day the second rank is the rf2 model lacking sm r2 0 86 rmse 0 31 mm day followed by rf3 model lacking ws vpd and rh r2 0 83 rmse 0 36 mm day and rf4 model lacking vegetation data r2 0 76 rmse 0 50 mm day the worst performance is rf5 model lacking ra r2 0 61 rmse 0 80 mm day and rf6 model lacking ta r2 0 43 rmse 1 23 mm day when the model lacks ra and ta the model is unable to predict t and t is significantly underestimated rf5 model and rf6 model underestimated 40 3 and 45 2 respectively these results are due to ta and ra being the dominant factor driving the t process and with the absence of these two types of data this may lead to underestimation when predicting et0 feng et al 2017 also arrived at the same conclusion they reported that the lack of ta and ra can lead to serious underestimation further from rf4 model missing vegetation data t will be overestimated by 16 3 indicating that vegetation data are important factors in partitioning the total et in contrast the effects of sm are relatively insignificant this may be due to the sm mainly affecting the size of e while the impact on t is relatively small finally the model performance is remains good even when there is a lack of vpd ws and rh r2 0 83 rmse 0 31 mm day indicating that the atmospheric related parameters are not very impactful to the model however some previous et0 studies have shown that ws is a more sensitive parameter traore et al 2010 kişi and ozturk 2007 the rf results show that the ws is not very sensitive which may be due to the vegetable farmland being not very dry because studies have shown that the ws has a greater impact on et0 only in arid windy areas therefore based on the above results we suggest when using the rf model to estimate t prioritizing the input of the ta ra and the vegetation data lai and vegetation height and then the sm atmospheric related parameters are considered fig 6 table 4 the key for using regression with svm is to choose the appropriate kernel function usually given a random data set obtained by simple mapping and then using more complex mapping if the data set is linearly separable the linear kernel function is generally used but if the data set is linearly inseparable the kernel function is obviously not working previous studies have shown that when linearly separable the linear kernel function is recommended and when the linearity is inseparable the rbf kernel function is used mohandes et al 2004 mohandes et al 2004 we compared the performance of three kernel functions in svr shown in table 3 and chose the radial basis function in the six svm models kişi and çimen 2009 mohandes et al 2004 based on statistical parameters table 5 the best performance was obtained using the svr1 model with all data input r2 0 92 rmse 0 24 mm day however different from the rf model the svr3 model lacking meteorological data performs better than the svr2 model r2 0 82 rmse 0 39 mm day vs r2 0 78 rmse 0 41 mm day similar to the rf model the svr4 model lacking vegetation data also showed some overestimation ranking fourth r2 0 69 rmse 0 62 mm day finally the svr5 model r2 0 52 rmse 0 98 mm day and the svr6 model r2 0 37 rmse 1 38 mm day which lacks both ta and ra data performs the worst and shows significant overestimation 3 3 comparison of rf and svr models comparison of the r2 values in the six planting seasons of daily t indicates that the rf model performs slightly better than the svr model in most of the plant seasons r2 with 0 84 of rf1 vs 0 83 of svr1 mae with 0 19 mm d of rf1vs 0 19 mm d of svr1 when the ws rh and vpd data are missing the two models perform quite well r2 with 0 79 of rf2 vs 0 79 of svr2 mae with 0 23 mm d of rf2vs 0 24 mm d of svr2 in addition the rf model performs better than the svr model when there is a lack of sm and vegetation data in the absence of ra and ta data both models are resulting in significant underestimation compared with s w model and the accuracies of the two models are very low but in this case the svr model outperforms the rf model r2 with 0 52 of rf5 vs 0 58 of svr5 mae with 0 81 mm d of rf5 vs 0 84 mm d of svr5 r2 with 0 46 of rf6 vs 0 50 of svr6 mae with 1 12 mm d of rf6 vs 0 92 mm d of svr6 therefore when there is sufficient observation data or only a lack of soil and vegetation data the use of the rf model is recommended in the case of missing or only short term a few months ra and ta data the svr is recommended however in this study the accuracy of both models is very low due to minimum data availability resulting in a serious underestimation figs 7 and fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 s w model performances and uncertainties the results from the s w model indicate that after improving the model the average r2 can be increased from 0 73 to 0 80 and rmse is reduced to less than 0 5 mm day which was better than most of reported studies e g gong et al 2019 zhao et al 2015 cleugh et al 2007 gong et al 2019 compared the performance of s w model and dual crop coefficient dual kc model in a drip irrigated tomato farmland the rmse of the s w model was between 0 61 0 63 mm d zhao et al 2015 used the s w model in et partition for a vineyard in arid region results show rmse was larger than 0 59 mm d the better performance of s w model in this study due to the two reasons 1 when calculating the r a s take into account the co2 concentration the influence of atmospheric co2 concentration is of great significance for revealing crop water consumption and improving water use efficiency several previous studies have proposed to couple the gross primary productivity gpp model considering co2 concentration into the s w model hu et al 2013 compared to this model our model is easier to operate and requires fewer parameters our proposed r a s correction method considering co2 concentration and emission shows a certain robustness in vegetable farmland but the uncertainty of the new model is concentrated on the correction parameter k therefore it is recommended to use the long term observation data to repeatedly correct k when using the model at present there are more than 500 eddy related observation sites in the world http fluxnet ornl gov so it is important to make full use of these data to further verify the performance of the proposed model on different underlying surfaces this greatly reduces the uncertainty of these parameters however there are still many uncertain parameters in the s w model such as the determination of maximum stomatal resistance r c max where the jarvis model is very empirical and select of extinction coefficient σ b still have many arguments e g krinner et al 2005 sitch et al 2003 in the future the model could be further improved by determination of constant and empirical parameters since these parameters still has significant uncertainty from the t et results the t et in cabbage farmland was higher than forest and shrubland closer to field crops and row crops and showed strong relationship with lai this conclusion is the consistent with previous studies e g stoy et al 2008 indicated seasonal variation of t et was mainly governed by ra vpd and lai huang et al 2010 found ta vpd and lai are both of the sensitive parameters to t et the ta ra vpd and lai will affect the size of r a s and thus affect the t et the higher and widely ranging change of t et in cabbage farmland due to the higher planting density and relatively short growing season make for faster speed of growth usually three months however it is necessary to further analyze the effect of different parameter combinations to t et and develop a deep understanding of the t et in cabbage farmland which is still lacking in previous studies 4 2 ai model performances and uncertainties in general t involves photosynthesis and respiration of vegetation is a complex bio hydrological process closely related to vegetation types vegetation growth stages meteorological and environmental factors allen et al 1998 zhao et al 2013 traditional physical models provide a very good description of the water vapor transport process but these parameterization schemes are too complex and need large numbers of ground observation data and limit their application in practice our research proves that it is feasible to use ai models after training to predict t using only a limited set of meteorological parameters this provides new possibilities for the study of vegetation transpiration and et partitioning which are very practical in some developing countries which lack ground observation in general both rf and svr have some advantages and disadvantages rf may have some advantages for data sets with more features such as 8 features in this study while rf will overfit in some noisy classification or regression problems but svr solves these problems very well the svr can select the key vector in the training process and remove the non support vectors so this makes svr very suitable for noisy problems while the disadvantage of svr is sensitive to missing data and it s also necessary to select the correct kernel function and require a lot of computing resources therefore in practical applications of the model in view of the difference performance between the two models in the difference scenarios it is strongly recommended to compare the performance of the two models to select the appropriate model in different situations in addition both rf and svr results indicate that ra and ta are more important factors in cabbage farmland which is different from some other scholars conclusions in et0 this is mainly due to two reasons 1 t and et0 have completely different control factors t has a stronger relationship with the vegetation respiration process so it s more sensitive to ra ta and lai while et0 characterizes the diffusion process of water vapor evaporation and is more closely related to aerodynamic factors such as rh and ws 2 different climate regions and surface condition lead to different influencing factors previously study found that et0 is more sensitive to ws and usually occurs in in arid regions traore et al 2010 kişi and ozturk 2007 but this study region is located in subtropical monsoon climate and surface condition is vegetable farmland therefore these reasons lead to differences in the sensitivity of ai model results to different input parameters with previous et0 study subsequent research can further analyze the sensitive parameters of ai model to predict t of other crop types 5 conclusions this study described an improved s w model using a new parameterization scheme to partition the e and t of a vegetable farmland in southern china between 2014 and 2017 it s also the first research attempt to predict t using ai models the conclusions are as follows 1 the improved r a s and r s s calculation module has an effect on the simulation of the total et the results from the s w model indicate that after improvement the average r2 can be increased from 0 73 to 0 80 and average rmse can be reduced from 0 54 mm day to 0 41 mm day in the six plant seasons 2 for the rf model the best simulation results are full input of vegetation data soil data and meteorological data the second best simulation results occurred when sm data were not available while lack of ws rh and vpd data ranked third lack of vegetation data will cause overestimation of t ranked fourth and the lack of ta and ra data can lead to significant underestimation and for this latter case the model performs very poorly for the svr model when the rh ws and vpd data are lacking the performance is better when only lacking sm data the results of the two models also indicate that basic meteorological data ta and ra are essential when using ai models to predict t and vegetation data is equally important while soil data and atmospheric data are relatively unimportant meaning the lack of these data still can provide reliable results in the modeling 3 through comparison between the two models the rf model is recommended when the input data are relatively complete or only lack soil and vegetation data when there is absence of atmospheric data and basic meteorological data ta and ra the svr model performs better and is

quality of lettuce in the climate chamber were optimal when the climate chamber temperature was 20 c these results provide conditions viable for increased yield and quality of lettuce keywords aerated irrigation warming irrigation yield quality relationship dry matter accumulation intelligent climate incubator 1 introduction water fertilizer gas and heat are essential conditions for crop growth maintaining proper soil moisture fertility gas permeability and temperature is necessary for any period of crop growth lettuce is rich in nutrients such as beta carotene and vitamin c and chinese people have generally preferred vegetables it has become the goal of many researchers to improve the yield and quality of lettuce at the same time lettuce has become the object of many scholars because of its short growth cycle at present the research on lettuce in china and globally focuses on the effects of led assisted illumination nutrient solutions and matrix techniques on growth yield and quality the effects of dissolved oxygen and temperature on the growth photosynthesis yield and quality of lettuce in different irrigation waters have not been reported in the literature however there is some evidence in the literature different dissolved oxygen levels in different irrigation waters as well as the influence of temperature on other crops in terms of irrigation volume and quality research the soluble sugar and protein contents of lettuce increase gradually with a decrease in the lower limit of irrigation for example the vitamin c content of lettuce treated with 50 field water capacity has been been found to be significantly higher than that of other treatments pei and bie 2008 in terms of light filling and quality research research of lettuce has primarily focused on plant factories focusing mainly on artificial light light intensity and illumination time for example liu et al 2019b found that the yield of lettuce in the middle and lower layers of the three dimensional cultivation of plant factories increased by 35 80 and 24 70 dry matter increased by 39 70 and 36 7 the soluble protein content increased by 9 42 and 9 24 and the nitrate content decreased by 10 75 and 6 75 compared with non complementing light ma et al 2017b also clarified that the crude protein and soluble sugar contents of lettuce of plant factories were highest under the semi overlapping mode of 850 nm infrared light and the vitamin c content was the highest and nitrate content was the lowest under 930 nm supplemental light sl alone liu et al 2019a revealed that by increasing the light intensity the soluble sugar soluble protein and carotenoid contents increased increasing the light intensity prolongs the illumination time and can promote the utilization efficiency of n and p elements and improve the quality of lettuce chen et al 2017 used alternating red and blue light to intentionally adjust the growth and quality of lettuce the growth and yield of lettuce increased by 32 104 using auxiliary lighting regardless of the quality of illumination zhang 2019 temperature and photoperiod have been shown to have significant effects on the leaf area of lettuce hang 2019 fu et al 2017 showed that illumination intensity and nitrogen had significant interactions with the photosynthesis yield and quality of lettuce the dry biomass of lettuce was the largest when the illumination was 220 μmol m 2 s 1 elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide either alone or combined with short term salt stress can improve the nutritional quality of lettuce by increasing the concentration of certain minerals and antioxidants and even increase yield pérez lópez et al 2015 in terms of nutrient solution and quality research compared with conventional fertilizer microbial fertilizer has been shown to improve the quality of lettuce in three cycles stamford et al 2019 research on lettuce has mainly focused on the effects of led assisted illumination nutrient solutions and matrix techniques on the growth yield and quality of lettuce in the field of aerated irrigation research in recent years aerated irrigation has gradually become a good choice for improving vegetable yield and quality the existing aerated irrigation research has mainly focused on the effects on vegetable quality yield and growth as well as soil nutrients for example zhu et al 2017a considered that the contents of lycopene vitamin c and soluble sugar and the sugar acid ratio in tomato fruit increased significantly by 37 73 31 43 32 30 and 45 64 respectively compared with no aerated subsurface drip irrigation ma et al 2017a obtained the best combination scheme through stereo planting of rapeseed in greenhouses under the following conditions 7 4 mg l 1 dissolved oxygen and an irrigation quota of 45 m3 hm 2 in addition compared with subsurface drip irrigation soil microbial respiration increased significantly by 11 5 p 0 05 zhu et al 2017b furthermore aerated irrigation ai has been shown to be beneficial for increasing crop yield and wue mean increases of 19 3 and 17 9 respectively compared to no aerated treatment du et al 2018 liu et al 2019c showed that micro and nanobubble water oxidation significantly increased tomato and cucumber yield iwue and fruit quality p 0 05 the yield irrigation water use efficiency vitamin c and soluble sugar of tomatoes increased by 16 9 16 9 17 7 and 39 2 while those for cucumbers were 22 1 22 1 16 7 and 19 4 respectively compared with no gas addition moreover pendergast et al 2019 found that the yield of chickpeas with aerated subsurface drip irrigation was much higher than the average yield of chickpeas over 7 years 2008 2015 compared with irrigation by other means and aeration irrigation resulted in significantly improved wue aerated irrigation has been shown to significantly increase tomato yield du et al 2019 ventilation can promote the migration of potassium from the roots to the leaves and reduce the sodium concentration in the roots of sensitive rootstocks paudel et al 2019 irrigation and specific soil aeration practices can balance crop yields and greenhouse gas reduction in greenhouse vegetable fields chen and yang 2018 additionally zhao et al 2018 showed that rhizosphere ventilation and urea application had a certain promoting effect on soil absorption taking into account that urea cannot be used for aeration irrigation when used as nitrogen fertilizer according to niu et al 2013 rhizosphere ventilation ventilation irrigation and post irrigation ventilation have a positive impact on crop growth and yield wang et al 2018 revealed that under the same fertilization level lai dry dm seed cotton yield partial factor productivity pfp and economic benefits increased with an increasing volume of irrigation water the combination of micro nanofoamer and 28 gas stone aerator pumps is the best when only considering the optimal effect of dissolved oxygen ouyang et al 2019 prior research on aerated irrigation has mainly focused on crops such as tomatoes chickpeas and cucumbers and the effects of aerated irrigation on the soil environment it can be seen that research on lettuce by aerated irrigation has not been reported furthermore warming irrigation is another good choice to improve the yield and quality of vegetables there have been a few studies on the effects of warming irrigation on crops first water irrigation at a temperature of 35 c has been shown to be optimal for tomato seedling growth bai et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 showed that the yield under irrigation water heating filming and filming conditions of the soil irrigation water heating treatment increased by 3 9 10 6 and 11 1 respectively second irrigation water temperatures of 25 30 c have been shown to be suitable for maintaining the effect of integrated irrigation water temperature on the growth yield and photosynthesis of brassica campestris l zhang et al 2017 compared with well water normal temperature irrigation well water warming irrigation can increase the net photosynthetic rate of rice by 22 2 and the leaf area index by 14 7 xu et al 2018 similarly no studies have been conducted on how warming irrigation affects lettuce finally professor tian juncang from ningxia university conducted research on water fertilizer gas heat coupled irrigation on greenhouse cucumber zhang 2017 tomato ma 2017 watermelon ouyang 2018 melon deng 2018 and pepper zhao et al 2019 plants through an orthogonal design and quadratic general rotation the design revealed optimal combination schemes however professor tian indicated that although the greenhouse test conditions are easier to control than outdoor field tests there is still no intelligent climate incubator condition that is easy to control and the test results in a smart climate incubator should be more accurate and reliable briefly global research on lettuce has mainly focused on the effects of led light nutrient solution and matrix techniques on the growth yield and quality of lettuce experimental research related to aerated irrigation and warming irrigation have mainly examined tomato cucumber watermelon melon and other crops due to the unsuitable control of external conditions such as meteorological factors and environmental factors of outdoor and greenhouse environments and to more accurately study the effects of aerated irrigation and warming irrigation on lettuce three intelligent climate incubators were tested under the same external environmental conditions the effects and mechanisms related to different dissolved oxygen concentrations and temperatures on the growth photosynthesis yield and quality of lettuce were analyzed this work revealed the heat demand law of lettuce and determined the optimal dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature of lettuce to improve the quality and efficiency of lettuce growth our results provide a new idea for many scholars to study the quality and efficiency of vegetables 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out in the intelligent tri color climate incubator of gongxing building wencui campus ningxia university from december 25 2018 to january 22 2019 the test area is located in yinchuan city ningxia china 38 30 n 106 08 e at an elevation of 1111 5 m asl the test area is in a

a comparison design was used in the experiment the dissolved oxygen o concentration and temperature in the climate chamber t were established each factor was set at three levels and each treatment was repeated three times resulting in a total of 18 treatments the purpose of the experiment was to study the effects of different dissolved oxygen concentrations and temperatures on the growth photosynthesis yield and quality of lettuce lactuca sativa l var grand rapids tbr and to provide a theoretical basis for determining the optimal combination of water fertilizer and air in the three color light climate chamber the contrast design of dissolved oxygen at different levels is shown in table 1 the temperature comparison design of different climate chambers is shown in table 2 2 3 experiment implementation the three color light climate chamber studio had width of 500 mm depth of 470 mm and height of 1145 mm the test irrigation water was produced by heal force ultrapure water equipment likang biomedical technology holdings co ltd shanghai china the planted flower pots were moved into three climate chambers at temperatures of 16 c 18 c and 20 c and the temperature was

14 70 39 90 77 21 32 79 32 79 and 5 84 p 0 05 respectively while the nitrate mass fraction decreased by 14 37 p 0 05 the main reasons for these changes are provided below first micro and nanobubbles generally have a cell size of 50 μm or less owing to their extremely small volume they have different properties compared with conventional bubbles these bubbles can remain in irrigation water for longer periods of time and increase the mass transfer efficiency resulting in good stability and durability li et al 2013 2012 this may be another reason why bubbles are easily attached to the surface of crop roots changing the adsorption characteristics of the root surface and improving nutrient absorption studies have shown that aerated irrigation can increase the soil oxygen content in the tomato root zone zhu et al 2017a and increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration in irrigation water can increase crop yield and water use efficiency while also increasing the leaf photosynthetic rate bhattarai and prasad 2005 second aerated irrigation can affect enzyme activities such as urease and catalase in soil and improve the soil microhabitat morard and silvestre 1996 third aerated irrigation can promote the biological activity of animals and plants under the same dissolved oxygen condition the growth rate and dry matter accumulation of lettuce in an oxidized culture solution are larger than those without oxygen ago et al 2005 park and kurata 2009 ushikubo et al 2010 finally there is a negative correlation between the nitrate content and nitrate reductase activity in lettuce and the nitrate reductase activity is one of the main endogenous factors affecting nitrate accumulation in lettuce guo et al 2008 increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration in irrigation water may enhance the nitrate reductase activity of lettuce promote the reduction of nitrate in lettuce and reduce the accumulation of nitrate this conclusion needs further experimental verification 4

respectively increasing the temperature inside the climate chamber increases the soil temperature soil temperature promotes lettuce growth photosynthesis quality water use efficiency and yield the main reasons for these changes are provided below first elevated soil temperatures will significantly alter the biomass activity and structure of soil microbes sheik et al 2011 and laboratory cultures indicate that soil microbial biomass and activity increase with soil warming fang et al 2005 increased temperature increases soil and litter decomposition rates and net nitrogen mineralization to promote nutrient cycling leading to increased physiological activity of soil microbes which in turn leads to increased soil decomposition rates and soil respiration belay tedla et al 2009 at temperatures below 25 c increasing the temperature promotes lettuce growth and the photosynthetic rate li et al 2015 in addition as the temperature increases the leaf area of the lettuce and the dry weight of the shoots increase whereas the content of soluble protein decreases yan et al 2010 this is consistent with the results of this study second nitrate reductase nr is the first enzyme formed by no3 induced formation its formation and activity are affected by environmental factors such as temperature and its effect may be through controlling the synthesis process of the enzyme protein which may also affect the physiological activities of the plant and indirectly affect the nr activity wang and chang 1985 in a suitable temperature range the elevated temperature promotes nr activity and the roots have a weaker ability to absorb no3 in the soil thereby reducing the no3 content in the lettuce at the same time the results of this test are consistent with the study by huang and yuan 1996 there is an inverse relationship between temperature and vegetable nitrate content 5 conclusions among the experimental conditions increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration in the irrigation water or temperature in the climate chamber promoted the growth of lettuce enhanced the photosynthetic ability of lettuce increased the wue and yield reduced the nitrate content improved the nutritional value of lettuce and improved the quality and flavor of lettuce at the same time dm and the yield of lettuce increased increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration in the irrigation water

irrigation warming irrigation yield quality relationship dry matter accumulation intelligent climate incubator 1 introduction water fertilizer gas and heat are essential conditions for crop growth maintaining proper soil moisture fertility gas permeability and temperature is necessary for any period of crop growth lettuce is rich in nutrients such as beta carotene and vitamin c and chinese people have generally preferred vegetables it has become the goal of many researchers to improve the yield and quality of lettuce at the same time lettuce has become the object of many scholars because of its short growth cycle at present the research on lettuce in china and globally focuses on the effects of led assisted illumination nutrient solutions and matrix techniques on growth yield and quality the effects of dissolved oxygen and temperature on the growth photosynthesis yield and quality of lettuce in different irrigation waters have not been reported in the literature however there is some evidence in the literature different dissolved oxygen levels in different irrigation waters as well as the influence of temperature on other crops in terms of irrigation volume and quality research the soluble sugar and protein contents of lettuce increase gradually with a decrease in the lower limit of irrigation for example the vitamin c content of lettuce treated with 50 field water capacity has been been found to be significantly higher than that of other treatments pei and bie 2008 in terms of light filling and quality research research of lettuce has primarily focused on plant factories focusing mainly on artificial light light intensity and illumination time for example liu et al 2019b found that the yield of lettuce in the middle and lower layers of the three dimensional cultivation of plant factories increased by 35 80 and 24 70 dry matter increased by 39 70 and 36 7 the soluble protein content increased by 9 42 and 9 24 and the nitrate content decreased by 10 75 and 6 75 compared with non complementing light ma et al 2017b also clarified that the crude protein and soluble sugar contents of lettuce of plant factories were highest under the semi overlapping mode of 850 nm infrared light and the vitamin c content was the highest and nitrate content was the lowest under 930 nm supplemental light sl alone liu et al 2019a revealed that by increasing the light intensity the soluble sugar soluble protein and carotenoid contents increased increasing the light intensity prolongs the illumination time and can promote the utilization efficiency of n and p elements and improve the quality of lettuce chen et al 2017 used alternating red and blue light to intentionally adjust the growth and quality of lettuce the growth and yield of lettuce increased by 32 104 using auxiliary lighting regardless of the quality of illumination zhang 2019 temperature and photoperiod have been shown to have significant effects on the leaf area of lettuce hang 2019 fu et al 2017 showed that illumination intensity and nitrogen had significant interactions with the photosynthesis yield and quality of lettuce the dry biomass of lettuce was the largest when the illumination was 220 μmol m 2 s 1 elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide either alone or combined with short term salt stress can improve the nutritional quality of lettuce by increasing the concentration of certain minerals and antioxidants and even increase yield pérez lópez et al 2015 in terms of nutrient solution and quality research compared with conventional fertilizer microbial fertilizer has been shown to improve the quality of lettuce in three cycles stamford et al 2019 research on lettuce has mainly focused on the effects of led assisted illumination nutrient solutions and matrix techniques on the growth yield and quality of lettuce in the field of aerated irrigation research in recent years aerated irrigation has gradually become a good choice for improving vegetable yield and quality the existing aerated irrigation research has mainly focused on the effects on vegetable quality yield and growth as well as soil nutrients for example zhu et al 2017a considered that the contents of lycopene vitamin c and soluble sugar and the sugar acid ratio in tomato fruit increased significantly by 37 73 31 43 32 30 and 45 64 respectively compared with no aerated subsurface drip irrigation ma et al 2017a obtained the best combination scheme through stereo planting of rapeseed in greenhouses under the following conditions 7 4 mg l 1 dissolved oxygen

irrigation ai has been shown to be beneficial for increasing crop yield and wue mean increases of 19 3 and 17 9 respectively compared to no aerated treatment du et al 2018 liu et al 2019c showed that micro and nanobubble water oxidation significantly increased tomato and cucumber yield iwue and fruit quality p 0 05 the yield irrigation water use efficiency vitamin c and soluble sugar of tomatoes increased by 16 9 16 9 17 7 and 39 2 while those for cucumbers were 22 1 22 1 16 7 and 19 4 respectively compared with no gas addition moreover pendergast et al 2019 found that the yield of chickpeas with aerated subsurface drip irrigation was much higher than the average yield of chickpeas over 7 years 2008 2015 compared with irrigation by other means and aeration irrigation resulted in significantly improved wue aerated irrigation has been shown to significantly increase tomato yield du et al 2019 ventilation can promote the migration of potassium from the roots to the leaves and reduce the sodium concentration in the roots of sensitive rootstocks paudel et al 2019 irrigation and specific soil aeration practices can balance crop yields and greenhouse gas reduction in greenhouse vegetable fields chen and yang 2018 additionally zhao et al 2018 showed that rhizosphere ventilation and urea application had a certain promoting effect on soil absorption taking into account that urea cannot be used for aeration irrigation when used as nitrogen fertilizer according to niu et al 2013 rhizosphere ventilation ventilation irrigation and post irrigation ventilation have a positive impact on crop growth and yield wang et al 2018 revealed that under the same fertilization level lai dry dm seed cotton yield partial factor productivity pfp and economic benefits increased with an increasing volume of irrigation water the combination of micro nanofoamer and 28 gas stone aerator pumps is the best when only considering the optimal effect of dissolved oxygen ouyang et al 2019 prior research on aerated irrigation has mainly focused on crops such as tomatoes chickpeas and cucumbers and the effects of aerated irrigation on the soil environment it can be seen that research on lettuce by aerated irrigation has not been reported furthermore warming irrigation is another good choice to improve the yield and quality of vegetables there have been a few studies on the effects of warming irrigation on crops first water irrigation at a temperature of 35 c has been shown to be optimal for tomato seedling growth bai et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 showed that the yield under irrigation water heating filming and filming conditions of the soil irrigation water heating treatment increased by 3 9 10 6 and 11 1 respectively second irrigation water temperatures of 25 30 c have been shown to be suitable for maintaining the effect of integrated irrigation water temperature on the growth yield and photosynthesis of brassica campestris l zhang et al 2017 compared with well water normal temperature irrigation well water warming irrigation can increase the net photosynthetic rate of rice by 22 2 and the leaf area index by 14 7 xu et al 2018 similarly no studies

agricultural water resources and crop yield means that attention must also be given to increasing production and improving fruit quality resulting in an agricultural irrigation problem 4 1 increasing dissolved oxygen concentration in irrigation water promotes lettuce growth photosynthesis quality wue and yield compared with o1 o3 had increased plant height leaf area index chlorophyll net photosynthetic rate dry matter accumulation vitamin c mass fraction soluble protein fraction yield irrigation water use efficiency and water use efficiency compared with o1 by 22 86 35 69 12 09 163 95 14 70 39 90 77 21 32 79 32 79 and 5 84 p 0 05 respectively while the nitrate mass fraction decreased by 14 37 p 0 05 the main reasons for these changes are provided below first micro and nanobubbles generally have a cell size of 50 μm or less owing to their extremely small volume they have different properties compared with conventional bubbles these bubbles can remain in irrigation water for longer periods of time and increase the mass transfer efficiency resulting in good stability and durability li et al 2013 2012 this may be another reason why bubbles are easily attached to the surface of crop roots changing the adsorption characteristics of the root surface and improving nutrient absorption studies have shown that aerated irrigation can increase the soil oxygen content in the tomato root zone zhu et al 2017a and increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration in irrigation water can increase crop yield and water use efficiency while also increasing the leaf photosynthetic rate bhattarai and prasad 2005 second aerated irrigation can affect enzyme activities such as urease and catalase in soil and improve the soil microhabitat morard and silvestre 1996 third aerated irrigation can promote the biological activity of animals and plants under the same dissolved oxygen condition the growth rate and dry matter accumulation of lettuce in an oxidized culture solution are larger than those without oxygen ago et al 2005 park and kurata 2009 ushikubo et al 2010 finally there is a negative correlation between the nitrate content and nitrate reductase activity in lettuce and the nitrate reductase activity is one of the main endogenous factors affecting nitrate accumulation in lettuce guo et al 2008 increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration in irrigation water may enhance the nitrate reductase activity of lettuce promote the reduction of nitrate in lettuce and reduce the accumulation of nitrate this conclusion needs further experimental verification 4

respectively increasing the temperature inside the climate chamber increases the soil temperature soil temperature promotes lettuce growth photosynthesis quality water use efficiency and yield the main reasons for these changes are provided below first elevated soil temperatures will significantly alter the biomass activity and structure of soil microbes sheik et al 2011 and laboratory cultures indicate that soil microbial biomass and activity increase with soil warming fang et al 2005 increased temperature increases soil and litter decomposition rates and net nitrogen mineralization to promote nutrient cycling leading to increased physiological activity of soil microbes which in turn leads to increased soil decomposition rates and soil respiration belay tedla et al 2009 at temperatures below 25 c increasing the temperature promotes lettuce growth and the photosynthetic rate li et al 2015 in addition as the temperature increases the leaf area of the lettuce and the dry weight of the shoots increase whereas the content of soluble protein decreases yan et al 2010 this is consistent with the results of this study second nitrate reductase nr is the first enzyme formed by no3 induced formation its formation and activity are affected by environmental factors such as temperature and its effect may be through controlling the synthesis process of the enzyme protein which may also affect the physiological activities of the plant and indirectly affect the nr activity wang and chang 1985 in a suitable temperature range the elevated temperature promotes nr activity and the roots have a weaker ability to absorb no3 in the soil thereby reducing the no3 content in the lettuce at the same time the results of this test are consistent with the study by huang and yuan 1996 there is an inverse relationship between temperature and vegetable nitrate content 5 conclusions among the experimental conditions increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration in the irrigation water or temperature in the climate chamber promoted the growth of lettuce enhanced the photosynthetic ability of lettuce increased the wue and yield reduced the nitrate content improved the nutritional value of lettuce and improved the quality and flavor of lettuce at the same time dm and the yield of lettuce increased increasing the dissolved oxygen concentration in the irrigation water or temperature in the climatic chamber had significant effects on plant height and e p 0 05 but had highly significant effects on a gsw ci and tleaf p 0 01 among them the plant height lai chlorophyll

the soluble protein and nitrate contents p 0 05 but had highly significant effects on the vitamin c content yield and iwue p 0 01 among them the vitamin c content soluble protein content yield iwue
