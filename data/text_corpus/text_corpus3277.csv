wwtp wastewater treatment plant introduction the population explosion has boosted the production of domestic wastewater which is typically treated using the biological activated sludge process as a result huge amounts of waste sludge are generated as a by product at a rate of 3 5 v v of influent currently 30 million tonnes 70 water content of dry sludge are produced annually mulchandani and westerhoff 2016 waste sludge not only contains significant amounts of pathogens and heavy metals but it also emits strong malodors posing a severe threat to the surrounding environments arthurson 2008 waste sludge must be treated properly to improve dewaterability eliminate pathogens and control malodour for space saving and safe disposal although anaerobic digestion ad technology e g cambi biothelys exelys lysotherm and turbotec can reduce sludge volume while recovering energy rich biogas i e ch4 shen et al 2015 kleerebezem et al 2015 not all ad processes can achieve energy self sufficiency at full scale cano et al 2015 han et al 2017 zan et al 2019 to enhance dewatering large amounts of chemical dosing e g cationic polyelectrolyte at 15 kg tonne dry sludge are required thereby increasing the operation costs lee and liu 2000 chen et al 2002 furthermore pathogens including fecal coliforms usually increase in the sludge cake after the dewatering process compared with the raw sludge chen et al 2011 erkan and sanin 2013 the pathogen enriched sludge cake further emits malodors which require subsequent disinfection and deodorization e g the addition of fecl3 or naclo

competitive considering the presence of impurities such as heavy metals in the sludge peccia 2015 as the most abundant resource in sludge c recovery by sludge fermentation for bioplastics synthesis 110 120 us dry tonne sludge has drawn growing interest rather than methane recovery however it demands a full scale practical evaluation da ros et al 2020 meanwhile other processes for recovering high value resources from sludge have emerged including biopolymer kehrein et al 2020 nanocellulose espíndola et al 2020 bio crude thomsen et al 2020 and bioprotein xiao and zhou 2020 biological e g enzymatic catalysis chemical e g oxidants addition and physical e g microwave and hydrothermal means for sludge treatment and resource recovery have extensively been investigated liu et al 2018a raheem et al 2018 zan et al 2019 in the last decade there has been a growing interest in the electrochemical process owing to its merits fig 1 particularly its minimal chemical use small reactor footprint and eases of installment and operation sirés et al 2014 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 besides the high salt content of the sludge nearly 1 3 ms cm of conductivity resulting from industrial wastewater shock loads or seawater infiltration facilitates application of the electrochemical process ségalen et al 2015 he et al 2017 for instance full scale implementation of the high voltage pretreatment 10 kv opencel process resulted in a 40 increase in biogas production via the ad of waste sludge rittmann et al 2008 making the sludge treatment plant energy self sufficient and economically feasible in addition the electro dewatering process can reduce the water content of sludge from approximately 80 to less than 40 while eliminating sludge malodor and pathogens without chemical dosing resulting in significant cost savings mahmoud et al 2018 zeng et al 2019a the process is versatile and it has demonstrated superior performance in removing heavy metals tang et al 2018 and recovering nutrients and vfas from sludge pan et al 2018 zeng et al 2021 nonetheless most studies focus on improving the effectiveness of the electrochemical process without highlighting the limitations of the process including the electrode scaling caused by organic deposition extra addition of electrolytes such as nacl to the low conductance wastes and high energy consumption particularly in a full scale plant also the environmental impacts e g toxic by products cathodic hydrogen emission associated with the electrochemical process and its potential applications have yet to be fully understood with the above in mind the present paper highlights the potential practical applications of the electrochemical process with emphases on 1 the effective treatment and safe disposal of the sludge and 2 the feasibility of recovering resources from the sludge in the first section the improvements to the ad and dewatering processes heavy metals removal pathogens inactivation and malodors control are considered while the second section reviews the state of knowledge regarding the electrochemical process assistant recovery of n p and vfas from sludge the mechanisms involved in the electrochemical process are critically reviewed and perspectives and future research directions discussed application domain of electrochemical process in sludge treatment the electrochemical processes for sludge treatment can be subdivided into three categories based on the input voltage namely micro voltage mv low voltage v and high voltage kv processes the different voltage ranges lead to different electrochemical mechanisms fig 2 typically the micro voltage range is used in the bio electrochemical system rabaey and rozendal 2010 wang et al 2015a schröder et al 2015 the low voltage range is utilized to enhance the sludge dewaterability and biodegradability huang et al 2021 kill pathogens and remove heavy metals zeng et al 2019a while the high voltage range is applied to improve the biogas production of the ad process rittmann et al 2008 anaerobic digestion enhancement the ad process is the most commonly used process for sludge stabilization and energy recovery enhancing the methane production of the ad process is the priority for achieving the energy self sufficiency of a conventional wwtp theoretically the specific methane production of approximately 300 ml ch4 g volatile solids vs is required to offset the total energy demand of a conventional wwtp operation cano et al 2015 however an average yield of nearly 250 ml ch4 g vs can be produced during the ad process wan et al 2016 to enhance the ad process performance the low and high voltage v kv electrochemical pretreatment and in situ micro voltage mv electrochemical assisted process were explored table 1 electrochemical pretreatment of sludge the pretreatment of the sludge aims to solubilize it and accelerate its hydrolysis which is the limiting step of the ad process for the low voltage 100 v pretreatment the fundamental principles are to disintegrate the flocs structure and break down the cellular membrane via the direct electric force and indirect oxidation the electric force created by the input charges can cause the dissolution of the cytoplasma rahmani et al 2015 zhan et al 2015 meanwhile various oxidants including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals oh hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite hocl and ocl can be produced in the electrochemical process via electrooxidation and electrochlorination christensen et al 2013 kapałka et al 2009 p a christensen et al 2013 xiao et al 2019 which further disturb the sludge flocs however the inhibitory effect of the produced oxidant on subsequent ad has not been reported in addition the ohmic heating generated during the low voltage electrochemical process can uniformly penetrate and diffuse throughout the sludge matrix enhancing the sludge solubilization via an increased temperature of up to 70 c pei et al 2019 sakr and liu 2014 the first low voltage electrochemical sludge pretreatment trial was conducted at 12 v for 15 h the methane yield increased to 318 ml g vs which represented increases of 31 compared with its control charles et al 2013 although the increased methane production can offset the consumed energy a long duration pretreatment 15 h limits its application it has been reported that the treatment duration and energy consumption can be reduced by increasing the input voltage with the pretreatment of 20 v for 40 min increases in biogas yield of up to 63 were recorded yang et al 2014 the addition of oxidants namely h2o2 and naclo during the electrochemical pretreatment have resulted in a synergistic effect for improving the methane production feki et al 2015 xu et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 combining the electrochemical pretreatment 200 v 45 min and naclo dosing increased the methane yield by 2 folds in a pilot ad plant yuan et al 2016 this pilot plant also showed a profit of nearly 20 30 us m3 wet sludge for the high voltage kv pretreatment in microseconds the electroporation and degradation of the complex organics are the core mechanisms rittmann et al 2008 little oxidants are produced and the ohmic heating is marginal due to the short treatment duration the high strength electrical field creates a polarization effect directly disturbing the elastic bilayer structure of the sludge i e the cell membrane sludge flocs are composed of phospholipids and peptidoglycans carrying a net negative charge making the cell membrane more vulnerable to the strong electrical field kopplow et al 2004 fig 2 the full scale application of the high voltage kv pretreatment with a rapid contact time in microseconds is promising for sludge handling a net economic benefit of approximately us 540 000 including profits from electricity generation and operating and maintenance costs can be achieved for a conventional wwtp treating 380 m3 wet sludge day with a 30 kv pulsed voltage pretreatment rittmann et al 2008 this approach not only obviates the generation of electrochemical toxicants namely chlorate and perchlorate zhen et al 2014 but it also significantly minimizes the reactor footprint and capital costs several high voltage based technologies including opencel biocrack and powermod have been successfully commercialized for instance the full scale opencel at the northwest water reclamation plant in mesa yielded 60 increase in biogas production and 40 reductions in biosolids long and bullard 2012 in addition biocrack can increase biogas yield by 20 while offering downstream energy savings from pumping and mixing of about 30 chiavola et al 2015 however the sludge characteristics are variable in different regions and standard operations of biocrack for different sludge treatments have not been well established in situ electrochemical assisted ad process in an in situ electrochemical assisted ad process typically referred to as a micro voltage electrochemical process the electrodes are continually inserted into the sludge digester serving as an electrochemical regulator the micro voltage mv electrochemical process stimulates the bacterial activity and enhances the methane production of the ad process as shown in fig 2 and table 1 in an electrochemical assisted ad system the electrode materials having enlarged surface area e g carbon fiber brush 7170 m2 m3 are typically designed to maximize the contact area logan et al 2007 the direct interspecies electron transfer and intermediates e g hydrogen acetate and formate formed during the electrochemical ad system contribute to the enhancement of methane production zhao et al 2015 sarker et al 2018 for instance the cathodic hydrogen production can promote the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens guo et al 2013 liu et al 2016 gajaraj et al 2017 an approximately 14 fold methane production over the control has been achieved at the voltage of 1800 mv with the h2 yield at nearly 10 ml g vss guo et al 2013 however the voltages of 300 mv 600 mv and 800 mv have been considered as the optimal input voltages for stimulating the hydrogenotrophic methanogens e g methanomicrobiales and methanobacteriales liu et al 2016 chen et al 2016 gajaraj et al 2017 this inconsistency over the selection of the optimal voltage for enriching the hydrogenotrophic methanogens is probably due to the various inoculum and different sludge substrates furthermore feng et al 2016 have demonstrated that 500 600 mv can directly promote the activity of electrochemically active bacteria e g cloacamona on the electrode surface this observation has also been supported by asztalos and kim 2015 the latter have demonstrated that a high methane content of biogas of nearly 95 can be reached in an electrochemical assisted ad system where colacamona is dominant nonetheless the above studies have limited themselves to the laboratory scale level for concept verification for further development the main challenges including the electrode fouling mass transfer limitation and ohmic polarization should be addressed perspectives on ad enhancement with electrochemical process one of the primary barriers of restricting the electrochemistry based ad process application is its intensive energy consumption generally the energy consumption of sludge pretreatment needs to be less than 0 2 kwh kg total solids ts for achieving energy self efficiency for a conventional wwtp cano et al 2015 the full scale implementation of the high voltage process opencel and powermod is sometimes energy inefficient nearly 0 15 0 3 kwh kg ts cano et al 2015 the energy consumption has been found to be significantly low 0 06 kwh kg ts for a low voltage pretreatment process in a pilot scale trial 1 5 m3 wet sludge treatment at 200 v 45 mins yuan et al 2016 however during the low voltage sludge pretreatment of this trial the foam h2 and o2 and scum generations regularly caused operating and safety issues it is believed that the sludge hydraulic recycling or coarse bubble aeration is a solution to the scum and foam issues this is also given that the flammability limit of h2 in the air mixture is 4 v v theoretically the maximum h2 vol in an electrochemical process is about 1 v v at a current density of 50 ma cm2 while this current density is safe and sufficient for running an electrochemical reactor in terms of the flammability limit according to the second faraday s law alsheyab et al 2008 it is recommended that the gas evacuation be installed the lifespan of an electrode is another challenge for electrochemical sludge treatment electrochemical efficacy is reduced when electrode coating material e g ruo2 iro2 tao2 dissolves periodical reversal of the electrode polarity can mitigate the electrode fouling and dissolution resulting in a longer service lifetime chow et al 2021 moreover it is recommended to recycle and reuse damaged electrodes for coating material repair which can dramatically reduce the electrode expense another concern regarding the ad process is the low cod capture via the methane recovery in practice approximately 14 of the total cod in the influent can ultimately be reused as biogas through the ad process for heat and power generations hao et al 2019 the ad process can be installed at the beginning a stage of conventional municipal wastewater treatment processes to enhance the cod capture by up to 65 liu et al 2018a particularly the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is ideal for the a stage process due to its robustness under climate temperature conditions li 2016 however membrane biofouling is the bottleneck for the development of an anmbr for mainstream cod capture cheng et al 2018 supplying a micro voltage electrochemical process to the conductive membrane in the anmbr can mitigate the biofouling effect and also upgrade the methane composition which has become the focus in recent studies katuri et al 2014 yang et al 2018 sludge dewaterability the dewatering process is an essential step for volume reduction during sludge treatment which ultimately saves the costs of transportation and final disposal the electrochemical process can effectively improve the sludge dewaterability and it is typically operated under two types of modes namely 1 the non pressure mode that consists of the electrochemical pretreatment and 2 the pressure mode that consists of the electro osmotic dewatering non pressure electrochemical pretreatment sludge typically contains four types of water i e free water interstitial water surface water and bound water tsang and vesilind 1990 free water can effectively be removed by the conventional dewatering processes including gravity settling filtration and centrifugation the interstitial water surface water particles bond and bound water intercellular and chemically bond cannot be dewatered easily due to their strong bonds with sludge flocs the non pressure electrochemical pretreatment is extensively being investigated and tested nowadays as summarized in table 2 typically low voltage electrochemical pretreatment is applied for enhancing the sludge dewaterability the principle being to disintegrate the hydrated and rigid structure of the sludge and break down the cell membrane via electrooxidation and electroporation under the ambient temperature and pressure this way the interstitial surface and bound waters can be released thus facilitating the following dewatering process such as belt filtration and centrifuge fig 3 a the low voltage electrochemical pretreatment 20 v 20 min was initially tested in 2011 and nearly 37 decreases in the capillary suction time cst of sludge were observed yuan et al 2011 an increase voltage of up to 30 v further reduced the specific resistance to filtration srf by 99 and cst by 76 compared to the control gharibi et al 2013 nevertheless voltages over 30 v deteriorated the sludge dewaterability due to the increase of sludge viscosity via the excessive release of the extracellular polymer substances eps for instance the sludge viscosity increased from nearly 140 mpa s in the control to nearly 160 mpa s after a 50 v pretreatment yuan et al 2011 gharibi et al 2013 applying a high voltage also leads to a high energy consumption to further improve the dewaterability at low voltage the dosing of chemicals including persulfate s2o8 2 ferrous ion fe2 zero valent iron fe0 permanganate mno4 and bisulfite hso3 into the electrochemical process has been investigated zhen et al 2013 li et al 2016 guo et al 2017 it has been found that the strong oxidants e g s2o8 2 and mno4 can disrupt the sludge flocs and crack the cells thereby enhancing the release of bound water guo et al 2017 furthermore the fe0 s2o8 2 addition can create a synergetic effect with low voltages supply of 20 40 v to improve the sludge dewatering process li et al 2016 the electrical field can induce the cell lysis and fe0 can simultaneously activate s2o8 2 for so4 2 radical generation which can further decompose the soluble eps a significantly high dewaterability enhancement has been obtained evidenced by the decreases of srf and cst of over 90 with the addition of the fenton reagent or nacl in an electrochemical process masihi and gholikandi 2018 xiao et al 2019 the cost of adding the fenton reagent 41 8 us t dry sludge ds is significantly lower than those of nacl 182 9 us t ds and fe0 additions 134 us t ds in the electrochemical process more importantly the fenton addition has been found to be more cost efficient for improving sludge dewaterability than the chemical free electrochemical system 82 us t ds drogui et al 2013 owing to the activation of the synergistic effect the non pressure electrochemical pretreatment 8 v 35 min has been tested in a pilot reactor treating 30 tonnes of wet sludge per day with a water content of 99 she et al 2017 after the belt filtration the water content of sludge cake was 65 but the total operating cost with an electrochemical pretreatment 29 us t wet sludge is much higher than the traditional dewatering process 18 us t wet sludge the intensive energy consumption and high operating costs have been responsible for the non industrial application of the electrochemical sludge pretreatment to this day pressure mode electro osmotic dewatering the electro osmotic dewatering process a combination of mechanical force and electric field improves the sludge liquid solid separation and reduces the sludge water content fig 3 it was first proposed for peat dewatering in the 1900s and later applied for sludge dewatering kondoh and hiraoka 1990 various mechanisms including electrophoresis electro migration electro osmosis and electrochemical reactions play essential roles in the electro osmotic dewatering process which were well reviewed by mahmoud et al 2010 and tuan et al 2012 this section focuses on the latest engineering advances and industrial applications of the electro osmotic sludge dewatering process as shown in table 2 optimizing the operating parameters of the electro osmotic dewatering process is important polyelectrolyte e g polyacrylamide was typically used for sludge conditioning before the electro osmotic dewatering process prior to the years 2000s it was later found that the macromolecular polyelectrolyte addition had negative effects including an increase in the filtration resistance in an electro osmotic system saveyn et al 2005 however citeau et al 2011 demonstrated that polyelectrolyte did not affect the electro osmotic system whatever the polyelectrolyte density and molecular weight were in other words polyelectrolyte was not needed for the electro osmotic dewatering process for the sake of chemicals saving 20 30 of total operation costs this was to be expected given that the total charges in the sludge were several orders of magnitude greater than those of the added polyelectrolytes mikkelsen 2003 conductivity is another key parameter in the electro osmotic dewatering process higher conductivity of anaerobically digested sludge 4 5 ms cm than that of waste activated sludge 1 3 ms cm leads to a faster dewatering rate and a lower water content of digested sludge cake visigalli et al 2017 the electro osmotic dewatering is more applicable to sludge with high conductivity however a significantly high conductivity 8 ms cm allows current to bypass the solid phase via the liquid phase due to the reduction of the electrical double layer of the particles thus deteriorating the dewaterability mahmoud et al 2018 furthermore the input voltage as the key variable in the energy consumption has required consideration to achieve the optimal dewatering performance a decrease in the input voltage from 50 v to 10 v can reduce the energy consumption from 0 4 to 0 08 kwh kg h2oremoved yu et al 2017 but the lowest water content of the sludge cake 35 40 has been obtained at the highest voltage input of 50 v mahmoud et al 2011 the optimal operation of the electro osmotic dewatering process is largely dependent on a specific case the industrial scale sludge electro osmotic dewatering process has first been successfully applied in japan at three wwtps kondoh and hiraoka 1990 during the process operation the sludge underwent pressure filtration for 20 min with the addition of cacl2 and then was subjected to an electro osmotic process this operating mode maximizes the efficacy of the input energy which has also been recommended by saveyn et al 2005 the total operating costs for the electro osmotic dewatering process plants 30 35 us t ds was found to be much lower than those of the conventional filter press 40 us t ds and belt press 64 us t ds chen et al 2002 process plants moreover its energy consumption 0 24 kwh kg h2oremoved has merely been 20 40 of the thermal drying olivier et al 2014 perspectives on electrochemical treatment for sludge dewatering in terms of the energy saving and reduction of the water content the pressure mode process i e electro osmotic dewatering has performed better than the non pressure mode process i e electrochemical pretreatment the electro osmotic dewatering systems have been commercialized including cinetik from ovivo inc usa elode from ace korea inc korea and electrokinetic united kingdom they offer similar electro osmotic dewatering processes and claim that the sludge products of cinetik and elode can be directly used for land and agriculture applications nonetheless these products are not yet popular for sludge dewatering due to the high capital investment costs for instance the market price for an electro osmotic dewatering unit with a one ton treatment capacity is us 60 000 80 000 in terms of electrochemical pretreatment for dewaterability enhancement it is practically unpopular for industrial application and limited to lab scale investigation presently because polymer addition has been well developed and accepted in wwtps for achieving effective sludge dewatering electrochemical pretreatment trials are not promoted at the current stage due to the additional capital investment if extra benefits such as odor control and pathogen removal can be provided in addition to improving dewaterability zeng et al 2019b it will increase wwtps interest in adopting this new technology nonetheless the equipment service life and maintenance are also concerns electrode scaling and damage often inevitably appear in the electro osmotic dewatering systems zhang et al 2017 moreover calcium and magnesium in the sludge migrate to the cathode driven by the electric field and precipitate on the cathode surface as caco3 and mg oh 2 impeding the process effectiveness for the anode the dissolution and peeling of the conductive coating are problematic the cost of the regular replacement of the electrodes generally accounts for nearly 18 of the equipment operating costs zhang et al 2017 according to the successful practice of the electro osmotic sludge dewatering process the carbon electrode is very competitive kondoh and hiraoka 1990 the carbon electrode is durable and cheap without issues of scaling in addition to the electrode selection a compact and modular design for reducing the investment costs is desirable heavy metals removal around 50 80 of metals in sewage can be eventually accumulated in the sludge pathak et al 2009 resulting in a 0 5 2 0 metal content in the sludge as dry weight babel et al 2006 toxic metals including cd cr cu and pb in the sludge pose a threat to public health if they enter the ecological cycle the presence of metals also restricts the land or agriculture application of the sludge an electro kinetic process has been developed for the remediation of metal contaminated sludge the core components in the electro kinetic system are the cathode e g stainless steel and anode e g graphite which are separated by two ion selective membranes fig 4 driven by the electrical field e g input voltage of 30 50 v metal cations cross the ion selective membranes and drift toward the cathode chamber the electrolysis of water at the anode generates h ions and can reduce the ph below 3 causing metals dissociation from their particle forms in the sludge yuan and weng 2006 metals in sludge have different forms including soluble exchangeable adsorbed organic bonded and inorganic bonded metals removal efficiencies highly depend on their chemical speciation for instance metals with high motilities i e soluble and exchangeable can easily be removed from the sludge by the electro kinetic process peng and tian 2010 to improve the overall metal removal efficiency additives including acids hno3 surfactants rhamnolipid and electrolytes nacl are often used to solubilize the heavy metals with the addition of hno3 at a ph of 2 0 for 24 h table 3 95 of zn 96 of cu 90 of ni and 68 of cr can be removed by the electro kinetic treatment wang et al 2005 with the same electric voltage gradient 1 25 v cm and electrode material cathode and anode are graphite citric acid has been found to be a better additive than tap water and sodium dodecyl sulfate a surfactant for metals removal cu pb ni zn and cr yuan and weng 2006 peng and tian 2010 however the nonbiodegradable properties of these organic acids e g citric acid and surfactants are major concerns given the secondary pollution that they create hence in recent years biosurfactants i e rhamnolipid saponin and sophorolipid have been tested owing to their high biodegradability ecological safety and low toxicity tang et al 2018 among these rhamnolipid performed the best in terms of heavy metal removal efficiency zn 70 cr and ni 60 owing to its higher content of the functional group of carboxyl than saponin and sophorolipid tang et al 2018 the first pilot trial of the electro kinetic process for metals removal from sludge was conducted in france zagury et al 1999 a volume of 60 l of industrial sludge from an oil and gas wwtp was treated with an input of 2 5 a 15 v and 33 zn were removed with an initial concentration of 3500 mg kg ts the total cost of this process including power consumption and acidification ph 4 5 hno3 addition was estimated at us 100 ton which is much cheaper than the landfilling cost of metal polluted industrial sludge us 165 245 ton in addition the metals removal of the anaerobically digested sludge cd 6 8 mg kg cr 115 6 mg kg cu 338 7 mg kg and pb 62 8 mg kg was investigated in a pilot scale reactor 60 l in korea kim et al 2002 subsequent to the electro kinetic process 2a 120 h with 1 m of h2so4 addition more than 70 metals were removed the ph was found to be the critical parameter affecting the electro kinetic process kim et al 2002 which corresponds with the result reported by xu et al 2017 acidification 2 5 ph 4 5 can effectively solubilize sludge thereby promoting the metals release increased concentration of the soluble metals and enhancing the metals removal through the electro kinetic process the electro kinetic process for metals removal from sludge is still in its early developing stages the operating parameters affecting the overall performance of this process have been investigated in lab scale studies with focuses on the chemical additive and ph variation a pilot trial has demonstrated that metal removal from industrial sludge with electro kinetic process is competitive zagury et al 1999 as for sewage sludge the economic feasibility has not been validated despite the metal s removal efficiency being high kim et al 2002 xu et al 2017 hence it has been suggested elsewhere that the relatively high costs of the electro kinetic process us 100 ton can restrict its application to sewage sludge treatment in which acidification us 35 55 ton is required babel and del mundo dacera 2006 however the electro kinetic process is viable for both soil and sediment remediations kim et al 2014 jeon et al 2015 lópez vizcaíno et al 2016 luo et al 2018 mao et al 2019 for instance the treatment costs of 40 50 us m2 using the electro kinetic process for full scale soil remediation are much lower than the conventional treatment costs of 100 us m2 alshawabkeh et al 1999 liu et al 2018b also given that the in situ soil remediation using the electro kinetic process does not require excavation and transport thus minimizing the soil disturbance this significantly reduces the treatment costs the feasibility for treating sewage sludge by the electro kinetic process is still underexplored pathogens removal high loads of human pathogens in feces and urine including salmonella spp listeria spp and e coli end up in sludge nearly 105 mpn g watanabe et al 1997 ultimately entering the ecosystem if sludge is not properly treated survey studies of infections among co workers and residents have indicated potential problems e g typhoid gastroenteritis skin rashes caused by enteric pathogens in the air and sludge samples lewis and gattie 2002 conventional processes for pathogens removal from sludge include drying mesophilic digestion and pasteurization however the drying and pasteurization processes are costly and the mesophilic digestion process usually reduces half of the pathogens to concentrations in the range of 102 103 mpn g ts arthurson 2008 zhao and liu 2019 the electrochemical process 10 30 v is effective in the disinfection of various types of waters and wastewaters including toilet wastewater huang et al 2016 urban wastewater anfruns estrada et al 2017 surface water schaefer et al 2017 and drinking water miao et al 2014 by the in situ production of oxidants e g ozone chlorine hydrogen peroxide in terms of sludge treatment the electrochemically produced chlorine plays an important role in pathogens removal in contrast the contribution of h2o2 to pathogens removal is limited due to its rapid decay rate in the sludge system the electrochemically generated chlorine reacts with ammonia and organic nitrogen forming chloramines e g nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 which contribute to pathogens removal cui et al 2013 for example a combination of 10 mg min l chlorine with 140 mg min l chloramine can achieve the 5 log inactivation of ms2 bacteriophage furst et al 2018 it has been reported that an elevated temperature caused by ohmic heating during the electrochemical process is another factor leading to pathogens inactivation with a 6 min electrochemical treatment at 40 v the sludge temperature can increase from 34 c to 100 c which leads to a 5 log reduction in total coliforms and a 4 log reduction in e coli daneshmand et al 2012 a similar finding has been reported by yin hoffmann and jiang 2018 whereby no e coli was detected after treatment with 18 v 120 min and the sludge temperature rose to nearly 70 c at high sludge temperature e g 95 c nh4 can be converted to nh3 gas which crosses the cellular lipid layer and disrupts the ph balance facilitating ohmic heat for pathogens inactivation takhtehfouladi et al 2013 although the electrochemical treatment is effective for the inactivation of pathogens few practical applications can be found in the literature the electrochemical approaches are effective for pathogens removal in lab scale studies however the by products formation e g chlorate perchlorate halogenated organic during the electrochemical sludge treatment is overlooked and deserves further attention considering their carcinogenic and mutagenic properties radjenovic and sedlak 2015 up to 100 mg l of chlorate and perchlorate can be generated in an electrochemical sewage treatment process which is equivalent to more than 100 folds the world health organization limiting concentration 0 7 mg l garcia segura et al 2015 however little information is available on the electrochemically formed by products during sludge treatment it is probably due to the high dilution rate of sludge filtrate after dewatering with the influent in the wwtp which reduces the toxicity of by products nonetheless minimizing the by product formation is crucial for further development of the electrochemical processes several approaches have emerged in reducing the by products formation for instance the cabeco process manufactured by condias germany can control the trihalomethanes potential human carcinogens concentration below 1 mg l regulation limit while maintaining the effective pathogens removal over 3 log reduction isidro et al 2018 the boron doped diamond bdd electrode is the key component of the cabeco process which induces ozone production via the reaction o2 2 oh o3 h2o it restricts chlorine production thus reducing the trihalomethanes formation a recent laboratory study has also shown that the nearly 5 log removal of e coli using a ti iro2 anode can be achieved without exceeding the disinfection by products guidelines schaefer et al 2015 this is due to the chloride concentration used in the above study being relatively low at nearly 100 mg l thereby diminishing the production of chlorine responsible for forming disinfection by products in addition shortening the reaction time 1 h and lowering the current density 50 a m2 can minimize the by product generation huang et al 2016 odor control the odor nuisance is often generated from the sludge during its storage dewatering transportation and disposal hydrogen sulfide h2s is the principal compound responsible for sludge odor emission the presence of sulfate so4 2 in sludge brought from the mixing with seawater in the seawater for toilet flushing system and sulfate containing coagulation alum addition cause the sulfide generation mediated by the biological sulfate reduction process zeng et al 2019a for instance saline sludge is particularly odorous and produces a high sulfide concentration 100 300 mg s l to prevent sulfide formation ferric chloride is typically used in wwtps unfortunately the ferric chloride dosing inevitably deteriorates the disinfection efficacy for the ultraviolet system although dosing with oxidants including chlorine can effectively eliminate sulfide sulfide can be regenerated during sludge transportation after several hours of being suppressed the electro osmotic process is effective in suppressing the emission of sulfur compounds from sludge methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide concentrations can be reduced by 93 and 92 respectively after the electro osmotic sludge treatment using a cinetik ck lab model at 60 v 5 5 a and 140 kpa ovivo canada navab daneshmand et al 2014 with a low energy input of 12 v 300 ma under ambient temperature and pressure about 99 of h2s g and 97 of dissolved sulfide produced from saline sludge can be suppressed for a month of anaerobic storage zeng et al 2019a electrochemical treatment disrupts metal binding functional groups such as c o in the sludge resulting in the release of metals e g fe and mn these soluble metals can precipitate the sulfide produced during biological sulfate reduction furthermore the effect of the electrochemically produced chlorine on sulfide oxidation should be marginal as chlorine can be rapidly consumed by the organics in the sludge zeng et al 2019a nonetheless the electrochemically produced chlorine can assist in breaking down the sludge flocs thereby enhancing the metals release for sulfide precipitation it should be noted that the electrode material in the electrochemical process determines the efficacy of the sludge sulfide control zeng et al 2020 the carbon base electrode can significantly reduce the sludge sulfide by over 99 through treatment at 10 v for 15 mins while the ti based electrode can marginally enhance the sulfide production however the underlying mechanisms of the electrochemical sludge sulfide control using different electrode materials remain unclear one pilot scale 700 l study for sewage sludge odor control has been conducted in which 100 h2s g 97 dimethyl sulfide and 100 free ammonia were removed with an input voltage of 8 v for 35 min she et al 2017 it was mentioned that the electrochemically produced chlorine plays a critical role in sulfide oxidation moreover the energy consumption of the pilot scale study has been high 150 kwh m3 over 10 times higher than that of the lab scale study 9 kwh m3 zeng et al 2019a hence the scaling up the electrochemical process for sludge odor control requires further investigation to achieve the energy saving decreasing the electrode distance using the bipolar electrode connection and supplying the pulsed electrical input are effective ways to minimize the energy consumption of the electrochemical process from the practical point of view application of electrochemical process for resources recovery turning the sludge into valuable resource provides a new sustainable path for sludge management beyond treatment and safe disposal the electrochemical process draws scientific attention to sludge resources recovery due to its multi functional working mechanisms including electrooxidation electrodialysis and electromigration however research on the underlying mechanisms and practical applications of the sludge based resources recovery involving electrochemical processes is lacking this section focuses on nutrients n and p and c recovery the shortcomings and merits of the different electrochemical approaches are reviewed for resource recovery from sludge nitrogen recovery the nitrogen content accounts for 3 4 of the dry mass in the sludge and mainly exists in proteins peccia 2015 proteins can be broken down into ammonia during the ad process with a 700 1500 mg l concentration in reject water after sludge dewatering or anaerobic digestate quist jensen et al 2018 thornton et al 2007 ammonia is the primary raw material for fertilizers it can be directly recovered from digestate using the electrodialysis process the electrodialysis process consists of three components namely the ion exchange membranes anode and cathode in which the ion exchange membranes separate the anode and cathode compartments in an electrodialysis process ammonium ions diffuse from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber through the cation exchange membrane mondor et al 2008 this process has been used for ammonia recovery from swine manure mondor et al 2008 ippersiel et al 2012 sotres et al 2015 domestic wastewater zhang and angelidaki 2015 and anthropogenic urine pronk biebow and boller 2006 it is estimated that an electrodialysis process can recover nearly 1 3 g n l from the sludge digestate creating a net profit of nearly 500 us day for a 1000 m3 digester desloover et al 2012 nonetheless the energy consumption of the electrodialysis process 17 kwh kg n is greater than that of the conventional nitrogen recovery process including air stripping 10 13 kwh kg n mehta et al 2015 reducing the energy consumption the electrodialysis process can further increase the net profit for nh4 n recovery the latest electrodialysis pilot study 24 l reactor volume for nh4 n recovery has demonstrated that the energy consumption can be reduced to 4 9 kwh kg n which is competitive ward et al 2018 in this pilot study a total of 31 cation exchange membranes and 30 anion exchange membranes were installed forming an electrodialysis stack however membrane fouling is still the major challenge for electrodialysis and chemical addition is inevitable for controlling membrane fouling higher conductivity feeds i e more concentrated feed can help decrease the energy consumption and improve the membranes lifetime overall electrodialysis was typically used for nh4 n recovery from the sludge digestate table 4 and the energy consumption has been reduced to 2 kwh kg n in the latest study meng et al 2021 the power to protein concept has recently been proposed by verstraete clauwaert and vlaeminck 2016 it turns nh4 co2 and h2 into high value proteins in this concept h2 is produced by water electrolysis for the hydrogen oxidizing bacteria hob growth matassa et al 2015 the hob produces single cell proteins with the substrate of h2 co2 and nh3 co2 and nh3 are obtained from the ad biogas and digestate respectively while the electrolytic h2 production can be driven by wind energy or solar source mishra et al 2020 it has been claimed that using the wind energy average power per unit area of 2 w m2 the assisted electrolytic h2 production for the hob growth 2 4 kg dry biomass kg h2 can yield up to 3120 tonnes of microbial proteins per year matassa et al 2015 this idea has further been investigated by molitor et al 2019 who have proposed a two stage bioprocess converting eclectic power and co2 into high quality single cell proteins in the first stage co2 is fixed by the anaerobic acetogenic bacteria for acetate production c ljungdahlii at 35 c and a ph of 5 7 in the second stage acetate as the intermediate metabolite is the substrate for cultivating yeasts or fungi for single cell proteins synthesis s cerevisiae at 30 c and a ph of 5 0 the protein production rate of 2 3 g l h at a commercial scale can be achieved using this two stage bioprocess phosphorus recovery p resource is irreplaceable and estimated to run out by 2050 with a global consumption rate of 20 million tonnes per year cordell et al 2011 the recovery of p has been one of the major concerns globally sludge contains 2 3 p in dry mass mainly present in the organic form rittmann and mccarty 2012 globally nearly five million tonne p year can be recovered from sludge mateo sagasta et al 2015 this amount of potentially recoverable p is drawing attention from researchers p can be effectively recovered from sludge using the electrodialysis process under the electrical field fig 5 the soluble p e g po4 3 moves toward the anode and passes through the anion exchange membranes that allow only negatively charged species to filter through while rejecting positively charged species other negative ions can move towards the anode end e g chloride sulfate the selection of sludge sources for p recovery is crucial generally the enhanced biological p removal ebpr sludge sludge digestate and sludge ash are the target sources for p recovery table 4 up to 1500 mg p l can be released from the ebpr sludge and driven to the anode chamber achieving a p recovery effectiveness of 96 under a current density of 10 ma cm2 wang et al 2013 the energy consumption 5 kwh kg p can be much lower than that of the p recovery from the sludge digestate 17 kwh kg p zhang et al 2013 p can also be recovered from the sludge digestate in the form of struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o wang et al 2010 kruk et al 2014 oliveira et al 2018 recovered p with electrodialysis was fed to a struvite reactor dosed with naoh and mgcl2 zhang 2013 over 90 of p have precipitated in the struvite reactor with an input of 5 v 0 2 a and energy consumption of nearly17 kwh kg p wang et al 2015b have demonstrated the feasibility of the electrodialysis process for the simultaneous recovery of 86 94 of p and 95 100 of nh4 in the form of struvite by dosing mgcl2 while several lab scale studies have showed the feasibility of the electrodialysis process for the recovery of p from sludge limited information regarding its practical application is available the p recovery effectiveness from digestate has to be over 56 of p per dry mass to make the recovery process profitable based on the investigation of a full scale plant namely the oxley creek wwtp which integrates struvite crystallization shu et al 2006 to enhance the electrodialysis process the ph adjustment is generally considered increasing the ph to 12 5 at the cathode chamber can solubilize nearly 120 mg p l from waste activated sludge to the bulk liquid and achieve 70 p recovery in 24 h guedes et al 2016 nevertheless the alkalic condition also induces the p precipitation on the other hand maintaining the ph below 2 in the cathode chamber and acidifying the sludge with the electro fenton pretreatment have been proposed for p recovery from anaerobically digested sludge ebbers et al 2015 burgos castillo et al 2018 p solubilization is up to 80 after acidification but the addition of high concentrations of acids is an obstacle to this process due to the secondary pollution and high operating costs volatile fatty acids vfa recovery sludge contains a large amount of c making it a potential source for vfas recovery vfas can serve as carbon source for biological nutrients removal in wwtps and are the building blocks for the synthesis of bioplastics esters and bioproteins alloul et al 2018 vfas recovery from the sludge involves three steps viz solubilization fermentation and vfas extraction from the fermented supernatant the pretreatment methods including thermal hydrolysis microwave ultrasound and electrooxidation aim to break down the sludge flocs and enhance the sludge solubilization for improving the vfas productivity lee et al 2014 in the fermentation stage the methanogenesis process must be prevented for the vfas accumulation the anode and cathode are inserted into an ad reactor serving as the electrochemical regulator in the ef system it has been found that methanogenesis can be effectively suppressed for the vfas generation under an anode potential of 0 2 v versus ag agcl hirano et al 2013 wang et al 2020 the ef process generally produces vfas with a mixture of acetate and propionate jiang et al 2018 lin et al 2019 to obtain a highly pure vfa broth the electron pushing strategy has been proposed in which propionate can be selectively enriched by supplying cathodic h2 maintain a p h2 10 4 atm in the ef system angenent and kleerebezem 2011 salamah and randall 2020 however this strategy has not been thoroughly investigated more importantly the ef system still faces challenges of scaling up it is impractical to insert the electrodes inside an ad reactor of several meters of depth and diameter with a running electrical current as for the vfas extraction the electrodialysis process is used vfas exist as anions in the fermented supernatant and can be transferred through the anion exchange membrane to the anode chamber under an electrical field the electrodialysis process at 18 v and 60 min can achieve a vfas recovery effectiveness of up to 99 from the sludge fermentation broths jones et al 2015 furthermore the vfas productivity can be increased 1 4 folds when the sludge fermentation process is coupled with an electrodialysis process arslan et al 2017 this way the vfas toxicity during the ad process can effectively be relieved by the electrodialysis based vfas extraction de vrieze et al 2018 as it has been observed in a full scale ad plant the accumulated vfas can easily exceed 10 g cod l which is higher than the threshold of vfas inhibition concentration for acidogenesis 5 7 g cod l de vrieze et al 2015 a process that integrates a microbial electrochemical process and the electrodialysis process for in situ vfas recovery from sludge digestate has been designed and tested zhang and angelidaki 2015 in this process the electricity generated from the microbial electrochemical process drives the electrodialysis process for vfas recovery this process is of low energy demand 0 8 kwh kg vfas and is flexible on the ph control via the relief of the vfas accumulation although a 4 fold vfas production enhancement has been achieved in the in situ vfas recovery integrated process the reverse diffusion undermines the vfas recovery suggesting that the optimization process is necessary before scaling up pan et al 2018 perspectives on sludge resources recovery with electrochemical techniques the electrodialysis process is gaining increasing attention for sludge resources recovery the high recovery efficiency is one of its advantages moreover the in situ electro dialytic extractions of ammonia or vfas from the digestate can enhance the process stability by mitigating toxicity i e ammonia and vfas inhibitions however most of the studies on the subject are still limited to the laboratory or pilot scale the issues regarding the membrane e g short lifetime and fouling and intensive energy consumption are the major obstacles to the practical application of electrodialysis in addition the low concentration of resources in the sludge source restricts the efficacy of electrodialysis using a concentrated sludge source such as sludge ash 90 g p kg ts can promote the development of the electrochemical process for resource recovery ottosen jensen and kirkelund 2016 on the one hand advancements in antifouling membranes and electrode materials will drive the development of electrodialysis titanium electrodes coated with ruo2 and iro2 are reversible and can be used for over 10 years with a current density of less than 4 ma cm2 veerman et al 2010 further increases in electrode lifetime can be achieved by using advanced coatings such as mixed metal oxide and magnéli phase tino2n 1 materials guo jing and chaplin 2016 however carbon electrodes with less mechanical stability may have a shorter lifetime when used for electrodialysis overall the commercialization of the electrodialysis based process e g electrodialysis reversal stock membranes connection is worth exploring shi et al 2019 more importantly whether or not the recovered sludge resources can offset the costs of electrodialysis requires verification prior to upscaling the process conclusions the electrochemical based process has been applied to a variety of sludge treatments in laboratory pilot and full scale trials electrochemical process using high voltage kv microsecond is more competitive than those using micro mv and low v voltage for enhancing biogas production from ad of sludge the electro osmotic process has been commercialized owing to its merits of simultaneously achieving sludge dewatering controlling odor and removing pathogens however its high investment and electrode stability preclude its promotion although electrochemical pretreatment is effective and easy to control for sludge handling it is still limited to the laboratory scale due to the high operating cost and halogen by products formation based on the findings of a pilot trial for metals removal the electrochemical based process is more economically viable for soil or sediment remediation than for sludge treatment electrodialysis is widely applied for nutrients and vfas recovery and

wwtp wastewater treatment plant introduction the population explosion has boosted the production of domestic wastewater which is typically treated using the biological activated sludge process as a result huge amounts of waste sludge are generated as a by product at a rate of 3 5 v v of influent currently 30 million tonnes 70 water content of dry sludge are produced annually mulchandani and westerhoff 2016 waste sludge not only contains significant amounts of pathogens and heavy metals but it also emits strong malodors posing a severe threat to the surrounding environments arthurson 2008 waste sludge must be treated properly to improve dewaterability eliminate pathogens and control malodour for space saving and safe disposal although anaerobic digestion ad technology e g cambi biothelys exelys lysotherm and turbotec can reduce sludge volume while recovering energy rich biogas i e ch4 shen et al 2015 kleerebezem et al 2015 not all ad processes can achieve energy self

thereby increasing the operation costs lee and liu 2000 chen et al 2002 furthermore pathogens including fecal coliforms usually increase in the sludge cake after the dewatering process compared with the raw sludge chen et al 2011 erkan and sanin 2013 the pathogen enriched sludge cake further emits malodors which require subsequent disinfection and deodorization e g the addition of fecl3 or naclo

competitive considering the presence of impurities such as heavy metals in the sludge peccia 2015 as the most abundant resource in sludge c recovery by sludge fermentation for bioplastics synthesis 110 120 us dry tonne sludge has drawn growing interest rather than methane recovery however it demands a full scale practical evaluation da ros et al 2020 meanwhile other processes for recovering high value resources from sludge have emerged including biopolymer kehrein et al 2020 nanocellulose espíndola et al 2020 bio crude thomsen et al 2020 and bioprotein xiao and zhou 2020 biological e g enzymatic catalysis chemical e g oxidants addition and physical e g microwave and hydrothermal means for sludge treatment and resource recovery have extensively been investigated liu et al 2018a raheem et al 2018 zan et al 2019 in the last decade there has been a growing interest in the electrochemical process owing to its merits fig 1 particularly its minimal chemical use small reactor footprint and eases of installment and operation sirés et al 2014 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 besides the high salt content of the sludge nearly 1 3 ms cm of conductivity resulting from industrial wastewater shock loads or seawater infiltration facilitates application of the electrochemical process ségalen et al 2015 he et al 2017 for instance full scale implementation of the high voltage pretreatment 10 kv opencel process resulted in a 40 increase in biogas production via the ad of waste sludge rittmann et al 2008 making the sludge treatment plant energy self sufficient and economically feasible in addition the electro dewatering process can reduce the water content of sludge from approximately 80 to less than 40 while eliminating sludge malodor and pathogens without chemical dosing resulting in significant cost savings mahmoud et al 2018 zeng et al 2019a the process is versatile and it has demonstrated superior performance in removing heavy metals tang et al 2018 and recovering nutrients and vfas from sludge pan et al 2018 zeng et al 2021 nonetheless most studies focus on improving the effectiveness of the electrochemical process without highlighting the limitations of the process including the electrode scaling caused by organic deposition extra addition of electrolytes such as nacl to the low conductance wastes and high energy consumption particularly in a full scale plant also the environmental impacts e g toxic by products cathodic hydrogen emission associated with the electrochemical process and its potential applications have yet to be fully understood with the above in mind the present paper highlights the potential practical applications of the electrochemical process with emphases on 1 the effective treatment and safe disposal of the sludge and 2 the feasibility of recovering resources from the sludge in the first section the improvements to the ad and dewatering processes heavy metals removal pathogens inactivation and malodors control are considered while the second section reviews the state of knowledge regarding the electrochemical process assistant recovery of n p and vfas from sludge the mechanisms involved in the electrochemical process are critically reviewed and perspectives and future research directions discussed application domain of electrochemical process in sludge treatment the electrochemical processes for sludge treatment can be subdivided into three categories based on the input voltage namely micro voltage mv low voltage v and high voltage kv processes the different voltage ranges lead to different electrochemical mechanisms fig 2 typically the micro voltage range is used in the bio electrochemical system rabaey and rozendal 2010 wang et al 2015a schröder et al 2015 the low voltage range is utilized to enhance the sludge dewaterability and biodegradability huang et al 2021 kill pathogens and remove heavy metals zeng et al 2019a while the high voltage range is applied to improve the biogas production of the ad process rittmann et al 2008 anaerobic digestion enhancement the ad process is the most commonly used process for sludge stabilization and energy recovery enhancing the methane production of the ad process is the priority for achieving the energy self sufficiency of a conventional wwtp theoretically the specific methane production of approximately 300 ml ch4 g volatile solids vs is required to offset the total energy demand of a conventional wwtp operation cano et al 2015 however an average yield of nearly 250 ml ch4 g vs can be produced during the ad process wan et al 2016 to enhance the ad process performance the low and high voltage v kv electrochemical pretreatment and in situ micro voltage mv electrochemical assisted process were explored table 1 electrochemical pretreatment of sludge the pretreatment of the sludge aims to solubilize it and accelerate its hydrolysis which is the limiting step of the ad process for the low voltage 100 v pretreatment the fundamental principles are to disintegrate the flocs structure and break down the cellular membrane via the direct electric force and indirect oxidation the electric force created by the input charges can cause the dissolution of the cytoplasma rahmani et al 2015 zhan et al 2015 meanwhile various oxidants including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals oh hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite hocl and ocl can be produced in the electrochemical process via electrooxidation and electrochlorination christensen et al 2013 kapałka et al 2009 p a christensen et al 2013 xiao et al 2019 which further disturb the sludge flocs however the inhibitory effect of the produced oxidant on subsequent ad has not been reported in addition the ohmic heating generated during the low voltage electrochemical process can uniformly penetrate and diffuse throughout the sludge matrix enhancing the sludge solubilization via an increased temperature of up to 70 c pei et al 2019 sakr and liu 2014 the first low voltage electrochemical sludge pretreatment trial was conducted at 12 v for 15 h the methane yield increased to 318 ml g vs which represented increases of 31 compared with its control charles et al 2013 although the increased methane production can offset the consumed energy a long duration pretreatment 15 h limits its application it has been reported that the treatment duration and energy consumption can be reduced by increasing the input voltage with the pretreatment of 20 v for 40 min increases in biogas yield of up to 63 were recorded yang et al 2014 the addition of oxidants namely h2o2 and naclo during the electrochemical pretreatment have resulted in a synergistic effect for improving the methane production feki et al 2015 xu et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 combining the electrochemical pretreatment 200 v 45 min and naclo dosing increased the methane yield by 2 folds in a pilot ad plant yuan et al 2016 this pilot plant also showed a profit of nearly 20 30 us m3 wet sludge for the high voltage kv pretreatment in microseconds the electroporation and degradation of the complex organics are the core mechanisms rittmann et al 2008 little oxidants are produced and the ohmic heating is marginal due to the short treatment duration the high strength electrical field creates a polarization effect directly disturbing the elastic bilayer structure of the sludge i e the cell membrane sludge flocs are composed of phospholipids and peptidoglycans carrying a net negative charge making the cell membrane more vulnerable to the strong electrical field kopplow et al 2004 fig 2 the full scale application of the high voltage kv pretreatment with a rapid contact time in microseconds is promising for sludge handling a net economic benefit of approximately us 540 000 including profits from electricity generation and operating and maintenance costs can be achieved for a conventional wwtp treating 380 m3 wet sludge day with a 30 kv pulsed voltage pretreatment rittmann et al 2008 this approach not only obviates the generation of electrochemical toxicants namely chlorate and perchlorate zhen et al 2014 but it also significantly minimizes the reactor footprint and capital costs several high voltage based technologies including opencel biocrack and powermod have been successfully commercialized for instance the full scale opencel at the northwest water reclamation plant in mesa yielded 60 increase in biogas production and 40 reductions in biosolids long and bullard 2012 in addition biocrack can increase biogas yield by 20 while offering downstream energy savings from pumping and mixing of about 30 chiavola et al 2015 however the sludge characteristics are variable in different regions and standard operations of biocrack for different sludge treatments have not been well established in situ electrochemical assisted ad process in an in situ electrochemical assisted ad process typically referred to as a micro voltage electrochemical process the electrodes are continually inserted into the sludge digester serving as an electrochemical regulator the micro voltage mv electrochemical process stimulates the bacterial activity and enhances the methane production of the ad process as shown in fig 2 and table 1 in an electrochemical assisted ad system the electrode materials having enlarged surface area e g carbon fiber brush 7170 m2 m3 are typically designed to maximize the contact area logan et al 2007 the direct interspecies electron transfer and intermediates e g hydrogen acetate and formate formed during the electrochemical ad system contribute to the enhancement of methane production zhao et al 2015 sarker et al 2018 for instance the cathodic hydrogen production can promote the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens guo et al 2013 liu et al 2016 gajaraj et al 2017 an approximately 14 fold methane production over the control has been achieved at the voltage of 1800 mv with the h2 yield at nearly 10 ml g vss guo et al 2013 however the voltages of 300 mv 600 mv and 800 mv have been considered as the optimal input voltages for stimulating the hydrogenotrophic methanogens e g methanomicrobiales and methanobacteriales liu et al 2016 chen et al 2016 gajaraj et al 2017 this inconsistency over the selection of the optimal voltage for enriching the hydrogenotrophic methanogens is probably due to the various inoculum and different sludge substrates furthermore feng et al 2016 have demonstrated that 500 600 mv can directly promote the activity of electrochemically active bacteria e g cloacamona on the electrode surface this observation has also been supported by asztalos and kim 2015 the latter have demonstrated that a high methane content of biogas of nearly 95 can be reached in an electrochemical assisted ad system where colacamona is dominant nonetheless the above studies have limited themselves to the laboratory scale level for concept verification for further development the main challenges including the electrode fouling mass transfer limitation and ohmic polarization should be addressed perspectives on ad enhancement with electrochemical process one of the primary barriers of restricting the electrochemistry based ad process application is its intensive energy consumption generally the energy consumption of sludge pretreatment needs to be less than 0 2 kwh kg total solids ts for achieving energy self efficiency for a conventional wwtp cano et al 2015 the full scale implementation of the high voltage process opencel and powermod is sometimes energy inefficient nearly 0 15 0 3 kwh kg ts cano et al 2015 the energy consumption has been found to be significantly low 0 06 kwh kg ts for a low voltage pretreatment process in a pilot scale trial 1 5 m3 wet sludge treatment at 200 v 45 mins yuan et al 2016 however during the low voltage sludge pretreatment of this trial the foam h2 and o2 and scum generations regularly caused operating and safety issues it is believed that the sludge hydraulic recycling or coarse bubble aeration is a solution to the scum and foam issues this is also given that the flammability limit of h2 in the air mixture is 4 v v theoretically the maximum h2 vol in an electrochemical process is about 1 v v at a current density of 50 ma cm2 while this current density is safe and sufficient for running an electrochemical reactor in terms of the flammability limit according to the second faraday s law alsheyab et al 2008 it is recommended that the gas evacuation be installed the lifespan of an electrode is another challenge for electrochemical sludge treatment electrochemical efficacy is reduced when electrode coating material e g ruo2 iro2 tao2 dissolves periodical reversal of the electrode polarity can mitigate the electrode fouling and dissolution resulting in a longer service lifetime chow et al 2021 moreover it is recommended to recycle and reuse damaged electrodes for coating material repair which can dramatically reduce the electrode expense another concern regarding the ad process is the low cod capture via the methane recovery in practice approximately 14 of the total cod in the influent can ultimately be reused as biogas through the ad process for heat and power generations hao et al 2019 the ad process can be installed at the beginning a stage of conventional municipal wastewater treatment processes to enhance the cod capture by up to 65 liu et al 2018a particularly the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is ideal for the a stage process due to its robustness under climate temperature conditions li 2016 however membrane biofouling is the bottleneck for the development of an anmbr for mainstream cod capture cheng et al 2018 supplying a micro voltage electrochemical process to the conductive membrane in the anmbr can mitigate the biofouling effect and also upgrade the methane composition which has become the focus in recent studies katuri et al 2014 yang et al 2018 sludge dewaterability the dewatering process is an essential step for volume reduction during sludge treatment which ultimately saves the costs of transportation and final disposal the electrochemical process can effectively improve the sludge dewaterability and it is typically operated under two types of modes namely 1 the non pressure mode that consists of the electrochemical pretreatment and 2 the pressure mode that consists of the electro osmotic dewatering non pressure electrochemical pretreatment sludge typically contains four types of water i e free water interstitial water surface water and bound water tsang and vesilind 1990 free water can effectively be removed by the conventional dewatering processes including gravity settling filtration and centrifugation the interstitial water surface water particles bond and bound water intercellular and chemically bond cannot be dewatered easily due to their strong bonds with sludge flocs the non pressure electrochemical pretreatment is extensively being investigated and tested nowadays as summarized in table 2 typically low voltage electrochemical pretreatment is applied for enhancing the sludge dewaterability the principle being to disintegrate the hydrated and rigid structure of the sludge and break down the cell membrane via electrooxidation and electroporation under the ambient temperature and pressure this way the interstitial surface and bound waters can be released thus facilitating the following dewatering process such as belt filtration and centrifuge fig 3 a the low voltage electrochemical pretreatment 20 v 20 min was initially tested in 2011 and nearly 37 decreases in the capillary suction time cst of sludge were observed yuan et al 2011 an increase voltage of up to 30 v further reduced the specific resistance to filtration srf by 99 and cst by 76 compared to the control gharibi et al 2013 nevertheless voltages over 30 v deteriorated the sludge dewaterability due to the increase of sludge viscosity via the excessive release of the extracellular polymer substances eps for instance the sludge viscosity increased from nearly 140 mpa s in the control to nearly 160 mpa s after a 50 v pretreatment yuan et al 2011 gharibi et al 2013 applying a high voltage also leads to a high energy consumption to further improve the dewaterability at low voltage the dosing of chemicals including persulfate s2o8 2 ferrous ion fe2 zero valent iron fe0 permanganate mno4 and bisulfite hso3 into the electrochemical process has been investigated zhen et al 2013 li et al 2016 guo et al 2017 it has been found that the strong oxidants e g s2o8 2 and mno4 can disrupt the sludge flocs and crack the cells thereby enhancing the release of bound water guo et al 2017 furthermore the fe0 s2o8 2 addition can create a synergetic effect with low voltages supply of 20 40 v to improve the sludge dewatering process li et al 2016 the electrical field can induce the cell lysis and fe0 can simultaneously activate s2o8 2 for so4 2 radical generation which can further decompose the soluble eps a significantly high dewaterability enhancement has been obtained evidenced by the decreases of srf and cst of over 90 with the addition of the fenton reagent or nacl in an electrochemical process masihi and gholikandi 2018 xiao et al 2019 the cost of adding the fenton reagent 41 8 us t dry sludge ds is significantly lower than those of nacl 182 9 us t ds and fe0 additions 134 us t ds in the electrochemical process more importantly the fenton addition has been found to be more cost efficient for improving sludge dewaterability than the chemical free electrochemical system 82 us t ds drogui et al 2013 owing to the activation of the synergistic effect the non pressure electrochemical pretreatment 8 v 35 min has been tested in a pilot reactor treating 30 tonnes of wet sludge per day with a water content of 99 she et al 2017 after the belt filtration the water content of sludge cake was 65 but the total operating cost with an electrochemical pretreatment 29 us t wet sludge is much higher than the traditional dewatering process 18 us t wet sludge the intensive energy consumption and high operating costs have been responsible for the non industrial application of the electrochemical sludge pretreatment to this day pressure mode electro osmotic dewatering the electro osmotic dewatering process a combination of mechanical force and electric field improves the sludge liquid solid separation and reduces the sludge water content fig 3 it was first proposed for peat dewatering in the 1900s and later applied for sludge dewatering kondoh and hiraoka 1990 various mechanisms including electrophoresis electro migration electro osmosis and electrochemical reactions play essential roles in the electro osmotic dewatering process which were well reviewed by mahmoud et al 2010 and tuan et al 2012 this section focuses on the latest engineering advances and industrial applications of the electro osmotic sludge dewatering process as shown in table 2 optimizing the operating parameters of the electro osmotic dewatering process is important polyelectrolyte e g polyacrylamide was typically used for sludge conditioning before the electro osmotic dewatering process prior to the years 2000s it was later found that the macromolecular polyelectrolyte addition had negative effects including an increase in the filtration resistance in an electro osmotic system saveyn et al 2005 however citeau et al 2011 demonstrated that polyelectrolyte did not affect the electro osmotic system whatever the polyelectrolyte density and molecular weight were in other words polyelectrolyte was not needed for the electro osmotic dewatering process for the sake of chemicals saving 20 30 of total operation costs this was to be expected given that the total charges in the sludge were several orders of magnitude greater than those of the added polyelectrolytes mikkelsen 2003 conductivity is another key parameter in the electro osmotic dewatering process higher conductivity of anaerobically digested sludge 4 5 ms cm than that of waste activated sludge 1 3 ms cm leads to a faster dewatering rate and a lower water content of digested sludge cake visigalli et al 2017 the electro osmotic dewatering is more applicable to sludge with high conductivity however a significantly high conductivity 8 ms cm allows current to bypass the solid phase via the liquid phase due to the reduction of the electrical double layer of the particles thus deteriorating the dewaterability mahmoud et al 2018 furthermore the input voltage as the key variable in the energy consumption has required consideration to achieve the optimal dewatering performance a decrease in the input voltage from 50 v to 10 v can reduce the energy consumption from 0 4 to 0 08 kwh kg h2oremoved yu et al 2017 but the lowest water content of the sludge cake 35 40 has been obtained at the highest voltage input of 50 v mahmoud et al 2011 the optimal operation of the electro osmotic dewatering process is largely dependent on a specific case the industrial scale sludge electro osmotic dewatering process has first been successfully applied in japan at three wwtps kondoh and hiraoka 1990 during the process operation the sludge underwent pressure filtration for 20 min with the addition of cacl2 and then was subjected to an electro osmotic process this operating mode maximizes the efficacy of the input energy which has also been recommended by saveyn et al 2005 the total operating costs for the electro osmotic dewatering process plants 30 35 us t ds was found to be much lower than those of the conventional filter press 40 us t ds and belt press 64 us t ds chen et al 2002 process plants moreover its energy consumption 0 24 kwh kg h2oremoved has merely been 20 40 of the thermal drying olivier et al 2014 perspectives on electrochemical treatment for sludge dewatering in terms of the energy saving and reduction of the water content the pressure mode process i e electro osmotic dewatering has performed better than the non pressure mode process i e electrochemical pretreatment the electro osmotic dewatering systems have been commercialized including cinetik from ovivo inc usa elode from ace korea inc korea and electrokinetic united kingdom they offer similar electro osmotic dewatering processes and claim that the sludge products of cinetik and elode can be directly used for land and agriculture applications nonetheless these products are not yet popular for sludge dewatering due to the high capital investment costs for instance the market price for an electro osmotic dewatering unit with a one ton treatment capacity is us 60 000 80 000 in terms of electrochemical pretreatment for dewaterability enhancement it is practically unpopular for industrial application and limited to lab scale investigation presently because polymer addition has been well developed and accepted in wwtps for achieving effective sludge dewatering electrochemical pretreatment trials are not promoted at the current stage due to the additional capital investment if extra benefits such as odor control and pathogen removal can be provided in addition to improving dewaterability zeng et al 2019b it will increase wwtps interest in adopting this new technology nonetheless the equipment service life and maintenance are also concerns electrode scaling and damage often inevitably appear in the electro osmotic dewatering systems zhang et al 2017 moreover calcium and magnesium in the sludge migrate to the cathode driven by the electric field and precipitate on the cathode surface as caco3 and mg oh 2 impeding the process effectiveness for the anode the dissolution and peeling of the conductive coating are problematic the cost of the regular replacement of the electrodes generally accounts for nearly 18 of the equipment operating costs zhang et al 2017 according to the successful practice of the electro osmotic sludge dewatering process the carbon electrode is very competitive kondoh and hiraoka 1990 the carbon electrode is durable and cheap without issues of scaling in addition to the electrode selection a compact and modular design for reducing the investment costs is desirable heavy metals removal around 50 80 of metals in sewage can be eventually accumulated in the sludge pathak et al 2009 resulting in a 0 5 2 0 metal content in the sludge as dry weight babel et al 2006 toxic metals including cd cr cu and pb in the sludge pose a threat to public health if they enter the ecological cycle the presence of metals also restricts the land or agriculture application of the sludge an electro kinetic process has been developed for the remediation of metal contaminated sludge the core components in the electro kinetic system are the cathode e g stainless steel and anode e g graphite which are separated by two ion selective membranes fig 4 driven by the electrical field e g input voltage of 30 50 v metal cations cross the ion selective membranes and drift toward the cathode chamber the electrolysis of water at the anode generates h ions and can reduce the ph below 3 causing metals dissociation from their particle forms in the sludge yuan and weng 2006 metals in sludge have different forms including soluble exchangeable adsorbed organic bonded and inorganic bonded metals removal efficiencies highly depend on their chemical speciation for instance metals with high motilities i e soluble and exchangeable can easily be removed from the sludge by the electro kinetic process peng and tian 2010 to improve the overall metal removal efficiency additives including acids hno3 surfactants rhamnolipid and electrolytes nacl are often used to solubilize the heavy metals with the addition of hno3 at a ph of 2 0 for 24 h table 3 95 of zn 96 of cu 90 of ni and 68 of cr can be removed by the electro kinetic treatment wang et al 2005 with the same electric voltage gradient 1 25 v cm and electrode material cathode and anode are graphite citric acid has been found to be a better additive than tap water and sodium dodecyl sulfate a surfactant for metals removal cu pb ni zn and cr yuan and weng 2006 peng and tian 2010 however the nonbiodegradable properties of these organic acids e g citric acid and surfactants are major concerns given the secondary pollution that they create hence in recent years biosurfactants i e rhamnolipid saponin and sophorolipid have been tested owing to their high biodegradability ecological safety and low toxicity tang et al 2018 among these rhamnolipid performed the best in terms of heavy metal removal efficiency zn 70 cr and ni 60 owing to its higher content of the functional group of carboxyl than saponin and sophorolipid tang et al 2018 the first pilot trial of the electro kinetic process for metals removal from sludge was conducted in france zagury et al 1999 a volume of 60 l of industrial sludge from an oil and gas wwtp was treated with an input of 2 5 a 15 v and 33 zn were removed with an initial concentration of 3500 mg kg ts the total cost of this process including power consumption and acidification ph 4 5 hno3 addition was estimated at us 100 ton which is much cheaper than the landfilling cost of metal polluted industrial sludge us 165 245 ton in addition the metals removal of the anaerobically digested sludge cd 6 8 mg kg cr 115 6 mg kg cu 338 7 mg kg and pb 62 8 mg kg was investigated in a pilot scale reactor 60 l in korea kim et al 2002 subsequent to the electro kinetic process 2a 120 h with 1 m of h2so4 addition more than 70 metals were removed the ph was found to be the critical parameter affecting the electro kinetic process kim et al 2002 which corresponds with the result reported by xu et al 2017 acidification 2 5 ph 4 5 can effectively solubilize sludge thereby promoting the metals release increased concentration of the soluble metals and enhancing the metals removal through the electro kinetic process the electro kinetic process for metals removal from sludge is still in its early developing stages the operating parameters affecting the overall performance of this process have been investigated in lab scale studies with focuses on the chemical additive and ph variation a pilot trial has demonstrated that metal removal from industrial sludge with electro kinetic process is competitive zagury et al 1999 as for sewage sludge the economic feasibility has not been validated despite the metal s removal efficiency being high kim et al 2002 xu et al 2017 hence it has been suggested elsewhere that the relatively high costs of the electro kinetic process us 100 ton can restrict its application to sewage sludge treatment in which acidification us 35 55 ton is required babel and del mundo dacera 2006 however the electro kinetic process is viable for both soil and sediment remediations kim et al 2014 jeon et al 2015 lópez vizcaíno et al 2016 luo et al 2018 mao et al 2019 for instance the treatment costs of 40 50 us m2 using the electro kinetic process for full scale soil remediation are much lower than the conventional treatment costs of 100 us m2 alshawabkeh et al 1999 liu et al 2018b also given that the in situ soil remediation using the electro kinetic process does not require excavation and transport thus minimizing the soil disturbance this significantly reduces the treatment costs the feasibility for treating sewage sludge by the electro kinetic process is still underexplored pathogens removal high loads of human pathogens in feces and urine including salmonella spp listeria spp and e coli end up in sludge nearly 105 mpn g watanabe et al 1997 ultimately entering the ecosystem if sludge is not properly treated survey studies of infections among co workers and residents have indicated potential problems e g typhoid gastroenteritis skin rashes caused by enteric pathogens in the air and sludge samples lewis and gattie 2002 conventional processes for pathogens removal from sludge include drying mesophilic digestion and pasteurization however the drying and pasteurization processes are costly and the mesophilic digestion process usually reduces half of the pathogens to concentrations in the range of 102 103 mpn g ts arthurson 2008 zhao and liu 2019 the electrochemical process 10 30 v is effective in the disinfection of various types of waters and wastewaters including toilet wastewater huang et al 2016 urban wastewater anfruns estrada et al 2017 surface water schaefer et al 2017 and drinking water miao et al 2014 by the in situ production of oxidants e g ozone chlorine hydrogen peroxide in terms of sludge treatment the electrochemically produced chlorine plays an important role in pathogens removal in contrast the contribution of h2o2 to pathogens removal is limited due to its rapid decay rate in the sludge system the electrochemically generated chlorine reacts with ammonia and organic nitrogen forming chloramines e g nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 which contribute to pathogens removal cui et al 2013 for example a combination of 10 mg min l chlorine with 140 mg min l chloramine can achieve the 5 log inactivation of ms2 bacteriophage furst et al 2018 it has been reported that an elevated temperature caused by ohmic heating during the electrochemical process is another factor leading to pathogens inactivation with a 6 min electrochemical treatment at 40 v the sludge temperature can increase from 34 c to 100 c which leads to a 5 log reduction in total coliforms and a 4 log reduction in e coli daneshmand et al 2012 a similar finding has been reported by yin hoffmann and jiang 2018 whereby no e coli was detected after treatment with 18 v 120 min and the sludge temperature rose to nearly 70 c at high sludge temperature e g 95 c nh4 can be converted to nh3 gas which crosses the cellular lipid layer and disrupts the ph balance facilitating ohmic heat for pathogens inactivation takhtehfouladi et al 2013 although the electrochemical treatment is effective for the inactivation of pathogens few practical applications can be found in the literature the electrochemical approaches are effective for pathogens removal in lab scale studies however the by products formation e g chlorate perchlorate halogenated organic during the electrochemical sludge treatment is overlooked and deserves further attention considering their carcinogenic and mutagenic properties radjenovic and sedlak 2015 up to 100 mg l of chlorate and perchlorate can be generated in an electrochemical sewage treatment process which is equivalent to more than 100 folds the world health organization limiting concentration 0 7 mg l garcia segura et al 2015 however little information is available on the electrochemically formed by products during sludge treatment it is probably due to the high dilution rate of sludge filtrate after dewatering with the influent in the wwtp which reduces the toxicity of by products nonetheless minimizing the by product formation is crucial for further development of the electrochemical processes several approaches have emerged in reducing the by products formation for instance the cabeco process manufactured by condias germany can control the trihalomethanes potential human carcinogens concentration below 1 mg l regulation limit while maintaining the effective pathogens removal over 3 log reduction isidro et al 2018 the boron doped diamond bdd electrode is the key component of the cabeco process which induces ozone production via the reaction o2 2 oh o3 h2o it restricts chlorine production thus reducing the trihalomethanes formation a recent laboratory study has also shown that the nearly 5 log removal of e coli using a ti iro2 anode can be achieved without exceeding the disinfection by products guidelines schaefer et al 2015 this is due to the chloride concentration used in the above study being relatively low at nearly 100 mg l thereby diminishing the production of chlorine responsible for forming disinfection by products in addition shortening the reaction time 1 h and lowering the current density 50 a m2 can minimize the by product generation huang et al 2016 odor control the odor nuisance is often generated from the sludge during its storage dewatering transportation and disposal hydrogen sulfide h2s is the principal compound responsible for sludge odor emission the presence of sulfate so4 2 in sludge brought from the mixing with seawater in the seawater for toilet flushing system and sulfate containing coagulation alum addition cause the sulfide generation mediated by the biological sulfate reduction process zeng et al 2019a for instance saline sludge is particularly odorous and produces a high sulfide concentration 100 300 mg s l to prevent sulfide formation ferric chloride is typically used in wwtps unfortunately the ferric chloride dosing inevitably deteriorates the disinfection efficacy for the ultraviolet system although dosing with oxidants including chlorine can effectively eliminate sulfide sulfide can be regenerated during sludge transportation after several hours of being suppressed the electro osmotic process is effective in suppressing the emission of sulfur compounds from sludge methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide concentrations can be reduced by 93 and 92 respectively after the electro osmotic sludge treatment using a cinetik ck lab model at 60 v 5 5 a and 140 kpa ovivo canada navab daneshmand et al 2014 with a low energy input of 12 v 300 ma under ambient temperature and pressure about 99 of h2s g and 97 of dissolved sulfide produced from saline sludge can be suppressed for a month of anaerobic storage zeng et al 2019a electrochemical treatment disrupts metal binding functional groups such as c o in the sludge resulting in the release of metals e g fe and mn these soluble metals can precipitate the sulfide produced during biological sulfate reduction furthermore the effect of the electrochemically produced chlorine on sulfide oxidation should be marginal as chlorine can be rapidly consumed by the organics in the sludge zeng et al 2019a nonetheless the electrochemically produced chlorine can assist in breaking down the sludge flocs thereby enhancing the metals release for sulfide precipitation it should be noted that the electrode material in the electrochemical process determines the efficacy of the sludge sulfide control zeng et al 2020 the carbon base electrode can significantly reduce the sludge sulfide by over 99 through treatment at 10 v for 15 mins while the ti based electrode can marginally enhance the sulfide production however the underlying mechanisms of the electrochemical sludge sulfide control using different electrode materials remain unclear one pilot scale 700 l study for sewage sludge odor control has been conducted in which 100 h2s g 97 dimethyl sulfide and 100 free ammonia were removed with an input voltage of 8 v for 35 min she et al 2017 it was mentioned that the electrochemically produced chlorine plays a critical role in sulfide oxidation moreover the energy consumption of the pilot scale study has been high 150 kwh m3 over 10 times higher than that of the lab scale study 9 kwh m3 zeng et al 2019a hence the scaling up the electrochemical process for sludge odor control requires further investigation to achieve the energy saving decreasing the electrode distance using the bipolar electrode connection and supplying the pulsed electrical input are effective ways to minimize the energy consumption of the electrochemical process from the practical point of view application of electrochemical process for resources recovery turning the sludge into valuable resource provides a new sustainable path for sludge management beyond treatment and safe disposal the electrochemical process draws scientific attention to sludge resources recovery due to its multi functional working mechanisms including electrooxidation electrodialysis and electromigration however research on the underlying mechanisms and practical applications of the sludge based resources recovery involving electrochemical processes is lacking this section focuses on nutrients n and p and c recovery the shortcomings and merits of the different electrochemical approaches are reviewed for resource recovery from sludge nitrogen recovery the nitrogen content accounts for 3 4 of the dry mass in the sludge and mainly exists in proteins peccia 2015 proteins can be broken down into ammonia during the ad process with a 700 1500 mg l concentration in reject water after sludge dewatering or anaerobic digestate quist jensen et al 2018 thornton et al 2007 ammonia is the primary raw material for fertilizers it can be directly recovered from digestate using the electrodialysis process the electrodialysis process consists of three components namely the ion exchange membranes anode and cathode in which the ion exchange membranes separate the anode and cathode compartments in an electrodialysis process ammonium ions diffuse from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber through the cation exchange membrane mondor et al 2008 this process has been used for ammonia recovery from swine manure mondor et al 2008 ippersiel et al 2012 sotres et al 2015 domestic wastewater zhang and angelidaki 2015 and anthropogenic urine pronk biebow and boller 2006 it is estimated that an electrodialysis process can recover nearly 1 3 g n l from the sludge digestate creating a net profit of nearly 500 us day for a 1000 m3 digester desloover et al 2012 nonetheless the energy consumption of the electrodialysis process 17 kwh kg n is greater than that of the conventional nitrogen recovery process including air stripping 10 13 kwh kg n mehta et al 2015 reducing the energy consumption the electrodialysis process can further increase the net profit for nh4 n recovery the latest electrodialysis pilot study 24 l reactor volume for nh4 n recovery has demonstrated that the energy consumption can be reduced to 4 9 kwh kg n which is competitive ward et al 2018 in this pilot study a total of 31 cation exchange membranes and 30 anion exchange membranes were installed forming an electrodialysis stack however membrane fouling is still the major challenge for electrodialysis and chemical addition is inevitable for controlling membrane fouling higher conductivity feeds i e more concentrated feed can help decrease the energy consumption and improve the membranes lifetime overall electrodialysis was typically used for nh4 n recovery from the sludge digestate table 4 and the energy consumption has been reduced to 2 kwh kg n in the latest study meng et al 2021 the power to protein concept has recently been proposed by verstraete clauwaert and vlaeminck 2016 it turns nh4 co2 and h2 into high value proteins in this concept h2 is produced by water electrolysis for the hydrogen oxidizing bacteria hob growth matassa et al 2015 the hob produces single cell proteins with the substrate of h2 co2 and nh3 co2 and nh3 are obtained from the ad biogas and digestate respectively while the electrolytic h2 production can be driven by wind energy or solar source mishra et al 2020 it has been claimed that using the wind energy average power per unit area of 2 w m2 the assisted electrolytic h2 production for the hob growth 2 4 kg dry biomass kg h2 can yield up to 3120 tonnes of microbial proteins per year matassa et al 2015 this idea has further been investigated by molitor et al 2019 who have proposed a two stage bioprocess converting eclectic power and co2 into high quality single cell proteins in the first stage co2 is fixed by the anaerobic acetogenic bacteria for acetate production c ljungdahlii at 35 c and a ph of 5 7 in the second stage acetate as the intermediate metabolite is the substrate for cultivating yeasts or fungi for single cell proteins synthesis s cerevisiae at 30 c and a ph of 5 0 the protein production rate of 2 3 g l h at a commercial scale can be achieved using this two stage bioprocess phosphorus recovery p resource is irreplaceable and estimated to run out by 2050 with a global consumption rate of 20 million tonnes per year cordell et al 2011 the recovery of p has been one of the major concerns globally sludge contains 2 3 p in dry mass mainly present in the organic form rittmann and mccarty 2012 globally nearly five million tonne p year can be recovered from sludge mateo sagasta et al 2015 this amount of potentially recoverable p is drawing attention from researchers p can be effectively recovered from sludge using the electrodialysis process under the electrical field fig 5 the soluble p e g po4 3 moves toward the anode and passes through the anion exchange membranes that allow only negatively charged species to filter through while rejecting positively charged species other negative ions can move towards the anode end e g chloride sulfate the selection of sludge sources for p recovery is crucial generally the enhanced biological p removal ebpr sludge sludge digestate and sludge ash are the target sources for p recovery table 4 up to 1500 mg p l can be released from the ebpr sludge and driven to the anode chamber achieving a p recovery effectiveness of 96 under a current density of 10 ma cm2 wang et al 2013 the energy consumption 5 kwh kg p can be much lower than that of the p recovery from the sludge digestate 17 kwh kg p zhang et al 2013 p can also be recovered from the sludge digestate in the form of struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o wang et al 2010 kruk et al 2014 oliveira et al 2018 recovered p with electrodialysis was fed to a struvite reactor dosed with naoh and mgcl2 zhang 2013 over 90 of p have precipitated in the struvite reactor with an input of 5 v 0 2 a and energy consumption of nearly17 kwh kg p wang et al 2015b have demonstrated the feasibility of the electrodialysis process for the simultaneous recovery of 86 94 of p and 95 100 of nh4 in the form of struvite by dosing mgcl2 while several lab scale studies have showed the feasibility of the electrodialysis process for the recovery of p from sludge limited information regarding its practical application is available the p recovery effectiveness from digestate has to be over 56 of p per dry mass to make the recovery process profitable based on the investigation of a full scale plant namely the oxley creek wwtp which integrates struvite crystallization shu et al 2006 to enhance the electrodialysis process the ph adjustment is generally considered increasing the ph to 12 5 at the cathode chamber can solubilize nearly 120 mg p l from waste activated sludge to the bulk liquid and achieve 70 p recovery in 24 h guedes et al 2016 nevertheless the alkalic condition also induces the p precipitation on the other hand maintaining the ph below 2 in the cathode chamber and acidifying the sludge with the electro fenton pretreatment have been proposed for p recovery from anaerobically digested sludge ebbers et al 2015 burgos castillo et al 2018 p solubilization is up to 80 after acidification but the addition of high concentrations of acids is an obstacle to this process due to the secondary pollution and high operating costs volatile fatty acids vfa recovery sludge contains a large amount of c making it a potential source for vfas recovery vfas can serve as carbon source for biological nutrients removal in wwtps and are the building blocks for the synthesis of bioplastics esters and bioproteins alloul et al 2018 vfas recovery from the sludge involves three steps viz solubilization fermentation and vfas extraction from the fermented supernatant the pretreatment methods including thermal hydrolysis microwave ultrasound and electrooxidation aim to break down the sludge flocs and enhance the sludge solubilization for improving the vfas productivity lee et al 2014 in the fermentation stage the methanogenesis process must be prevented for the vfas accumulation the anode and cathode are inserted into an ad reactor serving as the electrochemical regulator in the ef system it has been found that methanogenesis can be effectively suppressed for the vfas generation under an anode potential of 0 2 v versus ag agcl hirano et al 2013 wang et al 2020 the ef process generally produces vfas with a mixture of acetate and propionate jiang et al 2018 lin et al 2019 to obtain a highly pure vfa broth the electron pushing strategy has been proposed in which propionate can be selectively enriched by supplying cathodic h2 maintain a p h2 10 4 atm in the ef system angenent and kleerebezem 2011 salamah and randall 2020 however this strategy has not been thoroughly investigated more importantly the ef system still faces challenges of scaling up it is impractical to insert the electrodes inside an ad reactor of several meters of depth and diameter with a running electrical current as for the vfas extraction the electrodialysis process is used vfas exist as anions in the fermented supernatant and can be transferred through the anion exchange membrane to the anode chamber under an electrical field the electrodialysis process at 18 v and 60 min can achieve a vfas recovery effectiveness of up to 99 from the sludge fermentation broths jones et al 2015 furthermore the vfas productivity can be increased 1 4 folds when the sludge fermentation process is coupled with an electrodialysis process arslan et al 2017 this way the vfas toxicity during the ad process can effectively be relieved by the electrodialysis based vfas extraction de vrieze et al 2018 as it has been observed in a full scale ad plant the accumulated vfas can easily exceed 10 g cod l which is higher than the threshold of vfas inhibition concentration for acidogenesis 5 7 g cod l de vrieze et al 2015 a process that integrates a microbial electrochemical process and the electrodialysis process for in situ vfas recovery from sludge digestate has been designed and tested zhang and angelidaki 2015 in this process the electricity generated from the microbial electrochemical process drives the electrodialysis process for vfas recovery this process is of low energy demand 0 8 kwh kg vfas and is flexible on the ph control via the relief of the vfas accumulation although a 4 fold vfas production enhancement has been achieved in the in situ vfas recovery integrated process the reverse diffusion undermines the vfas recovery suggesting that the optimization process is necessary before scaling up pan et al 2018 perspectives on sludge resources recovery with electrochemical techniques the electrodialysis process is gaining increasing attention for sludge resources recovery the high recovery efficiency is one of its advantages moreover the in situ electro dialytic extractions of ammonia or vfas from the digestate can enhance the process stability by mitigating toxicity i e ammonia and vfas inhibitions however most of the studies on the subject are still limited to the laboratory or pilot scale the issues regarding the membrane e g short lifetime and fouling and intensive energy consumption are the major obstacles to the practical application of electrodialysis in addition the low concentration of resources in the sludge source restricts the efficacy of electrodialysis using a concentrated sludge source such as sludge ash 90 g p kg ts can promote the development of the electrochemical process for resource recovery ottosen jensen and kirkelund 2016 on the one hand advancements in antifouling membranes and electrode materials will drive the development of electrodialysis titanium electrodes coated with ruo2 and iro2 are reversible and can be used for over 10 years with a current density of less than 4 ma cm2 veerman et al 2010 further increases in electrode lifetime can be achieved by using advanced coatings such as mixed metal oxide and magnéli phase tino2n 1 materials guo jing and chaplin 2016 however carbon electrodes with less mechanical stability may have a shorter lifetime when used for electrodialysis overall the commercialization of the electrodialysis based process e g electrodialysis reversal stock membranes connection is worth exploring shi et al 2019 more importantly whether or not the recovered sludge resources can offset the costs of electrodialysis requires verification prior to upscaling the process conclusions the electrochemical based process has been applied to a variety of sludge treatments in laboratory pilot and full scale trials electrochemical process using high voltage kv microsecond is more competitive than those using micro mv and low v voltage for enhancing biogas production from ad of sludge the electro osmotic process has been commercialized owing to its merits of simultaneously achieving sludge dewatering controlling odor and removing pathogens however its high investment and electrode stability preclude its promotion although electrochemical pretreatment is effective and easy to control for sludge handling it is still limited to the laboratory scale due to the high operating cost and halogen by products formation based on the findings of a pilot trial for metals removal the electrochemical based process is more economically viable for soil or sediment remediation than for sludge treatment electrodialysis is widely applied for nutrients and vfas recovery and recent studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in energy consumption despite the fact that a variety of challenges exist including energy consumption total cost process effectiveness and

n2 the reduced no3 could be transformed into other intermediates such as nitrite no2 nitrous oxide n2o and ammonia nh4 which may have direct or indirect negative impacts on the environment therefore increasing n2 selectivity is a significant challenge in reducing no3 in groundwater which seriously impedes the large scale implementation of available remediation technologies in this work we comprehensively overview the most recent advances in n2 selectivity regarding the understanding of emerging groundwater no3 removal technologies mechanisms of by product production and strategies to enhance the selective reduction of no3 to n2 are discussed in detail furthermore we proposed topics for further research and hope that the total environmental impacts of remediation schemes should be evaluated comprehensively by quantifying all potential intermediate products and promising strategies should be further developed to enhance n2 selectivity to improve the feasibility of related technologies in actual remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrate removal n2 selectivity groundwater zero valent iron biological denitrification bio electrochemical treatment 1 introduction groundwater is the dominant water source in most regions of the world and is the only water source in some arid countries such as saudi arabia and india adimalla and qian 2021 wang et al 2009 however due to extensive agricultural intensification and other nonagricultural nitrogen n sources xin et al 2019 a continuous rise in nitrate no3 concentrations in groundwater has been widely observed worldwide including in the united states glenn and james lester 2010 china zhai et al 2017b japan hosono et al 2013 india adimalla and qian 2021 several countries in the european union angelopoulos et al 2009 and particularly in developing countries no3 pollution in groundwater poses a substantial threat to human and ecological health on one hand ingesting no3 may induce diseases such as methemoglobinemia in infants blue baby syndrome and stomach cancer xu et al 2017a on the other hand high concentrations of no3 in groundwater may flow into coterminous surface water or seawater inducing eutrophication and toxic algal blooms ghafari et al 2008 thus developing technologies that efficiently treat no3 pollution in groundwater has increasingly attracted researchers attention various in and ex situ technologies involving physical chemical and biological treatment processes have been applied to remediate no3 contaminated groundwater cecconet et al 2020 huno et al 2018 however implementation of these technologies at larger scales has not occurred because of incomplete no3 reduction ideally the reduced no3 should be transformed into its harmless form n2 rather than some intermediates such as nitrite no2 nitrous oxide n2o and ammonia nh4 which may have direct or indirect negative impacts on the environment niu et al 2019 therefore in addition to augmenting no3 removal many studies have attempted to find efficient measures to promote the selective reduction of no3 to n2 to decrease the negative effects of intermediates liu and wang 2019 martínez et al 2017 tokazhanov et al 2020 in addition to characterize the complete reduction degree of no3 a new concept of n2 selectivity has been proposed defined as the ratio of the n2 yield to the amount of consumed no3 wei et al 2018 different technologies may display variable no3 removal performance and n2 selectivity chemical reduction available as both in situ and ex situ remediation methods attempts to reduce no3 to nh4 or n2 by employing reducing agents song et al 2020 zero valent iron zvi has been the most investigated typical reductant bare zvi possesses poor n2 selectivity wei et al 2018 although the n2 selectivity in the zvi system can be slightly improved by adjusting the hydrochemical parameters of the solution ph and oxidation reduction potential orp yang and lee 2005 and the size and dose of the zvi choe et al 2000 xiong et al 2009 owing to the limitations of zvi systems some zvi composites have been applied to increase n2 selectivity and reviewed by liu and wang 2019 carbon materials supported zvi zvi c that are capable of changing the ph and orp in solution song et al 2020 wei et al 2018 and zvi supported metallic materials that exhibit additional catalytic reduction lubphoo et al 2015 tang et al 2019 have substantial potential for removing no3 from groundwater and require to develop some strategies to further enhance n2 selectivity moreover catalytic and electrocatalytic reduction have substantial potential for removing no3 from groundwater but will more probably be adopted as ex situ remediation methods the strategies to increase n2 selectivity in both the aforementioned treatment systems have been reviewed in previous studies martínez et al 2017 tokazhanov et al 2020 n2 selectivity higher than 90 can be achieved with both the aforementioned technologies and the undesired formation of nh4 is more substantially reduced than in the zvi system biological denitrification is another traditional method for removing no3 and may produce some toxic denitrification species i e no2 n2o and nh4 capodici et al 2018 yang et al 2012 the proportion of which in final products varies with treatment conditions relevant investigations and discussions have been performed on the factors influencing the accumulation of intermediates during denitrification including the type and quantity of electron donors warneke et al 2011 yang et al 2012 hydraulic retention time hrt wang et al 2009 zhai et al 2017a temperature holtan hartwig et al 2002 hu et al 2011 and so on in recent decades an increasing number of researchers have focused on different combinations of conventional technologies such as microbial electro remediation which couples microbial physiology with electrochemistry sevda et al 2018 in the integrated system no3 can be converted to n2 by heterotrophic denitrification or by autotrophic denitrification cecconet et al 2020 studies have shown that complete denitrification in microbial electro remediation can be achieved by adjusting the conductivity of groundwater pous et al 2013 puig et al 2012 applying different voltage nguyen et al 2015 virdis et al 2009 or current ghafari et al 2009 virdis et al 2009 and using different reactor configurations callegari et al 2019 zhang et al 2014a in summary increasing n2 selectivity is a primary challenge in reducing no3 in groundwater which seriously impedes the widespread use of available remediation technologies recently critical reviews have been published on in and ex situ groundwater nitrate treatment technologies for improving nitrate removal efficiency by contrast n2 selectivity appears to be neglected in remediation performance evaluation and optimization although martínez et al 2017 made the first attempt to summarize the strategies to enhance n2 selectivity in the catalytic and electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate using metallic catalysts according to our review of the literature no literature has systematically reviewed the removal performance of no3 by different technologies from the perspective of product composition therefore this review aims to provide insights into the reduction products of no3 by different commonly used remediation technologies in groundwater and their governing mechanisms in addition the latest developments in improvement strategies for n2 selectivity are presented and research gaps and potential further research directions are proposed we hope that our review provides a reference for practical engineering to treat no3 polluted groundwater such that the performance is improved and the negative effects decrease 2 nitrate reduction by zvi 2 1 mechanisms and products of nitrate reduction by zvi hydrogen gas h2 and zerovalent electropositive metals such as fe al murphy 1991 mg kumar and chakraborty 2006 zn carlson 1986 can be utilized as the reductant to reduce no3 from water by chemical reduction however using al mg zn and h2 as the only electron donor for no3 reduction in groundwater has been far less studied in recent years mainly because of their low safety high cost short lifetime and so on by comparison zvi has been mostly employed as the electron donor for in situ and ex situ no3 removal from groundwater because of its strong reducing property low price and wide material sources tang et al 2019 different reaction pathways for no3 reduction by zvi have been proposed since the 1990s however a uniform mechanism has not been determined hwang et al 2011 the most widely accepted mechanism is the direct electron transfer from zvi to no3 which involves the reactions in eqs 1 4 suzuki et al 2012 yang and lee 2005 fig 1 a in addition studies have proposed that no3 reduction is accomplished step by step eqs 4 5 zhang et al 2017 no2 is formed first as a reactive intermediate and is only produced at the initial stage of the reaction yang and lee 2005 zhang et al 2017 fig 1 b additionally the adsorbed h atom hads ferrous iron fe2 and some iron oxides play non negligible roles in the chemical reduction of no3 by zvi for example fe2 can reduce no3 to nh4 according to eq 6 however the dominant role of fe2 is not to provide electrons but to facilitate the transfer of electrons from the fe0 core to no3 huang and zhang 2005 suzuki et al 2012 because it could enhance corrosion caused by fe0 and form magnetite fe3o4 eqs 7 8 xu et al 2012 1 5 f e 0 2 no

the aforementioned reactions eqs 1 6 cheng et al 1997 choe et al 2000 it is generally accepted that n2 is a clean harmless and expected product of no3 reduction table s1 summarizes the distribution of products under different reaction conditions when zvi was used to reduce no3 the 20 groups of experimental data from seven studies were investigated approximately 35 of the reviewed data showed that nh4 was the main reduction product of no3 accounting for more than 50 of the final products and no3 was completely converted into n2 in only 5 of all reviewed groups as nh4 is an undesirable secondary pollutant there is increasing research interest in the factors affecting the composition of products and measures to enhance n2 selectivity an overview of related studies is presented in the next section 2 2 strategies to improve n2 selectivity in nitrate reduction by zvi 2 2 1 adjustment of ph and orp based on the pourbaix diagram of n and fe see fig s1 in si the speciation of n and fe is related to the ph and orp of solution when zvi is employed to reduce no3 during the reaction between no3 and zvi the final product has been demonstrated to be more inclined to be nh4 under acidic conditions yang and lee 2005 zhang et al 2010 one possible explanation for this finding is that zvi corrosion and the formation of fe2 induced under acidic conditions lead to a rapid decrease in the orp to a value range suitable for nh4 production chen et al 2004 wei et al 2018 however as the reaction progresses the final product may have a favorable selectivity to n2 which can be attributed primarily to the increase in orp to the value which is favorable for n2 production due to the formation of oxides with the consumption of h yang and lee 2005 on the basis of these findings it is recommended to control ph and orp to the level which is beneficial for n2 production wei et al 2018 however this is accompanied by side effects such as the formation of iron oxide and the inhibition of no3 reduction in other words the application of bare zvi for nitrate removal is constrained by the inevitable trade off between n2 selectivity and removal efficiency therefore studies have attempted to combine zvi particles with biochar which can directly mediate orp and ph and promote the selectivity reduction of nitrate wei et al 2018 the specific mechanisms are discussed in section 3 1 further studies are necessary to explore more measures to control ph and orp at a suitable level in favor of increasing n2 selectivity and the removal efficiency of no3 should not be negatively affected 2 2 2 optimal selection of zvi size and dosage zvi of various sizes with variable properties may lead to significantly disparate compositions of no3 reduction products in groundwater contradictory findings on the final product distribution using nanoscale zvi nzvi and microscale zvi mzvi particles to reduce no3 have been reported some studies have shown that nzvi particles displayed a higher potential to transform no3 to n2 than mzvi particles did chen et al 2004 choe et al 2000 they have found that the final product was almost nh4 which was obtained by using mzvi while a certain percentage of n2 was obtained after the reaction when using nzvi the specific reasons for this must be further explained and verified however a different phenomenon was reported by hwang et al 2011 86 49 of the initial amount of no3 n was converted to nh4 n and the data from gas chromatography showed that n2 was not formed using nzvi to reduce no3 therefore a vital step is to collect more experimental data to further understand the conflicting findings and elucidate how the size of zvi can affect n2 selectivity which has significant implications for the optimization of zvi size in practical engineering applications 2 2 3 adjustment of zvi to nitrate molar ratio based on the no3 reduction stoichiometries in eqs 1 and 2 when no3 is reduced by zvi following the direct electron transfer pathway from zvi to no3 n2 is the dominant product when the ratio of zvi to no3 is approximately 2 5 and nh4 is a major product when the ratio of zvi to no3 is greater than or equal to 4 xiong et al 2009 in table s1 almost all of the investigated cases used relatively excessive zvi a ratio of zvi to no3 4 to reduce no3 with the final reduction product being almost nh4 in conclusion the distribution of the final products may depend on the zvi dose xiong et al 2009 recommended a ratio of zvi to no3 close to the stoichiometric coefficients of eq 1 to enhance the n2 selectivity 3 nitrate reduction by carbon materials supported zvi 3 1 mechanisms and products of nitrate reduction by carbon materials supported zvi the addition of engineered carbon materials such as biochar bc or activated carbon ac is considered a promising method to improve the remediation performance of zvi for no3 contaminated groundwater khalil et al 2017 no3 removal mechanisms using zvi c composites can be classified into two categories fig 2 the first category involves the adsorption process studies have suggested that incorporating zvi into carbon materials may enhance its adsorption capacity ahmad et al 2018 liu et al 2016a the second refers to chemical processes in which no3 adsorbed on carbon materials can be reduced by zvi in zvi c systems zvi can spontaneously form a mass of microscopic galvanic cells with carbon to promote no3 reduction zhou et al 2013 and no3 can be reduced by hads on the surface of carbon materials luo et al 2014b in the chemical process carbon materials can greatly facilitate the transfer of electrons or serve as electron shuttles to accelerate the removal of no3 by zvi pignatello et al 2017 wei et al 2018 fig 2 in a zvi c system the adsorbed no3 on the surface of carbon material can be further reduced to nh4 and n2 by zvi ahmad et al 2018 wei et al 2018 table 2 however the concentration levels of various products differed from those of the bare zvi system studies have suggested that using zvi c composites can increase the selectivity toward n2 song et al 2020 found that the combination uses of nzvi ac presented a much higher n2 selectivity 33 1 in nitrate reduction than that 13 5 by using nzvi alone similarly coupling zvi powder with ac can enhance the n2 selectivity to 19 5 compared to 7 in zvi powder only system they did not address a deep insight into the governing mechanisms about how different zvi types affect n2 selectivity wei et al 2018 observed the same phenomenon in a nzvi bc system the proportion of n2 could reach 60 of the reduced no3 n by using nzvi bc to remove no3 however only 5 7 of the removed no3 n selectively became dinitrogen in the zvi system why zvi bc composites can increase n2 selectivity has been reported studies have revealed that zvi bc can selectively adsorb nh4 by the physical adsorption capacity of bc decreasing the nh4 proportion and increasing the n2 proportion in the final products liu et al 2020a fig 2 the dominant process of nh4 adsorption may be associated with acid functional groups such as carboxyl carbonyl and phenolic groups sumaraj et al 2020 wang et al 2015 in addition bc can control the ph of the solution inhibiting the oxidation of zvi and decreasing the orp of the solution to a suitable range in favor of forming n2 wei et al 2018 fig 2 wang et al 2019 deciphered why bc can decrease zvi oxidation tendency 1 the porous structure of bc decreases the contact between oxygen and zvi 2 the complexation between functional groups and iron ions inhibits the formation of oxide 3 the acid functional groups neutralize hydroxide and 4 the reducing functional groups offer a reductive environment although the combination of zvi and carbon materials has broad application prospects in no3 removal with high n2 selectivity information on the role of zvi types or carbon materials especially for ac in enhancing n2 selectivity is relatively limited further work is necessary to explain the synergetic effect of different constituents in the zvi c materials that increase n2 selectivity in no3 reduction 3 2 strategies to improve n2 selectivity in nitrate reduction using carbon materials supported zvi studies have shown that the combined utilization of zvi and carbon materials increased n2 selectivity by 12 4 54 3 compared with the bare zvi system wei et al 2018 although only limited data are available some studies have attempted to further improve n2 selectivity in removing no3 by adding denitrifying microorganisms to the zvi bc system oh et al 2016 wang et al 2019 in zvi microbe bc systems the bc can denote electrons to denitrifying bacteria and the pore structure of bc can increase the watery space thereby increasing the stability of an anaerobic environment to support denitrification tian et al 2019 in addition some strategies like selecting optimal carbon materials al bahri et al 2013 or modifying carbon materials by using various methods such as steam activation acidic treatment synthesis in ethanol medium thermal treatment and acid thermal treatment ahmed et al 2016 khalil et al 2017 have been applied to enhance the removal efficiency and rate of no3 khalil et al 2017 it is reported that these modification methods could improve the pore structure surface area and functionality of carbon materials and adjust the ph and orp of the solution based on which they are suspected to enhance n2 selectivity theoretically however no study has evaluated and provided the quantitative data of n2 selectivity in reaction systems using zvi modified carbon materials therefore further research on n2 selectivity in the aforementioned system should be conducted and n2 selectivity should be used as an evaluation indicator and included in the evaluation criteria of material modification furthermore long term investigations are required to evaluate the stability and performance of zvi modified carbon materials 4 nitrate reduction by zvi supported metallic materials 4 1 mechanisms and products of nitrate reduction by zvi supported metallic materials adding other metals al ag cu ni or pd to zvi and creating bimetallic or trimetallic materials to enhance no3 reduction efficiency in drinking water treatment or ex situ groundwater treatment have been extensively studied for bimetallic systems coating zvi with another metal such as cu ni or pd reports have demonstrated two step reaction pathways of nitrate reduction fig 1 c first a galvanic couple could be formed because of the relative potential difference between fe0 and the secondary metal improving the reduction efficiency of no3 by accelerating iron corrosion shi et al 2016b electrons can be transferred from fe0 anode to the secondary metal cathode and they will be further accepted by no3 to generate no2 at the cathode liu et al 2019 shi et al 2016b and accepted by h for conversion into atomic hydrogen shi et al 2016b in addition no3 can also be reduced to partial no2 by zvi tang et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 second the second metal does not serve as a reductant to participate in the reaction but as an active center to provide reactive sites in favor of adsorbing no2 and hads liu et al 2019 tang et al 2019 adsorbed nitrite no2 ads can be reduced to nh4 or n2 by hads with high activity shi et al 2016a b regarding trimetallic catalysts they comprise three elements supports promoter metals and noble metals bae et al 2016 cu ni and sn have generally been accepted for use as promoter metals and pt and pd have been used as noble metals martínez et al 2017 the no3 reduction mechanisms on the surface of trimetallic catalysts are proposed in fig 1 d promoter metals such as cu can adsorb no3 and hydrogen atoms lubphoo et al 2016 and they can react mutually to form no2 which is further released into the solution noble metals activate h because of their high affinity for h martínez et al 2017 no2 can be resorbed to the sites at the noble metal surface and react with hads to generate n2 or nh4 liou et al 2009 prüsse and vorlop 2001 in addition another no3 reduction mechanism in trimetallic materials have been developed by previous studies hou et al 2015 xu et al 2017b they found that the intermetallic al fe compounds al3fe4 could be formed in al fe alloys containing copper the al3fe4 which is an alternative catalyst to pd can provide active sites to the formation of hads bimetallic or trimetallic materials can reduce no3 to nh4 no2 and n2 according to the literature using some bimetallic materials to reduce no3 can decrease the nh4 yield compared with zvi shi et al 2016a found that 98 3 of no3 n was reduced when ni was added to chelating resin supported fe only 21 3 no3 n removal could be achieved using chelating resin supported fe and the concentration of nh4 was lower than the latter data not shown zeng et al 2017 observed that adding cu to fe0 could attain the no3 removal of 86 and nh4 selectivity the amount of nh4 n the amount of reduced no3 n of approximately 30 data was from fig 4 in the original paper and further calculated and 68 and 99 respectively when employing fe0 to reduce no3 however although improvements were obtained the selectivity to n2 did not reach a satisfactory level because no3 may be reduced selectively to no2 despite a low yield of nh4 liu et al 2014b 2019 compared with bimetallic particles trimetallic materials can further improve n2 selectivity because partial no2 can be adsorbed and further converted into n2 liou et al 2009 liu et al 2014b lubphoo et al 2015 notably the reuse of no2 as an intermediate product promotes the generation of n2 by the recombination of n atoms in the metallic system generally n2 selectivity is determined by the ratio of the n and h species n h prüsse and vorlop 2001 specifically a high n h favors the formation of n2 because it improves the chance of collision between n species and a low n h is inclined to generate nh4 for example for pd crystallites the edge and corner sites are favorable for nh4 formation due to the occurrence of deep hydrogenation and a relative surplus of adsorbed h while the terrace sites are beneficial for the formation n2 due to low affinity to h yoshinaga et al 2002 4 2 strategies to improve n2 selectivity in nitrate reduction using zvi supported metallic materials 4 2 1 optimal selection of loaded metal type in the bimetallic system it is a critical step in increasingthe n2 selectivity that no2 is adsorbed on the surface of a second metal and further reacts with atomic hydrogen the metal loaded on fe0 may exert a crucial effect on the formation of end products because of the different affinities to no2 and h several studies have demonstrated that cu has a higher no2 yield than other metals coupled with fe0 to reduce no3 bae et al 2016 liou et al 2005 liu et al 2019 cu has a low affinity for no2 and as a result no2 remains in the aqueous phase and its sorption on the metal surface is impeded liou et al 2005 liu et al 2019 by contrast pd has a better adsorption capacity for no2 and the partial no2 can be converted to n2 at the pd catalyst surface prüsse and vorlop 2001 thus the type of added second metal on fe0 influences no3 reduction characteristics and n2 selectivity to varying degrees in the trimetallic system optimizing the deposited sequence of metals is necessary as the electronegativity and reduction potential value of pd is higher than that of cu pd tends to compete for more electrons than cu does and no2 is more easily reduced to n2 on the surface of pd than cu is lubphoo et al 2016 as a result adding cu before pd on fe0 increases the n2 yield due to more exposure of pd sites to the pollutants therefore it is vital to carry out parametric studies on the loaded types and the deposited sequence of each individual catalyst to achieve nitrate reduction with high capacity and selectivity 4 2 2 other strategies in addition to selecting the optimal type of metal other strategies have been proposed to improve n2 selectivity when coupling zvi with metals for no3 removal some reaction conditions such as the mass ratio of the promoter and noble metals initial concentration of no3 loading of the metallic catalyst and ph of the solution should be optimized to improve the efficiency of no3 reduction and n2 selectivity the products selectivity of no3 reduction obtained under different reaction conditions are summarized in table 1 adjusting these factors to achieve high n2 selectivity for nitrate removal was reviewed by tokazhanov et al 2020 in addition preprocess methods such as pre magnetization have attracted much attention because of their substantial potential to form n2 by generating a magnetic field gradient force to attract more paramagnetic no3 and promote nn recombination ren et al 2017 another method to improve n2 selectivity is embedding supports in metallic materials the excellent adsorption performance of no3 may be achieved by adding carriers to promote the formation of nn pairing and the introduction of an appropriate carrier is conducive to the uniform distribution of metals promoting the formation of more terrace sites in favor of nn pairing taking pd crystallites as an example shi et al 2016b however internal mass transfer limitations inside the support may negatively affect the activity and selectivity of no3 reduction a low mass transfer limitation of no3 may promote the reduction of no3 to no2 increasing the no2 to h ratio and promoting the formation of nn pairing shi et al 2016b some studies have attempted to decrease internal mass transfer limitations by applying a catalyst aggregate with a small size which can be achieved by the ultrasonic treatment of the catalyst chinthaginjala and lefferts 2010b shuai et al 2012 on one hand a small catalyst particle can provide a short diffusion path chinthaginjala et al 2010a and promote nn pairing because of faster mass transfer on the other hand the increase in local ph can be reduced because of faster proton mass transfer in smaller aggregates inhibiting the production of nh4 shuai et al 2012 in addition some special supports have a low mass transfer limitation of no3 and exhibit high n2 selectivity because of their special structure for example the mass transfer limitations of chelating resin may be decreased inside the aggregate because of their high mesoporous volume low microporosity and absence of charged functional groups fixed on its matrix accelerating the reduction of no3 shi et al 2016b carbon nanofiber cnf supports have a greater mass transfer than other traditional support particles alumina ac graphite and silica because of their high porosity and low tortuosity chinthaginjala et al 2010a the types of support materials may have different effects on n2 selectivity so developing some novel support materials and determining the optimal support materials might be a challenge in future although research has enriched the theories and optimization methods with regard to the increase of n2 selectivity when coupling zvi with metals for no3 removal some limitations remain 1 most optimization strategies reviewed in our paper were investigated in batch reactors and showed a satisfactory effect to enhance n2 selectivity however the long term performance of zvi supported metallic materials after implementations should be further examined in continuous flow reactor or under real field conditions 2 currently the potential use of zvi supported metal materials in ex situ remediation facilities or in situ treatment has been inhibited because of the high prices of the composite materials an analysis of the cost and technological advantages of remediation using zvi based metallic materials is another topic for further research 3 in addition little research has been designed to quantify the level and change in molecular and atomic hydrogen considering its reduction directly affecting on n2 selectivity in zvi based bimetallic or trimetallic systems previous studies conducted in closed batch systems and they defaulted that molecular and atomic hydrogen can accumulate and provide sufficient electrons xie and cwiertny 2013 however in field applications with complex and dynamic conditions molecular and atomic hydrogen may be diffused and whether atomic hydrogen can achieve the required levels should be further confirmed 5 biological denitrification 5 1 mechanisms and products by biological denitrification biological denitrification which comprises autotrophic denitrification ad and heterotrophic denitrification hd has been widely used for in situ and ex situ no3 removal from groundwater su et al 2018 in biological denitrification no3 can be used as a terminal electron acceptor and converted into no2 then to nitric oxide no n2o and n2 in that order by respiration of autotrophic or heterotrophic microorganisms under anoxic conditions karanasios et al 2010 the general consensus in the literature is that the amount of no can be disregarded in the final products pous et al 2013 and that no2 and n2o are easily and stably accumulated under inappropriate conditions no2 which can cause methemoglobinemia and death if ingested by humans zhang et al 2018 has more toxic effects than no3 in groundwater majone et al 2015 in addition when the concentration of no2 is above 3 0 mg l it poses a serious threat to aquatic environments because of its biotoxicity zhou et al 2021 n2o a greenhouse gas with a 300 fold greater potential than co2 majone et al 2015 richardson et al 2009 is another by product that should be investigated n2o is predicted to become a dominant stratospheric ozone depleting substance in the 21st century ravishankara et al 2009 another unexpected intermediate specie nh4 may be generated via no2 by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra medinets et al 2015 or by fermentation of protein with natural biomass as the carbon source zhang et al 2012 therefore determining and reducing the amounts of these intermediates during biological denitrification is necessary 5 2 strategies to improve n2 selectivity for heterotrophic denitrification studies on intermediate products of heterotrophic denitrification have mainly focused on specific n species for example some studies have explored the accumulation of no2 or nh4 to ensure groundwater quality security and other studies have emphasized the emission of n2o because of its negative effect on climate change therefore obtaining the available data on all potential products and accurately quantifying n2 selectivity based on limited data are difficult in this section the concentration of the intermediate products investigated reflects the degree of complete denitrification under different conditions table s2 5 2 1 optimal selection of carbon source types the carbon source is the major factor affecting the no3 attenuation when groundwater has insufficient bioavailable carbon matters the application of heterotrophic metabolism is limited hou et al 2019 studies have focused on adding external and efficient carbon sources to no3 contaminated groundwater or relevant bioreactors extra carbon sources are classified into two types 1 liquid carbon sources including natural organic carbon compounds e g methanol ethanol glucose and by products of carbon rich waste liquid fermentation and 2 solid phase carbon sources including synthetic polymers and natural biomass wang et al 2021b different phenomena regarding the accumulation of intermediates have been observed when different carbon sources are used on one hand carbon source types may influence the competitive advantage between the dnra process and denitrification due to differential denitrifying organism adaption to carbon type yang et al 2012 generating different final products akunna et al 1993 found that glucose and glycerol could induce the dnra pathway and that some volatile fatty acids such as acetic and lactic acids were preferred for denitrification even for the same carbon source different processes may be activated unlike the result proposed by akunna et al 1993 in which up to 50 of reduced no3 n was converted to nh4 n when glycerol was used as the carbon source a subsequent study showed that adding glycerol as a carbon source exhibited a considerable denitrifying capacity by denitrification and data suggested that no3 removal could reach 98 14 and that nh4 did not accumulate schroeder et al 2020 on the other hand for denitrification the dominant microorganisms induced by each carbon type may have different affinities for various types of electron receptors and may form different quantities of nox no3 no2 n2o and no reductase wang et al 2021b as a result different intermediate denitrification products may have accumulated as mentioned by warneke et al 2011 wheat straw on average produced approximately three times more dissolved n2o than maize cobs green waste and woodchips used as carbon sources the high n2o emission in the wheat straw system was related to a relatively high ratio of nitrite reductase gene copies to nitrous oxide reductase gene copies generally natural biomass provides a very limited availability of carbon for microorganisms they contain abundant lignin a key substance that hinders bacteria from utilizing other materials hu et al 2017 some strategies have been developed to further enhance the quantity of microbially available carbon and increase n2 selectivity for example various pretreatment methods such as lime pretreatment and peracetic acid pretreatment have been developed to remove lignin from agricultural wastes and increase the abundance of denitrifying bacteria promoting complete denitrification hu et al 2017 2019 the performance of these pretreatment methods is significant in laboratory tests under controllable conditions however their performance and complete denitrification potential require further investigation in real groundwater environments moreover studies have recommended combining different carbon sources to achieve high denitrification performance and high n2 selectivity such as the combination of maize cobs and wood chips warneke et al 2011 they found that maize cob had a high no3 removal performance with a high release of total organic carbon toc and dissolved n2o and that wood substrates had a moderate sustained no3 removal with no adverse effects therefore to achieve a balance between no3 removal performance and by product production maize cobs and woodchips can be combined as carbon sources for denitrification in addition synthetic polymers as carbon sources have a higher more stable denitrification rate than natural occurring substances do wang and chu 2016 however the application of synthetic polymers is usually limited by their high cost chu and wang 2016 recently studies have attempted to blend polymers with cheap organic substances such as starch bamboo powder and sawdust and a more significant denitrification performance and lower accumulation of by products can be achieved even compared with polymers only systems chu and wang 2016 yang et al 2020a under such multiple carbon source conditions a mixed community of bacteria and fungi can be formed creating wide ecological niches qi et al 2020 the application of composite carbons combining low cost natural biomass with synthetic polymers should be a subject of further research for solid phase carbon sources containing complex dissolved organic compounds understanding the effects of dominant organic components on nitrate attenuation related processes in groundwater has important implications for effectively stimulating nitrate attenuation recently fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been utilized to elucidate the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter which should be further employed to characterize the dissolved organic carbon doc evolution in groundwater and elucidate governing mechanisms of doc related nitrate loss 5 2 2 optimal selection of carbon source quantity the quantity of the carbon source leads to a different ratio between organic carbon and no3 c n significantly affecting the accumulation of by products in heterotrophic denitrification it has been reported that the distribution of no3 consumption between heterotrophic denitrification and dnra is closely related to the availability of organic matter nikolenko et al 2018 fermentative dnra is believed to be favored in no3 limited environments with rich carbon sources by contrast heterotrophic denitrification dominates in carbon source limited groundwater burgin and hamilton 2007 nikolenko et al 2018 in heterotrophic denitrification processes a higher c n ratio is generally believed to decrease the accumulation of no2 zhai et al 2017a showed that when c n was above 0 9 1 2 no2 in the effluent was below the detection limit but the concentration of no3 and no2 in the effluent increased rapidly because of the limited carbon source when the c n ratio continued to decrease to 0 8 therefore controlling the quantity of carbon sources to avoid the accumulation of by products is essential generally using liquid carbon sources has the risk of insufficient doses or overdosing while solid carbon sources have the potential to alleviate these risks this occurs because the denitrifying microbes respond to nitrate levels in the aqueous phase and further adjust the amount of the released organic carbon for solid carbon sources wang and chu 2016 moreover the feeding scheme of carbon sources which refers to different feeding strategies such as the periodic or batch addition of carbon sources may influence the process of complete denitrification schalk otte et al 2000 found that in heterotrophic denitrification the feeding regime may result in an unbalanced supply of electron donors and acceptors and n2o emissions will be influenced particularly when carbon sources become exhausted and the culture enters starvation periods n2o accumulation is significant thus selecting a suitable feeding scheme for carbon sources such as a dynamic feeding scheme is advantageous for the full utilization of carbon sources and complete denitrification furthermore another new approach gradient filling pattern was proposed zhao et al 2020 in which the carbon source dosage decreased from upstream to downstream in the reactor corresponding to the gradually decreasing no3 concentration from the inlet to the outlet in the bioreactor the novel design provided a more feasible carbon source according to the real time needs of the microorganism and alleviated the problem of excessive organic matter in the downstream the researchers observed that the bioreactor with a gradient filling woodchip had a higher no3 removal rate and a lower no2 accumulation than the uniform filling bioreactor for no3 contaminated groundwater treatment further research should focus on different carbon sources in gradient filling bioreactors or developing other optimized filling patterns similarly the in situ heterotrophic denitrification process of injecting external carbon sources should consider the difference in no3 levels along the groundwater flow path and it is necessary to formulate corresponding strategies to prevent the insufficiency or excess of carbon sources such as multipoint injection 5 2 3 adjustment of dissolved oxygen concentration notably dissolved oxygen do concentration varies widely by the aquifer ranging from below 1 mg l to approximately 10 mg l collins et al 2017 jahangir et al 2014 however most denitrifying bacteria are facultative anaerobes van rijn et al 2006 do concentration levels should be considered during heterotrophic denitrification because they may affect the accumulation of intermediate products it has been reported that no3 can be completely converted to n2 by denitrification when do concentrations are below 1 6 mg l in aquifers böhlke et al 2007 but a high do concentration tends to result in more no2 luo et al 2014a yang et al 2012 high do concentration may inhibit the activities of different denitrification enzymes such as nitrate reductase nar or nitrous oxide reductase nir gómez et al 2002 wang and chu 2016 or influence the composition of bacterial biofilms gómez et al 2002 reported that when the do concentration was high the ratio between the population of bacteria with the function of n2o generation and no2 generation was very low resulting in no2 accumulation some strategies have been adopted to minimize the negative effects of do on heterotrophic denitrification for example in ectopic reactors adding reductive substances na2so3 to raw water gómez et al 2002 or optimizing the structure of denitrification devices gutierrez wing et al 2012 have been studied for oxygen elimination for the in situ deoxygenation of contaminated groundwater a two layer permeable reactive barrier prb has been proposed and continually developed in which the first layer filled with granular oxygen capturing materials is used to capture do in groundwater to create anaerobic conditions for the second layer of microbial denitrification liu et al 2013 zvi is usually selected as a potential oxygen capturing reagent liu et al 2013 additionally carbon substrates may influence the distribution of do concentration and two influence mechanisms are involved it was reported that when solid carbon sources such as biodegradable polymers are used as substrates for heterotrophic denitrification the diffusion of oxygen is inhibited and large anoxic zones are formed due to the pores and cracks of carbon sources gutierrez wing et al 2012 luo et al 2014a in addition the initial consumption rate of substrates is positively correlated with the consumption of oxygen therefore choosing a directly metabolic carbon type can stimulate oxygen consumption decreasing the adverse impact of the do level on denitrification products yang et al 2012 5 2 4 optimal design of hrt the release of intermediates is associated with the hrt during heterotrophic denitrification because a shorter hrt may lead to incomplete denitrification wang et al 2009 showed that when hrt was longer than 8 h the concentration of no2 n in the effluent was below 0 02 mg l but if the hrt was shorter than 4 h it could be sharply increased a similar result was found by zhai et al 2017a that is no2 was not detected when the hrt was 8 h however the no2 n concentration reached 9 18 mg l initial no3 n 50 mg l when the hrt was decreased to 2 h a shorter hrt may reduce physical contact between denitrifying bacteria and carbon sources and increase the shear force weakening the diffusivity of carbon sources in biofilms he et al 2016 therefore it is crucial to prolong the hrt to control the excessive generation of by products however if the hrt is too long the initial construction cost can be increased to achieve the same treatment capacity in addition nh4 and toc may be substantially released because of the long contact time between water and natural biomass in the bioreactor zhao et al 2020 on the basis of the aforementioned discussion hrt should be adjusted to an optimal value by considering cost no3 removal efficiency and the composition of products comprehensively during the design of the denitrification reactor 5 2 5 other strategies ph plays a crucial role in controlling the generation of by products for denitrification it has different influences on different enzyme activities the optimal ph for no3 and no2 reductases has been reported to be 7 5 and 6 5 respectively and high ph facilitates the accumulation of no2 stevens et al 1998 zhai et al 2017a regarding nh4 its accumulation due to the dnra process gradually decreases from acidic to alkaline conditions zhai et al 2017a zhang et al 2015b adding buffer has been a frequently used measure to adjust solution ph in bioreactors but is not feasible for in situ remediation implementations in addition to controlling the ph of the influent it should be noted that denitrification can generate oh and increase the ph of the solution therefore researchers have developed a new combined two step process of the heterotrophic and sulfur autotrophic denitrification processes and the ph can be better sustained liu et al 2009 moreover temperature changes may affect the accumulation of intermediates because they may influence microbial activity community structure riedel 2019 and hydrolysis of substrates wang and chu 2016 further affecting the structure of products during the denitrification process nearly all studies investigating the effect of temperature on nitrate removal have been conducted in denitrification reactors in addition other factors should be considered such as other co existing substances which may affect the excessive release of intermediate products phosphorus is a major essential microbial nutrient for biological growth and development zhang et al 2015a and an important limiting element for denitrification satake and tang 2018 high nitrate and low phosphorus have been reported as typical characteristics of groundwater in agricultural areas with high fertilizer usage however low phosphorus could lead to the incomplete reduction of no3 and the accumulation of no2 or n2o rather than n2 satake and tang 2018 therefore considering supplemental phosphorus sources is important when designing prbs or bioreactors for treating nitrate polluted groundwater zhang et al 2015a 5 3 strategies to improve n2 selectivity for fe supported autotrophic denitrification autotrophic denitrification has received increasing attention for treating groundwater with a low c n ratio tian and yu 2020 autotrophs use inorganic carbon such as carbon dioxide or bicarbonate as carbon sources and depend on inorganic electron donors for energy ghafari et al 2008 hydrogen h2 according to literature is potentially an ideal electron donor for autotrophic denitrification because it is harmless and has economic advantages tian and yu 2020 for the method of h2 supply in a h2 based system in addition to delivering h2 directly several technologies have been developed for generating h2 instantly for instance h2 can be supplied by iron corrosion liu et al 2020b or electrolysis in a bio electrochemical reactor ghafari et al 2008 jiang et al 2018 detailed description in section 6 to participate in hydrogenotrophic denitrification an fe supported autotrophic denitrification system can be applied in prbs as in situ groundwater remediation and in bioreactor as ex situ treatment in which iron has dual functions it can reduce no3 as a reducing agent and it can generate h2 by undergoing corrosion which acts as an electron donor for microbial metabolism liu et al 2020b in the early stages of the reaction chemical reduction is the principal mechanism and the terminal product is almost entirely nh4 the dominant reaction gradually evolves from chemical reduction to bio denitrification in which n2 is gradually generated an et al 2009 as described in section 2 1 no3 can be reduced by bare zvi with the generation of a large amount of nh4 while coupling iron with autotrophic bacteria can decrease the nh4 yield and increase the n2 selectivity of the final products for no3 removal however the degree of enhancement on n2 selectivity is largely dependent on multiple factors such as the iron s characteristics bioavailability of electron donors ph and do which need to be fully understood the results obtained under different reaction conditions are summarized in table 2 and discussed in the following sections 5 3 1 optimal selection of iron parameters the type of iron can influence the selection of n2 as an end product in fe supported autotrophic denitrification because of its different reductive ability and hydrogen production capacity for example an et al 2013 observed that using passivated iron powder can significantly change the denitrification end product distribution of hydrogenotrophic denitrification producing less nh4 than acid washed iron or steel wool in such a reaction system they hypothesized that the iron oxide coating might decrease the reduction of no3 but not influence the contact with water and generate h2 mishra and farrell 2005 therefore biological denitrification reactions are not limited however this topic requires further research in addition the surface of oxides may adsorb nh4 because of the net negative surface charges of oxides which may increase n2 selectivity by decreasing the nh4 proportion in the final products in addition to the iron type iron dosage is another important factor that affects the distribution of end products for fe supported autotrophic denitrification studies have found that using a lower steel wool concentration may minimize nh4 formation but may also limit h2 formation adversely affecting the rate of biological denitrification biswas and bose 2005 lavania and bose 2006 higher iron dosage may inhibit biological denitrification due to the toxicity of zvi to the microorganisms and induce an obvious increase in ph over the optimum range for bacteria you et al 2017 in addition one study found that the optimal dose of mzvi was 0 2 g l this dose removed no3 nearly completely and generated the smallest amount of no2 and nh4 and when the dose of mzvi was below 0 2 g l the concentration of the aforementioned by products increased zhang et al 2019 therefore the optimum iron dosage is case specific and a win win solution achieving both a high nitrate removal efficiency and a high n2 selectivity needs to be designed by comprehensively considering the iron dosage and other factors in summary the balance between chemical reduction and biodegradation should be seriously considered to generate a proper h2 yield and further promote biological denitrification when selecting the iron types and iron dosage moreover additional studies should be performed to understand the interfacial mass transfer and biochemical mechanisms of zvi bacteria and no3 under different iron parameters including the characteristics of enzyme activity electron transport and microbial communities which contribute to clarifying the specific influence of iron parameters on n2 selectivity and further optimizing reaction conditions 5 3 2 optimal selection of initial biomass concentration the initial biomass concentration affects nh4 formation by influencing the balance between chemical and biological processes when the fe bacteria system contained small doses of bacteria nh4 was accumulated because of the superiority of chemical reduction in competing for electrons when the biomass is excessive the growth of bacteria may be restricted by insufficient h2 and their adaptable phase may be prolonged resulting in a competitive advantage of chemical reduction and the accumulation of additional nh4 an et al 2009 therefore controlling the biomass concentration in an fe supported autotrophic denitrification system is crucial for decreasing undesirable end products 5 3 3 other strategies changing the method of coupling iron and bacteria may contribute to reducing nh4 production most studies have established an fe supported autotrophic denitrification system by directly adding and mixing bacteria and fe into the water an et al 2009 an et al 2014 and partial no3 can be reduced to nh4 by fe however more recently a denitrifying bacteria iron nanoparticle composite material was biosynthesized with iron nanoparticles embedded in the bacteria and fe nanoparticles were fully protected liu et al 2021 in this system iron nanoparticles did not act as a reductant to react and release additional nh4 but as the electron donor for bacteria to complete the biological denitrification process and promote the denitrification rate in addition previous studies developed some strategies to enhance n2 selectivity during iron assisted no3 removal in ex situ treatment such as adjusting the hrt temperature and ph yet which may be not easily implemented under in situ conditions generally a longer hrt benefits autotrophic denitrification and a shorter hrt benefits chemical reduction and results in an increased nh4 production liu et al 2020b till et al 1998 peng et al 2015 suggested that high temperature 37 substantially increased the removal efficiency of no3 but has little effect on nh4 yield in the combined system the ph of the solution is related to the different hydrogenotrophic cultures used in this denitrifying system studies have found that the optimum ph was 7 6 8 6 under which substantial no3 removal rates and desirable end products were displayed karanasios et al 2010 xing et al 2020 however in the actual reaction both chemical reduction by iron and hydrogen autotrophic denitrification can consume protons and increase the alkalinity of the system karanasios et al 2010 many studies have found that the ph of an fe supported autotrophic denitrification system significantly exceeded 9 5 and even increased to 10 5 without ph control liu et al 2020b xing et al 2016 some studies have used buffers to control the ph in reactors in addition co2 has been applied to control the ph and it showed a good removal efficiency of no3 xing et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 however except as the ph buffer additional co2 can react with h2 to participate in organic carbon metabolism and promote heterotrophic denitrification xing et al 2020 heterotrophic denitrification undoubtedly affects the flow of electrons and the distribution of end products in fe supported autotrophic denitrification but has not been explored in depth in addition pretest studies are necessary to increase the security and feasibility of ph regulation technology when determining the optimal ph in the reactor 5 4 strategies to improve n2 selectivity for sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification sdad is used to remove no3 at in situ denitrification walls or bioreactors in which some reduced sulfur compounds such as dissolved sulfide elemental sulfur s0 and thiosulfate s2o3 2 can act as electron donors by chemolithoautotrophic denitrification to reduce no3 to n2 sierra alvarez et al 2007 wang et al 2020 previous studies found that some bacteria can use reduced inorganic sulfur compounds as an electron donor for no3 reduction to nh4 by chemoautotrophic dnra but they were basically conducted in soil freshwater ecosystems coastal or estuarine sediments or estuary lu et al 2013 showed that free sulfide exerted little effect on dnra in soils with a high amount of organic carbon however a high addition rate of sulfide significantly increased dnra rates in low c environments li et al 2021 explored the synergistic effect of organic and sulfide on denitrification and dnra in sequencing biofilm batch reactor and found that dnra was facilitated in carbon limited system given the above clues sulfide related dnra pathway to reduce no3 should be considered in groundwater containing inadequate carbon sources in addition sulfur compounds can chemically reduce no3 to nh4 chao 1967 accordingly the contributions of denitrification chemical processes from no3 to nh4 and biological dnra to no3 removal should be further quantified in sdad in future at present studies have verified the feasibility of sdad to treat no3 pollution from groundwater and developed strategies to minimize sulfate production however in addition to sulfate the adverse effects of intermediate nitrogen especially n2o or no2 should be considered relevant technologies to reduce the production of nitric by products have been developed the results of many studies on the selectivity of nitrate reduction products under different reaction conditions by using sdad were collected and listed in table 3 5 4 1 optimal selection of the sulfur substrates in sdad the sulfur substrate electron donor is oxidized following which it offers a flow of electrons into the electron transport chain and further allocates them to different nitrogen oxide reductases oberoi et al 2021 therefore various sulfur substrates with different biological oxidation rates influence the electron competition among nitrogen oxide reductases significantly influencing no3 reduction and the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates no2 and n2o in sdad di capua et al 2016 found that 11 0 31 4 of initial no3 n was converted into no2 n when s0 was used as electron donors while s2o3 2 was an excellent electron donor capable of complete denitrification under the experimental conditions this result is consistent with that of oberoi et al 2021 there are two conflicting findings regarding the effect of dissolved sulfide on n2o reduction in sdad some studies have proposed that n2o reductase activity is inhibited because of the precipitation of sulfide with copper to form metal sulfide and n2o emission will be promoted bartacek et al 2010 pan et al 2013 by contrast yang et al 2016a demonstrated that dissolved sulfide h2s hs and s2 could effectively promote n2o reduction they suggested that the copper co factor in n2o reductase was not precipitated by dissolved sulfide in the cell periplasm and that continuous electron transport can be maintained because the dissolved sulfide can be instantly oxidized into sulfur or polysulfide by sulfide oxidase even for the same composition of elemental sulfur the accumulation of intermediates differs with different preparation methods and particle sizes in comparing the n2 selectivity performance of employing chemical elemental sulfur s0 chem and biogenic elemental sulfur s0 bio as sulfur sources contradictory findings have been reported di capua et al 2016 found that s0 bio as an electron donor exhibited a higher denitrification rate while more no2 accumulation 31 4 of the initial no3 n was observed in sdad with s0 bio as electron donor than s0 chem 11 0 of the initial no3 n by contrast the latest findings showed the opposite trend the reactor of s0 bio obtained a more complete denitrification than s0 chem even at a high load of no3 ucar et al 2020 kostrytsia et al 2018a 2018b found a low accumulation level and a fast removal rate 20 9 mg no2 n l d of no2 n when using s0 bio as electron donors however a slower removal rate 8 0 mg no2 n l d of the accumulated no2 n was observed when using s0 chem as electron donors it is because of the higher bioavailability of s0 bio provided by the microcrystallinity and hydrophilic properties than s0 chem wang et al 2020 these contradictory findings may result from other distinct factors such as the hrt and the sulfur to nitrogen s n mass ratio overall further in depth research is required to reveal the no2 accumulation performance in the sdad process under complex conditions moreover different particle surface areas mainly affect the s0 mass transfer from the solid to the aqueous phase and the bioavailability of electron donors di capua et al 2016 generally selecting s0 particle with a higher specific surface area such as s0 powder can increase the s0 solubilization rate and decrease the accumulation of by products di capua et al 2016 kostrytsia et al 2018a however in addition to no2 data on the accumulation of other intermediates such as n2o in sdad with different types of s0 have not been obtained therefore n2o emissions should be evaluated and considered in further research 5 4 2 optimal selection of s n the s n mass ratio affects the supply of electrons influencing the accumulation of denitrification intermediates according to the stoichiometry presented in eqs 9 and 10 the minimum theoretical requirements of s n mass ratio are 1 90 and 1 40 respectively using elemental sulfur and sulfide as electron donors for complete denitrification to n2 oberoi et al 2021 however the optimal s n mass ratio may be related to other reaction conditions in actual applications a higher s n mass ratio can provide adequate electrons to relieve the electron competition among no3 no2 and n2o reductases hence the reduction of intermediates can be significantly promoted liu et al 2016b yang et al 2016b in addition supplying excessive sulfide high s n mass ratio is also conducive to reducing the inhibition of free nitrous acid fna on n2o reduction generally fna can react with the active sites of copper containing enzymes and result in competitive inhibition of n2o reductase however this method can increase costs lan et al 2019 yang et al 2016b therefore the optimal s n mass ratio should be determined to consider other design conditions and minimize the cost and intermediate production simultaneously 9 s 0 1 2 n o 3 0 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 0 6 n 2 0 8 h 10 5 h s 8 no 3 3 h 5 so 4 2 4 n 2 4 h 2 o 5 4 3 other strategies in addition to the type and amount of electron donors selecting an optimal feeding scheme for the sulfur source may promote the complete reduction of no3 to n2 oberoi et al 2021 found that slow continuous feeding of sulfide decreased the inhibition of nitrous oxide reductase and n2o emissions from sdad hence selecting a suitable feeding strategy would achieve effective autotrophic denitrification and decrease the production of harmful intermediates adjusting other conditions including the ph hrt and temperature may be effective measures to decrease the accumulation of denitrification intermediates in bioreactors for example ph can influence fna and n2o emissions liu et al 2016b in addition a lower water temperature may promote the accumulation of no2 and n2o low temperature is better at suppressing n2o reductase than the n2o producing enzymes wang et al 2017 6 biological denitrification assisted by electricity 6 1 mechanisms and products of bio electrochemical systems bio electrochemical systems bess have been applied recently for in situ or ex situ no3 removal from contaminated groundwater the common structure of bess involves microorganisms electrodes and wires and microorganisms are attached to the electrodes mediating the electron transfer huang et al 2013 electrons are provided by an external source and reach the cathode through the electrodes and wires callegari et al 2019 no3 can be reduced in the anodic chamber by heterotrophic denitrification or autotrophic denitrification in the cathodic chamber based on the methods to maintain a continuous electron flow bess can be operated as the microbial fuel cells mfcs microbial electrolysis cells mecs or biofilm electrode reactors bers molognoni et al 2017 fig 3 in a denitrifying mfc electrons are created in the anodic chamber from the oxidization of organic matter and are transferred from the anode to the cathode along the wire containing a resistor puig et al 2012 in the cathode no3 can be used as an electron acceptor by microorganisms and removed the electrons spontaneously flow from lower to higher oxidation reduction potentials resulting in the generation of a current a typical characteristic of mfcs is that extra power input is not required pous et al 2015 however in a mec a voltage is required to be applied between the anode and cathode by using a potentiostat to maintain the cathodic potential at a desired reductive level logan et al 2008 wrana et al 2010 if electrons are provided by using a direct current between the anode and cathode the cell is known as a ber cecconet et al 2018 in a ber h2 produced from water electrolysis can serve as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrification in the cathode tong et al 2014 in addition the no3 removal pathways of these bess are similar to those of conventional biological denitrification including autotrophic or heterotrophic denitrification therefore the same by products may be formed including no2 n2o and nh4 described in section 5 1 6 2 strategies to improve n2 selectivity in bio electrochemical systems 6 2 1 optimization of conductivity studies have demonstrated that using bess to remove no3 or no2 from high conductivity 2000 11 000 μs cm 1 wastewaters was feasible however adopting bess has limitations for treating no3 pollution from groundwater because of its low conductivity 1000 μs cm 1 the low conductivity limits the nitrogen removal efficiency and the complete reduction of no3 under lower conductivity conditions mfc overpotentials irreversible energy losses related to ion transport are increased pous et al 2015 these resistances can hinder the transport of electrons and protons wang et al 2021a influencing the activities of denitrifying microorganisms and promoting the accumulation of by products in the cathode pous et al 2013 puig et al 2012 reducing the internal resistance and decreasing the production of intermediates from groundwater require increasing the conductivity of groundwater strategies for increasing conductivity have been applied in heterotopic reactors the most direct and effective method to increase the conductivity of groundwater is to add liquid electrolytes such as nacl pous et al 2015 nahco3 tong and he 2013 glucose and starch feng et al 2013 however some problems still need to be noted first adding a liquid electrolyte to in situ groundwater may be limited because the effect is not obvious due to the dilution of groundwater and it can potentially lead to secondary pollution pous et al 2015 second high salinity caused by many electrolytes can adversely affect mfc performance which may influence the activity of denitrifying bacteria kumar et al 2020 third some electrolytes such as so4 may compete with anode on electron harvesting and led to electron loss liu et al 2014a therefore we suggest comprehensively considering the dosage and possible potential impacts of exogenous electrolytes 6 2 2 control of the cathode potential or current if mecs with an additional voltage or bers with direct current are applied to no3 treatment the adverse influence of the low conductivity of groundwater can be diluted however an appropriate current or cathode potential is vital and can directly affect no3 removal performance as the n2 selectivity would be negatively affected with a too low or too high current or cathode potential for a ber chang et al 1999 found that no2 may be accumulated at a low current condition ghafari et al 2009 and van doan et al 2013 found that at high levels of current densities up to approximately 46 1 and 70 of the removed nitrate were accumulated as no2 and n2o respectively the supplied current directly affects h2 production which is closely related to autotrophic denitrification performance ghafari et al 2009 the production of h2 would be inhibited under too low or too high applied currents tong et al 2013 zhu et al 2021 in addition the structures and gene expressions of active biofilm communities may be significantly influenced at different current densities affecting the distribution of end products van doan et al 2013 therefore the optimal denitrification current as the in situ hydrogen generator must be determined in the mec similar efforts were previously made to examine the effects of cathode potential on the by products formation during nitrate reduction process virdis et al 2009 demonstrated that a lower accumulation of n2o was observed when applying a lower potential to the cathode pous et al 2015 also evaluated mecs performance but under a wider range of potentials from 597 to 703 mv vs standard hydrogen electrode she for the treatment of no3 polluted groundwater which resulted in different results from that reported by virdis et al 2009 they found that when the cathode potential was lower than 303 mv vs she obvious accumulation of no2 and n2o was observed but when the cathode potential further decreased to 123 mv vs the she the no2 and n2o accumulation were greatly alleviated in addition to no2 and n2o nh4 from dnra process was another possible by product at a lower potential zhang et al 2014a the effects of cathode potentials on the by products accumulation in the mec are mainly due to the following mechanisms proposed by different researchers 1 more electrons can be obtained at a lower potential leading to a higher electron donor acceptor ratio which favored dnra over denitrification zhang et al 2014a and lessened the competition between different denitrifying enzymes which can contribute to a more complete denitrification pous et al 2015 and 2 h2 generation which was cathode potential dependent may positively impact the denitrification by providing extra electron donor for autotrophic bacteria on the cathode wang et al 2021a despite the above understandings the comprehensive and multi involved impact pathways of cathode potential on complete denitrification have rarely been considered in one mec system 6 2 3 other strategies for a mfc system or an intensified bes that combines heterotrophic and hydrogenotrophic denitrification the degradation of organic substrates most likely occurs at the anode selecting appropriate carbon sources and the c n ratio are important for achieving complete denitrification feng et al 2013 found that a complex carbon source starch was more easily utilized by microorganisms to generate electricity than a simple carbon source methanol and glucose at the anode in an intensified bes but a higher no2 accumulation in the system containing a complex carbon source was found huang et al 2013 further observed that an increased c n ratio can facilitate the removal of no2 when starch was used as an electron donor at the anode in addition studies have been conducted to achieve full denitrification of groundwater by optimizing the structure of bess callegari et al 2019 connected two bes in series to form a sequential two step bes system in such a system a large part of no3 was removed in bes 1 while bes 2 was mainly used for removing no2 and n2o thus achieving a complete denitrification process even at a higher no3 load b zhang et al 2014a coupled the mfc with ber to supply electrons which was transferred from an mfc to a ber in comparison with the single ber system the coupled system can save extra electric energy and achieve complete biological denitrification because of the sufficient supply of electrons from mfc it is necessary for the development of novel and effective structure of bess to reduce intermediates accumulation during denitrification furthermore the electrical inversion of electrodes has been adopted to promote the complete denitrification a biofilm could firstly grow on an organic carbon oxidizing bioanode surface and afterwards the formed electrode bio anode is switched to be the biocathode through polarity inversion in this system lin et al 2021 some of the electrogenic bacteria enriched in the bioelectrode had bidirectional electron transferability and had an ability to directly use the electrode as an electron donor to reduce nitrate besides the polarity reversal of bioanodes could facilitate the formation of biofilm and the enriching of autotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria lin et al 2021 wang et al 2021c yang et al 2020b moreover the latest research demonstrated that specific microorganisms related with nitrous oxide reduction were enriched by polarity reversal promoting the reduction of n2o wang et al 2021c it should be noted that the nitrate removal performance of the bio cathode is closely related to the bio anodic bio oxidation electroactivity it is vital to adopt some strategies such as varying external resistance lin et al 2021 using different constant anodic potential and substrates to enhance the bio anodic bio oxidation electroactivity and improve the performance of the bio cathode moreover the modification of electrodes may be another potential strategy to enhance the reduction of intermediates in bess up to now the n2 selectivity in the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate with different electrode materials has been reviewed previously martínez et al 2017 but only a few studies evaluated the potential of complete denitrification through electrodes modification in bess for instance wang et al 2021c found cathode modification using porous polypyrrole ppy can promote electrons transport and n2o reduction due to the high conductivity and biocompatibility of ppy in future it is still a huge challenge to select electrode materials or tune the electrode surface by comprehensively considering electricity generation the compatibility with microorganisms complete denitrification long term stability and cost 7 conclusion and future prospects in summary recent advances in some mechanisms and strategies to improve the n2 selectivity of several frequently used methods for no3 removal in groundwater were reviewed the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the zvi system electrons transfer directly or indirectly from the zvi core to no3 which is the main mechanism for reducing no3 the main product of no3 removal was nh4 when zvi was used as the reducing agent the literature has reported that nh4 may be decreased by selecting an appropriate particle size zvi dosage ph and orp 2 to further decrease the production of nh4 in the zvi system common measures including use of loaded carbon materials and metallic materials have been applied the performance of the composite materials and reaction conditions can be optimized to enhance n2 selectivity 3 in biological denitrification and bess intermediates could accumulate including no2 and n2o generated by incomplete denitrification and nh4 produced by dnra some factors are highly related to the distribution of final products for denitrification such as the quantity and type of electron donors ph do and reactor structure 4 in terms of n2 selectivity biological denitrification is more advantaged than other chemical counterparts as the n2 selectivity can be optimized to an ideal level with appropriate cost effective measures although the optimal regulation to obtain a high n2 selectivity for biological denitrification can be relatively easily achieved in bioreactor its in situ applications are usually limited due to poor engineering feasibility under field conditions based on our review our proposals for possible future research and considerations are as follows 1 based on the concept of sustainable development defined by the brundtland commission when conducting technological comparisons of nitrate removal in groundwater the removal efficiency and rate and total environmental impacts caused by various products should be considered based on the life cycle assessment methodology acquiring information on n2 selectivity and considering nitrate removal efficiency can help decision makers better quantify environmental impact potentials and achieve a more sustainable remediation performance 2 although sufficient data are available to evaluate the negative effects of by products in no3 removal systems quantitative data on n2 selectivity remain inadequate especially for biological denitrification therefore the scarcity of measured n2 selectivity data in various nitrate remediation systems dramatically limits remediation performance evaluation and further hampers remediation scheme optimization therefore further efforts should be made to collect more data originating from different remediation systems and site conditions and the n2 selectivity database should be further enriched 3 most studies have focused on the influence of a single factor on n2 selectivity in future further evaluation of the combined effects of multiple factors is necessary in engineering practice in addition further research is needed to quantitatively establish a correlation among key factors the removal efficiency and n2 selectivity for the aforementioned technologies to treat no3 pollution in groundwater which will provide guidance for engineering applications 4 recent innovations in remediation materials and strategies for increasing n2 selectivity have been mostly undertaken in the laboratory under controlled operational conditions that considerably differ from field conditions thus demonstrating the feasibility of their application to real groundwater with fluctuating geochemical and hydrological parameters is necessary for example many co existing electron acceptors including some natural electron acceptors do so4 2 etc and reducible pollutants v v cr vi etc may have effects on the dominant reduction pathway thus further influencing n2 selectivity in addition further research should

16386,the pollution of nitrate no3 in groundwater has become an environmental problem of general concern and requires immediate remediation because of adverse human and ecological impacts no3 removal from groundwater is conducted mainly by chemical biological and coupled methods with the removal efficiency of no3 considered the sole performance indicator however in addition to the harmless form of n2 the reduced no3 could be transformed into other intermediates such as nitrite no2 nitrous oxide n2o and ammonia nh4 which may have direct or indirect negative impacts on the environment therefore increasing n2 selectivity is a significant challenge in reducing no3 in groundwater which seriously impedes the large scale implementation of available remediation technologies in this work we comprehensively overview the most recent advances in n2 selectivity regarding the understanding of emerging groundwater no3 removal technologies mechanisms of by product production and strategies to enhance the selective reduction of no3 to n2 are discussed in detail furthermore we proposed topics for further research and hope that the total environmental impacts of remediation schemes should be evaluated comprehensively by quantifying all potential intermediate products and promising strategies should be further developed to enhance n2 selectivity to improve the feasibility of related technologies in actual remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrate removal n2 selectivity groundwater zero valent iron biological denitrification bio electrochemical treatment 1 introduction groundwater is the dominant water source in most regions of the world and is the only water source in some arid countries such as saudi arabia and india adimalla and qian 2021 wang et al 2009 however due to extensive agricultural intensification and other nonagricultural nitrogen n sources xin et al 2019 a continuous rise in nitrate no3 concentrations in groundwater has been widely observed worldwide including in the united states glenn and james lester 2010 china zhai et al 2017b japan hosono et al 2013 india adimalla and qian 2021 several countries in the european union angelopoulos et al 2009 and particularly in developing countries no3 pollution in groundwater poses a substantial threat to human and ecological health on one hand ingesting no3 may induce diseases such as methemoglobinemia in infants blue baby syndrome and stomach cancer xu et al 2017a on the other hand high concentrations of no3 in groundwater may flow into coterminous surface water or seawater inducing eutrophication and toxic algal blooms ghafari et al 2008 thus developing technologies that efficiently treat no3 pollution in groundwater has increasingly attracted researchers attention various in and ex situ technologies involving physical chemical and biological treatment processes have been applied to remediate no3 contaminated groundwater cecconet et al 2020 huno et al 2018 however implementation of these technologies at larger scales has not occurred because of incomplete no3 reduction ideally the reduced no3 should be transformed into its harmless form n2 rather than some intermediates such as nitrite no2 nitrous oxide n2o and ammonia nh4 which may have direct or indirect negative impacts on the environment niu et al 2019 therefore in addition to augmenting no3 removal many studies have attempted to find efficient measures to promote the selective reduction of no3 to n2 to decrease the negative effects of intermediates liu and wang 2019 martínez et al 2017 tokazhanov et al 2020 in addition to characterize the complete reduction degree of no3 a new concept of n2 selectivity has been proposed defined as the ratio of the n2 yield to the amount of consumed no3 wei et al 2018 different technologies may display variable no3 removal performance and n2 selectivity chemical reduction available as both in situ and ex situ remediation methods attempts to reduce no3 to nh4 or n2 by employing reducing agents song et al 2020 zero valent iron zvi has been the most investigated typical reductant bare zvi possesses poor n2 selectivity wei et al 2018 although the n2 selectivity in the zvi system can be slightly improved by adjusting the hydrochemical parameters of the solution ph and oxidation reduction potential orp yang and lee 2005 and the size and dose of the zvi choe et al 2000 xiong et al 2009 owing to the limitations of zvi systems some zvi composites have been applied to increase n2 selectivity and reviewed by liu and wang 2019 carbon materials supported zvi zvi c that are capable of changing the ph and orp in solution song et al 2020 wei et al 2018 and zvi supported metallic materials that exhibit additional catalytic reduction lubphoo et al 2015 tang et al 2019 have substantial potential for removing no3 from groundwater and require to develop some strategies to further enhance n2 selectivity moreover catalytic and electrocatalytic reduction have substantial potential for removing no3 from groundwater but will more probably be adopted as ex situ remediation methods the strategies to increase n2 selectivity in both the aforementioned treatment systems have been reviewed in previous studies martínez et al 2017 tokazhanov et al 2020 n2 selectivity higher than 90 can be achieved with both the aforementioned technologies and the undesired formation of nh4 is more substantially reduced than in the zvi system biological denitrification is another traditional method for removing no3 and may produce some toxic denitrification species i e no2 n2o and nh4 capodici et al 2018 yang et al 2012 the proportion of which in final products varies with treatment conditions relevant investigations and discussions have been performed on the factors influencing the accumulation of intermediates during denitrification including the type and quantity of electron donors warneke et al 2011 yang et al 2012 hydraulic retention time hrt wang et al 2009 zhai et al 2017a temperature holtan hartwig et al 2002 hu et al 2011 and so on in recent decades an increasing number of researchers have focused on different combinations of conventional technologies such as microbial electro remediation which couples microbial physiology with electrochemistry sevda et al 2018 in the integrated system no3 can be converted to n2 by heterotrophic denitrification or by autotrophic denitrification cecconet et al 2020 studies have shown that complete denitrification in microbial electro remediation can be achieved by adjusting the conductivity of groundwater pous et al 2013 puig et al 2012 applying different voltage nguyen et al 2015 virdis et al 2009 or current ghafari et al 2009 virdis et al 2009 and using different reactor configurations callegari et al 2019 zhang et al 2014a in summary increasing n2 selectivity is a primary challenge in reducing no3 in groundwater which seriously impedes the widespread use of available remediation technologies recently critical reviews have been published on in and ex situ groundwater nitrate treatment technologies for improving nitrate removal efficiency by contrast n2 selectivity appears to be neglected in remediation performance evaluation and optimization although martínez et al 2017 made the first attempt to summarize the strategies to enhance n2 selectivity in the catalytic and electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate using metallic catalysts according to our review of the literature no literature has systematically reviewed the removal performance of no3 by different technologies from the perspective of product composition therefore this review aims to provide insights into the reduction products of no3 by different commonly used remediation technologies in groundwater and their governing mechanisms in addition the latest developments in improvement strategies for n2 selectivity are presented and research gaps and potential further research directions are proposed we hope that our review provides a reference for practical engineering to treat no3 polluted groundwater such that the performance is improved and the negative effects decrease 2 nitrate reduction by zvi 2 1 mechanisms and products of nitrate reduction by zvi hydrogen gas h2 and zerovalent electropositive metals such as fe al murphy 1991 mg kumar and chakraborty 2006 zn carlson 1986 can be utilized as the reductant to reduce no3 from water by chemical reduction however using al mg zn and h2 as the only electron donor for no3 reduction in groundwater has been far less studied in recent years mainly because of their low safety high cost short lifetime and so on by comparison zvi has been mostly employed as the electron donor for in situ and ex situ no3 removal from groundwater because of its strong reducing property low price and wide material sources tang et al 2019 different reaction pathways for no3 reduction by zvi have been proposed since the 1990s however a uniform mechanism has not been determined hwang et al 2011 the most widely accepted mechanism is the direct electron transfer from zvi to no3 which involves the reactions in eqs 1 4 suzuki et al 2012 yang and lee 2005 fig 1 a in addition studies have proposed that no3 reduction is accomplished step by step eqs 4 5 zhang et al 2017 no2 is formed first as a reactive intermediate and is only produced at the initial stage of the reaction yang and lee 2005 zhang et al 2017 fig 1 b additionally the adsorbed h atom hads ferrous iron fe2 and some iron oxides play non negligible roles in the chemical reduction of no3 by zvi for example fe2 can reduce no3 to nh4 according to eq 6 however the dominant role of fe2 is not to provide electrons but to facilitate the transfer of electrons from the fe0 core to no3 huang and zhang 2005 suzuki et al 2012 because it could enhance corrosion caused by fe0 and form magnetite fe3o4 eqs 7 8 xu et al 2012 1 5 f e 0 2 no

the aforementioned reactions eqs 1 6 cheng et al 1997 choe et al 2000 it is generally accepted that n2 is a clean harmless and expected product of no3 reduction table s1 summarizes the distribution of products under different reaction conditions when zvi was used to reduce no3 the 20 groups of experimental data from seven studies were investigated approximately 35 of the reviewed data showed that nh4 was the main reduction product of no3 accounting for more than 50 of the final products and no3 was completely converted into n2 in only 5 of all reviewed groups as nh4 is an undesirable secondary pollutant there is increasing research interest in the factors affecting the composition of products and measures to enhance n2 selectivity an overview of related studies is presented in the next section 2 2 strategies to improve n2 selectivity in nitrate reduction by zvi 2 2 1 adjustment of ph and orp based on the pourbaix diagram of n and fe see fig s1 in si the speciation of n and fe is related to the ph and orp of solution when zvi is employed to reduce no3 during the reaction between no3 and zvi the final product has been demonstrated to be more inclined to be nh4 under acidic conditions yang and lee 2005 zhang et al 2010 one possible explanation for this finding is that zvi corrosion and the formation of fe2 induced under acidic conditions lead to a rapid decrease in the orp to a value range suitable for nh4 production chen et al 2004 wei et al 2018 however as the reaction progresses the final product may have a favorable selectivity to n2 which can be attributed primarily to the increase in orp to the value which is favorable for n2 production due to the formation of oxides with the consumption of h yang and lee 2005 on the basis of these findings it is recommended to control ph and orp to the level which is beneficial for n2 production wei et al 2018 however this is accompanied by side effects such as the formation of iron oxide and the inhibition of no3 reduction in other words the application of bare zvi for nitrate removal is constrained by the inevitable trade off between n2 selectivity and removal efficiency therefore studies have attempted to combine zvi particles with biochar which can directly mediate orp and ph and promote the selectivity reduction of nitrate wei et al 2018 the specific mechanisms are discussed in section 3 1 further studies are necessary to explore more measures to control ph and orp at a suitable level in favor of increasing n2 selectivity and the removal efficiency of no3 should not be negatively affected 2 2 2 optimal selection of zvi size and dosage zvi of various sizes with variable properties may lead to significantly disparate compositions of no3 reduction products in groundwater contradictory findings on the final product distribution using nanoscale zvi nzvi and microscale zvi mzvi particles to reduce no3 have been reported some studies have shown that nzvi particles displayed a higher potential to transform no3 to n2 than mzvi particles did chen et al 2004 choe et al 2000 they have found that the final product was almost nh4 which was obtained by using mzvi while a certain percentage of n2 was obtained after the reaction when using nzvi the specific reasons for this must be further explained and verified however a different phenomenon was reported by hwang et al 2011 86 49 of the initial amount of no3 n was converted to nh4 n and the data from gas chromatography showed that n2 was not formed using nzvi to reduce no3 therefore a vital step is to collect more experimental data to further understand the conflicting findings and elucidate how the size of zvi can affect n2 selectivity which has significant implications for the optimization of zvi size in practical engineering applications 2 2 3 adjustment of zvi to nitrate molar ratio based on the no3 reduction stoichiometries in eqs 1 and 2 when no3 is reduced by zvi following the direct electron transfer pathway from zvi to no3 n2 is the dominant product when the ratio of zvi to no3 is approximately 2 5 and nh4 is a major product when the ratio of zvi to no3 is greater than or equal to 4 xiong et al 2009 in table s1 almost all of the investigated cases used relatively excessive zvi a ratio of zvi to no3 4 to reduce no3 with the final reduction product being almost nh4 in conclusion the distribution of the final products may depend on the zvi dose xiong et al 2009 recommended a ratio of zvi to no3 close to the stoichiometric coefficients of eq 1 to enhance the n2 selectivity 3 nitrate reduction by carbon materials supported zvi 3 1 mechanisms and products of nitrate reduction by carbon materials supported zvi the addition of engineered carbon materials such as biochar bc or activated carbon ac is considered a promising method to improve the remediation performance of zvi for no3 contaminated groundwater khalil et al 2017 no3 removal mechanisms using zvi c composites can be classified into two categories fig 2 the first category involves the adsorption process studies have suggested that incorporating zvi into carbon materials may enhance its adsorption capacity ahmad et al 2018 liu et al 2016a the second refers to chemical processes in which no3 adsorbed on carbon materials can be reduced by zvi in zvi c systems zvi can spontaneously form a mass of microscopic galvanic cells with carbon to promote no3 reduction zhou et al 2013 and no3 can be reduced by hads on the surface of carbon materials luo et al 2014b in the chemical process carbon materials can greatly facilitate the transfer of electrons or serve as electron shuttles to accelerate the removal of no3 by zvi pignatello et al 2017 wei et al 2018 fig 2 in a zvi c system the adsorbed no3 on the surface of carbon material can be further reduced to nh4 and n2 by zvi ahmad et al 2018 wei et al 2018 table 2 however the concentration levels of various products differed from those of the bare zvi system studies have suggested that using zvi c composites can increase the selectivity toward n2 song et al 2020 found that the combination uses of nzvi ac presented a much higher n2 selectivity 33 1 in nitrate reduction than that 13 5 by using nzvi alone similarly coupling zvi powder with ac can enhance the n2 selectivity to 19 5 compared to 7 in zvi powder only system they did not address a deep insight into the governing mechanisms about how different zvi types affect n2 selectivity wei et al 2018 observed the same phenomenon in a nzvi bc system the proportion of n2 could reach 60 of the reduced no3 n by using nzvi bc to remove no3 however only 5 7 of the removed no3 n selectively became dinitrogen in the zvi system why zvi bc composites can increase n2 selectivity has been reported studies have revealed that zvi bc can selectively adsorb nh4 by the physical adsorption capacity of bc decreasing the nh4 proportion and increasing the n2 proportion in the final products liu et al 2020a fig 2 the dominant process of nh4 adsorption may be associated with acid functional groups such as carboxyl carbonyl and phenolic groups sumaraj et al 2020 wang et al 2015 in addition bc can control the ph of the solution inhibiting the oxidation of zvi and decreasing the orp of the solution to a suitable range in favor of forming n2 wei et al 2018 fig 2 wang et al 2019 deciphered why bc can decrease zvi oxidation tendency 1 the porous structure of bc decreases the contact between oxygen and zvi 2 the complexation between functional groups and iron ions inhibits the formation of oxide 3 the acid functional groups neutralize hydroxide and 4 the reducing functional groups offer a reductive environment although the combination of zvi and carbon materials has broad application prospects in no3 removal with high n2 selectivity information on the role of zvi types or carbon materials especially for ac in enhancing n2 selectivity is relatively limited further work is necessary to explain the synergetic effect of different constituents in the zvi c materials that increase n2 selectivity in no3 reduction 3 2 strategies to improve n2 selectivity in nitrate reduction using carbon materials supported zvi studies have shown that the combined utilization of zvi and carbon materials increased n2 selectivity by 12 4 54 3 compared with the bare zvi system wei et al 2018 although only limited data are available some studies have attempted to further improve n2 selectivity in removing no3 by adding denitrifying microorganisms to the zvi bc system oh et al 2016 wang et al 2019 in zvi microbe bc systems the bc can denote electrons to denitrifying bacteria and the pore structure of bc can increase the watery space thereby increasing the stability of an anaerobic environment to support denitrification tian et al 2019 in addition some strategies like selecting optimal carbon materials al bahri et al 2013 or modifying carbon materials by using various methods such as steam activation acidic treatment synthesis in ethanol medium thermal treatment and acid thermal treatment ahmed et al 2016 khalil et al 2017 have been applied to enhance the removal efficiency and rate of no3 khalil et al 2017 it is reported that these modification methods could improve the pore structure surface area and functionality of carbon materials and adjust the ph and orp of the solution based on which they are suspected to enhance n2 selectivity theoretically however no study has evaluated and provided the quantitative data of n2 selectivity in reaction systems using zvi modified carbon materials therefore further research on n2 selectivity in the aforementioned system should be conducted and n2 selectivity should be used as an evaluation indicator and included in the evaluation criteria of material modification furthermore long term investigations are required to evaluate the stability and performance of zvi modified carbon materials 4 nitrate reduction by zvi supported metallic materials 4 1 mechanisms and products of nitrate reduction by zvi supported metallic materials adding other metals al ag cu ni or pd to zvi and creating bimetallic or trimetallic materials to enhance no3 reduction efficiency in drinking water treatment or ex situ groundwater treatment have been extensively studied for bimetallic systems coating zvi with another metal such as cu ni or pd reports have demonstrated two step reaction pathways of nitrate reduction fig 1 c first a galvanic couple could be formed because of the relative potential difference between fe0 and the secondary metal improving the reduction efficiency of no3 by accelerating iron corrosion shi et al 2016b electrons can be transferred from fe0 anode to the secondary metal cathode and they will be further accepted by no3 to generate no2 at the cathode liu et al 2019 shi et al 2016b and accepted by h for conversion into atomic hydrogen shi et al 2016b in addition no3 can also be reduced to partial no2 by zvi tang et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 second the second metal does not serve as a reductant to participate in the reaction but as an active center to provide reactive sites in favor of adsorbing no2 and hads liu et al 2019 tang et al 2019 adsorbed nitrite no2 ads can be reduced to nh4 or n2 by hads with high activity shi et al 2016a b regarding trimetallic catalysts they comprise three elements supports promoter metals and noble metals bae et al 2016 cu ni and sn have generally been accepted for use as promoter metals and pt and pd have been used as noble metals martínez et al 2017 the no3 reduction mechanisms on the surface of trimetallic catalysts are proposed in fig 1 d promoter metals such as cu can adsorb no3 and hydrogen atoms lubphoo et al 2016 and they can react mutually to form no2 which is further released into the solution noble metals activate h because of their high affinity for h martínez et al 2017 no2 can be resorbed to the sites at the noble metal surface and react with hads to generate n2 or nh4 liou et al 2009 prüsse and vorlop 2001 in addition another no3 reduction mechanism in trimetallic materials have been developed by previous studies hou et al 2015 xu et al 2017b they found that the intermetallic al fe compounds al3fe4 could be formed in al fe alloys containing copper the al3fe4 which is an alternative catalyst to pd can provide active sites to the formation of hads bimetallic or trimetallic materials can reduce no3 to nh4 no2 and n2 according to the literature using some bimetallic materials to reduce no3 can decrease the nh4 yield compared with zvi shi et al 2016a found that 98 3 of no3 n was reduced when ni was added to chelating resin supported fe only 21 3 no3 n removal could be achieved using chelating resin supported fe and the concentration of nh4 was lower than the latter data not shown zeng et al 2017 observed that adding cu to fe0 could attain the no3 removal of 86 and nh4 selectivity the amount of nh4 n the amount of reduced no3 n of approximately 30 data was from fig 4 in the original paper and further calculated and 68 and 99 respectively when employing fe0 to reduce no3 however although improvements were obtained the selectivity to n2 did not reach a satisfactory level because no3 may be reduced selectively to no2 despite a low yield of nh4 liu et al 2014b 2019 compared with bimetallic particles trimetallic materials can further improve n2 selectivity because partial no2 can be adsorbed and further converted into n2 liou et al 2009 liu et al 2014b lubphoo et al 2015 notably the reuse of no2 as an intermediate product promotes the generation of n2 by the recombination of n atoms in the metallic system generally n2 selectivity is determined by the ratio of the n and h species n h prüsse and vorlop 2001 specifically a high n h favors the formation of n2 because it improves the chance of collision between n species and a low n h is inclined to generate nh4 for example for pd crystallites the edge and corner sites are favorable for nh4 formation due to the occurrence of deep hydrogenation and a relative surplus of adsorbed h while the terrace sites are beneficial for the formation n2 due to low affinity to h yoshinaga et al 2002 4 2 strategies to improve n2 selectivity in nitrate reduction using zvi supported metallic materials 4 2 1 optimal selection of loaded metal type in the bimetallic system it is a critical step in increasingthe n2 selectivity that no2 is adsorbed on the surface of a second metal and further reacts with atomic hydrogen the metal loaded on fe0 may exert a crucial effect on the formation of end products because of the different affinities to no2 and h several studies have demonstrated that cu has a higher no2 yield than other metals coupled with fe0 to reduce no3 bae et al 2016 liou et al 2005 liu et al 2019 cu has a low affinity for no2 and as a result no2 remains in the aqueous phase and its sorption on the metal surface is impeded liou et al 2005 liu et al 2019 by contrast pd has a better adsorption capacity for no2 and the partial no2 can be converted to n2 at the pd catalyst surface prüsse and vorlop 2001 thus the type of added second metal on fe0 influences no3 reduction characteristics and n2 selectivity to varying degrees in the trimetallic system optimizing the deposited sequence of metals is necessary as the electronegativity and reduction potential value of pd is higher than that of cu pd tends to compete for more electrons than cu does and no2 is more easily reduced to n2 on the surface of pd than cu is lubphoo et al 2016 as a result adding cu before pd on fe0 increases the n2 yield due to more exposure of pd sites to the pollutants therefore it is vital to carry out parametric studies on the loaded types and the deposited sequence of each individual catalyst to achieve nitrate reduction with high capacity and selectivity 4 2 2 other strategies in addition to selecting the optimal type of metal other strategies have been proposed to improve n2 selectivity when coupling zvi with metals for no3 removal some reaction conditions such as the mass ratio of the promoter and noble metals initial concentration of no3 loading of the metallic catalyst and ph of the solution should be optimized to improve the efficiency of no3 reduction and n2 selectivity the products selectivity of no3 reduction obtained under different reaction conditions are summarized in table 1 adjusting these factors to achieve high n2 selectivity for nitrate removal was reviewed by tokazhanov et al 2020 in addition preprocess methods such as pre magnetization have attracted much attention because of their substantial potential to form n2 by generating a magnetic field gradient force to attract more paramagnetic no3 and promote nn recombination ren et al 2017 another method to improve n2 selectivity is embedding supports in metallic materials the excellent adsorption performance of no3 may be achieved by adding carriers to promote the formation of nn pairing and the introduction of an appropriate carrier is conducive to the uniform distribution of metals promoting the formation of more terrace sites in favor of nn pairing taking pd crystallites as an example shi et al 2016b however internal mass transfer limitations inside the support may negatively affect the activity and selectivity of no3 reduction a low mass transfer limitation of no3 may promote the reduction of no3 to no2 increasing the no2 to h ratio and promoting the formation of nn pairing shi et al 2016b some studies have attempted to decrease internal mass transfer limitations by applying a catalyst aggregate with a small size which can be achieved by the ultrasonic treatment of the catalyst chinthaginjala and lefferts 2010b shuai et al 2012 on one hand a small catalyst particle can provide a short diffusion path chinthaginjala et al 2010a and promote nn pairing because of faster mass transfer on the other hand the increase in local ph can be reduced because of faster proton mass transfer in smaller aggregates inhibiting the production of nh4 shuai et al 2012 in addition some special supports have a low mass transfer limitation of no3 and exhibit high n2 selectivity because of their special structure for example the mass transfer limitations of chelating resin may be decreased inside the aggregate because of their high mesoporous volume low microporosity and absence of charged functional groups fixed on its matrix accelerating the reduction of no3 shi et al 2016b carbon nanofiber cnf supports have a greater mass transfer than other traditional support particles alumina ac graphite and silica because of their high porosity and low tortuosity chinthaginjala et al 2010a the types of support materials may have different effects on n2 selectivity so developing some novel support materials and determining the optimal support materials might be a challenge in future although research has enriched the theories and optimization methods with regard to the increase of n2 selectivity when coupling zvi with metals for no3 removal some limitations remain 1 most optimization strategies reviewed in our paper were investigated in batch reactors and showed a satisfactory effect to enhance n2 selectivity however the long term performance of zvi supported metallic materials after implementations should be further examined in continuous flow reactor or under real field conditions 2 currently the potential use of zvi supported metal materials in ex situ remediation facilities or in situ treatment has been inhibited because of the high prices of the composite materials an analysis of the cost and technological advantages of remediation using zvi based metallic materials is another topic for further research 3 in addition little research has been designed to quantify the level and change in molecular and atomic hydrogen considering its reduction directly affecting on n2 selectivity in zvi based bimetallic or trimetallic systems previous studies conducted in closed batch systems and they defaulted that molecular and atomic hydrogen can accumulate and provide sufficient electrons xie and cwiertny 2013 however in field applications with complex and dynamic conditions molecular and atomic hydrogen may be diffused and whether atomic hydrogen can achieve the required levels should be further confirmed 5 biological denitrification 5 1 mechanisms and products by biological denitrification biological denitrification which comprises autotrophic denitrification ad and heterotrophic denitrification hd has been widely used for in situ and ex situ no3 removal from groundwater su et al 2018 in biological denitrification no3 can be used as a terminal electron acceptor and converted into no2 then to nitric oxide no n2o and n2 in that order by respiration of autotrophic or heterotrophic microorganisms under anoxic conditions karanasios et al 2010 the general consensus in the literature is that the amount of no can be disregarded in the final products pous et al 2013 and that no2 and n2o are easily and stably accumulated under inappropriate conditions no2 which can cause methemoglobinemia and death if ingested by humans zhang et al 2018 has more toxic effects than no3 in groundwater majone et al 2015 in addition when the concentration of no2 is above 3 0 mg l it poses a serious threat to aquatic environments because of its biotoxicity zhou et al 2021 n2o a greenhouse gas with a 300 fold greater potential than co2 majone et al 2015 richardson et al 2009 is another by product that should be investigated n2o is predicted to become a dominant stratospheric ozone depleting substance in the 21st century ravishankara et al 2009 another unexpected intermediate specie nh4 may be generated via no2 by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra medinets et al 2015 or by fermentation of protein with natural biomass as the carbon source zhang et al 2012 therefore determining and reducing the amounts of these intermediates during biological denitrification is necessary 5 2 strategies to improve n2 selectivity for heterotrophic denitrification studies on intermediate products of heterotrophic denitrification have mainly focused on specific n species for example some studies have explored the accumulation of no2 or nh4 to ensure groundwater quality security and other studies have emphasized the emission of n2o because of its negative effect on climate change therefore obtaining the available data on all potential products and accurately quantifying n2 selectivity based on limited data are difficult in this section the concentration of the intermediate products investigated reflects the degree of complete denitrification under different conditions table s2 5 2 1 optimal selection of carbon source types the carbon source is the major factor affecting the no3 attenuation when groundwater has insufficient bioavailable carbon matters the application of heterotrophic metabolism is limited hou et al 2019 studies have focused on adding external and efficient carbon sources to no3 contaminated groundwater or relevant bioreactors extra carbon sources are classified into two types 1 liquid carbon sources including natural organic carbon compounds e g methanol ethanol glucose and by products of carbon rich waste liquid fermentation and 2 solid phase carbon sources including synthetic polymers and natural biomass wang et al 2021b different phenomena regarding the accumulation of intermediates have been observed when different carbon sources are used on one hand carbon source types may influence the competitive advantage between the dnra process and denitrification due to differential denitrifying organism adaption to carbon type yang et al 2012 generating different final products akunna et al 1993 found that glucose and glycerol could induce the dnra pathway and that some volatile fatty acids such as acetic and lactic acids were preferred for denitrification even for the same carbon source different processes may be activated unlike the result proposed by akunna et al 1993 in which up to 50 of reduced no3 n was converted to nh4 n when glycerol was used as the carbon source a subsequent study showed that adding glycerol as a carbon source exhibited a considerable denitrifying capacity by denitrification and data suggested that no3 removal could reach 98 14 and that nh4 did not accumulate schroeder et al 2020 on the other hand for denitrification the dominant microorganisms induced by each carbon type may have different affinities for various types of electron receptors and may form different quantities of nox no3 no2 n2o and no reductase wang et al 2021b as a result different intermediate denitrification products may have accumulated as mentioned by warneke et al 2011 wheat straw on average produced approximately three times more dissolved n2o than maize cobs green waste and woodchips used as carbon sources the high n2o emission in the wheat straw system was related to a relatively high ratio of nitrite reductase gene copies to nitrous oxide reductase gene copies generally natural biomass provides a very limited availability of carbon for microorganisms they contain abundant lignin a key substance that hinders bacteria from utilizing other materials hu et al 2017 some strategies have been developed to further enhance the quantity of microbially available carbon and increase n2 selectivity for example various pretreatment methods such as lime pretreatment and peracetic acid pretreatment have been developed to remove lignin from agricultural wastes and increase the abundance of denitrifying bacteria promoting complete denitrification hu et al 2017 2019 the performance of these pretreatment methods is significant in laboratory tests under controllable conditions however their performance and complete denitrification potential require further investigation in real groundwater environments moreover studies have recommended combining different carbon sources to achieve high denitrification performance and high n2 selectivity such as the combination of maize cobs and wood chips warneke et al 2011 they found that maize cob had a high no3 removal performance with a high release of total organic carbon toc and dissolved n2o and that wood substrates had a moderate sustained no3 removal with no adverse effects therefore to achieve a balance between no3 removal performance and by product production maize cobs and woodchips can be combined as carbon sources for denitrification in addition synthetic polymers as carbon sources have a higher more stable denitrification rate than natural occurring substances do wang and chu 2016 however the application of synthetic polymers is usually limited by their high cost chu and wang 2016 recently studies have attempted to blend polymers with cheap organic substances such as starch bamboo powder and sawdust and a more significant denitrification performance and lower accumulation of by products can be achieved even compared with polymers only systems chu and wang 2016 yang et al 2020a under such multiple carbon source conditions a mixed community of bacteria and fungi can be formed creating wide ecological niches qi et al 2020 the application of composite carbons combining low cost natural biomass with synthetic polymers should be a subject of further research for solid phase carbon sources containing complex dissolved organic compounds understanding the effects of dominant organic components on nitrate attenuation related processes in groundwater has important implications for effectively stimulating nitrate attenuation recently fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been utilized to elucidate the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter which should be further employed to characterize the dissolved organic carbon doc evolution in groundwater and elucidate governing mechanisms of doc related nitrate loss 5 2 2 optimal selection of carbon source quantity the quantity of the carbon source leads to a different ratio between organic carbon and no3 c n significantly affecting the accumulation of by products in heterotrophic denitrification it has been reported that the distribution of no3 consumption between heterotrophic denitrification and dnra is closely related to the availability of organic matter nikolenko et al 2018 fermentative dnra is believed to be favored in no3 limited environments with rich carbon sources by contrast heterotrophic denitrification dominates in carbon source limited groundwater burgin and hamilton 2007 nikolenko et al 2018 in heterotrophic denitrification processes a higher c n ratio is generally believed to decrease the accumulation of no2 zhai et al 2017a showed that when c n was above 0 9 1 2 no2 in the effluent was below the detection limit but the concentration of no3 and no2 in the effluent increased rapidly because of the limited carbon source when the c n ratio continued to decrease to 0 8 therefore controlling the quantity of carbon sources to avoid the accumulation of by products is essential generally using liquid carbon sources has the risk of insufficient doses or overdosing while solid carbon sources have the potential to alleviate these risks this occurs because the denitrifying microbes respond to nitrate levels in the aqueous phase and further adjust the amount of the released organic carbon for solid carbon sources wang and chu 2016 moreover the feeding scheme of carbon sources which refers to different feeding strategies such as the periodic or batch addition of carbon sources may influence the process of complete denitrification schalk otte et al 2000 found that in heterotrophic denitrification the feeding regime may result in an unbalanced supply of electron donors and acceptors and n2o emissions will be influenced particularly when carbon sources become exhausted and the culture enters starvation periods n2o accumulation is significant thus selecting a suitable feeding scheme for carbon sources such as a dynamic feeding scheme is advantageous for the full utilization of carbon sources and complete denitrification furthermore another new approach gradient filling pattern was proposed zhao et al 2020 in which the carbon source dosage decreased from upstream to downstream in the reactor corresponding to the gradually decreasing no3 concentration from the inlet to the outlet in the bioreactor the novel design provided a more feasible carbon source according to the real time needs of the microorganism and alleviated the problem of excessive organic matter in the downstream the researchers observed that the bioreactor with a gradient filling woodchip had a higher no3 removal rate and a lower no2 accumulation than the uniform filling bioreactor for no3 contaminated groundwater treatment further research should focus on different carbon sources in gradient filling bioreactors or developing other optimized filling patterns similarly the in situ heterotrophic denitrification process of injecting external carbon sources should consider the difference in no3 levels along the groundwater flow path and it is necessary to formulate corresponding strategies to prevent the insufficiency or excess of carbon sources such as multipoint injection 5 2 3 adjustment of dissolved oxygen concentration notably dissolved oxygen do concentration varies widely by the aquifer ranging from below 1 mg l to approximately 10 mg l collins et al 2017 jahangir et al 2014 however most denitrifying bacteria are facultative anaerobes van rijn et al 2006 do concentration levels should be considered during heterotrophic denitrification because they may affect the accumulation of intermediate products it has been reported that no3 can be completely converted to n2 by denitrification when do concentrations are below 1 6 mg l in aquifers böhlke et al 2007 but a high do concentration tends to result in more no2 luo et al 2014a yang et al 2012 high do concentration may inhibit the activities of different denitrification enzymes such as nitrate reductase nar or nitrous oxide reductase nir gómez et al 2002 wang and chu 2016 or influence the composition of bacterial biofilms gómez et al 2002 reported that when the do concentration was high the ratio between the population of bacteria with the function of n2o generation and no2 generation was very low resulting in no2 accumulation some strategies have been adopted to minimize the negative effects of do on heterotrophic denitrification for example in ectopic reactors adding reductive substances na2so3 to raw water gómez et al 2002 or optimizing the structure of denitrification devices gutierrez wing et al 2012 have been studied for oxygen elimination for the in situ deoxygenation of contaminated groundwater a two layer permeable reactive barrier prb has been proposed and continually developed in which the first layer filled with granular oxygen capturing materials is used to capture do in groundwater to create anaerobic conditions for the second layer of microbial denitrification liu et al 2013 zvi is usually selected as a potential oxygen capturing reagent liu et al 2013 additionally carbon substrates may influence the distribution of do concentration and two influence mechanisms are involved it was reported that when solid carbon sources such as biodegradable polymers are used as substrates for heterotrophic denitrification the diffusion of oxygen is inhibited and large anoxic zones are formed due to the pores and cracks of carbon sources gutierrez wing et al 2012 luo et al 2014a in addition the initial consumption rate of substrates is positively correlated with the consumption of oxygen therefore choosing a directly metabolic carbon type can stimulate oxygen consumption decreasing the adverse impact of the do level on denitrification products yang et al 2012 5 2 4 optimal design of hrt the release of intermediates is associated with the hrt during heterotrophic denitrification because a shorter hrt may lead to incomplete denitrification wang et al 2009 showed that when hrt was longer than 8 h the concentration of no2 n in the effluent was below 0 02 mg l but if the hrt was shorter than 4 h it could be sharply increased a similar result was found by zhai et al 2017a that is no2 was not detected when the hrt was 8 h however the no2 n concentration reached 9 18 mg l initial no3 n 50 mg l when the hrt was decreased to 2 h a shorter hrt may reduce physical contact between denitrifying bacteria and carbon sources and increase the shear force weakening the diffusivity of carbon sources in biofilms he et al 2016 therefore it is crucial to prolong the hrt to control the excessive generation of by products however if the hrt is too long the initial construction cost can be increased to achieve the same treatment capacity in addition nh4 and toc may be substantially released because of the long contact time between water and natural biomass in the bioreactor zhao et al 2020 on the basis of the aforementioned discussion hrt should be adjusted to an optimal value by considering cost no3 removal efficiency and the composition of products comprehensively during the design of the denitrification reactor 5 2 5 other strategies ph plays a crucial role in controlling the generation of by products for denitrification it has different influences on different enzyme activities the optimal ph for no3 and no2 reductases has been reported to be 7 5 and 6 5 respectively and high ph facilitates the accumulation of no2 stevens et al 1998 zhai et al 2017a regarding nh4 its accumulation due to the dnra process gradually decreases from acidic to alkaline conditions zhai et al 2017a zhang et al 2015b adding buffer has been a frequently used measure to adjust solution ph in bioreactors but is not feasible for in situ remediation implementations in addition to controlling the ph of the influent it should be noted that denitrification can generate oh and increase the ph of the solution therefore researchers have developed a new combined two step process of the heterotrophic and sulfur autotrophic denitrification processes and the ph can be better sustained liu et al 2009 moreover temperature changes may affect the accumulation of intermediates because they may influence microbial activity community structure riedel 2019 and hydrolysis of substrates wang and chu 2016 further affecting the structure of products during the denitrification process nearly all studies investigating the effect of temperature on nitrate removal have been conducted in denitrification reactors in addition other factors should be considered such as other co existing substances which may affect the excessive release of intermediate products phosphorus is a major essential microbial nutrient for biological growth and development zhang et al 2015a and an important limiting element for denitrification satake and tang 2018 high nitrate and low phosphorus have been reported as typical characteristics of groundwater in agricultural areas with high fertilizer usage however low phosphorus could lead to the incomplete reduction of no3 and the accumulation of no2 or n2o rather than n2 satake and tang 2018 therefore considering supplemental phosphorus sources is important when designing prbs or bioreactors for treating nitrate polluted groundwater zhang et al 2015a 5 3 strategies to improve n2 selectivity for fe supported autotrophic denitrification autotrophic denitrification has received increasing attention for treating groundwater with a low c n ratio tian and yu 2020 autotrophs use inorganic carbon such as carbon dioxide or bicarbonate as carbon sources and depend on inorganic electron donors for energy ghafari et al 2008 hydrogen h2 according to literature is potentially an ideal electron donor for autotrophic denitrification because it is harmless and has economic advantages tian and yu 2020 for the method of h2 supply in a h2 based system in addition to delivering h2 directly several technologies have been developed for generating h2 instantly for instance h2 can be supplied by iron corrosion liu et al 2020b or electrolysis in a bio electrochemical reactor ghafari et al 2008 jiang et al 2018 detailed description in section 6 to participate in hydrogenotrophic denitrification an fe supported autotrophic denitrification system can be applied in prbs as in situ groundwater remediation and in bioreactor as ex situ treatment in which iron has dual functions it can reduce no3 as a reducing agent and it can generate h2 by undergoing corrosion which acts as an electron donor for microbial metabolism liu et al 2020b in the early stages of the reaction chemical reduction is the principal mechanism and the terminal product is almost entirely nh4 the dominant reaction gradually evolves from chemical reduction to bio denitrification in which n2 is gradually generated an et al 2009 as described in section 2 1 no3 can be reduced by bare zvi with the generation of a large amount of nh4 while coupling iron with autotrophic bacteria can decrease the nh4 yield and increase the n2 selectivity of the final products for no3 removal however the degree of enhancement on n2 selectivity is largely dependent on multiple factors such as the iron s characteristics bioavailability of electron donors ph and do which need to be fully understood the results obtained under different reaction conditions are summarized in table 2 and discussed in the following sections 5 3 1 optimal selection of iron parameters the type of iron can influence the selection of n2 as an end product in fe supported autotrophic denitrification because of its different reductive ability and hydrogen production capacity for example an et al 2013 observed that using passivated iron powder can significantly change the denitrification end product distribution of hydrogenotrophic denitrification producing less nh4 than acid washed iron or steel wool in such a reaction system they hypothesized that the iron oxide coating might decrease the reduction of no3 but not influence the contact with water and generate h2 mishra and farrell 2005 therefore biological denitrification reactions are not limited however this topic requires further research in addition the surface of oxides may adsorb nh4 because of the net negative surface charges of oxides which may increase n2 selectivity by decreasing the nh4 proportion in the final products in addition to the iron type iron dosage is another important factor that affects the distribution of end products for fe supported autotrophic denitrification studies have found that using a lower steel wool concentration may minimize nh4 formation but may also limit h2 formation adversely affecting the rate of biological denitrification biswas and bose 2005 lavania and bose 2006 higher iron dosage may inhibit biological denitrification due to the toxicity of zvi to the microorganisms and induce an obvious increase in ph over the optimum range for bacteria you et al 2017 in addition one study found that the optimal dose of mzvi was 0 2 g l this dose removed no3 nearly completely and generated the smallest amount of no2 and nh4 and when the dose of mzvi was below 0 2 g l the concentration of the aforementioned by products increased zhang et al 2019 therefore the optimum iron dosage is case specific and a win win solution achieving both a high nitrate removal efficiency and a high n2 selectivity needs to be designed by comprehensively considering the iron dosage and other factors in summary the balance between chemical reduction and biodegradation should be seriously considered to generate a proper h2 yield and further promote biological denitrification when selecting the iron types and iron dosage moreover additional studies should be performed to understand the interfacial mass transfer and biochemical mechanisms of zvi bacteria and no3 under different iron parameters including the characteristics of enzyme activity electron transport and microbial communities which contribute to clarifying the specific influence of iron parameters on n2 selectivity and further optimizing reaction conditions 5 3 2 optimal selection of initial biomass concentration the initial biomass concentration affects nh4 formation by influencing the balance between chemical and biological processes when the fe bacteria system contained small doses of bacteria nh4 was accumulated because of the superiority of chemical reduction in competing for electrons when the biomass is excessive the growth of bacteria may be restricted by insufficient h2 and their adaptable phase may be prolonged resulting in a competitive advantage of chemical reduction and the accumulation of additional nh4 an et al 2009 therefore controlling the biomass concentration in an fe supported autotrophic denitrification system is crucial for decreasing undesirable end products 5 3 3 other strategies changing the method of coupling iron and bacteria may contribute to reducing nh4 production most studies have established an fe supported autotrophic denitrification system by directly adding and mixing bacteria and fe into the water an et al 2009 an et al 2014 and partial no3 can be reduced to nh4 by fe however more recently a denitrifying bacteria iron nanoparticle composite material was biosynthesized with iron nanoparticles embedded in the bacteria and fe nanoparticles were fully protected liu et al 2021 in this system iron nanoparticles did not act as a reductant to react and release additional nh4 but as the electron donor for bacteria to complete the biological denitrification process and promote the denitrification rate in addition previous studies developed some strategies to enhance n2 selectivity during iron assisted no3 removal in ex situ treatment such as adjusting the hrt temperature and ph yet which may be not easily implemented under in situ conditions generally a longer hrt benefits autotrophic denitrification and a shorter hrt benefits chemical reduction and results in an increased nh4 production liu et al 2020b till et al 1998 peng et al 2015 suggested that high temperature 37 substantially increased the removal efficiency of no3 but has little effect on nh4 yield in the combined system the ph of the solution is related to the different hydrogenotrophic cultures used in this denitrifying system studies have found that the optimum ph was 7 6 8 6 under which substantial no3 removal rates and desirable end products were displayed karanasios et al 2010 xing et al 2020 however in the actual reaction both chemical reduction by iron and hydrogen autotrophic denitrification can consume protons and increase the alkalinity of the system karanasios et al 2010 many studies have found that the ph of an fe supported autotrophic denitrification system significantly exceeded 9 5 and even increased to 10 5 without ph control liu et al 2020b xing et al 2016 some studies have used buffers to control the ph in reactors in addition co2 has been applied to control the ph and it showed a good removal efficiency of no3 xing et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 however except as the ph buffer additional co2 can react with h2 to participate in organic carbon metabolism and promote heterotrophic denitrification xing et al 2020 heterotrophic denitrification undoubtedly affects the flow of electrons and the distribution of end products in fe supported autotrophic denitrification but has not been explored in depth in addition pretest studies are necessary to increase the security and feasibility of ph regulation technology when determining the optimal ph in the reactor 5 4 strategies to improve n2 selectivity for sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification sdad is used to remove no3 at in situ denitrification walls or bioreactors in which some reduced sulfur compounds such as dissolved sulfide elemental sulfur s0 and thiosulfate s2o3 2 can act as electron donors by chemolithoautotrophic denitrification to reduce no3 to n2 sierra alvarez et al 2007 wang et al 2020 previous studies found that some bacteria can use reduced inorganic sulfur compounds as an electron donor for no3 reduction to nh4 by chemoautotrophic dnra but they were basically conducted in soil freshwater ecosystems coastal or estuarine sediments or estuary lu et al 2013 showed that free sulfide exerted little effect on dnra in soils with a high amount of organic carbon however a high addition rate of sulfide significantly increased dnra rates in low c environments li et al 2021 explored the synergistic effect of organic and sulfide on denitrification and dnra in sequencing biofilm batch reactor and found that dnra was facilitated in carbon limited system given the above clues sulfide related dnra pathway to reduce no3 should be considered in groundwater containing inadequate carbon sources in addition sulfur compounds can chemically reduce no3 to nh4 chao 1967 accordingly the contributions of denitrification chemical processes from no3 to nh4 and biological dnra to no3 removal should be further quantified in sdad in future at present studies have verified the feasibility of sdad to treat no3 pollution from groundwater and developed strategies to minimize sulfate production however in addition to sulfate the adverse effects of intermediate nitrogen especially n2o or no2 should be considered relevant technologies to reduce the production of nitric by products have been developed the results of many studies on the selectivity of nitrate reduction products under different reaction conditions by using sdad were collected and listed in table 3 5 4 1 optimal selection of the sulfur substrates in sdad the sulfur substrate electron donor is oxidized following which it offers a flow of electrons into the electron transport chain and further allocates them to different nitrogen oxide reductases oberoi et al 2021 therefore various sulfur substrates with different biological oxidation rates influence the electron competition among nitrogen oxide reductases significantly influencing no3 reduction and the accumulation of denitrifying intermediates no2 and n2o in sdad di capua et al 2016 found that 11 0 31 4 of initial no3 n was converted into no2 n when s0 was used as electron donors while s2o3 2 was an excellent electron donor capable of complete denitrification under the experimental conditions this result is consistent with that of oberoi et al 2021 there are two conflicting findings regarding the effect of dissolved sulfide on n2o reduction in sdad some studies have proposed that n2o reductase activity is inhibited because of the precipitation of sulfide with copper to form metal sulfide and n2o emission will be promoted bartacek et al 2010 pan et al 2013 by contrast yang et al 2016a demonstrated that dissolved sulfide h2s hs and s2 could effectively promote n2o reduction they suggested that the copper co factor in n2o reductase was not precipitated by dissolved sulfide in the cell periplasm and that continuous electron transport can be maintained because the dissolved sulfide can be instantly oxidized into sulfur or polysulfide by sulfide oxidase even for the same composition of elemental sulfur the accumulation of intermediates differs with different preparation methods and particle sizes in comparing the n2 selectivity performance of employing chemical elemental sulfur s0 chem and biogenic elemental sulfur s0 bio as sulfur sources contradictory findings have been reported di capua et al 2016 found that s0 bio as an electron donor exhibited a higher denitrification rate while more no2 accumulation 31 4 of the initial no3 n was observed in sdad with s0 bio as electron donor than s0 chem 11 0 of the initial no3 n by contrast the latest findings showed the opposite trend the reactor of s0 bio obtained a more complete denitrification than s0 chem even at a high load of no3 ucar et al 2020 kostrytsia et al 2018a 2018b found a low accumulation level and a fast removal rate 20 9 mg no2 n l d of no2 n when using s0 bio as electron donors however a slower removal rate 8 0 mg no2 n l d of the accumulated no2 n was observed when using s0 chem as electron donors it is because of the higher bioavailability of s0 bio provided by the microcrystallinity and hydrophilic properties than s0 chem wang et al 2020 these contradictory findings may result from other distinct factors such as the hrt and the sulfur to nitrogen s n mass ratio overall further in depth research is required to reveal the no2 accumulation performance in the sdad process under complex conditions moreover different particle surface areas mainly affect the s0 mass transfer from the solid to the aqueous phase and the bioavailability of electron donors di capua et al 2016 generally selecting s0 particle with a higher specific surface area such as s0 powder can increase the s0 solubilization rate and decrease the accumulation of by products di capua et al 2016 kostrytsia et al 2018a however in addition to no2 data on the accumulation of other intermediates such as n2o in sdad with different types of s0 have not been obtained therefore n2o emissions should be evaluated and considered in further research 5 4 2 optimal selection of s n the s n mass ratio affects the supply of electrons influencing the accumulation of denitrification intermediates according to the stoichiometry presented in eqs 9 and 10 the minimum theoretical requirements of s n mass ratio are 1 90 and 1 40 respectively using elemental sulfur and sulfide as electron donors for complete denitrification to n2 oberoi et al 2021 however the optimal s n mass ratio may be related to other reaction conditions in actual applications a higher s n mass ratio can provide adequate electrons to relieve the electron competition among no3 no2 and n2o reductases hence the reduction of intermediates can be significantly promoted liu et al 2016b yang et al 2016b in addition supplying excessive sulfide high s n mass ratio is also conducive to reducing the inhibition of free nitrous acid fna on n2o reduction generally fna can react with the active sites of copper containing enzymes and result in competitive inhibition of n2o reductase however this method can increase costs lan et al 2019 yang et al 2016b therefore the optimal s n mass ratio should be determined to consider other design conditions and minimize the cost and intermediate production simultaneously 9 s 0 1 2 n o 3 0 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 0 6 n 2 0 8 h 10 5 h s 8 no 3 3 h 5 so 4 2 4 n 2 4 h 2 o 5 4 3 other strategies in addition to the type and amount of electron donors selecting an optimal feeding scheme for the sulfur source may promote the complete reduction of no3 to n2 oberoi et al 2021 found that slow continuous feeding of sulfide decreased the inhibition of nitrous oxide reductase and n2o emissions from sdad hence selecting a suitable feeding strategy would achieve effective autotrophic denitrification and decrease the production of harmful intermediates adjusting other conditions including the ph hrt and temperature may be effective measures to decrease the accumulation of denitrification intermediates in bioreactors for example ph can influence fna and n2o emissions liu et al 2016b in addition a lower water temperature may promote the accumulation of no2 and n2o low temperature is better at suppressing n2o reductase than the n2o producing enzymes wang et al 2017 6 biological denitrification assisted by electricity 6 1 mechanisms and products of bio electrochemical systems bio electrochemical systems bess have been applied recently for in situ or ex situ no3 removal from contaminated groundwater the common structure of bess involves microorganisms electrodes and wires and microorganisms are attached to the electrodes mediating the electron transfer huang et al 2013 electrons are provided by an external source and reach the cathode through the electrodes and wires callegari et al 2019 no3 can be reduced in the anodic chamber by heterotrophic denitrification or autotrophic denitrification in the cathodic chamber based on the methods to maintain a continuous electron flow bess can be operated as the microbial fuel cells mfcs microbial electrolysis cells mecs or biofilm electrode reactors bers molognoni et al 2017 fig 3 in a denitrifying mfc electrons are created in the anodic chamber from the oxidization of organic matter and are transferred from the anode to the cathode along the wire containing a resistor puig et al 2012 in the cathode no3 can be used as an electron acceptor by microorganisms and removed the electrons spontaneously flow from lower to higher oxidation reduction potentials resulting in the generation of a current a typical characteristic of mfcs is that extra power input is not required pous et al 2015 however in a mec a voltage is required to be applied between the anode and cathode by using a potentiostat to maintain the cathodic potential at a desired reductive level logan et al 2008 wrana et al 2010 if electrons are provided by using a direct current between the anode and cathode the cell is known as a ber cecconet et al 2018 in a ber h2 produced from water electrolysis can serve as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrification in the cathode tong et al 2014 in addition the no3 removal pathways of these bess are similar to those of conventional biological denitrification including autotrophic or heterotrophic denitrification therefore the same by products may be formed including no2 n2o and nh4 described in section 5 1 6 2 strategies to improve n2 selectivity in bio electrochemical systems 6 2 1 optimization of conductivity studies have demonstrated that using bess to remove no3 or no2 from high conductivity 2000 11 000 μs cm 1 wastewaters was feasible however adopting bess has limitations for treating no3 pollution from groundwater because of its low conductivity 1000 μs cm 1 the low conductivity limits the nitrogen removal efficiency and the complete reduction of no3 under lower conductivity conditions mfc overpotentials irreversible energy losses related to ion transport are increased pous et al 2015 these resistances can hinder the transport of electrons and protons wang et al 2021a influencing the activities of denitrifying microorganisms and promoting the accumulation of by products in the cathode pous et al 2013 puig et al 2012 reducing the internal resistance and decreasing the production of intermediates from groundwater require increasing the conductivity of groundwater strategies for increasing conductivity have been applied in heterotopic reactors the most direct and effective method to increase the conductivity of groundwater is to add liquid electrolytes such as nacl pous et al 2015 nahco3 tong and he 2013 glucose and starch feng et al 2013 however some problems still need to be noted first adding a liquid electrolyte to in situ groundwater may be limited because the effect is not obvious due to the dilution of groundwater and it can potentially lead to secondary pollution pous et al 2015 second high salinity caused by many electrolytes can adversely affect mfc performance which may influence the activity of denitrifying bacteria kumar et al 2020 third some electrolytes such as so4 may compete with anode on electron harvesting and led to electron loss liu et al 2014a therefore we suggest comprehensively considering the dosage and possible potential impacts of exogenous electrolytes 6 2 2 control of the cathode potential or current if mecs with an additional voltage or bers with direct current are applied to no3 treatment the adverse influence of the low conductivity of groundwater can be diluted however an appropriate current or cathode potential is vital and can directly affect no3 removal performance as the n2 selectivity would be negatively affected with a too low or too high current or cathode potential for a ber chang et al 1999 found that no2 may be accumulated at a low current condition ghafari et al 2009 and van doan et al 2013 found that at high levels of current densities up to approximately 46 1 and 70 of the removed nitrate were accumulated as no2 and n2o respectively the supplied current directly affects h2 production which is closely related to autotrophic denitrification performance ghafari et al 2009 the production of h2 would be inhibited under too low or too high applied currents tong et al 2013 zhu et al 2021 in addition the structures and gene expressions of active biofilm communities may be significantly influenced at different current densities affecting the distribution of end products van doan et al 2013 therefore the optimal denitrification current as the in situ hydrogen generator must be determined in the mec similar efforts were previously made to examine the effects of cathode potential on the by products formation during nitrate reduction process virdis et al 2009 demonstrated that a lower accumulation of n2o was observed when applying a lower potential to the cathode pous et al 2015 also evaluated mecs performance but under a wider range of potentials from 597 to 703 mv vs standard hydrogen electrode she for the treatment of no3 polluted groundwater which resulted in different results from that reported by virdis et al 2009 they found that when the cathode potential was lower than 303 mv vs she obvious accumulation of no2 and n2o was observed but when the cathode potential further decreased to 123 mv vs the she the no2 and n2o accumulation were greatly alleviated in addition to no2 and n2o nh4 from dnra process was another possible by product at a lower potential zhang et al 2014a the effects of cathode potentials on the by products accumulation in the mec are mainly due to the following mechanisms proposed by different researchers 1 more electrons can be obtained at a lower potential leading to a higher electron donor acceptor ratio which favored dnra over denitrification zhang et al 2014a and lessened the competition between different denitrifying enzymes which can contribute to a more complete denitrification pous et al 2015 and 2 h2 generation which was cathode potential dependent may positively impact the denitrification by providing extra electron donor for autotrophic bacteria on the cathode wang et al 2021a despite the above understandings the comprehensive and multi involved impact pathways of cathode potential on complete denitrification have rarely been considered in one mec system 6 2 3 other strategies for a mfc system or an intensified bes that combines heterotrophic and hydrogenotrophic denitrification the degradation of organic substrates most likely occurs at the anode selecting appropriate carbon sources and the c n ratio are important for achieving complete denitrification feng et al 2013 found that a complex carbon source starch was more easily utilized by microorganisms to generate electricity than a simple carbon source methanol and glucose at the anode in an intensified bes but a higher no2 accumulation in the system containing a complex carbon source was found huang et al 2013 further observed that an increased c n ratio can facilitate the removal of no2 when starch was used as an electron donor at the anode in addition studies have been conducted to achieve full denitrification of groundwater by optimizing the structure of bess callegari et al 2019 connected two bes in series to form a sequential two step bes system in such a system a large part of no3 was removed in bes 1 while bes 2 was mainly used for removing no2 and n2o thus achieving a complete denitrification process even at a higher no3 load b zhang et al 2014a coupled the mfc with ber to supply electrons which was transferred from an mfc to a ber in comparison with the single ber system the coupled system can save extra electric energy and achieve complete biological denitrification because of the sufficient supply of electrons from mfc it is necessary for the development of novel and effective structure of bess to reduce intermediates accumulation during denitrification furthermore the electrical inversion of electrodes has been adopted to promote the complete denitrification a biofilm could firstly grow on an organic carbon oxidizing bioanode surface and afterwards the formed electrode bio anode is switched to be the biocathode through polarity inversion in this system lin et al 2021 some of the electrogenic bacteria enriched in the bioelectrode had bidirectional electron transferability and had an ability to directly use the electrode as an electron donor to reduce nitrate besides the polarity reversal of bioanodes could facilitate the formation of biofilm and the enriching of autotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria lin et al 2021 wang et al 2021c yang et al 2020b moreover the latest research demonstrated that specific microorganisms related with nitrous oxide reduction were enriched by polarity reversal promoting the reduction of n2o wang et al 2021c it should be noted that the nitrate removal performance of the bio cathode is closely related to the bio anodic bio oxidation electroactivity it is vital to adopt some strategies such as varying external resistance lin et al 2021 using different constant anodic potential and substrates to enhance the bio anodic bio oxidation electroactivity and improve the performance of the bio cathode moreover the modification of electrodes may be another potential strategy to enhance the reduction of intermediates in bess up to now the n2 selectivity in the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate with different electrode materials has been reviewed previously martínez et al 2017 but only a few studies evaluated the potential of complete denitrification through electrodes modification in bess for instance wang et al 2021c found cathode modification using porous polypyrrole ppy can promote electrons transport and n2o reduction due to the high conductivity and biocompatibility of ppy in future it is still a huge challenge to select electrode materials or tune the electrode surface by comprehensively considering electricity generation the compatibility with microorganisms complete denitrification long term stability and cost 7 conclusion and future prospects in summary recent advances in some mechanisms and strategies to improve the n2 selectivity of several frequently used methods for no3 removal in groundwater were reviewed the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the zvi system electrons transfer directly or indirectly from the zvi core to no3 which is the main mechanism for reducing no3 the main product of no3 removal was nh4 when zvi was used as the reducing agent the literature has reported that nh4 may be decreased by selecting an appropriate particle size zvi dosage ph and orp 2 to further decrease the production of nh4 in the zvi system common measures including use of loaded carbon materials and metallic materials have been applied the performance of the composite materials and reaction conditions can be optimized to enhance n2 selectivity 3 in biological denitrification and bess intermediates could accumulate including no2 and n2o generated by incomplete denitrification and nh4 produced by dnra some factors are highly related to the distribution of final products for denitrification such as the quantity and type of electron donors ph do and reactor structure 4 in terms of n2 selectivity biological denitrification is more advantaged than other chemical counterparts as the n2 selectivity can be optimized to an ideal level with appropriate cost effective measures although the optimal regulation to obtain a high n2 selectivity for biological denitrification can be relatively easily achieved in bioreactor its in situ applications are usually limited due to poor engineering feasibility under field conditions based on our review our proposals for possible future research and considerations are as follows 1 based on the concept of sustainable development defined by the brundtland commission when conducting technological comparisons of nitrate removal in groundwater the removal efficiency and rate and total environmental impacts caused by various products should be considered based on the life cycle assessment methodology acquiring information on n2 selectivity and considering nitrate removal efficiency can help decision makers better quantify environmental impact potentials and achieve a more sustainable remediation performance 2 although sufficient data are available to evaluate the negative effects of by products in no3 removal systems quantitative data on n2 selectivity remain inadequate especially for biological denitrification therefore the scarcity of measured n2 selectivity data in various nitrate remediation systems dramatically limits remediation performance evaluation and further hampers remediation scheme optimization therefore further efforts should be made to collect more data originating from different remediation systems and site conditions and the n2 selectivity database should be further enriched 3 most studies have focused on the influence of a single factor on n2 selectivity in future further evaluation of the combined effects of multiple factors is necessary in engineering practice in addition further research is needed to quantitatively establish a correlation among key factors the removal efficiency and n2 selectivity for the aforementioned technologies to treat no3 pollution in groundwater which will provide guidance for engineering applications 4 recent innovations in remediation materials and strategies for increasing n2 selectivity have been mostly undertaken in the laboratory under controlled operational conditions that considerably differ from field conditions thus demonstrating the feasibility of their application to real groundwater with fluctuating geochemical and hydrological parameters is necessary for example many co existing electron acceptors including some natural electron acceptors do so4 2 etc and reducible pollutants v v cr vi etc may have effects on the dominant reduction pathway thus further influencing n2 selectivity in addition further research should

16387,due to global warming and local anthropogenic pressures sustainable groundwater resource exploitation in coastal cities is increasingly threatened for example the fifth largest brazilian city recife is considered as a representative hot spot for these issues and illustrates the great challenges facing many urban areas in the southern hemisphere there recharge as well as surface water and groundwater quality are altered by frequent droughts and poorly planned environmental management since decades to maintain access to water thousands of private wells were dug in order to pump water from the multi layered aquifer system found under the city this massive exploitation is causing a chronic lowering of the water levels as well as seawater intrusion and contaminations by wastewater or polluted surface waters through hydrochemical characterization mainly cl br ratio and cl concentrations of wells sampled throughout the metropole this study first characterizes the main environmental impacts on the resource i e waste waters and seawater combining this evaluation with lithological land use and socio environmental data it was then possible to build decision trees identifying combinations of multiple factors possibly having an impact on contamination types the well and population densities the waste and sewage management as well as the absence of sanitary facilities in houses appeared as critical parameters to target in order to reduce the risk of contamination of the water resource and ensure its preservation based on these factors we created a risk map for contamination types that should help in identifying areas where groundwater resource may present an environmental and then health issue for people besides this study shows that the combination of hydrochemical geomorphological and socio environmental characterizations of these urban systems featuring very contrasted situations between neighborhoods is a relevant tool to propose further groundwater management strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater contamination socio environment risks salinization southern metropoles 1 introduction due to global population growth projection of 9 7 billion people in 2050 global demand for water food energy and industrial processes is raising and a shift towards a more water dependent economy is occurring especially in coastal areas where population pressure is rapidly increasing michael et al 2017 compared to the year 2000 the population living in low elevation coastal zone lecz 638 million inhabitants should increase by 58 71 until 2050 and exceed one billion in all shared socioeconomic pathways ssp which are used for climate impact assessment merkens et al 2016 such trends are identified for instance in most tropical regions world bank 2021 resulting in significant urban growth occurring in the littoral coastal plains of major basins foster et al 2020 lu et al 2018 this implies major environmental challenges in mitigating the profound changes occurring over local water cycles but also impacts socio environmental conditions of resources users which in turn may impact their perception of natural resources and their strategies to access water e g re 2015 the metropolis of recife located in an estuarine plain in ne brazil constitutes a hot spot of such environmental hydroclimate water quality demographic and social challenges petelet giraud et al 2018 this area clearly illustrates the water crises that are faced in metropoles of the southern hemisphere over the past decades and which are becoming increasingly relevant worldwide e g michael et al 2017 jasechko et al 2020 from a sociological point of view and as in many southern metropoles the city can be considered as a mosaic of neighborhoods contrasted by their levels of socio environmental integration socio environmental evaluation combines physical and human geographical assessments and allows documenting and formalizing these contrasts throughout a range of indexes e g index of human development reflecting income access to public services such as the disposal of wastewater education levels exposure to environmental risks cavalcanti et al 2008 prefeitura recife 2012 the main area of the metropolis covers a complex fluvial system composed of 5 rivers and 66 canals in the lowlands of the estuary is found a mangrove being a zone of reproduction of innumerable species and promoting water purification and flood mitigations nowadays these surface waters and the mangrove suffer from chronic pollution and constant embankment due to the urban growth towards the flooded zones from a hydrogeological point of view the city is located over a multilayer aquifer system shallow aquifers are separated by an impermeable but discontinuous aquitard which leads to the fact that the deep and strategic aquifers are now being also impacted from a qualitative and quantitative points of view cary et al 2015 bertrand et al 2016 origins of water quality alterations associated processes and contaminants fate have been already identified over the area cary et al 2015 bertrand et al 2016 chatton et al 2016 bertrand et al 2017 petelet giraud et al 2018 and are related mainly to urban contamination through waste waters and salinization related to seawater and brackish water although their occurrences are now reasonably understood inferring their spatial extent remains challenging to provide a useful and affordable decision tool for managers helping the identification of distributed areas featuring contamination risks or conversely presenting interests for groundwater resource sustainable exploitation these decision tools may be addressed through various strategies at local scale e g through cost benefits or multicriteria analyses see e g onwubuya et al 2009 and references therein but using such approaches at larger scale relevant for metropoles still needs development hepburn et al 2019 such decision tool operating at larger scale is required for an effective planning policy and decision making and for the sustainable management of the resources this should be comprehended as a help among others for decision makers to adopt strategies for mitigating anthropogenic impacts this may also allow understanding the impacts of decision making determining the best land use patterns and socio environmental policies and informing people about the risk of groundwater contamination in the most simple way possible foster et al 2013 in this perspective a range of aquifer vulnerability methods have been developed since the 1980 s machiwal et al 2018 in complex hydrosystems the gis based multi criteria decision analysis methods e g drastic god are among the most used as they permit to define vulnerability index even in poorly documented e g large hydrosystems areas by using simple parameters in a contrasting manner physically based methods require a much more detailed knowledge of the groundwater and contaminant transfer processes e g modflow hydrus1 2 3d these approaches provide adaptable and fine scaled evaluation of specific vulnerability and may support local decision making regarding a specific contamination but might be limited in matching the field scale observations see the review of konikow 2011 at the interface between these two model families statistical approaches offer affordable strategies where land uses hydrogeological and groundwater quality patterns are reasonably constrained a variety of statistical techniques ranging from the simplest linear regression to multifaceted artificial intelligence techniques have been utilized to determine groundwater vulnerability to climate and land use pressures e g mair and el kadi 2013 bertrand et al 2021 shiri et al 2021 considering uncertainties associated with the qualitative overlay index methods that are based on strong but not always verified hypotheses combining geospatial and soft computing tools and techniques appears to be a promising perspective consistently machiwal et al 2018 stated that hybrid approaches in conjunction with artificial intelligence and other emerging techniques constitute a propitious way to overcome the limitations of existing methods furthermore integrating socioeconomic conditions as potential factors to develop improved i e adaptive robust and resilient policies and management strategies for the effective protection and sustainable utilization of groundwater resources is highly demanded e g re et al 2017 especially for integrated urban water management iuwm jensen and khalis 2020 in this context this study aims at understanding how socio environmental conditions and water resource quality relationship is interwoven this is a challenge in the sustainable management of resources of southern coastal metropoles and implies an ecosystemic vision of water uses by considering resources as an integral part of people habitat the specific objectives were therefore i to evaluate the range of possible contamination impacts over the local water resources ii to assess which socio environmental and physiographic drivers are preferentially associated to each contamination impact type iii to delineate an upscaled contamination risk mapping integrating hydrochemical and physiographic socio environmental data that could constitute a tool to plan further management strategies in this perspective the strategy was to make the socio environmental conditions potential explanatory variables for the contamination nature to this end this study implements the following strategies 1 evaluating the potential contamination of the resource by using a geochemical proxy in this purpose conservative tracers were used to finely identify the origin of water quality alteration the use of the bromine and chloride typology was selected since it permits to identify more efficiently saline end member water types than other pairs of solutes sánchez martos et al 2002 panno et al 2006 in addition the cl br ratio is dependent on the types of saline waters sea waters brines more or less developed deep saline waters and can also be used to distinguish natural and anthropogenic causes of salinization e g vengosh and pankratov 1998 the use of this indicator is consistent as it is not impacted by processes affecting reactive tracers e g nitrate ammonium sulfate or cations which were respectively proven to be affected by microbial reactions and cation exchanges cary et al 2015 bertrand et al 2016 over the area other more conservative tracers such as water and boron isotopic signatures may efficiently trace possible contaminations cary et al 2015 however these approaches require expensive facilities and expert technical survey that could limit the extent of their applications hence in order to apply an easy to use and economically interesting tool relevant in a range of similar contexts in southern countries and that may supply the machine learning algorithm with a required significant number of samples the cl br typology appeared to be the most suitable in this context 2 combining this typology with the socio environmental condition variability in the metropolis these data were acquired from the public services in charge of demographic studies ibge municipality and synthetized by cavalcanti et al 2008 the analysis of the relationships between environmental status of groundwater and the socio environmental parameters will be then performed throughout a partitioning algorithm leading to a decision tree building 3 implementing this typology via a geographical information system gis to address the spatial variability of the risk for groundwater quality alteration this should allow visualizing areas of anthropogenic pressures or in contrast of good quality and helping decision making for groundwater use and protection strategies the proposed methodology aims at being usable in and transferable to other metropolis to provide a simple and affordable tool helping groundwater management planning in such complex geological and sociological systems 2 context of the study 2 1 hydrological and hydrogeological contexts the recife sedimentary aquifer system fig 1 is located in the pernambuco state in brazil 8 04 03 s 34 55 00 w zmean 5 m a s l the climate is humid tropical with a mean annual precipitation of 2263 mm for the 1981 2010 period inmet 2018 falling mainly during the rainy period between may and august annual variations however can be high with a total rainfall height varying by a factor of as much as 2 or 3 at the end of the 90 s and during the 2010 s that constitute the focus period of this study drought has strongly impacted water access and uses petelet giraud et al 2018 the groundwater system consists in a multi layered aquifer complex and is set within the pernambuco and paraíba tectonic basins these latter are separated by the regional transverse structure of the pernambuco lineament fig 1 the deepest aquifers are the cabo and beberibe systems of cretaceous age reaching a maximum depth of 250 m below the city they are overlain by tertiary and quaternary sediments forming the superficial aquifers boa viagem and barreiras details on the geological and environmental settings may be found in cary et al 2015 the regional hydrogeological pattern consists in flow paths following the general hydrographic gradient from the western part of the area to the coastline on the east cary et al 2015 chatton et al 2016 fig 2 the recharge of the shallowest groundwater systems mainly occurs both downward from the surface and upward from hydraulic connection with the regional substratum deep aquifers are mainly fed from the recharge over the regional substratum that then may provide water to the sedimentary terrains throughout upward seepages these deepest circulations were dated from the early to the late holocene and therefore present a very slow turnover sensitive to exploitation chatton et al 2016 bertrand et al 2017 petelet giraud et al 2018 downward hydraulic connections occur between the shallow and deepest systems next to the seashore due to intensive exploitation pumping in the deepest aquifer layer chatton et al 2016 cary et al 2015 fig 1 potentially favoring contamination of the deepest and strategic resources 2 2 socio environmental context recife population was 1 625 583 inhabitants in 2016 according to the most recent evaluations ibge 2017 the population has been continuously increasing for one century and roughly multiplied by 3 since 1950 as stated by petelet giraud et al 2018 recife and its metropolitan area illustrates the problems of coastal metropolises in emerging countries combining urban sprawl unequal strategic urban planning favoring the private companies water supply sanitation deficiencies and partly lacking regulatory constraints from a social point of view brazil has undergone massive changes over the past decades with a significant decrease of poverty growth of the middle class and reduction in inequalities that nevertheless remain very high ipea 2013 however despite these trends urban growth combined with social inequity produces adverse effects on health pontual et al 2006 cavalcanti et al 2008 as conflict between social dynamics public policies and environmental preservation is a major problem of the great brazilian cities young 2013 cary and giglio 2018 the new population has two main origins either they come from the arid countryside after excessive droughts or from other cities near the littoral looking for jobs in the economic capital mello 2008 likewise in other latin american countries without access to the formal market of the urban property low income population occupies areas of environmental preservation as fens and river sides the first consequence is health risk due to the weakness of the habitations against floods and the exposition to illnesses due to non sustainable sanitary conditions the second consequence is the conflict between the individual right to occupy these spaces and the collective interest for preservation and protection of this environment until the mid 2000 s the poorest population installed their habitation in palafitas i e wooden houses on stilt next to the last areas vacant near the city center where this population can find work usually corresponding to the river borders since then a great part of these palafitas were destroyed and people were relocated in social habitations conjuntos habitacionais that occupy some specific neighborhoods although some river borders are still occupied nowadays mahmood 2017 at the end of the 2010 s the brazilian institute of geography and statistics instituto brasileiro de geografia e estatística ibge estimated that 88 of households were connected to the public water supply network however in many cases this was not distributed on a daily basis on the other hand only 30 were connected to the sewage network moreover only 20 of this volume was treated and the remaining volumes were discharged into rivers and canals without any treatment petelet giraud et al 2018 therefore the population mainly perceives surface waters as an open air sewer that stinks and causes illnesses facing this situation various strategies to access water for domestic purposes were developed cary et al 2018 rain harvesting and storage at home is a very frequent way to secure water access for few days mid and high income population may also jointly buy water from private distribution companies delivered by bicycle or trucks especially for drinking purpose the most frequent water access alternative is the private well legal or not that allows continuously accessing groundwater of variable quality and therefore not necessarily suitable for drinking purposes cary et al 2018 depending on its drilling depth and location petelet giraud et al 2018 this strategy deeply affected water levels throughout the city especially along with the littoral where recent high income neighborhoods developed e g boa viagem see coelho et al 2018 in parallel river bank filtration and direct injection in aquifer are currently evaluated but still remain strategies implemented at a very local scale coelho et al 2018 bertrand et al 2021 at the neighborhood scale the variable importance of these strategies strongly depends on the so called socio environmental inclusion exclusion such as evaluated by cavalcanti et al 2008 that described recife as a mosaic of socio environmental contrasts expressed through a socio environmental inclusion exclusion index for the 94 neighborhoods of recife fig 2 this approach is based on a range of economic e g income mean income per inhabitants educational e g school level analphabetism rate familiar e g number of children population density and habitability indicators e g percentage of connection to the potable water and wastewater network supplementary material table s1 from this evaluation it appeared that neighborhoods should not be seen only as administrative perimeters but as well as extremely heterogeneous territories more or less connected to city networks it is worth noting the extreme proximity 2 km of contrasted situations between included and excluded areas a range of socio environmental parameters revealed to be relevant for the present study as discussed in the following are summarized in the fig 3 it appears for instance that the rates of connection to the wastewater network of public waste collection and population density highly change 70 100 and from 0 to 60 to 240 300 inha km 2 respectively according to the neighborhoods highlighting the great differences in the daily life conditions characterizing numerous southern cities 3 material and methods the tasks organization was set as follows 1 compilation of the spatial database by combining socio environmental geological geographical and physico chemical data of wells i e cl br ratio and cl concentration supplementary material table s1 from the latter we evaluated the contamination typology of groundwater 2 definition of the best decision tree explaining groundwater contamination type from a training set of wells 80 of the dataset on the basis of node details and on the matrix error obtained from wells not used for the training 3 implementation of the generated rules over the recife area in a gis to propose a map of groundwater contamination vulnerability 3 1 database building two sampling campaigns for the characterization of 47 groundwater and 3 surface waters took place in september 2012 end of the wet period and march 2013 end of the dry period measurements of the physical and chemical parameters temperature electric conductivity ec ph eh and dissolved oxygen were performed on the field the groundwater samples were filtered at 0 45 μm for major minor and trace elements ca na k mg sr nh4 b so4 no3 br cl analyses and acidified for cationic analyses to ph 2 with ultrapure hno3 analyses of major and trace elements were carried out by icp aes and icp ms ultima 2 model jobin yvon for cations and by ion chromatography model dx120 dionex for anions in the university of são paolo and french geological service brgm laboratories respectively the accuracy of both techniques was in the range of 5 10 depending upon the concentration alkalinity was determined by hcl titration in laboratory all the ionic balances were checked and were below a 5 limit cary et al 2015 indicating that chemical analyses can be considered for further interpretations in this study the cl br and cl data will be discussed in detail detailed evaluation of spatio temporal variability of other groundwater geochemical data are available in cary et al 2015 bertrand et al 2016 and chatton et al 2016 the entire socio environmental data provided by the recife city hall cavalcanti et al 2008 has been compiled supplementary material table s1 we added the geological layer tapped by the sampling wells and integrated these data in a gis quantum gis this allowed visualizing correspondence between well location and its neighborhood physico chemical and socio environmental data were then concatenated in a unique table supplementary material table s2 combining these data implies that they are representative of a same period according to chatton et al 2016 both superficial and deep aquifers present traces of anthropogenic gasses cfc s sf6 consistent with impacts related to land uses and living conditions over the recent decades similarly modern impacts over superficial and deep groundwater resources in multi layered systems were observed under greatly urbanized areas for instance by qian et al 2020 in yinchuan china these authors showed that as it may be expected in recife from groundwater age evaluations by chatton et al 2016 water quality degradation remains slow over several decades up to centuries where high pre existing storage of good quality water exists 3 2 decision tree building decision tree is a hierarchical model composed of decision rules that recursively splits independent variables into homogeneous zones quinlan 1986 it was used in this study as it does not require statistical assumptions it can handle data represented on different measurement scales and is computationally fast williams 2009 this approach has proven to be effective in studies dealing with groundwater resource potential and contaminations e g jeihouni et al 2020 lee and lee 2015 the decision tree combines the features in a hierarchical fashion such that the most important feature is located at the root of the tree quinlan 1986 williams 2009 each node in the tree refers to one of the features and each leaf is assigned to a contamination type based on the cl br ratio and cl representing the most frequent class value additionally the leaf holds a probability vector indicating the probability of the feature contamination type in this work decision trees were built using the r software r development core team 2005 via the package rpart therneau and atkinson 1997 implemented in the rattle graphical user interface williams 2009 various sets of decision trees were tested and this study will discuss the most robust tree considering the number of documented wells 47 decision tree building was performed using 80 of the data for calibration and 20 of the data for validation the most adapted decision tree was selected on the basis of the matrix error constructed from the validation process to build a tree maximizing the number of rules required to understand environmental impacts over the water resource the complexity parameter cp and the minbucket minimum number of individuals per node parameters were used to control the size of the decision tree and to select the optimal tree size if the cost of adding another variable to the decision tree from the current node is above the value of cp then tree building does not continue setting up cp 0 and minbucket to 1 allows therefore a very detailed decision tree to be built consistently with the relative training and testing sample sizes then the overall error of the model has been evaluated performing the model over the test sample 20 of the database and reported in an error or confusion matrix 3 3 implementation of decision tree rules in a gis the most robust decision tree has been used to identify a set of conditions features that can be related to one type of contamination once those conditions were known they were affected to virtual wells throughout the city in order to create a map of risk on qgis the conditions were affected using conditional approach by following each node to the final leave corresponding to a type of impact doing so allowed spatializing the contamination types over the city and then discuss the main predictors corresponding to the successive nodes in the decision tree 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatio temporal variability of cl br a range of pressures over the superficial and strategic resources cl br ratio is dependent on the origin of saline waters edmunds 1996 stober 1999 and can be also used thanks to specific signatures found in sewages to distinguish anthropogenic e g waste water impacts over water resources e g flury and papritz 1993 andreasen and fleck 1997 vengosh and pankratov 1998 as an example alcalá and custodio 2008 distinguished in spain and portugal groundwaters affected by waste waters or leaching waste through molar cl br ratios that increased up to 1500 similarly mcarthur et al 2012 evaluated that septic tank outflows with values molar cl br reaching 5000 in parallel most of the authors define seawater end member with a cl br of 650 while cl is of 19 000 mg l pristine waters including precipitations and non disturbed freshwaters usually feature values varying from 400 to 650 due to sea spray signature but limited cl vengosh and pankratov 1998 alcalá and custodio 2008 in order to evaluate the relevance of this approach a comparison between cl br evaluation and boron isotope data reported in cary et al 2015 methods has been performed for the september 2012 campaign during which the both types of tracers were evaluated fig s1 in supplementary material this comparison highlights that cl br ratio is less sensitive to adsorption desorption processes that affect boron quantity and isotopic signatures vázquez suñé et al 2010 especially for high salinities but that in turn cl br when used to identify waste water impacts may be partly overwhelmed by seawater influence this latter may increase especially near the estuary during wet period paiva et al 2017 this justifies as indicated in the following why we focused on the dry period to more clearly evaluate the occurrence of waste water impacts comparison of cl br systematics with environmental species related to anthropogenic impacts such as no3 nh4 is poorly adapted as the aquifers were revealed to be bio geochemically reactive bertrand et al 2016 making these elements non conservative this makes the proposed approach as an adapted strategy for tropical coastal areas featuring both saline intrusions coupled with ionic exchanges and microbiological activities controlling a range of redox reactions modifying sewage signatures plotting cl and cl br for wet september 2012 and dry march 2013 periods fig 4 highlights a great spatio temporal variability the waste water endmember signature used to delineate the mixing line with pristine waters has been defined from the surface water sampled downstream the beberibe river that is recognized to be strongly impacted by wastes cary et al 2015 bertrand et al 2016 waters sampled following the wet period september 2012 show two general trends matching either with wastewater impact or in accordance with pristine conditions potentially under moderately salinized influence anthropogenic influences are more detectable during the dry period march 2013 with a greater number of wells potentially impacted by wastewaters or by seawater this seasonal difference could be attributed to wetter conditions in september favoring a general dilution of anthropogenic impacts in addition wetter conditions usually limit rationing and favor the use of the domestic network therefore attenuating the use of pumping wells furthermore wetter conditions favor some of the alternative water access strategies e g rain harvesting cary et al 2018 the impact of wetter conditions over urban areas has been evaluated in various studies to point out their positive or adverse effects over groundwater quality for instance peixoto 2020 suggested that wetter conditions over the city of fortaleza ne brazil are associated with greater mean contaminant concentrations e g nitrate nevertheless the dry period featured greater nitrate concentrations in a more punctual perspective suggesting a wider impact of domestic effluents consistently paiva et al 2017 by jointly monitoring precipitation rate groundwater level and electrical conductivity identified such a dilution effect during wet period in the recife aquifers including in deeper boreholes screened between 133 and 170 m deep this is in agreement with the findings of lasagna et al 2013 which stated that dilution has been found to play an important role in determining the degree of contamination in the case of nonsorbing solutes as it is the case for halides or nitrate accordingly the evaluation for the dry period march 2013 allows visualizing a greater degree of anthropogenic impacts most of the groundwaters are distributed along a mixing line between pristine aquifer and seawater signatures fig 4 the application of binary mixing models shows that the mixing rate for sea water is always less than 10 cl max 2000 mg l for the waters sampled throughout this campaign the seawater influence affects mainly groundwaters from cabo and beberibe aquifers but with a moderate amplitude as stated by cary et al 2015 this moderate impact has to be analyzed with care as the accessible wells are by definition not yet salinized the most salinized wells are most of the time sealed by owners to avoid any further pumping concurrently the sewage influence becomes the most important impact and affects all the aquifers the deep cabo and beberibe groundwaters that are under waste water influence remain usually in the first part of the mixing line suggesting that an anthropogenic impact may occur as well but that it remains usually moderate consistently with the findings of chatton et al 2016 as it will be detailed in the following the low cl br ratios for some deep groundwaters such as beb 51 59 60 cl br 113 132 152 respectively appear contradictory at a first sight with the boron typology discussed in cary et al 2015 these waters presented high δ11b 63 68 consistent with a possible influence of paleobrines brines can result from the dissolution of evaporites usually harboring a high cl br also it can be produced from the remaining solution resulting from partial evaporation of seawater which can present low cl br apparent enrichment in br might be explained in terms of dilution of evaporated seawater by relatively low salinity seawater or meteoric water because br is preferentially partitioned into the fluid phase mccaffrey et al 1987 therefore evaporation and further dilution by freshwaters are two processes that may occur in the estuary and mangrove area of recife consistently the high δ11b signatures reported by cary et al 2015 argue for brines resulting from evaporation of seawater which were then trapped in sediments rather than water dissolving evaporites therefore locally a seawater influence can be observed in areas distant from the seafront and is expected to be representative of transgressive marine processes e g paleomangroves that act locally as a salinization sources in the beberibe aquifer cary et al 2015 chatton et al 2016 it is important to take into consideration that within such a complex system several mixings may occur between the identified 3 end members pristine hydrogeological media waste waters salinized water more or less evaporated and diluted or from water dissolving evaporites or trapped in paleoenvironments therefore the impact of the septic influence may be partially overwhelmed by the impact of more salinized waters related to the estuary as previously suggested by the boron and strontium typologies discussed in cary et al 2015 or bertrand et al 2016 4 2 delineation of socio environmental conditions favoring impacts over groundwater quality based on the classification proposed in the fig 4 and from the socio environmental database provided by cavalcanti et al 2008 implemented in a gis a range of decision trees were built and tested for the dry period march 2013 the overall error for the selected tree was 13 4 as reported in the confusion matrix table 1 the lower identification was identified for the pristine waters error 40 in contrast wastewater impact and seawater impact were properly identified error 0 the correspondence analysis map fig 5 allows visualizing the match between the 3 predicted and observed features pristine seawater waste water impacts this suggests that the decision tree algorithm although presenting some weaknesses to target pristine like waters might be a relevant tool to identify occurrence and main types of dominant contaminations waste water and seawater this suggests that little changes in diluted waters mainly pristine may impact the general quality that can contrast from the pristine signature although being only slightly modified fig 6 details the main factors nodes required to better classify wells and to identify these contamination types and occurrences it appeared that the minimum distance from the sea front the rate of presence household sanitary facility the population density the minimal distance from surface water are implied in the delineation of the 3 groups of environmental status of groundwater leaf nodes it is worth noting that neither the lithology nor the groundwater depth related to screened depth were among the most relevant factors explaining the environmental impact variability this highlights the great role of environmental processes that overwhelm the possible hydraulic contrasts between aquifers as stated by previous studies cary et al 2015 chatton et al 2016 bertrand et al 2016 paiva et al 2017 hydraulic connections exist between deep and superficial aquifers more specifically cary et al 2015 highlighted that an upward leakage from the deeper aquifers occurs in the most inland areas whereas downward fluxes likely predominate in littoral zones such partial mixing between superficial and deep groundwaters could partially hide the expected protecting effect of depth over environmental consistently chatton et al 2016 found traces of modern anthropogenic gasses cfc s and sf6 in deep groundwater that were dated from 8000 to 20 000 years b p similarly impacts from superficial pollutions to deep confined and strategic groundwater resources has been lately identified in dense urban areas in china han et al 2016 or india lapworth et al 2018 revealing a broad environmental challenge for great cities worldwide 4 3 implementation of the socio environmental typology and mapping of risk over the metropolis the paths and nodes provided by the decision tree fig 6 were implemented using the built database from the combination of data provided by the city hall and the geological and geographical data over the metropolis this allowed proposing a map of socio environmental impacts fig 7 over the groundwater resource representative of what occurs during dry periods considering that it corresponds to the most threatening conditions fig 4 delineating contamination type does not directly permit the water quality itself to be evaluated but is rather a tool for visualizing contamination risks therefore in a long term and integrated management perspective such a visualization is more relevant when the risks are higher as it highlights contamination impacts that should be mitigated in priority over the long term applying this method it appears that contamination risks for groundwater may be summarized as follows pristine conditions are mainly found in the inland western part of the metropolis in areas distant from seafront corresponding to neighborhoods with high waste collection percentage low population density e g pau ferro neighborhood bq pop density 2 inhab km2 and 93 of households with waste collection and located upstream the surface water channels fig 3 such a trend related to population density is consistent with effects observed through statistical analysis at continental e g ouedraogo et al 2020 and at city scales in japan e g babiker et al 2007 or in india das et al 2013 nevertheless a narrow fringe of good environmental status should also occur near the sea front where well and population densities are the greatest this narrow area may be interpreted as a consequence of greater contamination risks over the zone that influence high income population strategies for accessing freshwater resources once previous wells are contaminated or salinized and then definitively sealed cary et al 2018 petelet giraud et al 2018 in this zone the socio environmental integration is among the highest cavalcanti et al 2008 favoring the development of technically developed groundwater withdraw strategies despite an overall groundwater quality degradation observed there since decades this area is characterized by great socio environmental integration with a waste collection percentage of 90 100 and a waste water network connection ranging from 80 to 100 fig 3 nevertheless despite this integration a great density of wells whose a great part is set to supply water for condominiums well density of 140 190 km2 exerts a pressure over the resource coelho et al 2018 this might also partly explain why the validation test for the decision tree was the weakest for pristine like waters table 1 wastewater impacts are dominant in various areas of the metropole and represent the main qualitative alterations on the groundwater resource at first the western and northern neighborhoods seem to feature conditions promoting such an impact these zones harbor low to moderate population density 0 60 inhab km2 but also a weak proportion of households connected to sewage network 0 20 especially in ar guabiraba and at ibura neighborhoods located on the north and on the south of the city center this agrees with other studies in southern densely populated metropolises such as reported by kooy et al 2018 in jakarta which stated that the degree of contamination of water varies according to the depth of wells households can afford to dig and the distance from their own and their neighbors septic tanks in parallel wastewater impacts are also inferred near the seashore distance from seafront 4460 m fig 6 and where population density tends to increase this area closer to the littoral features the combination of greater anthropogenic pressure risks with a denser network of surface channels that are known to be purveyors of contamination bertrand et al 2016 cary et al 2015 petelet giraud et al 2018 in addition the downstream location of this area may promote the accumulation of the anthropogenic impacts occurring upstream in the watershed various studies targeted the combined effect of dense sewage network leakage and the impact of storm waters that contribute to a great recharge proportion in urbanized areas mainly occurring through uncovered or featuring fissured covering infiltration points reached by cumulated run off vázquez suñé et al 2010 schirmer et al 2013 olds et al 2018 seawater influence appears to be distributed over two main zones the first area is rather distant to the sea front and is found near the madalena neighborhood bg over the beberibe aquifer as stated previously cary et al 2015 this impact is likely related to oceanic transgression that was favored along the pernambuco fault delineating a lowland zone throughout which the capibabribe river and estuary extended considering the various marine transgression and regression phases that have affected the whole recife s plain the deep salty groundwater most probably originates from the intrusion events cary et al 2015 stated this could have occurred during the pleistocene 123 000 years bp and through infiltration from the palaeomangroves covering the lower part of the area considering the groundwater ages of 4000 years b p in this zone chatton et al 2016 such salinization process could be also consistent with holocene transgression impacting low elevated areas along with the pernambuco fault this geogenic impact appears to be detectable when well density remains moderate figs 3 and 6 and this probably limits infiltration of superficial water impacted by sewages where sewage impact is more important this phenomenon may overwhelmthis geogenic influence secondly the southern recife seafront is subject to seawater influence as it was already mentioned by coelho et al 2018 among others this area features a great groundwater drawdown due to the important population density usually with moderate to high incomes these conditions favor the use of deep wells equipped with powerful pumps these resulted in a significant drawdown up to 70 m between 2000 and 2010 s as mentioned previously this non sustainable and most of the time illegal groundwater use has environmental and behavioral consequences from an environmental point of view this promotes direct seawater intrusion along the coastline a phenomenon that increased due to greater groundwater uses during the 2000 s and the 2010 s repeated droughts facing these quality issues users choose two kinds of strategies for direct domestic water access some people and condominiums invested in private desalinization facilities a range of studies revealed that such a strategy could locally as these facility are usually implemented in private condominium favor the interface between seawater and freshwater to drop e g jorreto et al 2009 stein et al 2020 and therefore favor a local freshening by attracting upstream freshwater nevertheless due to the wastewater impact featuring the superficial water in this area this strategy could increase quality issues for upstream groundwater after surface water infiltrations the second way consists in stopping the pumping and drill a new well as it is commonly observed in recife although the local legislation limits this strategy petelet giraud et al 2018 conversely to desalinization this favors better water quality access over the short term consistently with the contamination risk map but in turn should amplify the seawater intrusion over the long term 5 conclusion and management perspectives the strategy proposed in this paper aimed at providing a simple accurate and affordable way to assess the most typical risks of groundwater contamination occurring in southern coastal metropolises the proposed methodology should be understood as a generalizable screening tool to identify areas of interests for water management improvements foster et al 2013 jensen and khalis 2020 obviously the physiographical conditions are important but likely not sufficient to explain impacts on groundwater resources and the socio environmental inclusion exclusion evaluations were necessary this highlights the need for tight cooperation between human and environmental sciences to address anthropogenic impacts over urban water resource and further ways to manage them the application of this method for recife ne brazil permitted to discuss the structural features that underlie groundwater quality issues and led to somehow unexpected results in particular the distinction of shallow and deep groundwater was not required in the decision algorithm to delineate contamination types it is likely that the hydraulic connections between shallow threatened and deep strategic aquifers cary et al 2015 chatton et al 2016 avoided with the available dataset their distinction from a socio environmental point of view this highlights the increasing need for an iuwm plan over the area as current groundwater access strategies impact natural hydraulic separations as it is concurrently observed in other urban centers located over deep confined groundwater systems han et al 2016 lapworth et al 2018 on this basis combining the reality of highly contrasted socio environmental territories within the urban mosaic with water resource quality indicators appears to be a way to efficiently adapt iuwm in such a highly urbanized and coastal context this could in particular help the implementation of small scale distributed systems accounting for both social and environmental contrasts and emergencies constituting an intermediate way between purely centralized and highly defective and individual insecure and environmentally impacting strategies the choice of these systems ranging between managed aquifer recharge facilities small scale waste water treatment plants and gray water recycling are dependent on local hydrogeological and socio environmental contexts and require flexibility flexible approaches are now widely used in cities to timely adjust prevention from natural hazards e g gersonius et al 2013 city of melbourne 2016 in a context of climate changes impacts e g floods our work demonstrates that spatial flexibility would be an asset in socio environmental mosaics such as recife to manage local water resource required for the population s daily life in order to promote a proper implementation of such systems the combination of spatio temporal assessment of contamination risks such as proposed in this paper and its link with people socio environmental conditions and resource perceptions should be conjointly undertaken in particular water resource perceptions remain a challenging issue due to the high insecurity of other daily life aspects job income security cary et al 2018 and a more spatially detailed water quality indicator assessment should be encouraged declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest declared acknowledgements this communication was possible

16387,due to global warming and local anthropogenic pressures sustainable groundwater resource exploitation in coastal cities is increasingly threatened for example the fifth largest brazilian city recife is considered as a representative hot spot for these issues and illustrates the great challenges facing many urban areas in the southern hemisphere there recharge as well as surface water and groundwater quality are altered by frequent droughts and poorly planned environmental management since decades to maintain access to water thousands of private wells were dug in order to pump water from the multi layered aquifer system found under the city this massive exploitation is causing a chronic lowering of the water levels as well as seawater intrusion and contaminations by wastewater or polluted surface waters through hydrochemical characterization mainly cl br ratio and cl concentrations of wells sampled throughout the metropole this study first characterizes the main environmental impacts on the resource i e waste waters and seawater combining this evaluation with lithological land use and socio environmental data it was then possible to build decision trees identifying combinations of multiple factors possibly having an impact on contamination types the well and population densities the waste and sewage management as well as the absence of sanitary facilities in houses appeared as critical parameters to target in order to reduce the risk of contamination of the water resource and ensure its preservation based on these factors we created a risk map for contamination types that should help in identifying areas where groundwater resource may present an environmental and then health issue for people besides this study shows that the combination of hydrochemical geomorphological and socio environmental characterizations of these urban systems featuring very contrasted situations between neighborhoods is a relevant tool to propose further groundwater management strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater contamination socio environment risks salinization southern metropoles 1 introduction due to global population growth projection of 9 7 billion people in 2050 global demand for water food energy and industrial processes is raising and a shift towards a more water dependent economy is occurring especially in coastal areas where population pressure is rapidly increasing michael et al 2017 compared to the year 2000 the population living in low elevation coastal zone lecz 638 million inhabitants should increase by 58 71 until 2050 and exceed one billion in all shared socioeconomic pathways ssp which are used for climate impact assessment merkens et al 2016 such trends are identified for instance in most tropical regions world bank 2021 resulting in significant urban growth occurring in the littoral coastal plains of major basins foster et al 2020 lu et al 2018 this implies major environmental challenges in mitigating the profound changes occurring over local water cycles but also impacts socio environmental conditions of resources users which in turn may impact their perception of natural resources and their strategies to access water e g re 2015 the metropolis of recife located in an estuarine plain in ne brazil constitutes a hot spot of such environmental hydroclimate water quality demographic and social challenges petelet giraud et al 2018 this area clearly illustrates the water crises that are faced in metropoles of the southern hemisphere over the past decades and which are becoming increasingly relevant worldwide e g michael et al 2017 jasechko et al 2020 from a sociological point of view and as in many southern metropoles the city can be considered as a mosaic of neighborhoods contrasted by their levels of socio environmental integration socio environmental evaluation combines physical and human geographical assessments and allows documenting and formalizing these contrasts throughout a range of indexes e g index of human development reflecting income access to public services such as the disposal of wastewater education levels exposure to environmental risks cavalcanti et al 2008 prefeitura recife 2012 the main area of the metropolis covers a complex fluvial system composed of 5 rivers and 66 canals in the lowlands of the estuary is found a mangrove being a zone of reproduction of innumerable species and promoting water purification and flood mitigations nowadays these surface waters and the mangrove suffer from chronic pollution and constant embankment due to the urban growth towards the flooded zones from a hydrogeological point of view the city is located over a multilayer aquifer system shallow aquifers are separated by an impermeable but discontinuous aquitard which leads to the fact that the deep and strategic aquifers are now being also impacted from a qualitative and quantitative points of view cary et al 2015 bertrand et al 2016 origins of water quality alterations associated processes and contaminants fate have been already identified over the area cary et al 2015 bertrand et al 2016 chatton et al 2016 bertrand et al 2017 petelet giraud et al 2018 and are related mainly to urban contamination through waste waters and salinization related to seawater and brackish water although their occurrences are now reasonably understood inferring their spatial extent remains challenging to provide a useful and affordable decision tool for managers helping the identification of distributed areas featuring contamination risks or conversely presenting interests for groundwater resource sustainable exploitation these decision tools may be addressed through various strategies at local scale e g through cost benefits or multicriteria analyses see e g onwubuya et al 2009 and references therein but using such approaches at larger scale relevant for metropoles still needs development hepburn et al 2019 such decision tool operating at larger scale is required for an effective planning policy and decision making and for the sustainable management of the resources this should be comprehended as a help among others for decision makers to adopt strategies for mitigating anthropogenic impacts this may also allow understanding the impacts of decision making determining the best land use patterns and socio environmental policies and informing people about the risk of groundwater contamination in the most simple way possible foster et al 2013 in this perspective a range of aquifer vulnerability methods have been developed since the 1980 s machiwal et al 2018 in complex hydrosystems the gis based multi criteria decision analysis methods e g drastic god are among the most used as they permit to define vulnerability index even in poorly documented e g large hydrosystems areas by using simple parameters in a contrasting manner physically based methods require a much more detailed knowledge of the groundwater and contaminant transfer processes e g modflow hydrus1 2 3d these approaches provide adaptable and fine scaled evaluation of specific vulnerability and may support local decision making regarding a specific contamination but might be limited in matching the field scale observations see the review of konikow 2011 at the interface between these two model families statistical approaches offer affordable strategies where land uses hydrogeological and groundwater quality patterns are reasonably constrained a variety of statistical techniques ranging from the simplest linear regression to multifaceted artificial intelligence techniques have been utilized to determine groundwater vulnerability to climate and land use pressures e g mair and el kadi 2013 bertrand et al 2021 shiri et al 2021 considering uncertainties associated with the qualitative overlay index methods that are based on strong but not always verified hypotheses combining geospatial and soft computing tools and techniques appears to be a promising perspective consistently machiwal et al 2018 stated that hybrid approaches in conjunction with artificial intelligence and other emerging techniques constitute a propitious way to overcome the limitations of existing methods furthermore integrating socioeconomic conditions as potential factors to develop improved i e adaptive robust and resilient policies and management strategies for the effective protection and sustainable utilization of groundwater resources is highly demanded e g re et al 2017 especially for integrated urban water management iuwm jensen and khalis 2020 in this context this study aims at understanding how socio environmental conditions and water resource quality relationship is interwoven this is a challenge in the sustainable management of resources of southern coastal metropoles and implies an ecosystemic vision of water uses by considering resources as an integral part of people habitat the specific objectives were therefore i to evaluate the range of possible contamination impacts over the local water resources ii to assess which socio environmental and physiographic drivers are preferentially associated to each contamination impact type iii to delineate an upscaled contamination risk mapping integrating hydrochemical and physiographic socio environmental data that could constitute a tool to plan further management strategies in this perspective the strategy was to make the socio environmental conditions potential explanatory variables for the contamination nature to this end this study implements the following strategies 1 evaluating the potential contamination of the resource by using a geochemical proxy in this purpose conservative tracers were used to finely identify the origin of water quality alteration the use of the bromine and chloride typology was selected since it permits to identify more efficiently saline end member water types than other pairs of solutes sánchez martos et al 2002 panno et al 2006 in addition the cl br ratio is dependent on the types of saline waters sea waters brines more or less developed deep saline waters and can also be used to distinguish natural and anthropogenic causes of salinization e g vengosh and pankratov 1998 the use of this indicator is consistent as it is not impacted by processes affecting reactive tracers e g nitrate ammonium sulfate or cations which were respectively proven to be affected by microbial reactions and cation exchanges cary et al 2015 bertrand et al 2016 over the area other more conservative tracers such as water and boron isotopic signatures may efficiently trace possible contaminations cary et al 2015 however these approaches require expensive facilities and expert technical survey that could limit the extent of their applications hence in order to apply an easy to use and economically interesting tool relevant in a range of similar contexts in southern countries and that may supply the machine learning algorithm with a required significant number of samples the cl br typology appeared to be the most suitable in this context 2 combining this typology with the socio environmental condition variability in the metropolis these data were acquired from the public services in charge of demographic studies ibge municipality and synthetized by cavalcanti et al 2008 the analysis of the relationships between environmental status of groundwater and the socio environmental parameters will be then performed throughout a partitioning algorithm leading to a decision tree building 3 implementing this typology via a geographical information system gis to address the spatial variability of the risk for groundwater quality alteration this should allow visualizing areas of anthropogenic pressures or in contrast of good quality and helping decision making for groundwater use and protection strategies the proposed methodology aims at being usable in and transferable to other metropolis to provide a simple and affordable tool helping groundwater management planning in such complex geological and sociological systems 2 context of the study 2 1 hydrological and hydrogeological contexts the recife sedimentary aquifer system fig 1 is located in the pernambuco state in brazil 8 04 03 s 34 55 00 w zmean 5 m a s l the climate is humid tropical with a mean annual precipitation of 2263 mm for the 1981 2010 period inmet 2018 falling mainly during the rainy period between may and august annual variations however can be high with a total rainfall height varying by a factor of as much as 2 or 3 at the end of the 90 s and during the 2010 s that constitute the focus period of this study drought has strongly impacted water access and uses petelet giraud et al 2018 the groundwater system consists in a multi layered aquifer complex and is set within the pernambuco and paraíba tectonic basins these latter are separated by the regional transverse structure of the pernambuco lineament fig 1 the deepest aquifers are the cabo and beberibe systems of cretaceous age reaching a maximum depth of 250 m below the city they are overlain by tertiary and quaternary sediments forming the superficial aquifers boa viagem and barreiras details on the geological and environmental settings may be found in cary et al 2015 the regional hydrogeological pattern consists in flow paths following the general hydrographic gradient from the western part of the area to the coastline on the east cary et al 2015 chatton et al 2016 fig 2 the recharge of the shallowest groundwater systems mainly occurs both downward from the surface and upward from hydraulic connection with the regional substratum deep aquifers are mainly fed from the recharge over the regional substratum that then may provide water to the sedimentary terrains throughout upward seepages these deepest circulations were dated from the early to the late holocene and therefore present a very slow turnover sensitive to exploitation chatton et al 2016 bertrand et al 2017 petelet giraud et al 2018 downward hydraulic connections occur between the shallow and deepest systems next to the seashore due to intensive exploitation pumping in the deepest aquifer layer chatton et al 2016 cary et al 2015 fig 1 potentially favoring contamination of the deepest and strategic resources 2 2 socio environmental context recife population was 1 625 583 inhabitants in 2016 according to the most recent evaluations ibge 2017 the population has been continuously increasing for one century and roughly multiplied by 3 since 1950 as stated by petelet giraud et al 2018 recife and its metropolitan area illustrates the problems of coastal metropolises in emerging countries combining urban sprawl unequal strategic urban planning favoring the private companies water supply sanitation deficiencies and partly lacking regulatory constraints from a social point of view brazil has undergone massive changes over the past decades with a significant decrease of poverty growth of the middle class and reduction in inequalities that nevertheless remain very high ipea 2013 however despite these trends urban growth combined with social inequity produces adverse effects on health pontual et al 2006 cavalcanti et al 2008 as conflict between social dynamics public policies and environmental preservation is a major problem of the great brazilian cities young 2013 cary and giglio 2018 the new population has two main origins either they come from the arid countryside after excessive droughts or from other cities near the littoral looking for jobs in the economic capital mello 2008 likewise in other latin american countries without access to the formal market of the urban property low income population occupies areas of environmental preservation as fens and river sides the first consequence is health risk due to the weakness of the habitations against floods and the exposition to illnesses due to non sustainable sanitary conditions the second consequence is the conflict between the individual right to occupy these spaces and the collective interest for preservation and protection of this environment until the mid 2000 s the poorest population installed their habitation in palafitas i e wooden houses on stilt next to the last areas vacant near the city center where this population can find work usually corresponding to the river borders since then a great part of these palafitas were destroyed and people were relocated in social habitations conjuntos habitacionais that occupy some specific neighborhoods although some river borders are still occupied nowadays mahmood 2017 at the end of the 2010 s the brazilian institute of geography and statistics instituto brasileiro de geografia e estatística ibge estimated that 88 of households were connected to the public water supply network however in many cases this was not distributed on a daily basis on the other hand only 30 were connected to the sewage network moreover only 20 of this volume was treated and the remaining volumes were discharged into rivers and canals without any treatment petelet giraud et al 2018 therefore the population mainly perceives surface waters as an open air sewer that stinks and causes illnesses facing this situation various strategies to access water for domestic purposes were developed cary et al 2018 rain harvesting and storage at home is a very frequent way to secure water access for few days mid and high income population may also jointly buy water from private distribution companies delivered by bicycle or trucks especially for drinking purpose the most frequent water access alternative is the private well legal or not that allows continuously accessing groundwater of variable quality and therefore not necessarily suitable for drinking purposes cary et al 2018 depending on its drilling depth and location petelet giraud et al 2018 this strategy deeply affected water levels throughout the city especially along with the littoral where recent high income neighborhoods developed e g boa viagem see coelho et al 2018 in parallel river bank filtration and direct injection in aquifer are currently evaluated but still remain strategies implemented at a very local scale coelho et al 2018 bertrand et al 2021 at the neighborhood scale the variable importance of these strategies strongly depends on the so called socio environmental inclusion exclusion such as evaluated by cavalcanti et al 2008 that described recife as a mosaic of socio environmental contrasts expressed through a socio environmental inclusion exclusion index for the 94 neighborhoods of recife fig 2 this approach is based on a range of economic e g income mean income per inhabitants educational e g school level analphabetism rate familiar e g number of children population density and habitability indicators e g percentage of connection to the potable water and wastewater network supplementary material table s1 from this evaluation it appeared that neighborhoods should not be seen only as administrative perimeters but as well as extremely heterogeneous territories more or less connected to city networks it is worth noting the extreme proximity 2 km of contrasted situations between included and excluded areas a range of socio environmental parameters revealed to be relevant for the present study as discussed in the following are summarized in the fig 3 it appears for instance that the rates of connection to the wastewater network of public waste collection and population density highly change 70 100 and from 0 to 60 to 240 300 inha km 2 respectively according to the neighborhoods highlighting the great differences in the daily life conditions characterizing numerous southern cities 3 material and methods the tasks organization was set as follows 1 compilation of the spatial database by combining socio environmental geological geographical and physico chemical data of wells i e cl br ratio and cl concentration supplementary material table s1 from the latter we evaluated the contamination typology of groundwater 2 definition of the best decision tree explaining groundwater contamination type from a training set of wells 80 of the dataset on the basis of node details and on the matrix error obtained from wells not used for the training 3 implementation of the generated rules over the recife area in a gis to propose a map of groundwater contamination vulnerability 3 1 database building two sampling campaigns for the characterization of 47 groundwater and 3 surface waters took place in september 2012 end of the wet period and march 2013 end of the dry period measurements of the physical and chemical parameters temperature electric conductivity ec ph eh and dissolved oxygen were performed on the field the groundwater samples were filtered at 0 45 μm for major minor and trace elements ca na k mg sr nh4 b so4 no3 br cl analyses and acidified for cationic analyses to ph 2 with ultrapure hno3 analyses of major and trace elements were carried out by icp aes and icp ms ultima 2 model jobin yvon for cations and by ion chromatography model dx120 dionex for anions in the university of são paolo and french geological service brgm laboratories respectively the accuracy of both techniques was in the range of 5 10 depending upon the concentration alkalinity was determined by hcl titration in laboratory all the ionic balances were checked and were below a 5 limit cary et al 2015 indicating that chemical analyses can be considered for further interpretations in this study the cl br and cl data will be discussed in detail detailed evaluation of spatio temporal variability of other groundwater geochemical data are available in cary et al 2015 bertrand et al 2016 and chatton et al 2016 the entire socio environmental data provided by the recife city hall cavalcanti et al 2008 has been compiled supplementary material table s1 we added the geological layer tapped by the sampling wells and integrated these data in a gis quantum gis this allowed visualizing correspondence between well location and its neighborhood physico chemical and socio environmental data were then concatenated in a unique table supplementary material table s2 combining these data implies that they are representative of a same period according to chatton et al 2016 both superficial and deep aquifers present traces of anthropogenic gasses cfc s sf6 consistent with impacts related to land uses and living conditions over the recent decades similarly modern impacts over superficial and deep groundwater resources in multi layered systems were observed under greatly urbanized areas for instance by qian et al 2020 in yinchuan china these authors showed that as it may be expected in recife from groundwater age evaluations by chatton et al 2016 water quality degradation remains slow over several decades up to centuries where high pre existing storage of good quality water exists 3 2 decision tree building decision tree is a hierarchical model composed of decision rules that recursively splits independent variables into homogeneous zones quinlan 1986 it was used in this study as it does not require statistical assumptions it can handle data represented on different measurement scales and is computationally fast williams 2009 this approach has proven to be effective in studies dealing with groundwater resource potential and contaminations e g jeihouni et al 2020 lee and lee 2015 the decision tree combines the features in a hierarchical fashion such that the most important feature is located at the root of the tree quinlan 1986 williams 2009 each node in the tree refers to one of the features and each leaf is assigned to a contamination type based on the cl br ratio and cl representing the most frequent class value additionally the leaf holds a probability vector indicating the probability of the feature contamination type in this work decision trees were built using the r software r development core team 2005 via the package rpart therneau and atkinson 1997 implemented in the rattle graphical user interface williams 2009 various sets of decision trees were tested and this study will discuss the most robust tree considering the number of documented wells 47 decision tree building was performed using 80 of the data for calibration and 20 of the data for validation the most adapted decision tree was selected on the basis of the matrix error constructed from the validation process to build a tree maximizing the number of rules required to understand environmental impacts over the water resource the complexity parameter cp and the minbucket minimum number of individuals per node parameters were used to control the size of the decision tree and to select the optimal tree size if the cost of adding another variable to the decision tree from the current node is above the value of cp then tree building does not continue setting up cp 0 and minbucket to 1 allows therefore a very detailed decision tree to be built consistently with the relative training and testing sample sizes then the overall error of the model has been evaluated performing the model over the test sample 20 of the database and reported in an error or confusion matrix 3 3 implementation of decision tree rules in a gis the most robust decision tree has been used to identify a set of conditions features that can be related to one type of contamination once those conditions were known they were affected to virtual wells throughout the city in order to create a map of risk on qgis the conditions were affected using conditional approach by following each node to the final leave corresponding to a type of impact doing so allowed spatializing the contamination types over the city and then discuss the main predictors corresponding to the successive nodes in the decision tree 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatio temporal variability of cl br a range of pressures over the superficial and strategic

groundwaters affected by waste waters or leaching waste through molar cl br ratios that increased up to 1500 similarly mcarthur et al 2012 evaluated that septic tank outflows with values molar cl br reaching 5000 in parallel most of the authors define seawater end member with a cl br of 650 while cl is of 19 000 mg l pristine waters including precipitations and non disturbed freshwaters usually feature values varying from 400 to 650 due to sea spray signature but limited cl vengosh and pankratov 1998 alcalá and custodio 2008 in order to evaluate the relevance of this approach a comparison between cl br evaluation and boron isotope data reported in cary et al 2015 methods has been performed for the september 2012 campaign during which the both types of tracers were evaluated fig s1 in supplementary material this comparison highlights that cl br ratio is less sensitive to adsorption desorption processes that affect boron quantity and isotopic signatures vázquez suñé et al 2010 especially for high salinities but that in turn cl br when used to identify waste water impacts may be partly overwhelmed by seawater influence this latter may increase especially near the estuary during wet period paiva et al 2017 this justifies as indicated in the following why we focused on the dry period to more clearly evaluate the occurrence of waste water impacts comparison of cl br systematics with environmental species related to anthropogenic impacts such as no3 nh4 is poorly adapted as the aquifers were revealed to be bio geochemically reactive bertrand et al 2016 making these elements non conservative this makes the proposed approach as an adapted strategy for tropical coastal areas featuring both saline intrusions coupled with ionic exchanges and microbiological activities controlling a range of redox reactions modifying sewage signatures plotting cl and cl br for wet september 2012 and dry march 2013 periods fig 4 highlights a great spatio temporal variability the waste water endmember signature used to delineate the mixing line with pristine waters has been defined from the surface water sampled downstream the beberibe river that is recognized to be strongly impacted by wastes cary et al 2015 bertrand et al 2016 waters sampled following the wet period september 2012 show two general trends matching either with wastewater impact or in accordance with pristine conditions potentially under moderately salinized influence anthropogenic influences are more detectable during the dry period march 2013 with a greater number of wells potentially impacted by wastewaters or by seawater this seasonal difference could be attributed to wetter conditions in september favoring a general dilution of anthropogenic impacts in addition wetter conditions usually limit rationing and favor the use of the domestic network therefore attenuating the use of pumping wells furthermore wetter conditions favor some of the alternative water access strategies e g rain harvesting cary et al 2018 the impact of wetter conditions over urban areas has been evaluated in various studies to point out their positive or adverse effects over groundwater quality for instance peixoto 2020 suggested that wetter conditions over the city of fortaleza ne brazil are associated with greater mean contaminant concentrations e g nitrate nevertheless the dry period featured greater nitrate concentrations in a more punctual perspective suggesting a wider impact of domestic effluents consistently paiva et al 2017 by jointly monitoring precipitation rate groundwater level and electrical conductivity identified such a dilution effect during wet period in the recife aquifers including in deeper boreholes screened between 133 and 170 m deep this is in agreement with the findings of lasagna et al 2013 which stated that dilution has been found to play an important role in determining the degree of contamination in the case of nonsorbing solutes as it is the case for halides or nitrate accordingly the evaluation for the dry period march 2013 allows visualizing a greater degree of anthropogenic impacts most of the groundwaters are distributed along a mixing line between pristine aquifer and seawater signatures fig 4 the application of binary mixing models shows that the mixing rate for sea water is always less than 10 cl max 2000 mg l for the waters sampled throughout this campaign the seawater influence affects mainly groundwaters from cabo and beberibe aquifers but with a moderate amplitude as stated by cary et al 2015 this moderate impact has to be analyzed with care as the accessible wells are by definition not yet salinized the most salinized wells are most of the time sealed by owners to avoid any further pumping concurrently the sewage influence becomes the most important impact and affects all the aquifers the deep cabo and beberibe groundwaters that are under waste water influence remain usually in the first part of the mixing line suggesting that an anthropogenic impact may occur as well but that it remains usually moderate consistently with the findings of chatton et al 2016 as it will be detailed in the following the low cl br ratios for some deep groundwaters such as beb 51 59 60 cl br 113 132 152 respectively appear contradictory at a first sight with the boron typology discussed in cary et al 2015 these waters presented high δ11b 63 68 consistent with a possible influence of paleobrines brines can result from the dissolution of evaporites usually harboring a high cl br also it can be produced from the remaining solution resulting from partial evaporation of seawater which can present low cl br apparent enrichment in br might be explained in terms of dilution of evaporated seawater by relatively low salinity seawater or meteoric water because br is preferentially partitioned into the fluid phase mccaffrey et al 1987 therefore evaporation and further dilution by freshwaters are two processes that may occur in the estuary and mangrove area of recife consistently the high δ11b signatures reported by cary et al 2015 argue for brines resulting from evaporation of seawater which were then trapped in sediments rather than water dissolving evaporites therefore locally a seawater influence can be observed in areas distant from the seafront and is expected to be representative of transgressive marine processes e g paleomangroves that act locally as a salinization sources in the beberibe aquifer cary et al 2015 chatton et al 2016 it is important to take into consideration that within such a complex system several mixings may occur between the identified 3 end members pristine hydrogeological media waste waters salinized water more or less evaporated and diluted or from water dissolving evaporites or trapped in paleoenvironments therefore the impact of the septic influence may be partially overwhelmed by the impact of more salinized waters related to the estuary as previously suggested by the boron and strontium typologies discussed in cary et al 2015 or bertrand et al 2016 4 2 delineation of socio environmental conditions favoring impacts over groundwater quality based on the classification proposed in the fig 4 and from the socio environmental database provided by cavalcanti et al 2008 implemented in a gis a range of decision trees were built and tested for the dry period march 2013 the overall error for the selected tree was 13 4 as reported in the confusion matrix table 1 the lower identification was identified for the pristine waters error 40 in contrast wastewater impact and seawater impact were properly identified error 0 the correspondence analysis map fig 5 allows visualizing the match between the 3 predicted and observed features pristine seawater waste water impacts this suggests that the decision tree algorithm although presenting some weaknesses to target pristine like waters might be a relevant tool to identify occurrence and main types of dominant contaminations waste water and seawater this suggests that little changes in diluted waters mainly pristine may impact the general quality that can contrast from the pristine signature although being only slightly modified fig 6 details the main factors nodes required to better classify wells and to identify these contamination types and occurrences it appeared that the minimum distance from the sea front the rate of presence household sanitary facility the population density the minimal distance from surface water are implied in the delineation of the 3 groups of environmental status of groundwater leaf nodes it is worth noting that neither the lithology nor the groundwater depth related to screened depth were among the most relevant factors explaining the environmental impact variability this highlights the great role of environmental processes that overwhelm the possible hydraulic contrasts between aquifers as stated by previous studies cary et al 2015 chatton et al 2016 bertrand et al 2016 paiva et al 2017 hydraulic connections exist between deep and superficial aquifers more specifically cary et al 2015 highlighted that an upward leakage from the deeper aquifers occurs in the most inland areas whereas downward fluxes likely predominate in littoral zones such partial mixing between superficial and deep groundwaters could partially hide the expected protecting effect of depth over environmental consistently chatton et al 2016 found traces of modern anthropogenic gasses cfc s and sf6 in deep groundwater that were dated from 8000 to 20 000 years b p similarly impacts from superficial pollutions to deep confined and strategic groundwater resources has been lately identified in dense urban areas in china han et al 2016 or india lapworth et al 2018 revealing a broad environmental challenge for great cities worldwide 4 3 implementation of the socio environmental typology and mapping of risk over the metropolis the paths and nodes provided by the decision tree fig 6 were implemented using the built database from the combination of data provided by the city hall and the geological and geographical data over the metropolis this allowed proposing a map of socio environmental impacts fig 7 over the groundwater resource representative of what occurs during dry periods considering that it corresponds to the most threatening conditions fig 4 delineating contamination type does not directly permit the water quality itself to be evaluated but is rather a tool for visualizing contamination risks therefore in a long term and integrated management perspective such a visualization is more relevant when the risks are higher as it highlights contamination impacts that should be mitigated in priority over the long term applying this method it appears that contamination risks for groundwater may be summarized as follows pristine conditions are mainly found in the inland western part of the metropolis in areas distant from seafront corresponding to neighborhoods with high waste collection percentage low population density e g pau ferro neighborhood bq pop density 2 inhab km2 and 93 of households with waste collection and located upstream the surface water channels fig 3 such a trend related to population density is consistent with effects observed through statistical analysis at continental e g ouedraogo et al 2020 and at city scales in japan e g babiker et al 2007 or in india das et al 2013 nevertheless a narrow fringe of good environmental status should also occur near the sea front where well and population densities are the greatest this narrow area may be interpreted as a consequence of greater contamination risks over the zone that influence high income population strategies for accessing freshwater resources once previous wells are contaminated or salinized and then definitively sealed cary et al 2018 petelet giraud et al 2018 in this zone the socio environmental integration is among the highest cavalcanti et al 2008 favoring the development of technically developed groundwater withdraw strategies despite an overall groundwater quality degradation observed there since decades this area is characterized by great socio environmental integration with a waste collection percentage of 90 100 and a waste water network connection ranging from 80 to 100 fig 3 nevertheless despite this integration a great density of wells whose a great part is set to supply water for condominiums well density of 140 190 km2 exerts a pressure over the resource coelho et al 2018 this might also partly explain why the validation test for the decision tree was the weakest for pristine like waters table 1 wastewater impacts are dominant in various areas of the metropole and represent the main qualitative alterations on the groundwater resource at first the western and northern neighborhoods seem to feature conditions promoting such an impact these zones harbor low to moderate population density 0 60 inhab km2 but also a weak proportion of households connected to sewage network 0 20 especially in ar guabiraba and at ibura neighborhoods located on the north and on the south of the city center this agrees with other studies in southern densely populated metropolises such as reported by kooy et al 2018 in jakarta which stated that the degree of contamination of water varies according to the depth of wells households can afford to dig and the distance from their own and their neighbors septic tanks in parallel wastewater impacts are also inferred near the seashore distance from seafront 4460 m fig 6 and where population density tends to increase this area closer to the littoral features the combination of greater anthropogenic pressure risks with a denser network of surface channels that are known to be purveyors of contamination bertrand et al 2016 cary et al 2015 petelet giraud et al 2018 in addition the downstream location of this area may promote the accumulation of the anthropogenic impacts occurring upstream in the watershed various studies targeted the combined effect of dense sewage network leakage and the impact of storm waters that contribute to a great recharge proportion in urbanized areas mainly occurring through uncovered or featuring fissured covering infiltration points reached by cumulated run off vázquez suñé et al 2010 schirmer et al 2013 olds et al 2018 seawater influence appears to be distributed over two main zones the first area is rather distant to the sea front and is found near the madalena neighborhood bg over the beberibe aquifer as stated previously cary et al 2015 this impact is likely related to oceanic transgression that was favored along the pernambuco fault delineating a lowland zone throughout which the capibabribe river and estuary extended considering the various marine transgression and regression phases that have affected the whole recife s plain the deep salty groundwater most probably originates from the intrusion events cary et al 2015 stated this could have occurred during the pleistocene 123 000 years bp and through infiltration from the palaeomangroves covering the lower part of the area considering the groundwater ages of 4000 years b p in this zone chatton et al 2016 such salinization process could be also consistent with holocene transgression impacting low elevated areas along with the pernambuco fault this geogenic impact appears to be detectable when well density remains moderate figs 3 and 6 and this probably limits infiltration of superficial water impacted by sewages where sewage impact is more important this phenomenon may overwhelmthis geogenic influence secondly the southern recife seafront is subject to seawater influence as it was already mentioned by coelho et al 2018 among others this area features a great groundwater drawdown due to the important population density usually with moderate to high incomes these conditions favor the use of deep wells equipped with powerful pumps these resulted in a significant drawdown up to 70 m between 2000 and 2010 s as mentioned previously this non sustainable and most of the time illegal groundwater use has environmental and behavioral consequences from an environmental point of view this promotes direct seawater intrusion along the coastline a phenomenon that increased due to greater groundwater uses during the 2000 s and the 2010 s repeated droughts facing these quality issues users choose two kinds of strategies for direct domestic water access some people and condominiums invested in private desalinization facilities a range of studies revealed that such a strategy could locally as these facility are usually implemented in private condominium favor the interface between seawater and freshwater to drop e g jorreto et al 2009 stein et al 2020 and therefore favor a local freshening by attracting upstream freshwater nevertheless due to the wastewater impact featuring the superficial water in this area this strategy could increase quality issues for upstream groundwater after surface water infiltrations the second way consists in stopping the pumping and drill a new well as it is commonly observed in recife although the local legislation limits this strategy petelet giraud et al 2018 conversely to desalinization this favors better water quality access over the short term consistently with the contamination risk map but in turn should amplify the seawater intrusion over the long term 5 conclusion and management perspectives the strategy proposed in this paper aimed at providing a simple accurate and affordable way to assess the most typical risks of groundwater contamination occurring in southern coastal metropolises the proposed methodology should be understood as a generalizable screening tool to identify areas of interests for water management improvements foster et al 2013 jensen and khalis 2020 obviously the physiographical conditions are important but likely not sufficient to explain impacts on groundwater resources and the socio environmental inclusion exclusion evaluations were necessary this highlights the need for tight cooperation between human and environmental sciences to address anthropogenic impacts over urban water resource and further ways to manage them the application of this method for recife ne brazil permitted to discuss the structural features that underlie groundwater quality issues and led to somehow unexpected results in particular the distinction of shallow and deep groundwater was not required in the decision algorithm to delineate contamination types it is likely that the hydraulic connections between shallow threatened and deep strategic aquifers cary et al 2015 chatton et al 2016 avoided with the available dataset their distinction from a socio environmental point of view this highlights the increasing need for an iuwm plan over the area as current groundwater access strategies impact natural hydraulic separations as it is concurrently observed in other urban centers located over deep confined groundwater systems han et al 2016 lapworth et al 2018 on this basis combining the reality of highly contrasted socio environmental territories within the urban mosaic with water resource quality indicators appears to be a way to efficiently adapt iuwm in such a highly urbanized and coastal context this could in particular help the implementation of small scale distributed systems accounting for both social and environmental contrasts and emergencies constituting an intermediate way between purely centralized and highly defective and individual insecure and environmentally impacting strategies the choice of these systems ranging between managed aquifer recharge facilities small scale waste water treatment plants and gray water recycling are dependent on local hydrogeological and socio environmental contexts and require flexibility flexible approaches are now widely used in cities to timely adjust prevention from natural hazards e g gersonius et al 2013 city of melbourne 2016 in a context of climate changes impacts e g floods our work demonstrates that spatial flexibility would be an asset in socio environmental mosaics such as recife to manage local water resource required for the population s daily life in order to promote a proper implementation of such systems the combination of spatio temporal assessment of contamination risks such as proposed in this paper and its link with people socio environmental conditions and resource perceptions should be conjointly undertaken in particular water resource perceptions remain a challenging issue due to the high insecurity of other daily life aspects job income security cary et al 2018 and a more spatially detailed water quality indicator assessment should be encouraged declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest declared acknowledgements this communication was possible

16388,hydrothermal liquefaction htl is a thermochemical process for the conversion of biomass into bio crude oil however treatment of post htl aqueous by products is an emerging issue towards the commercialisation of htl technology this study investigates the use of non catalytic wet oxidation wo for the reduction of organic compounds and heat production at different temperatures 200 350 c residence times rt 2 180 min and excess oxygen the aqueous phase from htl of sewage sludge is investigated and 97 6 of the chemical oxygen demand cod and 96 1 of the total organic carbon toc were removed at the highest temperature and retention time the minimum energy requirement achieved was 9 6 kwh kg cod removed at 200 c for 180 min and the exothermic reactions of the process can generate 28 3 of the required heat gc fid and ms analysis revealed that the degradation of different groups of organic compounds generates acetic acid as an intermediate by product of wo being further oxidised at temperatures higher than 300 c nh4 and nh3 are generated from the decomposition of nitrogenated organic compounds showing the highest concentration of 704 5 mg nh4 l at 350 c after 180 min graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wet oxidation hydrothermal liquefaction sewage sludge aqueous phase 1 introduction the production of advanced fuels which are derived from lignocellulosic biomass non food crop feedstocks agricultural and forest residues and industrial and urban wastes are sustainable options for the decarbonisation of the transport sector especially for high power transport vehicles such as aircrafts ships and trucks fokaides and christoforou 2016 hydrothermal liquefaction htl is one of the main technologies that can produce advanced fuels and value added chemicals by converting a variety of organic materials into bio crude the technology involves heating aqueous slurries at high temperatures 300 350 c with pressures higher than the vapour pressure of water the process has been demonstrated successfully for various feedstock including algae wastes and lignocellulosic biomass elliott et al 2015 sewage sludge ss a waste stream from wastewater treatment plants wwtps has great potential as a feedstock for htl and its conversion to biocrude has been the subject of several studies qian et al 2017 shah et al 2020 snowden swan et al 2016 thomsen et al 2020 xu et al 2018 in 2010 the generation of sewage sludge in the eu27 was approximately 11 5 mt dry matter dm and the production is expected to increase with the expansion of wastewater treatment plants especially in eastern europe verlicchi and zambello 2015 in 2018 the us produced approximately 14 mt of dry sludge skaggs et al 2018 not only is sewage sludge a surplus feedstock source which is costly to dispose it also entails a variety of environmental burdens when applied to land and loss of valuable resources if incinerated previous studies have shown the potential of htl to destroy hazardous pollutants thomsen et al 2020 in sewage sludge and the recovery of p as nutrients liu et al 2021 the conversion of sewage sludge into bio crude can reach yields between 24 5 and 45 anastasakis et al 2018 malins et al 2015 however a large quantity of process water is produced from the process denominated htl aqueous phase htl ap the htl ap can contain between 20 and 40 of the organics and 60 80 of the nutrients from the feedstock si et al 2019 the htl ap contains high levels of total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonium and its discharge into the environment without proper treatment would lead to environmental and health impacts nutrient runoff and eutrophication the high cod and ammonium contents impede the direct treatment in wwtps and requires additional treatment or pretreatment for the sustainable development of the htl process it is essential to determine the most appropriate technology to efficiently utilise the carbon present on htl ap unleash its potential and maximise the upscale feasibility of the process watson et al 2020 several studies suggested different technologies for the use of htl ap which includes anaerobic digestion ad hydrothermal gasification htg electrochemical oxidation eo microbial electrolysis and algae and microbial growth sundarrajan et al 2021 all have advantages and disadvantages in cost energy efficiency scale up inhibition toxicity and catalyst contamination ad and htg are the most referenced technologies to address the htl ap issue pipitone et al 2020 organic matter is converted to biogas ch4 and co2 by anaerobic organisms in the ad process the process when compared to other technologies is low cost and has a low energy requirement for the conversion of htl ap chen et al 2020 however the composition of htl ap can be inhibitory or toxic to the anaerobes due to the presence of recalcitrant organic compounds and a high concentration of ammonia wang et al 2021 these characteristics of htl ap can limit biogas production reducing its applicability unless pretreatment or heavy dilution are applied martin ryals et al 2015 yang et al 2020 furthermore ad as a biochemical process is much slower than thermochemical processes requiring large reactor volumes and the digestate produced as a by product requires further treatment in htg or in catalytic hydrothermal gasification chg the organic compounds dissolved in the htl ap can be converted into a gas consisting mainly of h2 ch4 and co2 zhang et al 2011b however the capital and operational costs of the htg chg are high and the metal catalysts used can suffer from sulfur poisoning zhu et al 2019 the electrochemical oxidation eo process was investigated to decrease the soluble organics content in the aqueous phase co product from the htl of microalgae chlorella sp a cod removal efficiency of 99 was achieved including the decomposition of organic nitrogen into ammonium ciarlini et al 2020 however the eo process has long been criticised for its high energy consumption xing et al 2018 matayeva and biller 2021 investigated the use of eo for the treatment of htl aqueous phase and hydrogen production they achieved 99 7 cod removal efficiency with an h2 production rate of 0 84 kwh kg cod for sewage sludge htl aqueous phase however the energy consumption was 39 27 kwh kg cod removed matayeva and biller 2021 microbial electrolysis mec is a bioelectrochemical system in which anaerobic bacteria produce electrons by decomposing waste in order to create hydrogen the produced electrons are transported to the cathode for proton reduction research conducted by shen et al 2018 with htl aqueous phase from manure in mec reactors showed high removals of organics 90 98 and nitrogen 57 93 under various organic loadings applied voltages and flow rates achieving h2 production of 5 mmol h2 g cod removed which corresponds to 0 37 kwh kg cod removed shen et al 2018 however more research for industrial scale up is required as proposed by rousseau et al 2020 one option not previously investigated for htl ap treatment is wet oxidation wo wo is an advanced oxidation technology firstly proposed by f j zimmermann also known as the zimmerman process zimmermann 1954 which is suitable for the treatment of high concentration toxic harmful and refractory wastewaters zhang 2020 characteristics present in htl ap wo entails the oxidation of dissolved or suspended compounds under hydrothermal conditions in water by an oxidant typically molecular oxygen o2 from the air or in pure form is used as the oxidant to degrade organic compounds in aqueous waste streams that are too dilute for incineration and too concentrated or recalcitrant for microbial treatment parsons 2004 the organic pollutants are oxidised and decomposed into inorganic matter such as co2 and h2o or small oxygenated organic molecules in the liquid phase under high temperature 125 350 c and high pressure 0 5 20 mpa dietrich et al 1985 the application of temperatures and pressures higher than the critical point for pure water in wo are denominated supercritical wet oxidation scwo portela et al 2001 wo and scwo processes can also use catalysts to reduce activation energy and increase pollutants removal rate bhargava et al 2006 ding et al 1995 due to the oxidant s broad applicability and low price several commercial wo plants have already been established for chemical and pharmaceuticals production effluents textile effluents effluents from paper mills and olive processing luck 1999 mantzavinos and psillakis 2004 the main operational costs are related to power to compress air or oxygen and high pressure liquid pumps verenich et al 2000 in addition reaction temperature pressure and reactor material are also significant cost factors by analysing the wet oxidation reaction mechanism it is understood that the attack of free radicals on the organic matter will produce low mw organic acids and other reaction mechanisms such as redox also suggest that the break of c c bonds will produce low mw organics typical stable intermediates are acetic acid methanol and ethanol zhang 2020 wo has recently been investigated to treat the aqueous phase generated by hydrothermal carbonisation htc reza et al 2016 reza et al 2016 demonstrated that wo of the aqueous phase of htc could remove 74 of the toc at 260 c for 30 min weiner et al 2018 investigated wo in a temperature range between 170 and 210 c and showed a cod removal of 50 70 weiner et al 2018 baskir et al 2014 studied the wo of char water slurries from htc and could show that sufficient heat is released under certain wo conditions to thermally sustain the htc process baskyr et al 2014 hydrothermal liquefaction and wo present an intriguing synergy for integration for example at conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp htl can convert the solid fractions sludges into biocrude which can be further upgraded and refined into biofuels wo can treat the htl ap to acceptable levels for its return to the wwtp and generate heat which can be integrated with the htl process in addition wo treatment could open the opportunity for biological treatment by reducing the toxicity of htl ap and increasing the concentration of easily biodegradable vfas biological processes such as anaerobic digestion and microbial electrolysis could also valorize the post wp htl ap more efficiently and increase the overall energy recovery from the htl process the current study aims to demonstrate the applicability of wo for the treatment or pretreatment of the aqueous phase generated from biocrude production by htl of sewage sludge also at higher temperatures compared to previous htc ap studies which could enable heat integration with htl by analysing the htl ap composition before and after the wo process the general reaction mechanisms of organic pollutants and the products generated are described finally the energy production and requirements of wo of htl ap are discussed 2 experimental method 2 1 htl aqueous phase characterisation hydrothermal liquefaction of sewage sludge was performed on the continuous htl pilot plant at aarhus university denmark the htl plant is described in detail by anastasakis et al 2018 the htl experiments from which the htl ap for the current study was obtained using dewatered primary sewage sludge was described by thomsen et al 2020 the operational parameters of the htl conversion are shown in table 1 the product stream containing the bio crude and the aqueous phase from the htl reactor was separated gravimetrically using a separation funnel prior to the wet oxidation experiments the htl ap was filtered using filter paper to remove any remaining solids 2 2 wet oxidation experiments wet oxidation of htl ap was carried out in custom build hy lok reactors the reactors were constructed from 316 stainless steel ¾ inch hy lok pipes the bottom of the reactor was capped and the top was connected with a ¾ to ½ inch reduction union followed by a ½ to ⅛ inch reducer the top part of the reactor was connected to a union cross with a 1 5 m long ⅛ inch pipe the union cross was connected to a pressure gauge safety valve and quick connector for the oxygen injection the ¾ inch pipe was 10 cm in length giving a total reactor volume of 20 ml the pressurised reactors were coupled to a shaker for continuous mixing at 110 rpm and submerged into a pre heated fluidised sand bath the experiments were performed at four sandbath setpoint temperatures 200 250 300 and 350 c and six retention times 2 10 30 60 120 and 180 min the heating profile curves of the wet oxidation reactors filled only with the equivalent amount of distilled water under different final temperatures are shown in fig s1 in the supplementary information each experiment was performed at least in duplicate by using 5 ml of htl ap the reactors were vented three times with o2 and afterwards pressurised with oxygen gas to the designated pressure shown in table 2 an excess amount of o2 was provided 20 and 90 bar of o2 these values are respectively equivalent to 2 8 and 12 5 times more than the minimum o2 required at 300 and 350 c the experiments were not performed at the low pressure 20 bar as the final pressure at reaction temperature did not reach water saturation pressure the pressure calculation was based on the initial cod of the htl ap and the required saturation pressure of water under the specified temperature as explained more analytically in section 2 4 after the reaction time the reactors were cooled down to room temperature and the samples were collected and stored at 4 c 2 3 characterisation of water samples htl ap samples and the samples after wet oxidation were analysed for chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and ammonium nh₄ content using merck spectroquant cell tests part numbers cod 114 541 toc 114 879

25id agilent technologies usa using helium as carrier gas hydrogen and air were used as fid detector gasses gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms was used to identify the volatile and semi volatile compounds present in the samples before and after the wet oxidation reaction the method includes the derivatisation of the aqueous samples using methyl chloroformate mfc the method was described by madsen et al 2016 and previously applied by us quantitatively for 19 compounds thomsen et al 2020 while in the current study only the peak areas of the 67 most prominent peaks were used in the previous publication the 19 qualified compounds only accounted for 5 of the toc so that we estimate that the current method would identify around 15 20 of the total toc as the vfa s are known to quantitatively account for 10 of the initial toc see fig 4 2 3 analysis and calculation the o2 pressure demand for the wet oxidation experiment was calculated based on the cod value of the initial sample and the ideal gas law 1 p v n r t where p is the required pressure bar v is the volume of the reactor s headspace of the reactor s l n is the oxygen demand mol r is the ideal gas constant 0

sewage sludge is highly contaminated presenting a high cod value with an average concentration of 28 300 mg l and a high concentration of toc 11 900 mg l it also contains high tn and ammonium concentrations of 685 and 208 mg l respectively the average ph was around 3 85 being acidic due to the presence of volatile fatty acids vfas based on eq 4 and considering 100 of cod removal the untreated htl ap has a potential of 384 70 kj l which gives the opportunity for energy recovery in the form of heat the performance of wet oxidation on the htl ap of sewage sludge is based on its effectiveness in reducing cod and toc levels wo was analysed under different temperatures and residence times as can be observed in fig 1 the cod and toc removal increased with temperature and residency time achieving a maximum cod removal of 97 6 and toc removal of 96 1 at 350 c 180 min the post wo process water cod and toc concentrations after maximum removal were 690 and 470 mg l respectively these results do not comply with the current european discharge limits of 125 mg l cod directive 1991 one common feature for the different reaction temperatures is that the cod and toc removal initially showed high rates followed by a slower removal rate this is presumably to the fact that a large number of organic compounds were degraded generating short chain organic compounds that are much more resistant to wo treatment than the compounds originally present lin et al 1996 in fig 1a it is possible to observe that after 2 min the cod removal efficiency rates reached values between 14 5 at 200 c and 55 3 at 350 c after 2 min at 350 c the removal was more efficient when compared to 200 c after 180 min the same phenomenon can be observed in terms of toc in fig 1b at 200 c the toc removal was between 15 5 49 7 2 180 min and after 2 min at 350 c the removal was 57 8 reza et al 2016 performed one study using process water from hydrothermal carbonisation of sewage sludge and achieved 74 toc removal at 260 c for 30 min reza et al 2016 weiner et al 2018 also investigated the wo process for the treatment of sewage sludge htc aqueous phase at 200 c with a residence time ranging between 30 min and 4 h they achieve a cod removal of 50 70 weiner et al 2018 in the current study the cod removal at 200 c reached values between 14 5 and 55 0 2 180 min and toc removal at 250 c 30 min reached 46 1 these difference in the results can be due to compositional differences in the of process water of htl and htc partial oxidation occurs when insufficient temperatures and residence times are employed the partial oxidation of higher molecular weight molecules produces low molecular weight carboxylic acids which are extremely difficult to oxidise bhargava et al 2006 the high cod and toc removal at 350 c after 180 min indicate that at this temperature the oxidation of low molecular weight carboxylic acids to co2 and h2o occurred the higher initial o2 pressures investigated under 200 and 250 c showed no significant cod and toc removal difference the cod and toc removal after 180 min at 200 c 55 0 and 49 7 were removed under 20 bar and 57 4 and 55 0 under 90 bar respectively at 250 c the removals were 66 7 and 62 1 at 20 bar and 65 1 and 62 2 at 90 bar for cod and toc respectively 3 2 energy requirement the energy requirement for the performance of wet oxidation of htl ap is shown in table 4 the values for water energy requirements were calculated based on the specific heat capacity of water more details can be found in table s1 in the supplementary information wet oxidation reactions are exothermic generating heat that will reduce the energy requirements of the process facilitating its viability and applicability to continuous flow reactors with heat recovery as shown in table 4 the ratio between the energy released and the water heating requirement ranged between 7 5 and 28 3 with the maximum ratio achieved at 200 c after 180 min this indicates that 28 of the energy required for the wo reaction can be obtained from the oxidative heat release wo has been shown to generate enough heat to become self sustaining bhargava et al 2006 therefore with appropriate heat recovery no continued heating is required after an initial heating phase the heat released due to the exothermicity of wo suggests that in a continuous industrial wo process the process can be energetically self sustained if coupled with an efficient heat exchanger able to recover 75 of the heat such heat exchanger has already been reported on pilot scale for htl process anastasakis et al 2018 although it is should be pointed out that the process requires high pressure o2 or air supply which comes with an additional energy penalty for comparison the energy requirements were converted to energy per kg of cod removed kwh kg 1 as shown in table 4 the calculation takes into consideration only the energy requirements for heating the water to the reaction temperature the energy requirement in the experiments for heating water varied between 13 3 and 60 5 kwh per kg of cod removed the lowest requirement was achieved at 200 c for 180 min and the highest for 2 min at 250 c the highest energy consumption was always found after 2 min under the four temperatures investigated and the lowest after 180 min also because no additional energy requirement was calculated to keep the reaction temperature for longer periods only the heating phase at 350 c the highest energy consumption was 28 3 kwh per kg of cod removed after 2 min and the lowest 15 8 kwh per kg of cod removed a typical urban wastewater treatment plant can require values between 0 03 and 7 1 kwh kg cod removed christoforidou et al 2020 other technologies present higher energy requirements than wo for the treatment of htl ap electrochemical oxidation for example required 28 kwh per kg of cod removed for the treatment of nitrogen rich post hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater with an initial cod content of 35 990 mg l as demonstrated by ciarlini et al 2020 another example is hydrothermal gasification htg and catalytic hydrothermal gasification ctg that operate at high temperatures 300 700 c zhang et al 2011a when performed at temperatures higher than 350 c it will require more energy for heating the water when compared to wo while heat recovery can be integrated into both htg and wo wo has the advantage of additional heat release which could facilitate autothermal operation of continuous wo htl ap treatment however this comes with the penalty of not producing a combustible gas and the additional cost of oxygen compression 3 3 the fate of htl ap organics two processes determine the overall reaction rate in non catalytic wet air oxidation first the mass transfer of oxygen from the gas to the liquid phase and second the reaction occurring in the liquid phase kolaczkowski et al 1999 the mass transfer of oxygen across the gas liquid phase contact can be considered as a combination of resistances in the gas and liquid phases with diffusional resistance concentrated in a thin layer on each side of the interface the oxygen transfer in the gas phase is significantly faster than in the liquid phase for soluble gases like oxygen in the water as a result the gas phase resistance may be neglected and mass transfer is controlled by the liquid film resistance levenspiel 1999 for wo processes the oxidation reaction takes place essentially in the bulk of the liquid debellefontaine et al 1996 in order to quantify the vfas from the htl ap and wo products gc fid was carried out the analysis includes nine volatile fatty acids acetic propanoic isobutyric butyric isovaleric valeric isohexanoic hexanoic and heptanoic acid as seen in fig 2 the analysis was performed for each temperature and residence time investigated in terms of concentration before and after wo the analysis of vfas is quantitative and units of mg l are provided in table s2 in fig 2 the data has been normalised to 100 for the initial un treated htl ap for improved visualisation in fig 2a and b a twofold increase in the acetic acid concentration can be seen showing that acid acetic is the main intermediary product from wo bhargava et al 2006 at 200 and 250 c the oxidation of acetic acid appears to be more difficult acetic acid among the low molecular weight carboxylic acids c1 c6 is the most resistant to wet oxidation and the oxidation under this temperature range is extremely difficult a reduction of only 7 in cod during wo of acetic acid at 275 c in 5 h has been reported shende and mahajani 1997 the use of catalysts is required in order to oxidise acetic acid at temperatures in the range of 200 and 250 c hosokawa 2003 investigated the state of ru on ceo2 and its catalytic activity in the wet oxidation of acetic acid they achieved complete toc removal after 60 min at 190 c hosokawa 2003 at 200 c fig 2a complete isohexanoic and hexanoic acid degradation were observed after 120 and 30 min respectively other acids like propanoic isobutyric isovaleric and heptanoic present higher resistance to oxidation containing more than half of their initial concentration after 180 min in fig 2b at 250 c valeric isohexanoic and hexanoic acids were completely removed after 180 min propanoic isobutyric and heptanoic acids present high resistance for oxidation at this temperature at 300 c degradation of acetic acid can be observed after a high increase at shorter rts as it is shown in fig 2c the concentration of acetic acid increases until 120 min reaching 3 28 times 5 3 g l more than the initial concentration in htl ap 1 6 g l afterwards the concentration reduces to 4 7 g l showing that at 300 c the degradation of acetic acid can occur at low rates achieving a reduction of 12 6 isohexanoic acid appears as an intermediate at 300 c which exhibits an increase in the first 60 min followed by its complete degradation after 180 min complete degradation can also be observed for almost all the remaining vfa s except propanoic and isobutyric acid in fig 2d almost complete degradation of acetic acid can be seen after 180 min at 350 c only 0 17 g l of acetic acid remain this is 11 2 of the initial acetic acid present in htl ap the concentration started to reduce after 10 min of reaction however in the first 10 min acetic acid was generated showing a concentration 3 times higher than in htl ap the propanoic acid concentration was only 4 of its initial concentration and total degradation was achieved for all the other vfa s after 180 min of rt the proportion of the organic carbon from vfas in the toc from wo products was calculated to understand its final composition better as shown in fig 3 a b and c the proportion of vfas of total toc increase with increasing residence time initially vfas correspond to 9 1 of the total organic carbon from htl ap at 200 c the proportion reaches 27 2 after 180 min and at 250 c 34 8 in fig 3d the proportion of vfas increases until 120 min at 350 c achieving 68 1 the highest proportion achieved followed by a decrease reaching 18 2 after 180 min the increase in the vfas proportion in comparison to other compounds creates an opportunity for further utilisation of post wo process water in downstream technologies for example biological process microbial electrolysis and others that can benefit from the high concentration of vfas and low concentration of other organic compounds that can present toxicity the complexity of the htl ap composition prevents the elucidation of a detailed reaction pathway of the wet oxidation process and consequently its optimisation gc ms analysis identified 67 main compounds and they were classed into eight different groups according to their structure and nature the htl ap consisted of organic acids acetic butanoic pentanoic butanedioic propanoic etc alcohols 1 octanol aromatic compounds phenolic compounds benzenodiols cyclic ketones cyclopentanone cyclohexanone followed by esters and ethers methyl acetoxyacetate diisopropyl ether and ketones 2 5 hexanedione in addition nitrogen containing aromatic compounds pyridine benzenamine were classified as nitrogen aromatics nas while amides amines and carbamates were categorised into n compounds the complete list of compounds and the sum of the compounds areas of different categories of untreated htl ap can be found in table s3 and fig s2 in the supplementary information fig 4 shows the degradation patterns under different temperatures 200 250 300 and 350 c of the main compounds classes based on the peak area of the determined group before and after the wo process in fig 4a and b a 2 2 and 2 1 fold increase of organic acids for 200 and 250 c can be observed respectively while the degradation of alcohols aromatic compounds cyclic ketones ketones ester ethers and nas reached values between 0 01 and 0 18 the n compounds showed degradation of 0 62 fold at 200 c showing a slow degradation at this temperature at 250 c a fold reduction of 0 76 of n compounds was observed the high proportion of n compounds at 200 c is due to the release of some specific compounds glycine methyl dimethyl carbamate and acetamide these compounds presented a proportion higher than 1 in comparison to the initial htl ap peak area they can be intermediates from the oxidation of nas and shows higher resistance to oxidation by wo while the rest of the n compounds were quickly oxidised reducing the total final proportion of n compounds in relation to the initial values the same phenomenon was observed at 250 c however only glycine presented higher values than the initial ones at 300 and 350 c the values of organic acids higher than 1 present in fig 4a and b and at the beginning of fig 4c and d indicate that these compounds are intermediates of the degradation of other compound groups delvin and harris 1984 demonstrated the possible oxidation pathways of aqueous phenol with dissolved oxygen devlin and harris 1984 they concluded that at elevated temperatures and in the presence of water oxidation might occur in three different reactions it can introduce an oxygen atom into an aromatic ring to form phenolics or quinones attack carbon to carbon double bonds to form carbonyl compounds and oxidise alcohols and carbonyl groups to form carboxylic acids at 300 and 350 c a fast decomposition of all the detected compound groups can be observed except for organic acids followed by the degradation of such acids after 30 and 10 min for 300 and 350 c respectively at 300 c only an incomplete degradation of the organic acids was observed after reaching 2 81 fold increase after 30 min the organic acids proportion reduce to 1 92 fold after 180 min at 350 c almost complete degradation of the organics acids was achieved revealing 8 4 of the initial area these results agree with the reduction of the vfas concentration previously shown in fig 2 n compounds and nas degrade into nh4 and nh3 as can be observed in fig 4 these by products are originated from the degradation of the organic nitrogen in the oxidation process by the oh radicals genç et al 2002 as shown in fig 5 the formation of ammonium increases at higher temperatures at 350 c after 180 min 704 5 mg l was quantified however after 60 min the increase was negligible at 250 and 300 c the ammonia release after 180 min presents similar results 600 0 and 607 5 mg l respectively however at 300 c the generation quickly increases in the first 60 min followed by a slower increase afterwards at 200 c the increase is steady through time the oxidation of ammonia under wet oxidation conditions has been investigated and complete oxidation requires the use of catalysts and supercritical conditions for example oe et al 2007 achieved 100 removal of nh3 under 590 c using a tubular ni alloy 625 reactor after 62 s oe et al 2007 as for vfas proportion of toc the nh4 nh3 portion of tn was calculated to understand better the decomposition of organic nitrogen compounds present in htl ap as shown in fig 6 the percentage of nh4 in the total nitrogen increased throughout time and with the increase of temperature this is a direct result of the degradation of n compounds and na before wo the htl ap contained a tn concentration of 685 mg l htl ap had 208 mg l of ammonium this corresponds to 23 6 of total nitrogen after the wo process the ammonium content increased reaching 91 9 of the tn at 350 c for 60 min this means that only 48 mg l correspond to n in other forms organic and inorganic the tn concentration reduces after 2 min of wo and remained stable afterwards minor variations at 200 c 2 min tn reduced to 610 mg l and at 350 c after 180 min rt the concentration was 595 mg l these low removals are related to the conversion of the organic nitrogen compounds into ammonium which is difficult to oxidize under the operational conditions investigated in the current study furthermore these concentrations do not comply with the european requirements for urban waste water treatment plants discharge of 15 mg l tn directive 1991 the high concentrations of nh4 nh3 has been found to have a significant harmful effect on a number of essential wastewater treatment processes including nitrification denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox enhanced biological phosphorus removal anaerobic process and sludge solubilisation liu et al 2019 however it can significantly improve biodegradability by promoting the nitrite pathway in the wastewater treatment process of secondary sludge increasing biological nutrient removal and enhance renewable energy production liu et al 2019 snowden swan et al 2017 investigate a conceptual design for biorefinery of hydrothermal liquefaction of wet waste suggesting possible pathways for htl ap ammonia removal or recovery via nh3 stripping membrane filtration and by biological methods such as anammox and nitrification denitrification snowden swan et al 2017 however when recovery of ammonia is performed for example by stripping the high cod values present in htl ap can lead to significant levels of organics in the ammonia stream turning the stripping by product unfeasible for nutrient recovery thus requiring prior treatment snowden swan et al 2021 wet oxidation can be an option for such treatment since it achieved high proportion of ammonia in tn and high reduction of cod and toc concentrations the ammonia produced by wo of htl ap could also be integrated with the struvite precipitation process ovsyannikova et al 2021 investigated the development of a struvite producing unit for nutrient recovery using the process water and leachate solids from htl achieving a product that contains more than 75 of struvite ovsyannikova et al 2021 munir et al 2019 investigated the integration of wet oxidation and struvite precipitation for sewage sludge treatment and phosphorus recovery concluding that the low concentration nh3 may have inhibited struvite formation during struvite precipitation munir et al 2019 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that wet oxidation could be an advantageous process for the treatment of htl ap the use of higher temperatures and longer residence times increases the cod and toc removal efficiencies the post wo water at 350 c and 180 min rt process contains 690 mg l cod 470 mg l toc 595 mg l of tn and 704 5 mg l of nh₄ the exothermic characteristic of wo reactions can generate up to 28 3 of the heat required for the reactions the minimum energy requirement per kg of cod removal is 9 6 kwh at 200 c for 180 min without taking into account any opportunities for heat recovery during the wo process wo can also be used as a pretreatment capable of converting complex organic compounds into acetic acid and at 350 c for 180 min almost complete degradation of organic compounds can be achieved nh4 and nh3 appear as a by product of the decomposition of organic nitrogenated compounds not being oxidised creating an opportunity for nutrients recovery declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16388,hydrothermal liquefaction htl is a thermochemical process for the conversion of biomass into bio crude oil however treatment of post htl aqueous by products is an emerging issue towards the commercialisation of htl technology this study investigates the use of non catalytic wet oxidation wo for the reduction of organic compounds and heat production at different temperatures 200 350 c residence times rt 2 180 min and excess oxygen the aqueous phase from htl of sewage sludge is investigated and 97 6 of the chemical oxygen demand cod and 96 1 of the total organic carbon toc were removed at the highest temperature and retention time the minimum energy requirement achieved was 9 6 kwh kg cod removed at 200 c for 180 min and the exothermic reactions of the process can generate 28 3 of the required heat gc fid and ms analysis revealed that the degradation of different groups of organic compounds generates acetic acid as an intermediate by product of wo being further oxidised at temperatures higher than 300 c nh4 and nh3 are generated from the decomposition of nitrogenated organic compounds showing the highest concentration of 704 5 mg nh4 l at 350 c after 180 min graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wet oxidation hydrothermal liquefaction sewage sludge aqueous phase 1 introduction the production of advanced fuels which are derived from lignocellulosic biomass non food crop feedstocks agricultural and forest residues and industrial and urban wastes are sustainable options for the decarbonisation of the transport sector especially for high power transport vehicles such as aircrafts ships and trucks fokaides and christoforou 2016 hydrothermal liquefaction htl is one of the main technologies that can produce advanced fuels and value added chemicals by converting a variety of organic materials into bio crude the technology involves heating aqueous slurries at high temperatures 300 350 c with pressures higher than the vapour pressure of water the process has been demonstrated successfully for various feedstock including algae wastes and lignocellulosic biomass elliott et al 2015 sewage sludge ss a waste stream from wastewater treatment plants wwtps has great potential as a feedstock for htl and its conversion to biocrude has been the subject of several studies qian et al 2017 shah et al 2020 snowden swan et al 2016 thomsen et al 2020 xu et al 2018 in 2010 the generation of sewage sludge in the eu27 was approximately 11 5 mt dry matter dm and the production is expected to increase with the expansion of wastewater treatment plants especially in eastern europe verlicchi and zambello 2015 in 2018 the us produced approximately 14 mt of dry sludge skaggs et al 2018 not only is sewage sludge a surplus feedstock source which is costly to dispose it also entails a variety of environmental burdens when applied to land and loss of valuable resources if incinerated previous studies have shown the potential of htl to destroy hazardous pollutants thomsen et al 2020 in sewage sludge and the recovery of p as nutrients liu et al 2021 the conversion of sewage sludge into bio crude can reach yields between 24 5 and 45 anastasakis et al 2018 malins et al 2015 however a large quantity of process water is produced from the process denominated htl aqueous phase htl ap the htl ap can contain between 20 and 40 of the organics and 60 80 of the nutrients from the feedstock si et al 2019 the htl ap contains high levels of total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonium and its discharge into the environment without proper treatment would lead to environmental and health impacts nutrient runoff and eutrophication the high cod and ammonium contents impede the direct treatment in wwtps and requires additional treatment or pretreatment for the sustainable development of the htl process it is essential to determine the most appropriate technology to efficiently utilise the carbon present on htl ap unleash its potential and maximise the upscale feasibility of the process watson et al 2020 several studies suggested different technologies for the use of htl ap which includes anaerobic digestion ad hydrothermal gasification htg electrochemical oxidation eo microbial electrolysis and algae and microbial growth sundarrajan et al 2021 all have advantages and disadvantages in cost energy efficiency scale up inhibition toxicity and catalyst contamination ad and htg are the most referenced technologies to address the htl ap issue pipitone et al 2020 organic matter is converted to biogas ch4 and co2 by anaerobic organisms in the ad process the process when compared to other technologies is low cost and has a low energy requirement for the conversion of htl ap chen et al 2020 however the composition of htl ap can be inhibitory or toxic to the anaerobes due to the presence of recalcitrant organic compounds and a high concentration of ammonia wang et al 2021 these characteristics of htl ap can limit biogas production reducing its applicability unless pretreatment or heavy dilution are applied martin ryals et al 2015 yang et al 2020 furthermore ad as a biochemical process is much slower than thermochemical processes requiring large reactor volumes and the digestate produced as a by product requires further treatment in htg or in catalytic hydrothermal gasification chg the organic compounds dissolved in the htl ap can be converted into a gas consisting mainly of h2 ch4 and co2 zhang et al 2011b however the capital and operational costs of the htg chg are high and the metal catalysts used can suffer from sulfur poisoning zhu et al 2019 the electrochemical oxidation eo process was investigated to decrease the soluble organics content in the aqueous phase co product from the htl of microalgae chlorella sp a cod removal efficiency of 99 was achieved including the decomposition of organic nitrogen into ammonium ciarlini et al 2020 however the eo process has long been criticised for its high energy consumption xing et al 2018 matayeva and biller 2021 investigated the use of eo for the treatment of htl aqueous phase and hydrogen production they achieved 99 7 cod removal efficiency with an h2 production rate of 0 84 kwh kg cod for sewage sludge htl aqueous phase however the energy consumption was 39 27 kwh kg cod removed matayeva and biller 2021 microbial electrolysis mec is a bioelectrochemical system in which anaerobic bacteria produce electrons by decomposing waste in order to create hydrogen the produced electrons are transported to the cathode for proton reduction research conducted by shen et al 2018 with htl aqueous phase from manure in mec reactors showed high removals of organics 90 98 and nitrogen 57 93 under various organic loadings applied voltages and flow rates achieving h2 production of 5 mmol h2 g cod removed which corresponds to 0 37 kwh kg cod removed shen et al 2018 however more research for industrial scale up is required as proposed by rousseau et al 2020 one option not previously investigated for htl ap treatment is wet oxidation wo wo is an advanced oxidation technology firstly proposed by f j zimmermann also known as the zimmerman process zimmermann 1954 which is suitable for the treatment of high concentration toxic harmful and refractory wastewaters zhang 2020 characteristics present in htl ap wo entails the oxidation of dissolved or suspended compounds under hydrothermal conditions in water by an oxidant typically molecular oxygen o2 from the air or in pure form is used as the oxidant to degrade organic compounds in aqueous waste streams that are too dilute for incineration and too concentrated or recalcitrant for microbial treatment parsons 2004 the organic pollutants are oxidised and decomposed into inorganic matter such as co2 and h2o or small oxygenated organic molecules in the liquid phase under high temperature 125 350 c and high pressure 0 5 20 mpa dietrich et al 1985 the application of temperatures and pressures higher than the critical point for pure water in wo are denominated supercritical wet oxidation scwo portela et al 2001 wo and scwo processes can also use catalysts to reduce activation energy and increase pollutants removal rate bhargava et al 2006 ding et al 1995 due to the oxidant s broad applicability and low price several commercial wo plants have already been established for chemical and pharmaceuticals production effluents textile effluents effluents from paper mills and olive processing luck 1999 mantzavinos and psillakis 2004 the main operational costs are related to power to compress air or oxygen and high pressure liquid pumps verenich et al 2000 in addition reaction temperature pressure and reactor material are also significant cost factors by analysing the wet oxidation reaction mechanism it is understood that the attack of free radicals on the organic matter will produce low mw organic acids and other reaction mechanisms such as redox also suggest that the break of c c bonds will produce low mw organics typical stable intermediates are acetic acid methanol and ethanol zhang 2020 wo has recently been investigated to treat the aqueous phase generated by hydrothermal carbonisation htc reza et al 2016 reza et al 2016 demonstrated that wo of the aqueous phase of htc could remove 74 of the toc at 260 c for 30 min weiner et al 2018 investigated wo in a temperature range between 170 and 210 c and showed a cod removal of 50 70 weiner et al 2018 baskir et al 2014 studied the wo of char water slurries from htc and could show that sufficient heat is released under certain wo conditions to thermally sustain the htc process baskyr et al 2014 hydrothermal liquefaction and wo present an intriguing synergy for integration for example at conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp htl can convert the solid fractions sludges into biocrude which can be further upgraded and refined into biofuels wo can treat the htl ap to acceptable levels for its return to the wwtp and generate heat which can be integrated with the htl process in addition wo treatment could open the opportunity for biological treatment by reducing the toxicity of htl ap and increasing the concentration of easily biodegradable vfas biological processes such as anaerobic digestion and microbial electrolysis could also valorize the post wp htl ap more efficiently and increase the overall energy recovery from the htl process the current study aims to demonstrate the applicability of wo for the treatment or pretreatment of the aqueous phase generated from biocrude production by htl of sewage sludge also at higher temperatures compared to previous htc ap studies which could enable heat integration with htl by analysing the htl ap composition before and after the wo process the general reaction mechanisms of organic pollutants and the products generated are described finally the energy production and requirements of wo of htl ap are discussed 2 experimental method 2 1 htl aqueous phase characterisation hydrothermal liquefaction of sewage sludge was performed on the continuous htl pilot plant at aarhus university denmark the htl plant is described in detail by anastasakis et al 2018 the htl experiments from which the htl ap for the current study was obtained using dewatered primary sewage sludge was described by thomsen et al 2020 the operational parameters of the htl conversion are shown in table 1 the product stream containing the bio crude and the aqueous phase from the htl reactor was separated gravimetrically using a separation funnel prior to the wet oxidation experiments the htl ap was filtered using filter paper to remove any remaining solids 2 2 wet oxidation experiments wet oxidation of htl ap was carried out in custom build hy lok reactors the reactors were constructed from 316 stainless steel ¾ inch hy lok pipes the bottom of the reactor was capped and the top was connected with a ¾ to ½ inch reduction union followed by a ½ to ⅛ inch reducer the top part of the reactor was connected to a union cross with a 1 5 m long ⅛ inch pipe the union cross was connected to a pressure gauge safety valve and quick connector for the oxygen injection the ¾ inch pipe was 10 cm in length giving a total reactor volume of 20 ml the pressurised reactors were coupled to a shaker for continuous mixing at 110 rpm and submerged into a pre heated fluidised sand bath the experiments were performed at four sandbath setpoint temperatures 200 250 300 and 350 c and six retention times 2 10 30 60 120 and 180 min the heating profile curves of the wet oxidation reactors filled only with the equivalent amount of distilled water under different final temperatures are shown in fig s1 in the supplementary information each experiment was performed at least in duplicate by using 5 ml of htl ap the reactors were vented three times with o2 and afterwards pressurised with oxygen gas to the designated pressure shown in table 2 an excess amount of o2 was provided 20 and 90 bar of o2 these values are respectively equivalent to 2 8 and 12 5 times more than the minimum o2 required at 300 and 350 c the experiments were not performed at the low pressure 20 bar as the final pressure at reaction temperature did not reach water saturation pressure the pressure calculation was based on the initial cod of the htl ap and the required saturation pressure of water under the specified temperature as explained more analytically in section 2 4 after the reaction time the reactors were cooled down to room temperature and the samples were collected and stored at 4 c 2 3 characterisation of water samples htl ap samples and the samples after wet oxidation were analysed for chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and ammonium nh₄ content using merck spectroquant cell tests part numbers cod 114 541 toc 114 879 tn 114 763 and nh4 114 559 the concentration of volatile fatty acids vfas in the samples were analysed using a gc fid system 7890a agilent technologies usa with an hp innowax column 30 m 0 25 μm 0 25id agilent technologies usa using helium as carrier gas hydrogen and air were used as fid detector gasses gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms was used to identify the volatile and semi volatile compounds present in the samples before and after the wet oxidation reaction the method includes the derivatisation of the aqueous samples using methyl chloroformate mfc the method was described by madsen et al 2016 and previously applied by us quantitatively for 19 compounds thomsen et al 2020 while in the current study only the peak areas of the 67 most prominent peaks were used in the previous publication the 19 qualified compounds only accounted for 5 of the toc so that we estimate that the current method would identify around 15 20 of the total toc as the vfa s are known to quantitatively account for 10 of the initial toc see fig 4 2 3 analysis and calculation the o2 pressure demand for the wet oxidation experiment was calculated based on the cod value of the initial sample and the ideal gas law 1 p v n r t where p is the required pressure bar v is the volume of the reactor s headspace of the reactor s l n is the oxygen demand mol r is the ideal gas constant 0

energy efficiency ee took into consideration the energy consumed ec and er ec was based on the energy required to heat liquid water to the experimental conditions the values for heating water was based on the nist database chase 1998 5 e e e r k j l e c k j l 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod and toc removal the characteristics of the htl ap are shown in table 3 the htl aqueous phase from sewage sludge is highly contaminated presenting a high cod value with an average concentration of 28 300 mg l and a high concentration of toc 11 900 mg l it also contains high tn and ammonium concentrations of 685 and 208 mg l respectively the average ph was around 3 85 being acidic due to the presence of volatile fatty acids vfas based on eq 4 and considering 100 of cod removal the untreated htl ap has a potential of 384 70 kj l which gives the opportunity for energy recovery in the form of heat the performance of wet oxidation on the htl ap of sewage sludge is based on its effectiveness in reducing cod and toc levels wo was analysed under different temperatures and residence times as can be observed in fig 1 the cod and toc removal increased with temperature and residency time achieving a maximum cod removal of 97 6 and toc removal of 96 1 at 350 c 180 min the post wo process water cod and toc concentrations after maximum removal were 690 and 470 mg l respectively these results do not comply with the current european discharge limits of 125 mg l cod directive 1991 one common feature for the different reaction temperatures is that the cod and toc removal initially showed high rates followed by a slower removal rate this is presumably to the fact that a large number of organic compounds were degraded generating short chain organic compounds that are much more resistant to wo treatment than the compounds originally present lin et al 1996 in fig 1a it is possible to observe that after 2 min the cod removal efficiency rates reached values between 14 5 at 200 c and 55 3 at 350 c after 2 min at 350 c the removal was more efficient when compared to 200 c after 180 min the same phenomenon can be observed in terms of toc in fig 1b at 200 c the toc removal was between 15 5 49 7 2 180 min and after 2 min at 350 c the removal was 57 8 reza et al 2016 performed one study using process water from hydrothermal carbonisation of sewage sludge and achieved 74 toc removal at 260 c for 30 min reza et al 2016 weiner et al 2018 also investigated the wo process for the treatment of sewage sludge htc aqueous phase at 200 c with a residence time ranging between 30 min and 4 h they achieve a cod removal of 50 70 weiner et al 2018 in the current study the cod removal at 200 c reached values between 14 5 and 55 0 2 180 min and toc removal at 250 c 30 min reached 46 1 these difference in the results can be due to compositional differences in the of process water of htl and htc partial oxidation occurs when insufficient temperatures and residence times are employed the partial oxidation of higher molecular weight molecules produces low molecular weight carboxylic acids which are extremely difficult to oxidise bhargava et al 2006 the high cod and toc removal at 350 c after 180 min indicate that at this temperature the oxidation of low molecular weight carboxylic acids to co2 and h2o occurred the higher initial o2 pressures investigated under 200 and 250 c showed no significant cod and toc removal difference the cod and toc removal after 180 min at 200 c 55 0 and 49 7 were removed under 20 bar and 57 4 and 55 0 under 90 bar respectively at 250 c the removals were 66 7 and 62 1 at 20 bar and 65 1 and 62 2 at 90 bar for cod and toc respectively 3 2 energy requirement the energy requirement for the performance of wet oxidation of htl ap is shown in table 4 the values for water energy requirements were calculated based on the specific heat capacity of water more details can be found in table s1 in the supplementary information wet oxidation reactions are exothermic generating heat that will reduce the energy requirements of the process facilitating its viability and applicability to continuous flow reactors with heat recovery as shown in table 4 the ratio between the energy released and the water heating requirement ranged between 7 5 and 28 3 with the maximum ratio achieved at 200 c after 180 min this indicates that 28 of the energy required for the wo reaction can be obtained from the oxidative heat release wo has been shown to generate enough heat to become self sustaining bhargava et al 2006 therefore with appropriate heat recovery no continued heating is required after an initial heating phase the heat released due to the exothermicity of wo suggests that in a continuous industrial wo process the process can be energetically self sustained if coupled with an efficient heat exchanger able to recover 75 of the heat such heat exchanger has already been reported on pilot scale for htl process anastasakis et al 2018 although it is should be pointed out that the process requires high pressure o2 or air supply which comes with an additional energy penalty for comparison the energy requirements were converted to energy per kg of cod removed kwh kg 1 as shown in table 4 the calculation takes into consideration only the energy requirements for heating the water to the reaction temperature the energy requirement in the experiments for heating water varied between 13 3 and 60 5 kwh per kg of cod removed the lowest requirement was achieved at 200 c for 180 min and the highest for 2 min at 250 c the highest energy consumption was always found after 2 min under the four temperatures investigated and the lowest after 180 min also because no additional energy requirement was calculated to keep the reaction temperature for longer periods only the heating phase at 350 c the highest energy consumption was 28 3 kwh per kg of cod removed after 2 min and the lowest 15 8 kwh per kg of cod removed a typical urban wastewater treatment plant can require values between 0 03 and 7 1 kwh kg cod removed christoforidou et al 2020 other technologies present higher energy requirements than wo for the treatment of htl ap electrochemical oxidation for example required 28 kwh per kg of cod removed for the treatment of nitrogen rich post hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater with an initial cod content of 35 990 mg l as demonstrated by ciarlini et al 2020 another example is hydrothermal gasification htg and catalytic hydrothermal gasification ctg that operate at high temperatures 300 700 c zhang et al 2011a when performed at temperatures higher than 350 c it will require more energy for heating the water when compared to wo while heat recovery can be integrated into both htg and wo wo has the advantage of additional heat release which could facilitate autothermal operation of continuous wo htl ap treatment however this comes with the penalty of not producing a combustible gas and the additional cost of oxygen compression 3 3 the fate of htl ap organics two processes determine the overall reaction rate in non catalytic wet air oxidation first the mass transfer of oxygen from the gas to the liquid phase and second the reaction occurring in the liquid phase kolaczkowski et al 1999 the mass transfer of oxygen across the gas liquid phase contact can be considered as a combination of resistances in the gas and liquid phases with diffusional resistance concentrated in a thin layer on each side of the interface the oxygen transfer in the gas phase is significantly faster than in the liquid phase for soluble gases like oxygen in the water as a result the gas phase resistance may be neglected and mass transfer is controlled by the liquid film resistance levenspiel 1999 for wo processes the oxidation reaction takes place essentially in the bulk of the liquid debellefontaine et al 1996 in order to quantify the vfas from the htl ap and wo products gc fid was carried out the analysis includes nine volatile fatty acids acetic propanoic isobutyric butyric isovaleric valeric isohexanoic hexanoic and heptanoic acid as seen in fig 2 the analysis was performed for each temperature and residence time investigated in terms of concentration before and after wo the analysis of vfas is quantitative and units of mg l are provided in table s2 in fig 2 the data has been normalised to 100 for the initial un treated htl ap for improved visualisation in fig 2a and b a twofold increase in the acetic acid concentration can be seen showing that acid acetic is the main intermediary product from wo bhargava et al 2006 at 200 and 250 c the oxidation of acetic acid appears to be more difficult acetic acid among the low molecular weight carboxylic acids c1 c6 is the most resistant to wet oxidation and the oxidation under this temperature range is extremely difficult a reduction of only 7 in cod during wo of acetic acid at 275 c in 5 h has been reported shende and mahajani 1997 the use of catalysts is required in order to oxidise acetic acid at temperatures in the range of 200 and 250 c hosokawa 2003 investigated the state of ru on ceo2 and its catalytic activity in the wet oxidation of acetic acid they achieved complete toc removal after 60 min at 190 c hosokawa 2003 at 200 c fig 2a complete isohexanoic and hexanoic acid degradation were observed after 120 and 30 min respectively other acids like propanoic isobutyric isovaleric and heptanoic present higher resistance to oxidation containing more than half of their initial concentration after 180 min in fig 2b at 250 c valeric isohexanoic and hexanoic acids were completely removed after 180 min propanoic isobutyric and heptanoic acids present high resistance for oxidation at this temperature at 300 c degradation of acetic acid can be observed after a high increase at shorter rts as it is shown in fig 2c the concentration of acetic acid increases until 120 min reaching 3 28 times 5 3 g l more than the initial concentration in htl ap 1 6 g l afterwards the concentration reduces to 4 7 g l showing that at 300 c the degradation of acetic acid can occur at low rates achieving a reduction of 12 6 isohexanoic acid appears as an intermediate at 300 c which exhibits an increase in the first 60 min followed by its complete degradation after 180 min complete degradation can also be observed for almost all the remaining vfa s except propanoic and isobutyric acid in fig 2d almost complete degradation of acetic acid can be seen after 180 min at 350 c only 0 17 g l of acetic acid remain this is 11 2 of the initial acetic acid present in htl ap the concentration started to reduce after 10 min of reaction however in the first 10 min acetic acid was generated showing a concentration 3 times higher than in htl ap the propanoic acid concentration was only 4 of its initial concentration and total degradation was achieved for all the other vfa s after 180 min of rt the proportion of the organic carbon from vfas in the toc from wo products was calculated to understand its final composition better as shown in fig 3 a b and c the proportion of vfas of total toc increase with increasing residence time initially vfas correspond to 9 1 of the total organic carbon from htl ap at 200 c the proportion reaches 27 2 after 180 min and at 250 c 34 8 in fig 3d the proportion of vfas increases until 120 min at 350 c achieving 68 1 the highest proportion achieved followed by a decrease reaching 18 2 after 180 min the increase in the vfas proportion in comparison to other compounds creates an opportunity for further utilisation of post wo process water in downstream technologies for example biological process microbial electrolysis and others that can benefit from the high concentration of vfas and low concentration of other organic compounds that can present toxicity the complexity of the htl ap composition prevents the elucidation of a detailed reaction pathway of the wet oxidation process and consequently its optimisation gc ms analysis identified 67 main compounds and they were classed into eight different groups according to their structure and nature the htl ap consisted of organic acids acetic butanoic pentanoic butanedioic propanoic etc alcohols 1 octanol aromatic compounds phenolic compounds benzenodiols cyclic ketones cyclopentanone cyclohexanone followed by esters and ethers methyl acetoxyacetate diisopropyl ether and ketones 2 5 hexanedione in addition nitrogen containing aromatic compounds pyridine benzenamine were classified as nitrogen aromatics nas while amides amines and carbamates were categorised into n compounds the complete list of compounds and the sum of the compounds areas of different categories of untreated htl ap can be found in table s3 and fig s2 in the supplementary information fig 4 shows the degradation patterns under different temperatures 200 250 300 and 350 c of the main compounds classes based on the peak area of the determined group before and after the wo process in fig 4a and b a 2 2 and 2 1 fold increase of organic acids for 200 and 250 c can be observed respectively while the degradation of alcohols aromatic compounds cyclic ketones ketones ester ethers and nas reached values between 0 01 and 0 18 the n compounds showed degradation of 0 62 fold at 200 c showing a slow degradation at this temperature at 250 c a fold reduction of 0 76 of n compounds was observed the high proportion of n compounds at 200 c is due to the release of some specific compounds glycine methyl dimethyl carbamate and acetamide these compounds presented a proportion higher than 1 in comparison to the initial htl ap peak area they can be intermediates from the oxidation of nas and shows higher resistance to oxidation by wo while the rest of the n compounds were quickly oxidised reducing the total final proportion of n compounds in relation to the initial values the same phenomenon was observed at 250 c however only glycine presented higher values than the initial ones at 300 and 350 c the values of organic acids higher than 1 present in fig 4a and b and at the beginning of fig 4c and d indicate that these compounds are intermediates of the degradation of other compound groups delvin and harris 1984 demonstrated the possible oxidation pathways of aqueous phenol with dissolved oxygen devlin and harris 1984 they concluded that at elevated temperatures and in the presence of water oxidation might occur in three different reactions it can introduce an oxygen atom into an aromatic ring to form phenolics or quinones attack carbon to carbon double bonds to form carbonyl compounds and oxidise alcohols and carbonyl groups to form carboxylic acids at 300 and 350 c a fast decomposition of all the detected compound groups can be observed except for organic acids followed by the degradation of such acids after 30 and 10 min for 300 and 350 c respectively at 300 c only an incomplete degradation of the organic acids was observed after reaching 2 81 fold increase after 30 min the organic acids proportion reduce to 1 92 fold after 180 min at 350 c almost complete degradation of the organics acids was achieved revealing 8 4 of the initial area these results agree with the reduction of the vfas concentration previously shown in fig 2 n compounds and nas degrade into nh4 and nh3 as can be observed in fig 4 these by products are originated from the degradation of the organic nitrogen in the oxidation process by the oh radicals genç et al 2002 as shown in fig 5 the formation of ammonium increases at higher temperatures at 350 c after 180 min 704 5 mg l was quantified however after 60 min the increase was negligible at 250 and 300 c the ammonia release after 180 min presents similar results 600 0 and 607 5 mg l respectively however at 300 c the generation quickly increases in the first 60 min followed by a slower increase afterwards at 200 c the increase is steady through time the oxidation of ammonia under wet oxidation conditions has been investigated and complete oxidation requires the use of catalysts and supercritical conditions for example oe et al 2007 achieved 100 removal of nh3 under 590 c using a tubular ni alloy 625 reactor after 62 s oe et al 2007 as for vfas proportion of toc the nh4 nh3 portion of tn was calculated to understand better the decomposition of organic nitrogen compounds present in htl ap as shown in fig 6 the percentage of nh4 in the total nitrogen increased throughout time and with the increase of temperature this is a direct result of the degradation of n compounds and na before wo the htl ap contained a tn concentration of 685 mg l htl ap had 208 mg l of ammonium this corresponds to 23 6 of total nitrogen after the wo process the ammonium content increased reaching 91 9 of the tn at 350 c for 60 min this means that only 48 mg l correspond to n in other forms organic and inorganic the tn concentration reduces after 2 min of wo and remained stable afterwards minor variations at 200 c 2 min tn reduced to 610 mg l and at 350 c after 180 min rt the concentration was 595 mg l these low removals are related to the conversion of the organic nitrogen compounds into ammonium which is difficult to oxidize under the operational conditions investigated in the current study furthermore these concentrations do not comply with the european requirements for urban waste water treatment plants discharge of 15 mg l tn directive 1991 the high concentrations of nh4 nh3 has been found to have a significant harmful effect on a number of essential wastewater treatment processes including nitrification denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox enhanced biological phosphorus removal anaerobic process and sludge solubilisation liu et al 2019 however it can significantly improve biodegradability by promoting the nitrite pathway in the wastewater treatment process of secondary sludge increasing biological nutrient removal and enhance renewable energy production liu et al 2019 snowden swan et al 2017 investigate a conceptual design for biorefinery of hydrothermal liquefaction of wet waste suggesting possible pathways for htl ap ammonia removal or recovery via nh3 stripping membrane filtration and by biological methods such as anammox and nitrification denitrification snowden swan et al 2017 however when recovery of ammonia is performed for example by stripping the high cod values present in htl ap can lead to significant levels of organics in the ammonia stream turning the stripping by product unfeasible for nutrient recovery thus requiring prior treatment snowden swan et al 2021 wet oxidation can be an option for such treatment since it achieved high proportion of ammonia in tn and high reduction of cod and toc concentrations the ammonia produced by wo of htl ap could also be integrated with the struvite precipitation process ovsyannikova et al 2021 investigated the development of a struvite producing unit for nutrient recovery using the process water and leachate solids from htl achieving a product that contains more than 75 of struvite ovsyannikova et al 2021 munir et al 2019 investigated the integration of wet oxidation and struvite precipitation for sewage sludge treatment and phosphorus recovery concluding that the low concentration nh3 may have inhibited struvite formation during struvite precipitation munir et al 2019 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that wet oxidation could be an advantageous process for the treatment of htl ap the use of higher temperatures and longer residence times increases the cod and toc removal efficiencies the post wo water at 350 c and 180 min rt process contains 690 mg l cod 470 mg l toc 595 mg l of tn and 704 5 mg l of nh₄ the exothermic characteristic of wo reactions can generate up to 28 3 of the heat required for the reactions the minimum energy requirement per kg of cod removal is 9 6 kwh at 200 c for 180 min without taking into account any opportunities for heat recovery during the wo process wo can also be used as a pretreatment capable of converting complex organic compounds into acetic acid and at 350 c for 180 min almost complete degradation of organic compounds can be achieved nh4 and nh3 appear as a by product of the decomposition of organic nitrogenated compounds not being oxidised creating an opportunity for nutrients recovery declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16389,the composition of oxidant reactive dissolved organic nitrogen don is poorly characterized although its ozonation is likely to form a great variety of disinfection by products containing a nitrogen oxygen bond n dbps in this study two chemical oxidation procedures were developed continuous ozonation at ph 7 0 and free available chlorine fac titrations at ph 9 2 the formation of two oxidation products nitrate no 3 and chloramines respectively was used to quantify and characterize oxidant reactive nitrogenous moieties in don in addition batch experiments were conducted to study the no 3 yields of 30 selected nitrogenous model compounds upon ozonation the no 3 yields of 12 primary and secondary amines were highly variable 17 100 specific ozone dose of 20 molo3 moln 7 amino acids had high no 3 yields 90 and tertiary amines as well as pyrrole acetamide and urea had low no 3 yields 15 the mechanisms of no 3 formation were further examined with benzylamine and n methylbenzylamine as model compounds our results show that nitroalkanes are the last intermediate products before the formation of no 3 both for primary and secondary amines the presence of an electron withdrawing group in the vicinity of the n atom facilitates the formation of no 3 from nitroalkanes therefore the formation of no 3 is attributed to amino acids and activated primary and secondary amines in contrast all primary and secondary amines were transformed to chloramines upon chlorination which was determined by a novel oxidative titration with chlorine to further support the selectivity of this assay it was demonstrated by derivatization of amine moieties that chloramine formation could be inhibited 13 45 of the don of 4 dissolved organic matter isolates and 2 wastewater effluents formed no 3 and 0 39 formed chloramines indicating that the potential for n dbp formation is high µmn mgc level from differences in the formation of no 3 and chloramines the nature of the precursors can be hypothesized e g activated or non activated primary and secondary amines partially oxidized nitrogenous compounds this study highlights the capacity of two novel methods to

information is available on the formation of non halogenated n dbps during ozonation with knowledge gaps about i the don composition serving as n dbp precursors and ii the mechanisms of reactions between don moieties and ozone leading to the formation of n dbps the heterogeneous nature of the don constitutes a vast array of n dbp precursors don is a mostly unresolved heterogeneous mixture

sonntag 2000 zimmermann et al 2012 it has also been demonstrated that ozonation of some aliphatic amines dom isolates and wastewater effluents forms nitrate song et al 2017 de vera et al 2017 which is the endpoint of nitrogen oxidation however so far it is inconclusive which factors influence the nitrate formation yields comparatively organic primary and secondary amines in their neutral form react with chlorine to quickly form the corresponding chloramines by electrophilic substitution deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2017 wajon and morris 1982 at ph 7 organic amines exert significant second order rate constants for the reactions with chlorine 103 104 m 1s 1 heeb et al 2017 these chloramines can be detected by photometric methods targeting the total chlorine concentration aieta et al 1984 pinkernell et al 2000 which possibly enables a quantification of the total amine concentration in dom an assessment of the formation of n dbps during ozonation is therefore dependant on the understanding of the ozonation mechanisms and the nature of the precursors to overcome these difficulties new methods are required to identify and quantify the precursors of n dbps in don the aim of this study was to develop two novel assays using controlled oxidation conditions i free available chlorine fac titrations at ph 9 2 with the formation of chloramines and ii don oxidation to nitrate by ozonation at ph 7 0 these methods rely on the ph dependance of the apparent second order rate constants k app for the reaction of chlorine and ozone with the major functional groups in dom fig 1 a and b controlling the oxidation conditions can narrow down the diversity of target functional groups that react with the two selected oxidants chloramines and nitrate are two independent and easy to quantify parameters that are formed during the proposed controlled oxidations they gauge the potential of n dbp formation from the reactions of don with ozone these methods were optimized and tested with numerous model compounds four nom efom isolates and two wastewater samples furthermore a kinetic and mechanistic assessment of the nitrate formation during reactions of amines with ozone was

quantification of fac and total chlorine tc fac concentrations were measured by the dpd colorimetric method described elsewhere baird et al 2017 rodier et al 2016 dpd is oxidized by fac to the würster

assessment of the nitrate formation during ozonation of model compounds before measuring the nitrate formation during ozonation of dom efom samples the relevance and extent of nitrate as an oxidation end product had to be evaluated to strengthen the current mechanistic knowledge three aspects were studied with several model nitrogenous compounds 1 the temporal evolution of no 3 formation with 4 model amines kinetic experiments 2 the yields of no 3 formation with 30 model amines dosage experiments 3 the mechanisms of no 3 formation with 3 aliphatic amines dosage experiments 3 1 1 kinetics of nitrate formation from model amine compounds to study the evolution of nitrate during ozonation kinetic experiments were performed with ba mba l alanine and β alanine and the results were compared with previously published data for glycine de vera et al 2017 these compounds were chosen after evaluation of their apparent second order rate constants k app text s5 si at ph 7 which ranged over 2 orders of magnitude table s6 si o3 was completely consumed within 90 min for each of the compounds figure s2 si comparable to glycine under similar conditions de vera et al 2017 the ozone exposures were between 0 32 and 0 39 m s 256 312 mg min l but higher for β alanine 0 57 m s or 456 mg min l the second order rate constants for no 3 formation k f no 3 as defined in text s6 and figure s3 si and no 3 yields were determined based on the profiles of o3 decay and no 3 formation over time in fig 1c k app no 3 yields and k f no 3 are compared in parallel for the five target compounds clearly no correlation exists between k app and the no 3 yields nor between k app and k f no 3 this suggests that the nitrate formation kinetics and yields are not controlled by the initial ozone attack but by further reactions involving intermediate transformation products the chemical structures of these intermediates could be a key parameter controlling the kinetics of no 3 formation and yields during ozonation 3 1 2 nitrate yields of model amine compounds during ozonation amino acids eight amino acids with different side chains were studied seven of which showed 90 conversion to nitrate no 3 amino acid 0 with a molar ratio o 3 amino acid 0 20 fig 3 with one oxidant equivalent an average no 3 yield of 14 was observed for 6 amino acids this is only possible if some intermediate tps are more reactive towards ozone than the precursors because 1 molar equivalent of ozone is needed to transform an amine to nitrate exceptions were methionine and cysteine containing an ozone reactive sulfide or thiol group respectively which partially consume ozone via a fast reaction von sonntag and von gunten 2012 since the sulfoxides are ozone refractory the sulfur reaction pathway of methionine is completed for 1 molar equivalent of ozone therefore methionine showed a no 3 yield of 59 8 for a molar ratio o 3 methionine 0 5 which is similar to an average value of 53 for the other tested amino acids excluding cysteine a higher ozone demand for cysteine requiring more than 1 molar equivalent of ozone for completion was observed with no 3 yields of only 30 5 and 71 8 for molar ratios o 3 amino acid 0 5 and 20 respectively primary amines no 3 yields of nine structurally different primary amines were determined fig 3 in contrast to amino acids great variability was observed among the tested compounds ba 4 chlorobenzylamine and 4 nitrobenzylamine showed the highest no 3 yields 90 for o 3 amine 0 20 ethanolamine 2 phenylethylamine α methylamine and 3 phenyl 1 propylamine had intermediate yields 37 58 while ethylamine and β alanine had the lowest yields 20 since ethylamine differed from l alanine only by the absence of a carboxyl group on the α carbon and β alanine by a longer carbon chain it indicates that the carboxyl group in α position to the amino group might play an important role secondary amines secondary amines overall displayed a lower conversion to nitrate compared to primary amines fig 3 which could be due to the greater degree of dealkylation required which is not the main ozone reaction lim et al 2019 diethylamine n methylated ethylamine formed 16 6 no 3 for a molar ratio o 3 amine 0 20 similar to ethylamine 19 2 under the same conditions mba n methylated benzylamine 32 4 and sarcosine n methylated glycine 28 8 displayed an augmented no 3 yield compared to diethylamine 16 6 no 3 yields from secondary amines were equivocal and seemed to be structure dependent tertiary amines three tertiary amines n n dimethylbenzylamine tramadol and trimethylamine were ozonated with all showing small no 3 yields even at high specific ozone doses fig 3 other n containing functional groups due to the abundance of proteins and peptides in don the contribution of amides to nitrate formation was also explored two amide containing compounds were tested acetamide and diglycine gly gly for acetamide 2 yield of nitrate was obtained with a molar ratio o 3 acetamide 0 20 gly gly contains 2 moles of n per molecule peptide link and nh 2 terminus at a molar ratio o 3 gly gly 0 20 a no 3 yield of 50 was observed suggesting that the terminal nh2 group was fully converted to nitrate with no significant contribution from the amide group further compounds which make up significant fractions of don are urea and pyrrole urea which contributes 0 65 mean std 6 9 9 7 mol mol of the don pool in natural estuarine environments and 6 4 5 7 in riverine environments sipler and bronk 2015 formed almost no nitrate fig 3 pyrrole abundant in waters due to its presence in chlorophyll heme porphyrins histidine and tryptophan tekle röttering et al 2020 produced only 7 nitrate when oxidized with 20 molar equivalents of ozone 3 1 3 transformation products formation and mechanistic considerations our results suggest that the carbonyl group in α position stimulates no 3 formation from amino acids during ozonation consistent no 3 yields for the tested amino acids indicate a similar ozone oxidation pathway for all amino acids the formation of nitrate from glycine has been previously studied berger et al 1999 lim et al 2019 mccurry et al 2016 song et al 2017 de vera et al 2017 proposed mechanisms pass through several intermediates such as hydroxylamines oximes or nitro so alkanes decarboxylation and hydrolysis were proposed as mechanisms forming nitrate however the mechanisms of no 3 formation from primary secondary and tertiary amines during ozonation are still unclear and the observed variability in no 3 formation was initially unexpected to study these mechanisms in more detail oxidation cascades of ba mba and dmba were followed in batch dosages experiments ba yielded one of the highest no 3 yields among the selected primary amines fig 4 a shows the abatement of ba and the evolution of its tps at ph 7 for specific ozone doses from 0 to 20 molo3 moln the ba concentration decreased for molar ratios o3 ba 0 10 and was entirely abated at 10 molar equivalents of ozone for molar ratios o3 ba 0 5 the major tp was nitromethylbenzene max 76 of the abated ba whereas no 3 also rose rapidly already reaching 32 of the abated ba at a molar ratio o3 ba 3 nitromethylbenzene was a transient tp completely oxidized to no 3 with a yield of 91 at a molar ratio o3 ba 0 20 this indirectly supports the amine oxide pathway reactions i j and g in fig 4c as the main oxidation mechanism this pathway is also supported by sequentially increasing no 3 yields for benzylamine and nitromethylbenzene at molar ratios o3 ba 0 of 1 and 5 fig 3 benzaldehyde oxime nitromethylbenzene tautomer was part of the analytical method but not observed reaction k in fig 4c the nitrogen mass balance was 89 103 for all ozone doses which confirms that no major tps were missed although not measured nh 4 formation should consequently be minor disqualifying the electron transfer pathway reaction h in fig 4c these results contrasted with a recent study showing that the only tp of ethylamine ozonation was nitroethane tested molar ratios o3 ethylamine 0 0 3 and with a no 3 yield of only 10 for a 20 fold ozone excess lim et al 2019 another study also reported a complete transformation of methylamine to nitromethane at 12 molar equivalents of ozone mccurry et al 2016 batch dosage experiments demonstrated that nitromethylbenzene forms more no 3 than nitromethane fig 3 and we therefore hypothesize that electronic effects induction delocalization and resonance play a decisive role in reactivity differences the acid dissociation constant k a is the most informative parameter related to electron withdrawing effects encountered by an amine group as a function of the chemical groups in its vicinity schwarzenbach et al 2016 a strong positive correlation was observed between k a and no 3 formation yields for 6 primary amines text s7 si supporting our hypothesis the tp investigation for ba suggested that a c n bond scission occurred after the formation of the nitro intermediate although not available the α carbon s pk a should be influenced by the same factors as of the amine group a lower pk a could promote the formation of a carbanion allowing an ozone attack on the α carbon and resulting in a carbonyl type compound via an ozone adduct the latter could decompose resulting in the corresponding aldehyde and no 2 finally oxidized to no 3 by o3 our results suggest that the α carbon s pk a influences reaction g fig 4c to occur in turn controlling the primary amine no 3 yields this could possibly explain the observed heterogeneity in primary amine no 3 yields which is supported by the key role of the α carbon s pk a already observed for the formation of nitromethane from several n methylamines reaction d in fig 4c shi and mccurry 2020 mba was entirely abated with a molar ratio o3 mba 0 5 fig 4b at a molar ratio o3 mba 0 1 n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide represented 42 of the abated mba and nitromethane 31 with no contribution from nitrate or nitromethylbenzene in the range 1 o3 mba 0 5 three main tps were gradually formed n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide and nitromethane in parallel and nitromethylbenzene with some delay i e secondary tp n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide and nitromethylbenzene were only transient tps n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide has been suggested as an intermediate between mba and nitromethane shi and mccurry 2020 which was corroborated in this study by its buildup in the range 1 o 3 mba 0 3 followed by its abatement in the range 3 o 3 mba 0 10 nitromethane increased quantitatively with the abatement of n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide table s8 si at molar ratios o 3 mba 0 10 nitromethane concentration reached a plateau as n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide was depleted after a concentration peak at a molar ratio of o 3 mba 0 5 nitromethylbenzene was abated with an associated increase of the nitrate concentration as observed for ba and nitromethylbenzene was completely consumed at a molar ratio o 3 mba 0 15 at a molar ratio o 3 mba 0 20 the major final oxidation products were nitromethane 72 and nitrate 32 which complements recently published results on the ozonation of mba shi and mccurry 2020 no benzylamine was observed from the oxidation of mba disqualifying the electron transfer pathway for mba too reaction b fig 4c the mass balance was 92 107 for all ozone doses which confirms that no major tps are missing these observations suggest the occurrence of two oxidation pathways from the initially formed hydroxylamine reaction a fig 4c two distinct imine oxides r 1 cn r 2 o and r 1 n cr 2 o could be formed by oxygen and or electron transfer reactions reactions c d and e in fig 4c the transient imine oxides were further oxidized to the measured nitroalkanes via two possible c n bond cleavages reaction f fig 4c the final step is the nitroalkane oxidation to no 3 for which the yield is structure dependent as discussed above and shown in fig 3 for nitromethane and nitromethylbenzene in this case nitromethane was favoured over nitromethylbenzene for reasons discussed in text s8 si reaction f and the final no 3 yield was only 32 4 overall this is in line with the previously proposed pathway for the reaction of diethylamine with ozone for which however only one nitrone was observed because of the symmetry of the compound having 2 ethyl groups lim et al 2019 dmba was quantitatively transformed to its n oxide analogue with 1 molar ozone equivalent figure s4 si for higher ozone doses up to o3 dmba 0 5 only limited no 3 was formed 4 this is in agreement with previous studies lim et al 2019 muñoz et al 2001 zimmermann et al 2012 the mass balance was 100 106 for all ozone doses which confirmed that no major tps were missed 3 1 4 no 3 formation potential as a proxy for n dbp precursors based on these results the no 3 formation potential can be regarded as an estimate of the highly reactive species in don mainly activated primary and secondary amines and amino acids under realistic conditions e g in a wastewater treatment plant the formation of n dbps i e intermediate compounds in the n oxidation cascade can be formed whereas in our continuous ozonation system a large fraction of these specifically targeted intermediates such as nitro or nitroso compounds will be further oxidized to nitrate depending on their reactivity and susceptibility see figs 3 and 4 therefore nitrate formation during ozonation could be a potential proxy for the pool of reactive n dbp precursors similar approaches exist to estimate other dbp precursor concentrations baird et al 2017 mitch and sedlak 2004 however our approach may only cover part of the total pool of primary and secondary amines even at high ozone doses to overcome this potential underestimation we assessed a complimentary second approach based on a fac titration 3 2 assessment of the chloramine formation with oxidative fac titrations chloramines are quickly formed by the reaction of chlorine with amines deborde and von gunten 2008 therefore one could indirectly quantify n dbp precursors by quantifying chloramines with a non selective method dpd after reaction with increasing doses of chlorine this is the goal of the fac titrations to this end the oxidation conditions should maximize the formation of chloramines and minimize the consumption of chlorine by other reactive species at ph 9 2 chlorine reacts fast with primary and secondary amines as well as with activated phenolic compounds such as resorcinol fig 1b optimal reaction times have to be chosen to satisfy the chlorine demand of amine model compounds or amine moieties in dom which was done by kinetic simulations of a simple reaction amine hocl chloramine with k app ph 9 2 defined in text s9 si at several initial conditions 3 2 1 kinetic simulations and reaction time fig 1d shows the modeled time for a 99 abatement t 99 of 37 model amine compounds during chlorination fac 0 15 µm at ph 9 2 for 36 amines t 99 was smaller than 60 s for diisopropylamine a combination of high pk a 11 07 and relatively low k hocl 1 8 107 m 1s 1 leads to a longer t 99 of 139 s generally secondary amines have lower k hocl than primary amines but similar pk a values leading to higher t 99 amino acids have intermediate pk a values 9 54 10 10 and high k hocl 0 32 1 13 108 m 1s 1 yielding low t 99 finally peptidic structures enhance the reactivity of the terminal amine by decreasing the pk a 7 94 8 70 despite having k hocl values 0 6 1 26 107 m 1s 1 one order of magnitude lower than amino acids figure s5 si compares the calculated t 99 of the 37 selected model amines for 6 fac doses ranging between 10 and 40 µm typically used in the oxidative fac titration experiments in this study fac 0 amine 0 10 µm is the least favorable condition since 12 compounds mostly secondary amines had a t 99 120 s with a fac 0 12 µm only diisopropylamine had a t 99 120 s and all amines had a t 99 120 s for a fac 0 20 µm based on these observations a reaction time t r x of 120 s seemed reasonable for complex mixtures such as dom for the fac titrations of model compounds glycine methylamine and dimethylamine a t rx 60 s is sufficient based on calculations with the same model 3 2 2 boc 2o derivatization efficiency for primary and secondary amines derivatization efficiencies were 97 figure s6 table s9 si these results were comparable to already reported efficiencies einhorn et al 1991 mccurry et al 2016 in contrast derivatization had no significant effect on the measured concentrations of either four phenolic compounds and n n dimethylbenzylamine a tertiary amine p value 0 05 figure s11 si this indicates that the derivatization procedure does not alter the nature of phenolic moieties but only transforms primary and secondary amines to carbamates for benzylamine the formation of tert butyl benzylcarbamate was qualitatively confirmed by retention time comparison hplc uv with a commercial standard data not shown 3 2 3 oxidative fac titrations of model compounds fig 5 a c and table s9 si show the results of oxidative fac titrations for three amine model compounds glycine methylamine and dimethylamine amine 0 10 µm as a function of the chlorine doses fac 0 0 40 µm at ph 9 2 residual fac measurements resulted in two distinct phases the initial phase for fac doses 10µm was characterized by a full fac consumption the second phase showed a linear increase for fac doses 10 µm with slopes of regression lines of about 1 0 98 1 01 and intercepts close to 10 µm 9 10 10 91 µm which corresponds to the initial amine concentration in contrast corresponding tc measurements were characterized by a single linear phase with slopes of about 1 0 94 0 97 and intercepts not significantly different from zero table s9 si during the initial phase the total applied fac could be only measured as tc meaning that the applied fac was fully transformed to chloramine species thereafter a constant difference in µm was observed between the parallel regression lines of tc and fac fig 5a c a 1 1 stoichiometric ratio can be considered for the reaction between fac and amine moieties deborde and von gunten 2008 therefore the difference between the tc and fac regression model intercepts β fac and β tc respectively corresponds to the initial total concentration of precursor amines δ β β tc β fac chloramines t 60 s amines t 0 s to confirm δ β as a valid amine indicator the same three model amines were fac titrated for the same conditions but after boc 2o derivatization fig 5d f in contrast to non derivatized amines no δ β were observed table s9 si indicating that no chloramines were formed during chlorination identical slopes for fac and tc close to 1 also confirmed that the added fac remained unchanged in solution in presence of carbamate chlorine reactive phenolic compounds are present in dom at much higher concentrations than nitrogen containing species therefore their influence on oxidative fac titrations had to be tested phenol was selected as the simplest phenolic compound its apparent second order rate constant for the reaction with fac under the conditions of the oxidative fac titrations at ph 9 2 k app ph 9 2 78 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 is about 2 800 times lower than for glycine k app ph 9 2 2 2 105 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 fig 1b the oxidative fac titration of phenol resulted in slopes 1 for both regression lines figure s7a si this indicates that phenol partially consumes the applied fac dose resulting in this case in a constant fac t 60 s fac t 0 s ratio of about 2 3 independent of fac t 0 s a kinetic simulation was performed with the same conditions and based on known species specific second order rate constants for reaction of fac with the phenolate ion and its chlorophenolate ions which are formed upon chlorination table s10 si the kinetic simulation agreed well with the experimentally observed behavior of phenol during the oxidative fac titration figure s8 si in contrast no fac consumption was observed when 2 4 6 trimethylphenol was fac titrated since the three sites of possible fac attack in ortho and para positions are blocked by methyl groups figure s7b si furthermore experiments were performed with resorcinol benzene 1 3 diol figure s7c si a phenolic compound with significantly higher chlorine reactivity than phenol k app ph 9 2 2 0 104 m 1s 1 rebenne et al 1996 a large initial phase of about 25 µm as well as a slope of about 2 3 were observed for a reaction time of 60 s induced by both the rapid initial reaction of resorcinol with fac and slower subsequent reactions between fac and the ensuing products rebenne et al 1996 an equivalent right shift should occur on the fac and tc lines having no influence on δ β since no chloramines are formed from these compounds therefore non zero β tc are an indication of the presence of rapidly reacting phenolic type moieties based on these results δ β is proposed as a novel reliable parameter indirectly quantifying the total content of fast chlorine reactive nitrogen compounds in aqueous solutions this is a complementary indicator to the nitrate formation from ozonation discussed above 3 3 effects of controlled oxidative treatments on dom properties four standard nom efom isolates srfa srnom umrnom efom ch and two wastewater samples wwta and wwtb were subjected to continuous ozonation and fac titration experiments changes in dom bulk characteristics nitrate and chloramine formation and changes in optical properties occurring as a function of ozone chlorine treatment are discussed nitrate and chloramine formation were compared to the don content of each water sample wwta and wwtb had a don concentration of 1 30 0 37 mg n l 93 26 µm and 1 14 0 37 mg n l 80 26 µm respectively text s10 si compared to nom isolates wastewater samples had higher specific don concentrations fig 6 c these values are in the range of typical don concentration in wastewater effluents 3 3 1 nitrate formation an optimal don transformation to no 3 requires a large ozone excess i e 20 molo3 moln section 3 1 2 practically ozone exposures of about 0 32 0 57 m s 256 456 mg min l could be reached in batch experiments containing only one ozone reactive compound section 3 1 1 further increasing the ozone exposures in such systems is impracticable due to the maximum ozone concentration of the ozone stock solution for our setup i e 1 1 mm in dom containing solutions other faster reacting moieties e g phenolic compounds fig 1a can act as competing ozone consumers önnby et al 2018 lowering the ozone availability for nitrate formation for these reasons continuous ozonation experiments were developed in this study in solutions containing dom isolates or wastewater the laboratory system fig 2a enabled high ozone exposures for a contact time of 120 min i e 0 63 0 97 ms or 504 776 mg min l figure s9 si these are much higher than ozone exposures typically obtained in laboratory batch experiments with model water or wastewater effluents lee et al 2014 song et al 2017 de vera et al 2017 upon continuous ozonation a gradual no 3 production was observed for the four dom isolates but with different production rates fig 6a the no 3 production was biphasic with a short initial phase with a high rate followed by a second longer phase with a lower rate figure s9 si the maximum no 3 formation potential was defined as the specific no 3 concentration resulting after a reaction time of 120 min and represented 13 20 of the total don content fig 6c in the wastewater samples the background no 2 also contributed to the formation of no 3 text s11 si to assess the no 3 formation potential of the don matrix only the total no 3 formation potential was corrected for the initial no 2 concentration fig 6b the corrected no 3 production curves were also characterized by two phases figure s9 si separated by an intermediate plateau and finally plateaued at about 42 45 of their don content fig 6c 3 3 2 effects of continuous ozonation on dom optical properties fig 6d shows the normalized absorbance of the solution at 260 nm a 260 a 260 max tot as a function of time as monitored during continuous ozonation experiments this indicator is influenced by two factors i the water matrix absorbance a 260 w and ii the absorbance of dissolved ozone a 260 o 3 during the initial phase t r x 4 min a v shape evolution is visible insert fig 6d although a complete deconvolution of the signals is impossible i e a 260 w vs a 260 o 3 it can be qualitatively interpreted the descending branch is due to the initial decrease of dom absorbance between 40 s and 120 s whereas the ascending branch is attributed to the rapid ozone dissolution reaching its maximum i e a260 a260 max tot 1 after about 10 min the inflection point occurs at the moment where a 260 o 3 outcompetes a 260 w overall a 260 a 260 m ax tot profiles are similar for all samples the slowly decreasing phase observed after the maximum is due to the instability of the ozone generator without having an influence on the experiments moreover comparing a 260 a 260 max tot at t r x 0 s between isolates renders information about their relative initial absorbance srfa

continuous ozonation experiments this parameter decreased over time i e with increasing ozone exposure for the nom isolates a decrease of 30 occurred at the end of the initial descending branch 120 s before plateauing at about 40 25 for srfa of the initial a 260 w at t rx 10 min for wwta and wwtb the initial decrease was smaller about 20 and the final plateau occurred at about 50 of the initial a

revealed the presence of slower hocl consuming compounds which did not form chloramines for wastewater samples the background nh3 nh4 concentration also contributed to the formation of chloramines

mechanisms in dom fig 6f compares a 260 a 260 max tot and the specific no 3 formation for the 10 first minutes of the continuous ozonation experiments for the four isolates the no 3 formation started

si at higher doses fig 7 these observations experimentally confirm a step wise oxidation of electron rich moieties in dom which has been hypothesized by kinetic modeling buffle et al 2006 from a kinetic point of view this corresponds to two main steps occurring successively i oxidation of phenolic compounds ii oxidation of amine compounds fig 1a b decreases in suva254 have been correlated with the abatement of conjugated nom structures by cleavage of aromatic rings remucal et al 2020 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 weishaar et al 2003 wenk et al 2013 therefore the observed initial changes in optical properties i e initial descending a 260 a 260 m ax tot branch and fast initial decrease in a260 a260 0 w are most likely caused by oxidation of phenolic moieties further decreases in a260 a260 0 w may be attributed to ring cleavages of other aromatic structures reacting more slowly with ozone such as anisoles and polymethoxybenzenes which are structures present in lignin mvula et al 2009 by comparing the a260 a260 max tot profile of each isolate and the profile of a control solution containing no dom the initial ozone exposure consumed by phenolic compounds i e t r x 40 120 s could be calculated from which the concentration of abated phenolic compounds was estimated text s13 si this results in 0 74 1 09 µmolphoh mgc that were abated during this first phase independently of the total phenolic content figure s11 si β tc observed during fac titrations are in the same range 0 5 1 2 µmolphoh mgc figure s11 si suggesting that both assays also provide estimates for highly reactive phenolic compounds serving as dbp precursors mainly resorcinol hydroquinones and catechols as previously observed arnold et al 2008 jiang et al 2020 zhao et al 2012 the formation of nitrate reveals the presence of mineralizable nitrogenous moieties such as amino acids and activated primary and secondary amines section 3 1 2 the biphasic nature of the nitrate formation during ozonation suggests that various types of nitrogenous moieties were mineralized the first phase was systematically associated with a higher k f no 3 than the second phase figure s9 si according to the kinetic and dosage experiments with model compounds the first phase may be attributed to compounds forming nitrate quickly i e amino acids phase 1 in fig 6c with estimated second order rate constants k f no 3 in the range of 2 5 6 5 m 1s 1 which is similar to l alanine 7 1 m 1s 1 for instance the estimated content of fast reacting amine moieties in srfa was 0 07 µmoln mgc which corroborates well with a previously reported amino acid concentration 0 08 µmoln mgc averett et al 1994 for all isolates the first phase represented less than 10 of their total don content which is lower than for wwta and wwtb 25 fig 6c the second phase may be attributed to mineralizable primary and secondary amines phase 2 fig 6c with k f no 3 in the range of 0 1 0 3 m 1s 1 which is closer to β alanine 0 1 m 1s 1 or n methylbenzylamine 0 6 m 1s 1 comparatively the total content of amino acids and primary and secondary amines is quantified during fac titrations for srnom and umrnom the chloramine formation 40 of don fig 6c was higher than the nitrate formation 25 of don and the difference may be attributed to the fraction of primary and secondary amines which is not easily mineralized nevertheless this difference is still within a factor of two which is a reasonable overlap considering the different nature of the two assays although these moieties are not forming nitrate quantitatively i e not quantified by continuous ozonation they can still form n dbps such as nitroalkanes upon ozonation as was demonstrated in this study and in previous investigations lim et al 2019 for srfa and efom ch a low nitrate formation was observed i e 20 of don together with an absence of measurable chloramine formation fig 6c for srfa the absence of measurable δ β may be due to a too high loq for the fac titration method 0 5 µmoln mgc which is higher than the formation of nitrate measured during ozonation 0 19 µmoln mgc the kinetics of no 3 formation for efom ch were higher than for the other isolates fig 6a but closer to the wwta b samples this suggests that other compounds could be responsible for it such as partially oxidized biomolecules produced during biological wastewater treatment wwta and wwtb had low chloramine formation yields 5 11 and high no 3 yields 42 45 the initial nitrate formation kinetics is extremely high with k f no 3 in the range of 23 29 m 1s 1 these values are far above the k f no 3 for the probe compounds and suggest a direct formation from intermediate compounds the second phase is then again comparable to β alanine and n methylbenzylamine this suggests that 34 37 of their don is composed of moieties which are ozone reactive but not forming chloramines during chlorination they are therefore not amino acids or amines but could be partially oxidized nitrogenous compounds or other biomolecules formed during nitrification where n o containing compounds could be formed as a consequence the corresponding nitrogen containing moieties are not readily available for chlorination although being significant contributors to the n dbp formation potentials the exact nature of these species remains unknown nevertheless the behavior is in agreement with e g 4 nitrobenzylamine which was efficiently transformed to nitrate upon ozonation overall the novel approaches applied in this study show that ozone and fac titrations provide complimentary information for the characterization of dom in terms of potential n dbp precursors quantification and characterization in the tested samples up to 40 of the don is chlorine and or ozone reactive and serves as n dbp precursors furthermore there was a reasonable agreement between ozone and fac titrations regarding the fast reactive moieties in nom samples which may lead to c dbps finally our findings reveal clear differences between the selected nom efom isolates and the real water samples however no general conclusions can be drawn 3 5 practical implications previous laboratory scale studies mostly focused on the yields of n dbp formation from specific model compounds or standard nom sources under excess oxidant conditions which could lead to dbp overestimation under real oxidation conditions bond et al 2012 in the proposed approach a subtle change of perspective is proposed by focusing on the specific quantification of common oxidation products nitrate and chloramines formed upon controlled oxidation experiments with ozone or chlorine nitrate is the end product of the nitrogen oxidation cascade and our study demonstrates that intermediate n dbps are formed at lower ozone doses in that sense the nitrate formation is an unambiguous indicator of the n dbp formation potential because nitrate is formed only after extensive ozonation via intermediate tps this suggests that the fraction of don that can form undetected n dbps during ozonation is high in wwtp including an ozonation step moderate ozone doses are typically targeted 0 55 0 65 go3 gdoc bourgin et al 2018 it can be assumed that phenolic moieties consumed 0 02 0 21 go3 gdoc during the initial phase of continuous ozonation experiments text s13 si therefore a significant part of the applied ozone dose could subsequently oxidize don forming various n dbps even under realistic ozonation conditions fac titrations offer complimentary information about the nature of the n dbp precursors as not all primary and secondary amines form nitrate readily upon ozonation this permits to estimate the concentration of n dbp precursors present in a water sample also including primary and secondary amines which are only partially oxidized to e g nitroalkanes during ozonation 4 conclusion in this study kinetics and mechanisms of no 3 formation by the reaction of amine compounds with ozone have been studied with model compounds dom isolates and wastewater samples moreover a combination of two novel oxidation assays was developed and applied to better characterize the nature of oxidant reactive nitrogenous moieties in dom the following conclusions can be drawn molar no 3 yields of 30 nitrogenous model compounds have been determined in ozone dosage experiments at ph 7 with 20 molar equivalents of ozone amino acids and activated primary amines showed the highest yields 90 followed by other primary and secondary amines 20 50 and tertiary amines 15 this information can serve as a basis for a better understanding of reactivity of nitrogenous moieties in dom nitroalkanes are major intermediate tps in the oxidation cascade of primary and secondary amines e g nitromethylbenzene benzylamine and n methylbenzylamine and nitromethane n methylbenzylamine for secondary amines the formation of nitroalkane occurs by c n bond cleavage on nitrone intermediates e g n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide and n phenylmethylmethanimine oxide n methylbenzylamine the nitrate formation potential of a nitrogenous compound is not correlated to its apparent second order rate constant for the reaction with ozone but it is related to its chemical structure in particular the presence of an electron withdrawing group in the vicinity of the amine group promotes the formation of no 3 by decreasing the pk a value of the α carbon on intermediate nitroalkanes the formation of no 3 in nom efom and wastewater samples during continuous ozonation is biphasic the first phase is attributed to amino acids and the second phase to mineralizable primary and secondary amines as kinetically determined this is an effective way to characterize and quantify the don fraction which is ozone reactive this fraction was higher for wastewater samples than for nom efom isolates i e 40 vs 20 for wastewater samples the formation of no 3 was also faster fac titration is a complementary method used to reveal the formation of chloramines in nom efom or wastewater samples as a proxy for the total primary and secondary amine content for two nom isolates srnom and umrnom the don fraction which is chlorine reactive was higher than the don fraction which is ozone reactive i e 40 vs 20 this reveals the presence of primary and secondary amines which are not forming no 3 quantitatively but that can potentially form nitroalkanes in contrast wastewater samples had higher ozone reactive don fractions than chlorine reactive fractions i e 40 vs 11 revealing the presence of partially oxidized nitrogenous compounds with a n o bond formed during nitrification these observations highlight the good complementarity of both assays in deconvoluting the composition of the don pool oxidant reactive phenolic compound concentrations could also be estimated by both methods and were in the range 0 5 1 2 µmolphoh mgc for the nom efom isolates overall the tested samples had a significant oxidant reactive don fraction up to 45 which could lead to the formation of µm levels of potentially toxic n dbps such as nitro compounds during ozonation of drinking water or wastewater the presented assays can help to gauge this level for specific water samples a post chlorination could potentially lead to the formation of toxic halonitro compounds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16389,the composition of oxidant reactive dissolved organic nitrogen don is poorly characterized although its ozonation is likely to form a great variety of disinfection by products containing a nitrogen oxygen bond n dbps in this study two chemical oxidation procedures were developed continuous ozonation at ph 7 0 and free available chlorine fac titrations at ph 9 2 the formation of two oxidation products nitrate no 3 and chloramines respectively was used to quantify and characterize oxidant reactive nitrogenous moieties in don in addition batch experiments were conducted to study the no 3 yields of 30 selected nitrogenous model compounds upon ozonation the no 3 yields of 12 primary and secondary amines were highly variable 17 100 specific ozone dose of 20 molo3 moln 7 amino acids had high no 3 yields 90 and tertiary amines as well as pyrrole acetamide and urea had low no 3 yields 15 the mechanisms of no 3 formation were further examined with benzylamine and n methylbenzylamine as model compounds our results show that nitroalkanes are the last intermediate products before the formation of no 3 both for primary and secondary amines the presence of an electron withdrawing group in the vicinity of the n atom facilitates the formation of no 3 from nitroalkanes therefore the formation of no 3 is attributed to amino acids and activated primary and secondary amines in contrast all primary and secondary amines were transformed to chloramines upon chlorination which was determined by a novel oxidative titration with chlorine to further support the selectivity of this assay it was demonstrated by derivatization of amine moieties that chloramine formation could be inhibited 13 45 of the don of 4 dissolved organic matter isolates and 2 wastewater

information is available on the formation of non halogenated n dbps during ozonation with knowledge gaps about i the don composition serving as n dbp precursors and ii the mechanisms of reactions between don moieties and ozone leading to the formation of n dbps the heterogeneous nature of the don constitutes a vast array of n dbp precursors don is a mostly unresolved heterogeneous mixture

the endpoint of nitrogen oxidation however so far it is inconclusive which factors influence the nitrate formation yields comparatively organic primary and secondary amines in their neutral form react with chlorine to quickly form the corresponding chloramines by electrophilic substitution deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2017 wajon and morris 1982 at ph 7 organic amines exert significant second order rate constants for the reactions with chlorine 103 104 m 1s 1 heeb et al 2017 these chloramines can be detected by photometric methods targeting the total chlorine concentration aieta et al 1984 pinkernell et al 2000 which possibly enables a quantification of the total amine concentration in dom an assessment of the formation of n dbps during ozonation is therefore dependant on the understanding of the ozonation mechanisms and the nature of the precursors to overcome these difficulties new methods are required to identify and quantify the precursors of n dbps in don the aim of this study was to develop two novel assays using controlled oxidation conditions i free available chlorine fac titrations at ph 9 2 with the formation of chloramines and ii don oxidation to nitrate by ozonation at ph 7 0 these methods rely on the ph dependance of the apparent second order rate constants k app for the reaction of chlorine and ozone with the major functional groups in dom fig 1 a and b controlling the oxidation conditions can narrow down the diversity of target functional groups that react with the two selected oxidants chloramines and nitrate are two independent and easy to quantify parameters that are formed during the proposed controlled oxidations they gauge the potential of n dbp formation from the reactions of don with ozone these methods were optimized and tested

assessment of the nitrate formation during ozonation of model compounds before measuring the nitrate formation during ozonation of dom efom samples the relevance and extent of nitrate as an oxidation end product had to be evaluated to strengthen the current mechanistic knowledge three aspects were studied with several model nitrogenous compounds 1 the temporal evolution of no 3 formation with 4 model amines kinetic experiments 2 the yields of no 3 formation with 30 model amines dosage experiments 3 the mechanisms of no 3 formation with 3 aliphatic amines dosage experiments 3 1 1 kinetics of nitrate formation from model amine compounds to study the evolution of nitrate during ozonation kinetic experiments were performed with ba mba l alanine and β alanine and the results were compared with previously published data for glycine de vera et al 2017 these compounds were chosen after evaluation of their apparent second order rate constants k app text s5 si at ph 7 which ranged over 2 orders of magnitude table s6 si o3 was completely consumed within 90 min for each of the compounds figure s2 si comparable to glycine under similar conditions de vera et al 2017 the ozone exposures were between 0 32 and 0 39 m s 256 312 mg min l but higher for β alanine 0 57 m s or 456 mg min l the second order rate constants for no 3 formation k f no 3 as defined in text s6 and figure s3 si and no 3 yields were determined based on the profiles of o3 decay and no 3 formation over time in fig 1c k app no 3 yields and k f no 3 are compared in parallel for the five target compounds clearly no correlation exists between k app and the no 3 yields nor between k app and k f no 3 this suggests that the nitrate formation kinetics and yields are not controlled by the initial ozone attack but by further reactions involving intermediate transformation products the chemical structures of these intermediates could be a key parameter controlling the kinetics of no 3 formation and yields during ozonation 3 1 2 nitrate yields of model amine compounds during ozonation amino acids eight amino acids with different side chains were studied seven of which showed 90 conversion to nitrate no 3 amino acid 0 with a molar ratio o 3 amino acid 0 20 fig 3 with one oxidant equivalent an average no 3 yield of 14 was observed for 6 amino acids this is only possible if some intermediate tps are more reactive towards ozone than the precursors because 1 molar equivalent of ozone is needed to transform an amine to nitrate exceptions were methionine and cysteine containing an ozone reactive sulfide or thiol group respectively which partially consume ozone via a fast reaction von sonntag and von gunten 2012 since the sulfoxides are ozone refractory the sulfur reaction pathway of methionine is completed for 1 molar equivalent of ozone therefore methionine showed a no 3 yield of 59 8 for a molar ratio o 3 methionine 0 5 which is similar to an average value of 53 for the other tested amino acids excluding cysteine a higher ozone demand for cysteine requiring more than 1 molar equivalent of ozone for completion was observed with no 3 yields of only 30 5 and 71 8 for molar ratios o 3 amino acid 0 5 and 20 respectively primary amines no 3 yields of nine structurally different primary amines were determined fig 3 in contrast to amino acids great variability was observed among the tested compounds ba 4 chlorobenzylamine and 4 nitrobenzylamine showed the highest no 3 yields 90 for o 3 amine 0 20 ethanolamine 2 phenylethylamine α methylamine and 3 phenyl 1 propylamine had intermediate yields 37 58 while ethylamine and β alanine had the lowest yields 20 since ethylamine differed from l alanine only by the absence of a carboxyl group on the α carbon and β alanine by a longer carbon chain it indicates that the carboxyl group in α position to the amino group might play an important role secondary amines secondary amines overall displayed a lower conversion to nitrate compared to primary amines fig 3 which could be due to the greater degree of dealkylation required which is not the main ozone reaction lim et al 2019 diethylamine n methylated ethylamine formed 16 6 no 3 for a molar ratio o 3 amine 0 20 similar to ethylamine 19 2 under the same conditions mba n methylated benzylamine 32 4 and sarcosine n methylated glycine 28 8 displayed an augmented no 3 yield compared to diethylamine 16 6 no 3 yields from secondary amines were equivocal and seemed to be structure dependent tertiary amines three tertiary amines n n dimethylbenzylamine tramadol and trimethylamine were ozonated with all showing small no 3 yields even at high specific ozone doses fig 3 other n containing functional groups due to the abundance of proteins and peptides in don the contribution of amides to nitrate formation was also explored two amide containing compounds were tested acetamide and diglycine gly gly for acetamide 2 yield of nitrate was obtained with a molar ratio o 3 acetamide 0 20 gly gly contains 2 moles of n per molecule peptide link and nh 2 terminus at a molar ratio o 3 gly gly 0 20 a no 3 yield of 50 was observed suggesting that the terminal nh2 group was fully converted to nitrate with no significant contribution from the amide group further compounds which make up significant fractions of don are urea and pyrrole urea which contributes 0 65 mean std 6 9 9 7 mol mol of the don pool in natural estuarine environments and 6 4 5 7 in riverine environments sipler and bronk 2015 formed almost no nitrate fig 3 pyrrole abundant in waters due to its presence in chlorophyll heme porphyrins histidine and tryptophan tekle röttering et al 2020 produced only 7 nitrate when oxidized with 20 molar equivalents of ozone 3 1 3 transformation products formation and mechanistic considerations our results suggest that the carbonyl group in α position stimulates no 3 formation from amino acids during ozonation consistent no 3 yields for the tested amino acids indicate a similar ozone oxidation pathway for all amino acids the formation of nitrate from glycine has been previously studied berger et al 1999 lim et al 2019 mccurry et al 2016 song et al 2017 de vera et al 2017 proposed mechanisms pass through several intermediates such as hydroxylamines oximes or nitro so alkanes decarboxylation and hydrolysis were proposed as mechanisms forming nitrate however the mechanisms of no 3 formation from primary secondary and tertiary amines during ozonation are still unclear and the observed variability in no 3 formation was initially unexpected to study these mechanisms in more detail oxidation cascades of ba mba and dmba were followed in batch dosages experiments ba yielded one of the highest no 3 yields among the selected primary amines fig 4 a shows the abatement of ba and the evolution of its tps at ph 7 for specific ozone doses from 0 to 20 molo3 moln the ba concentration decreased for molar ratios o3 ba 0 10 and was entirely abated at 10 molar equivalents of ozone for molar ratios o3 ba 0 5 the major tp was nitromethylbenzene max 76 of the abated ba whereas no 3 also rose rapidly already reaching 32 of the abated ba at a molar ratio o3 ba 3 nitromethylbenzene was a transient tp completely oxidized to no 3 with a yield of 91 at a molar ratio o3 ba 0 20 this indirectly supports the amine oxide pathway reactions i j and g in fig 4c as the main oxidation mechanism this pathway is also supported by sequentially increasing no 3 yields for benzylamine and nitromethylbenzene at molar ratios o3 ba 0 of 1 and 5 fig 3 benzaldehyde oxime nitromethylbenzene tautomer was part of the analytical method but not observed reaction k in fig 4c the nitrogen mass balance was 89 103 for all ozone doses which confirms that no major tps were missed although not measured nh 4 formation should consequently be minor disqualifying the electron transfer pathway reaction h in fig 4c these results contrasted with a recent study showing that the only tp of ethylamine ozonation was nitroethane tested molar ratios o3 ethylamine 0 0 3 and with a no 3 yield of only 10 for a 20 fold ozone excess lim et al 2019 another study also reported a complete transformation of methylamine to nitromethane at 12 molar equivalents of ozone mccurry et al 2016 batch dosage experiments demonstrated that nitromethylbenzene forms more no 3 than nitromethane fig 3 and we therefore hypothesize that electronic effects induction delocalization and resonance play a decisive role in reactivity differences the acid dissociation constant k a is the most informative parameter related to electron withdrawing effects encountered by an amine group as a function of the chemical groups in its vicinity schwarzenbach et al 2016 a strong positive correlation was observed between k a and no 3 formation yields for 6 primary amines text s7 si supporting our hypothesis the tp investigation for ba suggested that a c n bond scission occurred after the formation of the nitro intermediate although not available the α carbon s pk a should be influenced by the same factors as of the amine group a lower pk a could promote the formation of a carbanion allowing an ozone attack on the α carbon and resulting in a carbonyl type compound via an ozone adduct the latter could decompose resulting in the corresponding aldehyde and no 2 finally oxidized to no 3 by o3 our results suggest that the α carbon s pk a influences reaction g fig 4c to occur in turn controlling the primary amine no 3 yields this could possibly explain the observed heterogeneity in primary amine no 3 yields which is supported by the key role of the α carbon s pk a already observed for the formation of nitromethane from several n methylamines reaction d in fig 4c shi and mccurry 2020 mba was entirely abated with a molar ratio o3 mba 0 5 fig 4b at a molar ratio o3 mba 0 1 n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide represented 42 of the abated mba and nitromethane 31 with no contribution from nitrate or nitromethylbenzene in the range 1 o3 mba 0 5 three main tps were gradually formed n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide and nitromethane in parallel and nitromethylbenzene with some delay i e secondary tp n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide and nitromethylbenzene were only transient tps n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide has been suggested as an intermediate between mba and nitromethane shi and mccurry 2020 which was corroborated in this study by its buildup in the range 1 o 3 mba 0 3 followed by its abatement in the range 3 o 3 mba 0 10 nitromethane increased quantitatively with the abatement of n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide table s8 si at molar ratios o 3 mba 0 10 nitromethane concentration reached a plateau as n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide was depleted after a concentration peak at a molar ratio of o 3 mba 0 5 nitromethylbenzene was abated with an associated increase of the nitrate concentration as observed for ba and nitromethylbenzene was completely consumed at a molar ratio o 3 mba 0 15 at a molar ratio o 3 mba 0 20 the major final oxidation products were nitromethane 72 and nitrate 32 which complements recently published results on the ozonation of mba shi and mccurry 2020 no benzylamine was observed from the oxidation of mba disqualifying the electron transfer pathway for mba too reaction b fig 4c the mass balance was 92 107 for all ozone doses which confirms that no major tps are missing these observations suggest the occurrence of two oxidation pathways from the initially formed hydroxylamine reaction a fig 4c two distinct imine oxides r 1 cn r 2 o and r 1 n cr 2 o could be formed by oxygen and or electron transfer reactions reactions c d and e in fig 4c the transient imine oxides were further oxidized to the measured nitroalkanes via two possible c n bond cleavages reaction f fig 4c the final step is the nitroalkane oxidation to no 3 for which the yield is structure dependent as discussed above and shown in fig 3 for nitromethane and nitromethylbenzene in this case nitromethane was favoured over nitromethylbenzene for reasons discussed in text s8 si reaction f and the final no 3 yield was only 32 4 overall this is in line with the previously proposed pathway for the reaction of diethylamine with ozone for which however only one nitrone was observed because of the symmetry of the compound having 2 ethyl groups lim et al 2019 dmba was quantitatively transformed to its n oxide analogue with 1 molar ozone equivalent figure s4 si for higher ozone doses up to o3 dmba 0 5 only limited no 3 was formed 4 this is in agreement with previous studies lim et al 2019 muñoz et al 2001 zimmermann et al 2012 the mass balance was 100 106 for all ozone doses which confirmed that no major tps were missed 3 1 4 no 3 formation potential as a proxy for n dbp precursors based on these results the no 3 formation potential can be regarded as an estimate of the highly reactive species in don mainly activated primary and secondary amines and amino acids under realistic conditions e g in a wastewater treatment plant the formation of n dbps i e intermediate compounds in the n oxidation cascade can be formed whereas in our continuous ozonation system a large fraction of these specifically targeted intermediates such as nitro or nitroso compounds will be further oxidized to nitrate depending on their reactivity and susceptibility see figs 3 and 4 therefore nitrate formation during ozonation could be a potential proxy for the pool of reactive n dbp precursors similar approaches exist to estimate other dbp precursor concentrations baird et al 2017 mitch and sedlak 2004 however our approach may only cover part of the total pool of primary and secondary amines even at high ozone doses to overcome this potential underestimation we assessed a complimentary second approach based on a fac titration 3 2 assessment of the chloramine formation with oxidative fac titrations chloramines are quickly formed by the reaction of chlorine with amines deborde and von gunten 2008 therefore one could indirectly quantify n dbp precursors by quantifying chloramines with a non selective method dpd after reaction with increasing doses of chlorine this is the goal of the fac titrations to this end the oxidation conditions should maximize the formation of chloramines and minimize the consumption of chlorine by other reactive species at ph 9 2 chlorine reacts fast with primary and secondary amines as well as with activated phenolic compounds such as resorcinol fig 1b optimal reaction times have to be chosen to satisfy the chlorine demand of amine model compounds or amine moieties in dom which was done by kinetic simulations of a simple reaction amine hocl chloramine with k app ph 9 2 defined in text s9 si at several initial conditions 3 2 1 kinetic simulations and reaction time fig 1d shows the modeled time for a 99 abatement t 99 of 37 model amine compounds during chlorination fac 0 15 µm at ph 9 2 for 36 amines t 99 was smaller than 60 s for diisopropylamine a combination of high pk a 11 07 and relatively low k hocl 1 8 107 m 1s 1 leads to a longer t 99 of 139 s generally secondary amines have lower k hocl than primary amines but similar pk a values leading to higher t 99 amino acids have intermediate pk a values 9 54 10 10 and high k hocl 0 32 1 13 108 m 1s 1 yielding low t 99 finally peptidic structures enhance the reactivity of the terminal amine by decreasing the pk a 7 94 8 70 despite having k hocl values 0 6 1 26 107 m 1s 1 one order of magnitude lower than amino acids figure s5 si compares the calculated t 99 of the 37 selected model amines for 6 fac doses ranging between 10 and 40 µm typically used in the oxidative fac titration experiments in this study fac 0 amine 0 10 µm is the least favorable condition since 12 compounds mostly secondary amines had a t 99 120 s with a fac 0 12 µm only diisopropylamine had a t 99 120 s and all amines had a t 99 120 s for a fac 0 20 µm based on these observations a reaction time t r x of 120 s seemed reasonable for complex mixtures such as dom for the fac titrations of model compounds glycine methylamine and dimethylamine a t rx 60 s is sufficient based on calculations with the same model 3 2 2 boc 2o derivatization efficiency for primary and secondary amines derivatization efficiencies were 97 figure s6 table s9 si these results were comparable to already reported efficiencies einhorn et al 1991 mccurry et al 2016 in contrast derivatization had no significant effect on the measured concentrations of either four phenolic compounds and n n dimethylbenzylamine a tertiary amine p value 0 05 figure s11 si this indicates that the derivatization procedure does not alter the nature of phenolic moieties but only transforms primary and secondary amines to carbamates for benzylamine the formation of tert butyl benzylcarbamate was qualitatively confirmed by retention time comparison hplc uv with a commercial standard data not shown 3 2 3 oxidative fac titrations of model compounds fig 5 a c and table s9 si show the results of oxidative fac titrations for three amine model compounds glycine methylamine and dimethylamine amine 0 10 µm as a function of the chlorine doses fac 0 0 40 µm at ph 9 2 residual fac measurements resulted in two distinct phases the initial phase for fac doses 10µm was characterized by a full fac consumption the second phase showed a linear increase for fac doses 10 µm with slopes of regression lines of about 1 0 98 1 01 and intercepts close to 10 µm 9 10 10 91 µm which corresponds to the initial amine concentration in contrast corresponding tc measurements were characterized by a single linear phase with slopes of about 1 0 94 0 97 and intercepts not significantly different from zero table s9 si during the initial phase the total applied fac could be only measured as tc meaning that the applied fac was fully transformed to chloramine species thereafter a constant difference in µm was observed between the parallel regression lines of tc and fac fig 5a c a 1 1 stoichiometric ratio can be considered for the reaction between fac and amine moieties deborde and von gunten 2008 therefore the difference between the tc and fac regression model intercepts β fac and β tc respectively corresponds to the initial total concentration of precursor amines δ β β tc β fac chloramines t 60 s amines t 0 s to confirm δ β as a valid amine indicator the same three model amines were fac titrated for the same conditions but after boc 2o derivatization fig 5d f in contrast to non derivatized amines no δ β were observed table s9 si indicating that no chloramines were formed during chlorination identical slopes for fac and tc close to 1 also confirmed that the added fac remained unchanged in solution in presence of carbamate chlorine reactive phenolic compounds are present in dom at much higher concentrations than nitrogen containing species therefore their influence on oxidative fac titrations had to be tested phenol was selected as the simplest phenolic compound its apparent second order rate constant for the reaction with fac under the conditions of the oxidative fac titrations at ph 9 2 k app ph 9 2 78 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 is about 2 800 times lower than for glycine k app ph 9 2 2 2 105 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 fig 1b the oxidative fac titration of phenol resulted in slopes 1 for both regression lines figure s7a si this indicates that phenol partially consumes the applied fac dose resulting in this case in a constant fac t 60 s fac t 0 s ratio of about 2 3 independent of fac t 0 s a kinetic simulation was performed with the same conditions and based on known species specific second order rate constants for reaction of fac with the phenolate ion and its chlorophenolate ions which are formed upon chlorination table s10 si the kinetic simulation agreed well with the experimentally observed behavior of phenol during the oxidative fac titration figure s8 si in contrast no fac consumption was observed when 2 4 6 trimethylphenol was fac titrated since the three sites of possible fac attack in ortho and para positions are blocked by methyl groups figure s7b si furthermore experiments were performed with resorcinol benzene 1 3 diol figure s7c si a phenolic compound with significantly higher chlorine reactivity than phenol k app ph 9 2 2 0 104 m 1s 1 rebenne et al 1996 a large initial phase of about 25 µm as well as a slope of about 2 3 were observed for a reaction time of 60 s induced by both the rapid initial reaction of resorcinol with fac and slower subsequent reactions between fac and the ensuing products rebenne et al 1996 an equivalent right shift should occur on the fac and tc lines having no influence on δ β since no chloramines are formed from these compounds therefore non zero β tc are an indication of the presence of rapidly reacting phenolic type moieties based on these results δ β is proposed as a novel reliable parameter indirectly quantifying the total content of fast chlorine reactive nitrogen compounds in aqueous solutions this is a complementary indicator to the nitrate formation from ozonation discussed above 3 3 effects of controlled oxidative treatments on dom properties four standard nom efom isolates srfa srnom umrnom efom ch and two wastewater samples wwta and wwtb were subjected to continuous ozonation and fac titration experiments changes in dom bulk characteristics nitrate and chloramine formation and changes in optical properties occurring as a function of ozone chlorine treatment are discussed nitrate and chloramine formation were compared to the don content of each water sample wwta and wwtb had a don concentration of 1 30 0 37 mg n l 93 26 µm and 1 14 0 37 mg n l 80 26 µm respectively text s10 si compared to nom isolates wastewater samples had higher specific don concentrations fig 6 c these values are in the range of typical don concentration in wastewater effluents 3 3 1 nitrate formation an optimal don transformation to no 3 requires a large ozone excess i e 20 molo3 moln section 3 1 2 practically ozone exposures of about 0 32 0 57 m s 256 456 mg min l could be reached in batch experiments containing only one ozone reactive compound section 3 1 1 further increasing the ozone exposures in such systems is impracticable due to the maximum ozone concentration of the ozone stock solution for our setup i e 1 1 mm in dom containing solutions other faster reacting moieties e g phenolic compounds fig 1a can act as competing ozone consumers önnby et al 2018 lowering the ozone availability for nitrate formation for these reasons continuous ozonation experiments were developed in this study in solutions containing dom isolates or wastewater the laboratory system fig 2a enabled high ozone exposures for a contact time of 120 min i e 0 63 0 97 ms or 504 776 mg min l figure s9 si these are much higher than ozone exposures typically obtained in laboratory batch experiments with model water or wastewater effluents lee et al 2014 song et al 2017 de vera et al 2017 upon continuous ozonation a gradual no 3 production was observed for the four dom isolates but with different production rates fig 6a the no 3 production was biphasic with a short initial phase with a high rate followed by a second longer phase with a lower rate figure s9 si the maximum no 3 formation potential was defined as the specific no 3 concentration resulting after a reaction time of 120 min and represented 13 20 of the total don content fig 6c in the wastewater samples the background no 2 also contributed to the formation of no 3 text s11 si to assess the no 3 formation potential of the don matrix only the total no 3 formation potential was corrected for the initial no 2 concentration fig 6b the corrected no 3 production curves were also characterized by two phases figure s9 si separated by an intermediate plateau and finally plateaued at about 42 45 of their don content fig 6c 3 3 2 effects of continuous ozonation on dom optical properties fig 6d shows the normalized absorbance of the solution at 260 nm a 260 a 260 max tot as a function of time as monitored during continuous ozonation experiments this indicator is influenced by two factors i the water matrix absorbance a 260 w and ii the absorbance of dissolved ozone a 260 o 3 during the initial phase t r x 4 min a v shape evolution is visible insert fig 6d although a complete deconvolution of the signals is impossible i e a 260 w vs a 260 o 3 it can be qualitatively interpreted the descending branch is due to the initial decrease of dom absorbance between 40 s and 120 s whereas the ascending branch is attributed to the rapid ozone dissolution reaching its maximum i e a260 a260 max tot 1 after about 10 min the inflection point occurs at the moment where a 260 o 3 outcompetes a 260 w overall a 260 a 260 m ax tot profiles are similar for all samples the slowly decreasing phase observed after the maximum is due to the instability of the ozone generator without having an influence on the experiments moreover comparing a 260 a 260 max tot at t r x 0 s between isolates renders information about their relative initial absorbance srfa umrnom srnom efom ch in agreement with their suva254 table s2 si fig 6e shows the relative changes of absorbance at 260 nm of the water matrix a 260 a 260 0 w as a function of time during the same continuous ozonation experiments this parameter decreased over time i e with increasing ozone exposure for the nom isolates a decrease of 30 occurred at the end of the initial descending branch 120 s before plateauing at about 40 25 for srfa of the initial a 260 w at t rx 10 min for wwta and wwtb the initial decrease was smaller about 20 and the final plateau occurred at about 50 of the initial a 260 w value 3 3 3 chloramine formation oxidative fac titrations of the four dom isolates doc 5 mgc l were carried out with a reaction time of 120 s for srnom and umrnom fig 7 a c significant δ β were observed i e 0 68 and 1 32 µmolhocl mgc respectively indicating that 38 39 of their specific don content formed chloramines upon oxidative fac titration fig 6c the same oxidative fac titrations performed after derivatization showed no significant δ β figure s10 si confirming that δ β consists of chlorine reactive nitrogen containing compounds which form chloramines for srfa the fulvic acid fraction of srnom and efom ch the hydrophobic fraction of the sampled efom no significant δ β were observed fig 7b and d a fac slope of 0 80 0 84 i e 1 table s9 si for the four tested isolates revealed the presence of slower hocl consuming compounds which did not form chloramines for wastewater samples the background nh3 nh4 concentration also contributed to the formation of chloramines text s12 si wolfe et al 1984 to assess the chloramine formation potential of the don matrix only the total chloramine formation potentials fig 7e f were corrected for the initial nh3 nh4 concentrations after correction wwta and wwtb showed significant δ β of 1 31 11 of the don content and 0 79 µµmolhocl mgc 5 respectively fig 6c 3 4 characterization of dbp precursors and oxidation mechanisms in dom fig 6f compares a 260 a 260 max tot and the specific no 3 formation for the 10 first minutes of the continuous ozonation experiments for the four isolates the no 3 formation started only after completion of the initial descending branch of a 260 a 260 max tot similarly two steps could be observed during fac titrations of the four isolates i a complete hocl consumption at lower doses i e significant β tc table s9 si without formation of chloramines and ii chloramines formation i e significant δ β table s9 si and or slow chlorine consumption i e fac and tc slopes 1 table s9 si at higher doses fig 7 these observations experimentally confirm a step wise oxidation of electron rich moieties in dom which has been hypothesized by kinetic modeling buffle et al 2006 from a kinetic point of view this corresponds to two main steps occurring successively i oxidation of phenolic compounds ii oxidation of amine compounds fig 1a b decreases in suva254 have been correlated with the abatement of conjugated nom structures by cleavage of aromatic rings remucal et al 2020 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 weishaar et al 2003 wenk et al 2013 therefore the observed initial changes in optical properties i e initial descending a 260 a 260 m ax tot branch and fast initial decrease in a260 a260 0 w are most likely caused by oxidation of phenolic moieties further decreases in a260 a260 0 w may be attributed to ring cleavages of other aromatic structures reacting more slowly with ozone such as anisoles and polymethoxybenzenes which are structures present in lignin mvula et al 2009 by comparing the a260 a260 max tot profile of each isolate and the profile of a control solution containing no dom the initial ozone exposure consumed by phenolic compounds i e t r x 40 120 s could be calculated from which the concentration of abated phenolic compounds was estimated text s13 si this results in 0 74 1 09 µmolphoh mgc that were abated during this first phase independently of the total phenolic content figure s11 si β tc observed during fac titrations are in the same range 0 5 1 2 µmolphoh mgc figure s11 si suggesting that both assays also provide estimates for highly reactive phenolic compounds serving as dbp precursors mainly resorcinol hydroquinones and catechols as previously observed arnold et al 2008 jiang et al 2020 zhao et al 2012 the formation of nitrate reveals the presence of mineralizable nitrogenous moieties such as amino acids and activated primary and secondary amines section 3 1 2 the biphasic nature of the nitrate formation during ozonation suggests that various types of nitrogenous moieties were mineralized the first phase was systematically associated with a higher k f no 3 than the second phase figure s9 si according to the kinetic and dosage experiments with model compounds the first phase may be attributed to compounds forming nitrate quickly i e amino acids phase 1 in fig 6c with estimated second order rate constants k f no 3 in the range of 2 5 6 5 m 1s 1 which is similar to l alanine 7 1 m 1s 1 for instance the estimated content of fast reacting amine moieties in srfa was 0 07 µmoln mgc which corroborates well with a previously reported amino acid concentration 0 08 µmoln mgc averett et al 1994 for all isolates the first phase represented less than 10 of their total don content which is lower than for wwta and wwtb 25 fig 6c the second phase may be attributed to mineralizable primary and secondary amines phase 2 fig 6c with k f no 3 in the range of 0 1 0 3 m 1s 1 which is closer to β alanine 0 1 m 1s 1 or n methylbenzylamine 0 6 m 1s 1 comparatively the total content of amino acids and primary and secondary amines is quantified during fac titrations for srnom and umrnom the chloramine formation 40 of don fig 6c was higher than the nitrate formation 25 of don and the difference may be attributed to the fraction of primary and secondary amines which is not easily mineralized nevertheless this difference is still within a factor of two which is a reasonable overlap considering the different nature of the two assays although these moieties are not forming nitrate quantitatively i e not quantified by continuous ozonation they can still form n dbps such as nitroalkanes upon ozonation as was demonstrated in this study and in previous investigations lim et al 2019 for srfa and efom ch a low nitrate formation was observed i e 20 of don together with an absence of measurable chloramine formation fig 6c for srfa the absence of measurable δ β may be due to a too high loq for the fac titration method 0 5 µmoln mgc which is higher than the formation of nitrate measured during ozonation 0 19 µmoln mgc the kinetics of no 3 formation for efom ch were higher than for the other isolates fig 6a but closer to the wwta b samples this suggests that other compounds could be responsible for it such as partially oxidized biomolecules produced during biological wastewater treatment wwta and wwtb had low chloramine formation yields 5 11 and high no 3 yields 42 45 the initial nitrate formation kinetics is extremely high with k f no 3 in the range of 23 29 m 1s 1 these values are far above the k f no 3 for the probe compounds and suggest a direct formation from intermediate compounds the second phase is then again comparable to β alanine and n methylbenzylamine this suggests that 34 37 of their don is composed of moieties which are ozone reactive but not forming chloramines during chlorination they are therefore not amino acids or amines but could be partially oxidized nitrogenous compounds or other biomolecules formed during nitrification where n o containing compounds could be formed as a consequence the corresponding nitrogen containing moieties are not readily available for chlorination although being significant contributors to the n dbp formation potentials the exact nature of these species remains unknown nevertheless the behavior is in agreement with e g 4 nitrobenzylamine which was efficiently transformed to nitrate upon ozonation overall the novel approaches applied in this study show that ozone and fac titrations provide complimentary information for the characterization of dom in terms of potential n dbp precursors quantification and characterization in the tested samples up to 40 of the don is chlorine and or ozone reactive and serves as n dbp precursors furthermore there was a reasonable agreement between ozone and fac titrations regarding the fast reactive moieties in nom samples which may lead to c dbps finally our findings reveal clear differences between the selected nom efom isolates and the real water samples however no general conclusions can be drawn 3 5 practical implications previous laboratory scale studies mostly focused on the yields of n dbp formation from specific model compounds or standard nom sources under excess oxidant conditions which could lead to dbp overestimation under real oxidation conditions bond et al 2012 in the proposed approach a subtle change of perspective is proposed by focusing on the specific quantification of common oxidation products nitrate and chloramines formed upon controlled oxidation experiments with ozone or chlorine nitrate is the end product of the nitrogen oxidation cascade and our study demonstrates that intermediate n dbps are formed at lower ozone doses in that sense the nitrate formation is an unambiguous indicator of the n dbp formation potential because nitrate is formed only after extensive ozonation via intermediate tps this suggests that the fraction of don that can form undetected n dbps during ozonation is high in wwtp including an ozonation step moderate ozone doses are typically targeted 0 55 0 65 go3 gdoc bourgin et al 2018 it can be assumed that phenolic moieties consumed 0 02 0 21 go3 gdoc during the initial phase of continuous ozonation experiments text s13 si therefore a significant part of the applied ozone dose could subsequently oxidize don forming various n dbps even under realistic ozonation conditions fac titrations offer complimentary information about the nature of the n dbp precursors as not all primary and secondary amines form nitrate readily upon ozonation this permits to estimate the concentration of n dbp precursors present in a water sample also including primary and secondary amines which are only partially oxidized to e g nitroalkanes during ozonation 4 conclusion in this study kinetics and mechanisms of no 3 formation by the reaction of amine compounds with ozone have been studied with model compounds dom isolates and wastewater samples moreover a combination of two novel oxidation assays was developed and applied to better characterize the nature of oxidant reactive nitrogenous moieties in dom the following conclusions can be drawn molar no 3 yields of 30 nitrogenous model compounds have been determined in ozone dosage experiments at ph 7 with 20 molar equivalents of ozone amino acids and activated primary amines showed the highest yields 90 followed by other primary and secondary amines 20 50 and tertiary amines 15 this information can serve as a basis for a better understanding of reactivity of nitrogenous moieties in dom nitroalkanes are major intermediate tps in the oxidation cascade of primary and secondary amines e g nitromethylbenzene benzylamine and n methylbenzylamine and nitromethane n methylbenzylamine for secondary amines the formation of nitroalkane occurs by c n bond cleavage on nitrone intermediates e g n methyl 1 phenylmethanimine oxide and n phenylmethylmethanimine oxide n methylbenzylamine the nitrate formation potential of a nitrogenous compound is not correlated to its apparent second order rate constant for the reaction with ozone but it is related to its chemical structure in particular the presence of an electron withdrawing group in the vicinity of the amine group promotes the formation of no 3 by decreasing the pk a value of the α carbon on intermediate nitroalkanes the formation of no 3 in nom efom and wastewater samples during continuous ozonation is biphasic the first phase is attributed to amino acids and the second phase to mineralizable primary and secondary amines as kinetically determined this is an effective way to characterize and quantify the don fraction which is ozone reactive this fraction was higher for wastewater samples than for nom efom isolates i e 40 vs 20 for wastewater samples the formation of no 3 was also faster fac titration is a complementary method used to reveal the formation of chloramines in nom efom or wastewater samples as a proxy for the total primary and secondary amine content for two nom isolates srnom and umrnom the don fraction which is chlorine reactive was higher than the don fraction which is ozone reactive i e 40 vs 20 this reveals the presence of primary and secondary amines which are not forming no 3 quantitatively but that can potentially form nitroalkanes in contrast wastewater samples had higher ozone reactive don fractions than chlorine reactive fractions i e 40 vs 11 revealing the presence of partially oxidized nitrogenous compounds with a n o bond formed during nitrification these observations highlight the good complementarity of both assays in deconvoluting the composition of the don pool oxidant reactive phenolic compound concentrations could also be estimated by both methods and were in the range 0 5 1 2 µmolphoh mgc for the nom efom isolates overall the tested samples had a significant oxidant reactive don fraction up to 45 which could lead to the formation of µm levels of potentially toxic n dbps such as nitro compounds during ozonation of drinking water or wastewater the presented assays can help to gauge this level for specific water samples a post chlorination could potentially lead to the formation of toxic halonitro compounds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
