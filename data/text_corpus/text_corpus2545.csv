12725,with the extensive detection of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args in drinking water treatment plants the safety of drinking water has received increased attention therefore the distribution and removal of antibiotics and args in drinking water systems require further investigation in this study nine typical antibiotics nine args and one integron in two drinking water plants were investigated by high pressure liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses sulfonamides were the dominant antibiotic in the two drinking water treatment plants wp a and wp b the removal effect of advanced water treatment on total antibiotic concentration was significantly higher than that of conventional treatment sul gene was the dominant gene in the raw water of the two plants after undergoing different treatment units the finished water in wp a and wp b exhibited sul gene concentrations of 54 06 genes ml and 67 9 genes ml respectively in the conventional treatment process adding a sand filtration unit before the flocculation unit can improve the removal efficiency of antibiotics and args in the advanced treatment process the post ozonization unit using the strong oxidation of o3 could effectively remove antibiotics and args although the activated carbon unit can effectively remove antibiotics the removal effect of args is poor chlorination has a poor effect on the removal of antibiotics but it can effectively remove args this study can provide a basis for understanding the fate of antibiotics and args in drinking water systems keywords antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes ozone activated carbon water treatment plant removal efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have been increasingly detected in the aquatic environment therefore the health and safety concerns arising from the presence of drugs and ppcps in drinking water have attracted increasing attention 1 antibiotics are one of the most representative pollutants in ppcps the concentration of tetracycline antibiotics in drinking water in the lower reaches of the yangtze river in china ranges from 11 16 ng l to 56 ng l 2 the concentration of antibiotics in chongqing china ranged from 20 6 ng l to 188 1 ng l 3 the abuse of antibiotics leads to antibiotic pollution and accumulation in the environment this causes selective pressures on bacteria resulting in the formation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb 4 and consequently the production of args 5 some studies have pointed out that 11 types of args have been detected in the water sources of shanghai and the average concentration range was approximately 3 66 101 1 62 105 copy ml 6 the args in arb can be transmitted within and between species through vertical and horizontal gene transfer 7 moreover even though ozone can inactivate arb cell the dna carrying args can exist for a long time in the deoxynuclease therefore the persistence and easy spread of args will become a hidden danger are a major impact of environmental pollution caused by antibiotics 8 and highly relevant to ecological and human health the drinking water treatment process is an important potential route of exposure to antibiotics and args in humans 9 recently researchers have increasingly focused on the removal of antibiotics and args from drinking water using various treatment processes stackelberg et al found that granular activated carbon filtration can effectively remove erythromycin from water 10 song et al studied the removal efficiency of antibiotics in different water treatment plants and found that the flocculation unit contributed to a superior removal performance in one treatment plant while the disinfection process played an important role in another plant 11 hu et al found that compared with the conventional process the advanced process can effectively improve the removal efficiency of sulfonamide antibiotics moreover pre flocculation sedimentation and sand filtration are effective methods to reduce args in water 12 the spread of antibiotics and args in drinking water system poses a significant threat to human health however most studies focus on the distribution of antibiotics or args in drinking water or only on the removal of a class of antibiotics and args in drinking water treatment ignoring the antibiotic and arg removal effects and mechanisms in different treatment units therefore the removal mechanism of antibiotics and args by different drinking water treatment processes must be further investigated this study focused on the distribution of sulfonamides tetracyclines macrolides and quinolones including nine antibiotics sulfamethoxydiazine sulfameter sulfamerazine ofloxacin enrofloxacin tetracycline oxytetracycline erythromycin and roxithromycin nine args sul1 sul2 erma ermb qnrd qnrs tetm teto and tetw and one integron inti in two drinking water plants and compared the differences in antibiotic removal and args by different conventional treatment techniques simultaneously the effect and mechanism of advanced treatment on the removal of antibiotics and args were explored thus the study aimed to provide a basis for understanding the fate of antibiotics and args in drinking water systems 2 material and methods 2 1 drinking water treatment plants and sample collection in october 2020 samples were collected from drinking water treatment plants a and b wp a and wp b in wuhan city china both wp a and wp b used the same water source hanjiang river for the experiments 2 l water samples were collected by a water collector in wp a samples were collected from the raw water rw

standards were purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh germany the substitutes used were sulfamethoxazole d4 sulfamethazine 13c6 thiabendazole d4 ciprofloxacin d8 and erythromycin 13c d3 all the substitutes were purchased from toronto research chemicals company while the internal standard atrazine 13c3 was purchased from dr ehrenstorfer all standard solutions were stored at 20 c the solid phase extraction column 500 mg 6 ml was purchased from waters usa and the chromatographic pure reagents such as methanol acetonitrile and formic acid were purchased from thermo fisher technology china co ltd 2 3 sample pretreatment for the pretreatment of water samples 0 5 g edta and 0 3 g ascorbic acid were added to a 1 l water sample the solution was thoroughly shaken the ph was adjusted to 2 3 with concentrated sulfuric acid and then 0 45 g ascorbic acid was added a volume of 1000 μl water sample was filtered using a cellulose acetate membrane to remove impurities and 10 μl substitute solution was added to the filtered sample and mixed an oasis hlb solid phase extraction column waters usa was used to extract a concentrated solution before pretreatment the extraction column was activated with 10 ml methanol and 10 ml millipore water after the water sample was filtered at a flow rate of 10 15 ml min the column was immediately washed with 10 ml millipore water and dried by purging with nitrogen then 10 ml methanol was used as eluent at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min and collected in a 10 ml glass tube the collected eluent was blown dry using nitrogen in a water bath at 40 c and 10 μl internal standard solution was added and made up the volume to 1 ml the samples were filtered by the organic phase filter membrane 0 45 μm cellulose acetate and stored in dark at 20 c before operation the methanol in the sample was replaced by the initial mobile phase the used membrane was cut into small fragments and placed in the powerbead tubes of fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa to isolate bacterial genomic dna before dna extraction and analysis the membrane fragments were stored at 80 c 2 4 quantification of antibiotics and args real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr of args was performed using a rapid real time pcr system jena qtower2 2 germany the qpcr system included 10 μl chamq universal sybr qpcr master mix 0 4 μl positive

threshold cyclic ct was considered to be valid data between 20 and 35 and the absolute abundance of args and 16srdna was calculated the reduction of args and 16srdna in this article is calculated by the following formula reduction log c1 c2 c1 and c2 are absolute concentrations of genes all figures are drawn by origin2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of antibiotics and args in raw and finished water 3 1 1 distribution of antibiotics in raw and finished water the removal effect of antibiotics in different drinking water treatment processes was determined by analyzing the concentration of antibiotics in rw and fw water in wp a and wp b the concentrations of antibiotics in the two water plants are summarized in table 1 nine antibiotics were tested in the rw of wp a and wp b and the detection rate for sulfonamides was 100 with smd accounting for the highest concentration followed by smx this may be due to the existence of livestock and aquaculture farms along the hanjiang river which commonly use sulfonamides and result in the high content of this group of antibiotics in the water source 13 moreover sulfonamides are hydrophilic and chemically stable with good environmental migration ability and can easily migrate to rivers during the rainy season resulting in their high contents in raw water 14 however enr and ofl were scarcely detected which may be because quinolones are readily adsorbed on the surface of solid particles resulting in a small amount of these antibiotics in the aqueous phase 15 tetracyclines are among the most widely used antibiotics in poultry breeding 16 however they are easily adsorbed onto particles and sediments and readily undergo hydrolysis or photolysis in water therefore the content of tetracyclines in the aqueous phase was low 17 in addition macrolides exhibited a low concentration in the aquatic environment because of their low water solubility high adsorption capacity to sediments and rapid conversion to biotransformation products through biodegradation or photodegradation 18 erythromycin is unstable in water and can be rapidly converted into dehydrated products 1 because the rw of both wp a and wp b originated from the same river the distribution of antibiotics in the rw was similar but the removal efficiency of antibiotics in the two water plants was different in wp a the detection rate of antibiotics was 55 6 with removal rates of 100 for sd and tc and less than 50 for smx smd and rox the detection rate of antibiotics in wp b was 66 7 with removal rates of 100 in sd tc and enr and more than 60 in smx smd and rox these differences may be due to the addition of advanced treatment processes including po and ac in wp b the advanced treatment process can effectively remove antibiotics from the water thereby reducing the concentration of antibiotics in the water treatment plants 3 1 2 distribution of args in raw and finished water in recent years args have often been detected in drinking water treated by water treatment plants arising widespread public concern table 2 lists the concentrations and removal rates of nine args inti and 16s rdna in the rw and fw of wp a and wp b although the water sources of both wp a and wp b originate from the same river the contents of args varied due to the different water intake points nine args and one mobile genetic element were detected in the rw of the two drinking water treatment plants in wp a the absolute concentration range of args and inti were 3 31 10 1 to 3 05 105 gene ml and 8 102 gene ml with sul1 exhibiting the lowest concentration and sul2 the highest concentration the sul gene was the dominant gene in wp a accounting for 99 3 of the total args in wp b the absolute concentration range of args and inti were 4 06 101 to 7 44 103 gene ml and 1 103 gene ml additionally sul gene was the dominant gene in wp b accounting for 81 5 of the total args the reason for the high abundance of sul gene may be that it is collected on mobile genetic elements which can improve the transmission and persistence of the gene in the aqueous environment 19 in addition in the process of preventing and controlling covid 19 the use of drugs rose sharply even some patients with mild symptoms used drugs at home and these drugs also entered natural water bodies including the yangtze river basin the concentration range of antibiotics is 2 61 1122 ng l which causes a selection pressure leading to an increased abundance of resistance genes in the water 20 overall the removal efficiency of wp a and wp b for most args ranged from 0 2 to 4 8 log however some args such as sul1 0 2 log ermb 1 1 log qnrs 0 8 log tetm 0 2 log and tetw 0 8 log exhibited significant negative growth in wp a this shows that the conventional treatment processes of wp a and wp b have limited effect on the removal of args thus the surface water treated by drinking water treatment processes is facing the risk of severe args pollution 3 2 removal of antibiotics and args by conventional treatment processes 3 2 1 comparison of wp a and wp b conventional processes for antibiotic removal the antibiotic concentrations in each unit of the conventional treatment process for wp a and wp b are presented in fig 2 different conventional treatment processes are found to have different removal effects on antibiotics the removal rate of total antibiotics in wp a was 36 11 while that in wp b was 31 76 in the rw flo process of wp a five types of antibiotics were detected the total antibiotic concentration decreased from 23 66 ng l to 14 06 ng l and the removal rate reached 40 57 the removal rate of rox was 45 82 followed by that of tc 44 66 this may be because rox and tc are readily adsorbed onto the sediments 21 in addition the addition of coagulant during the coagulation process leads to an increase in the ph while under alkaline conditions this promotes the negatively charged tc to attract active substances thus improving the degradation effect 22 in the sf the removal efficiencies of sd 95 96 and rox 49 29 were higher than the other antibiotics and the removal rates of smx smd and tc were less than 30 however the total removal rate of antibiotics in the sf was higher than that in the subsequent st and thus sf can effectively reduce the antibiotic load in the sedimentation tank in the process of rw flo the removal efficiency of wp b to total antibiotics was only 3 02 while that of wp a reached 28 64 this may be the reason that flo can remove inorganic particles and tetracyclines with strong adsorption capacities moreover in wp a the sf unit is set in front of flo unit which can remove some pollutants and improve subsequent flocculation effect and increase the removal effect of lipophilic antibiotics therefore the sf can effectively promote the removal of antibiotics in the flo st process the removal efficiency of antibiotics in wp a ranged from 22 to 70 additionally flo st had the maximum contribution in the removal of tc according to the structural characteristics of tc the hydrophobic bis tetraphenylbenzene skeleton can easily interact with the surface of solid particles resulting in its removal from the solid to the aqueous phase 11 the same phenomenon was observed in wp b implying that flocculation and sedimentation process cannot effectively eliminate hydrophilic compounds with low octanol water partition coefficient logkow values and high solubilities 23 this is also confirmed by the low removal efficiencies of sd smx and smd less than 30 in wp a and wp b during the filtration process the removal efficiencies of total antibiotics were poor in wp a and wp b less than 10 however the removal of efficiency in wp b was better than that in wp a because of the longer backwash time the backwash time of the dvf is longer than that of the vf resulting in the better adsorption performance of the filter material in the dvf than that of the vf in wp a thus backwashing can affect the performance of the filter unit in removing antibiotics the conventional treatment processes of the two treatment plants have a similar effect on the removal of total antibiotics in wp b the st improves the removal effect of antibiotics compared with wp b the removal effect is better in wp a when a sand filter is added before the st as the antibiotic load can be effectively reduced by sf this indicates that both the sf and st can effective removal of antibiotics 3 2 2 comparison of conventional processes in wp a and wp b in removing resistance genes the percentages and log reduction of the absolute concentration change in args during the conventional treatment processes in wp a and wp b are shown in fig 3 after treatment by the sf unit in wp a other args in the water increased by 0 16 3 88 log except for sul2 and erma the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen and total phosphorus increased after the treatment in sf as it induces the formation of biofilms on the filtration materials 24 moreover inti increases during the sf process which also poses the risk of horizontal gene transfer of args 25 furthermore aging biofilms that fall off from the filtration materials increase the concentration of args therefore the backwashing time and effect determine the effect of arg removal by sf the flo units can effectively remove the args in both wp a and wp b after treatment in the flo unit in wp a the args decreased by 0 16 log which was significantly lower than that of wp b 0 63 log this may be due to the solid liquid separation effect in the sf that removes the microorganisms adsorbed on the particle phase and reduces the content of intracellular args by reducing arb in the aqueous phase 26 this phenomenon might be the reason for the limited removal of args by flo in wp a both wp a and wp b use polyaluminum ferric chloride as coagulant which could produce positively charged flocculent particles with iron aluminum hydroxide in wp a the dosage of coagulant is 16 93 mg l and in wp b it is 39 08 mg l these particles can interact with negatively charged arb via electrostatic attraction to remove arb and reduce args 27 the coagulants could directly combine with extracellular args in water and finally remove the args through precipitation although the removal efficiency by flo is not high after sf unit in wp a the combined removal efficiency of args by sf and flo units is significantly higher than that in wp b this further shows that sf processes can effectively improve the removal efficiency of args sedimentation tanks are used in the treatment process to precipitate the large particle impurities and flocs in the water to the bottom of the tank through physical action the absolute abundance of args was reduced after the st treatment in wp a and wp b and decreased by 0 04 log and 0 24 log respectively in particular sul2 was the easiest to remove in wp a which decreased by 0 67 log while the removal effect of erma in wp b was the best 0 60 log this may be due to the different water quality in wp a and wp b which cause the discrepancy of types of args removal the decline in 16s rdna could explain the reduction of args achieved by decreasing the arb in water 12 in addition a few args increased in wp a and wp b during precipitation which might be due to the strong hydraulic agitation generated by the sludge discharge machine at the bottom of the sedimentation tank this causes the args adsorbed on the flocs to return to the water phase resulting in the increase of args 12 the v type filter was used in wp a and thus the abundance of most args increased by 0 2 3 6 log only four genes sul2 erma ermb and qnrd decreased by 0 06 0 36 log and the inti gene was reduced by 0 59 log in wp b the absolute abundances of erma tetd and tetw increased by 0 15 log 0 15 log and 0 06 log respectively in contrast the absolute abundance of the other args decreased by 0 01 0 15 log thus the removal effect of args by the filters in the two water treatment plants was not ideal this may be because most of the intracellular args were removed during precipitation but the shape flexibility of extracellular args which often exist in the form of transposons integrons and plasmids 28 increases their ability to pass through the filter 29 3 3 removal of antibiotics and args by advanced treatment processes 3 3 1 effect and analysis of antibiotic removal by advanced treatment table 3 shows the antibiotic concentration and removal rate in po bac fw epw unit compared with the conventional treatment process advanced treatment can effectively improve the removal efficiency of antibiotics ozone oxidation is widely considered an effective method to remove antibiotics due to the strong oxidizing effect of ozone it can react with compounds with carbon carbon double bonds 30 and the hydroxyl radicals produced by ozone decomposition in water do not selectively oxidize pollutants in water 10 in wp b the ozone dosage of po unit is 1 5 mg l the removal rates of sd tc enr and rox were higher than 40 furthermore tc was no longer detected in the water after treatment in the po unit therefore po is a promising method to remove tetracycline antibiotics 11 the increase in chemical oxygen demand after the po unit indicated that the biodegradability was slightly improved which also confirmed the degradation of some antibiotics 23 however in the study by yaru et al the removal of the sas were above 80 14 which significantly higher than that of po in wp b this may be due to the low ozone dosage in the po process in wp b causing only the partial degradation of antibiotics simultaneously the concentration of organic pollutants entering the po unit reaches 0 372 mg l which will also react with ozone and hydroxyl radicals forming a competitive relationship with the parent antibiotic and further inhibiting the removal of antibiotics furthermore ph can also affect the oxidation effect of ozone the ph of the po unit is alkaline which promotes the production of hydroxyl radicals 31 and the degradation rate increases with the increase in ph therefore alkaline water conditions are conducive to the removal of antibiotics by low concentration ozone 32 thus the ozone dosage and ph are important factors to determine the degradation efficiency of antibiotics additionally hydraulic retention time affects the removal of antibiotics by ozone in wp b the hydraulic retention time of po unit is only 10 min and the limitation of reaction time will also lead to the poorer efficacy of ozone in removing antibiotics at the same time the bubble type of ozone will also have an impact compared with millibubble ultrafine bubble have more advantages in removing antibiotics 33 ultrafine bubble increase the contact surface between ozone and pollutants increase the contact points and then increase the removal effect therefore when removing antibiotics in po unit ultrafine bubble can be used to improve the removal rate the removal efficiency of smd and smx in the po unit was 25 33 and 26 30 respectively which was less than 30 indicating that the removal efficiency of po units was limited this result is similar to the findings of guo et al 34 the removal rate of smx was only 51 after treatment in the po unit for 30 min the low removal efficiency of smx may be because the double bonds and aromatic rings are primarily oxidized by ozone 35 at ph 7 smx exists in the anionic form and develop electrostatic repulsion with hydroxyl radicals 34 which means the removal of smx relies on ozone simultaneously ozone can directly attack the benzene ring and cause the straight chain reaction 36 however ozone will be converted to produce hydroxyl radicals in water which will also lead to low ozone concentration thereby limiting the removal effect of smx similar to the research results of hu et al the removal effect of po unit on smd is poor yaru et al showed that the removal rate of smd in the ozonation unit was less than 40 and the removal effect of smd in the flocculation and sedimentation process was better than that of the po unit thus smd may be effectively removed by strengthening flocculation 14 after the flo unit treatment the removal effect of smd reached 28 81 which was higher than that of the po unit which also showed that the ozone and hydroxyl radical of po unit could not effectively oxidize smd in water but the removal effect was more effective in the form of flocculation the removal efficiency of the ac unit for all antibiotics was more than 30 wherein that of enr was the highest 53 69 followed by sd 50 60 the removal of trace organics by this process is mainly realized by the adsorptive capacity of ac and the formation of biofilm on the ac surface 23 which is conducive to the adsorption of organics the different logkow values of different antibiotics also lead to different adsorption effects of ac for different antibiotics 37 furthermore enr is a microorganism that is difficult to biodegrade 38 so its removal in the ac unit mainly depends on the physical adsorption of ac the lipophilicity of sulfonamides antibiotics is poor which is not easy to be adsorbed by ac therefore sd mainly depends on the degradation and removal of microorganisms however there are disadvantages through biodegradation in ac unit the residual antibiotics and some chemical substances on the biofilm may have a co selection effect on args leading to the expression of args 39 in addition the contact time can affect the removal effect of antibiotics prolonging the contact time can increase the number of available absorption sites 40 some studies show that the maximum adsorption capacity of ac to smx can reach 217 mg g without interference of other impurities 41 however in the actual biological activated carbon bac unit due to the complex water quality various organic pollutants will compete with the adsorption of antibiotics and the concentration of antibiotics in the actual water body only reaches the level of ng l which will greatly reduce the adsorption effect of ac to antibiotics in the study of bac improvement xu et al studied the removal effect of ac zero valent iron amended bioretention cells on smx and tc the results showed that the removal effect of ac zero valent iron modified bioretention cells was significantly higher than that of ac 42 this also shows that the removal effect of antibiotics can be improved by optimizing ac for bac units 3 3 2 effect and analysis of advanced treatment on removing args table 4 shows the log reduction and abundance of args in po bac fw epw unit in po unit except erma and tetw the other args increased by 0 07 0 59 log this result is similar to that reported by su et al that the absolute abundance of teta tetm tetw cfr cmla qnrb and qnrs increased after ozone treatment 43 a high concentration of ozone can destroy the cell proteins to increase the permeability of the cell membrane which is conducive to the release of args in cells and leads to the transfer of intracellular args to extracellular genes 44 the transfer of intracellular args to the extracellular space will directly lead to the increase of args in aqueous phase although o3 and hydroxyl radicals produced by its hydrolysis can oxidize the dna molecules carrying extracellular args organic compounds with double or unsaturated bonds in the aqueous phase can also consume the oxidizing substances in the water forming a competitive relationship with args and limiting the oxidation effect 45 in addition the limited mass transfer affects the efficiency of ozone transfer from the gas to liquid phase and then limits the concentration of ozone in liquid phase 46 in the actual po unit the removal of args is accompanied by a trace amount of antibiotics and the trace amount of antibiotics and the intermediate products produced in the process of ozone oxidation induce the drug resistance and sublethal stress reaction mechanism of arb which can make it resist the oxidation of ozone than non resistant microorganisms 47 at the same time it has also been shown that oxidative stress can induce the transfer of args in arb during ozone treatment 48 thereby increasing the abundance of args in the environment therefore for the removal of args in water by ozone it is necessary to consider increasing the dosage of ozone in water not only to inactivate the arb present but also to damage the dna of the arb to reduce the abundance of args in water the research has shown that when the concentration of o3 is 2 mg l the removal efficiency of sulfonamide args is only 34 5 49 2 49 however zhuang et al found that the removal rate of args increased significantly when the ozone concentration was increased to 61 mg l 50 this shows that the change of o3 concentration will also affect the removal effect of args the effect of ac on the removal of args was not significant and the change in the removal efficiency of args was between 0 15 log and 0 15 log which is similar to the result of yaru et al 12 51 meanwhile the removal rate of sul1 was 0 26 log which was similar to the results obtained by zhang et al who reported a removal rate of 0 3 log for sul1 52 the biofilm formed on ac during the treatment could partially adsorb the arb to reduce intracellular args in the aqueous phase 53 however the abundance of arb on the biofilm can facilitate the occurrence of horizontal and vertical gene transfers 54 which leads to the increase in args the increase in the inti concentration after ac treatment promotes bacterial reconciliation leading to the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer 55 simultaneously there is a risk that biofilm can fall into the water leading to an increase of microorganisms in the water resulting in a poor removal effect of args 56 in addition su et al found that compared with powdered activated carbon filtration pac granular activated carbon filtration almost did not remove args 43 which indicated that the type of ac also affects the removal efficiency of args in the actual bac unit the removal effect of bac is mainly improved by backwashing however some studies have shown that the relative abundance and absolute abundance of args in the bac unit after backwashing are rising and the accumulation of such args may be caused by the horizontal transfer of genes 57 3 4 removal of antibiotics and args by disinfection 3 4 1 effect and analysis of antibiotic removal by disinfection the rate of antibiotic removal by disinfection in wp a ranged from 1 to 6 in the disinfection process in wp b the removal rate of antibiotics was 4 100 and sd was not detected in the water after chlorine disinfection the removal efficiency of wp b was significantly higher than that of wp a which may be because the disinfectant used in wp b was sodium hypochlorite while that used in wp a was liquid chlorine in water liquid chlorine is hydrolyzed into hypochlorous acid which can remove organic matter by addition or electrophilic substitution reaction with unsaturated bond therefore hypochlorite is the main oxidizing substance 58 studies have shown that the removal rates of sulfonamides trimethoprim and carbadox were more than 90 in the presence of 0 5 1 mg l cl2 59 moreover in complex water systems the existence of organic matter affects the oxidation efficiency of antibiotics therefore the chlorine dosage is an important factor affecting the antibiotic removal efficiency however chlorine disinfection can readily generate chlorination and disinfection by products which are more toxic than the original compounds 10 zhuang et al found that the individual effect of chlorination or uv was significantly lower than the combined effect of chlorination and uv treatment 50 cristina et al showed that uv h2o2 can destroy the sulfonamide bond of sulfamethoxazole and the hydroxyl radical generated by h2o2 can further degrade the intermediate of sulfamethoxazole 60 therefore combined disinfection is an effective method to remove antibiotics 3 4 2 effect and analysis of arg removal by disinfection chlorination is widely used in disinfecting drinking water because of its advantages of high efficiency and continuous disinfection process studies have shown that a high dose of chlorine can destroy the cell wall of arb and enter the cytoplasm to react with dna inactivating the args 61 after chlorine disinfection in wp a the removal of most args ranged from 0 24 log to 1 57 log while in wp b the removal ranged from 0 07 log to 1 05 log these results are similar to those of stange et al 62 the gene copy number decreased at 0 25 mg l chlorine furthermore chlorine disinfection can not only effectively reduce the absolute abundance of args 63 but increasing the dosage of chlorine can also reduce the types of args present in the water 64 however studies have shown that the presence of antibiotics can enhance the transmission of args in the environment 65 the ermb increased by 1 3 log after chlorination which was similar to the results of liu et al who reported that chlorination could increase the concentration of ermb in extracellular args eargs 66 in addition when the chlorine concentration is lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration free chlorine promotes the spread of args 67 some studies have shown that chlorination can lead to the increase in cell membrane permeability and the horizontal transfer of args therefore args are enriched in chlorine resistant bacteria leading to the production of multi drug resistant bacteria 68 the removal efficiency of args highly varied from the water treatment plant to the epw in wp a qnrs was removed by 3 3 log while teto was enriched by 6 7 log for the total args the absolute concentration of args increased from 1 1 103 to 3 5 103 gene ml after passing through the pipeline distribution system in the pipe network distribution some bacterial communities have a competitive advantage because of their growth under such conditions 69 in addition the changes of temperature chlorine residue and nutrient content in the pipeline lead to the instability of microorganisms in the distribution system which leads to the differences in the types and amounts of args detected 69 therefore we should focus on the changes of antibiotics and args in drinking water in the future 4 conclusions this study investigated the occurrence and removal of nine antibiotics nine args and one integron in two drinking water treatment plants adding an sf unit before the flo unit in conventional treatment systems can effectively improve the removal efficiencies of antibiotics and args moreover the backwashing time and effect of the sf unit affects the removal efficiencies of antibiotics and args the po process is an effective method to remove antibiotics and args in advanced treatment and increasing the o3 dosage can be efficacious in improving the removal effect of antibiotics and args however due to the formation of biofilm on ac the removal effect of args using the ac unit is poor the effect of single disinfection treatment on antibiotic removal is limited but that of the combined disinfection process is excellent however even though chlorination can effectively remove args it can lead to the enrichment of args in chlorine resistant bacteria therefore the distribution characteristics and removal effects of antibiotics and args in different processes should be further investigated and the best process and optimal process parameters for removing antibiotics and args to avoid the increase of the concentration of antibiotics and args in the process of drinking water distribution should be explored to protect human health and safety funding this work was supported by the wuhan science and technology planning project 2018060401011313 credit authorship contribution

12725,with the extensive detection of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args in drinking water treatment plants the safety of drinking water has received increased attention therefore the distribution and removal of antibiotics and args in drinking water systems require further investigation in this study nine typical antibiotics nine args and one integron in two drinking water plants were investigated by high pressure liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses sulfonamides were the dominant antibiotic in the two drinking water treatment plants wp a and wp b the removal effect of advanced water treatment on total antibiotic concentration was significantly higher than that of conventional treatment sul gene was the dominant gene in the raw water of the two plants after undergoing different treatment units the finished water in wp a and wp b exhibited sul gene concentrations of 54 06 genes ml and 67 9 genes ml respectively in the conventional treatment process adding a sand filtration unit before the flocculation unit can improve the removal efficiency of antibiotics and args in the advanced treatment process the post ozonization unit using the strong oxidation of o3 could effectively remove antibiotics and args although the activated carbon unit can effectively remove antibiotics the removal effect of args is poor chlorination has a poor effect on the removal of antibiotics but it can effectively remove args this study can provide a basis for understanding the fate of antibiotics and args in drinking water systems keywords antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes ozone activated carbon water treatment plant removal efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have been increasingly detected in the aquatic environment therefore the health and safety concerns arising from the presence of drugs and ppcps in drinking water have attracted increasing attention 1 antibiotics are one of the most representative pollutants in ppcps the concentration of tetracycline antibiotics in drinking water in the lower reaches of the yangtze river in china ranges from 11 16 ng l to 56 ng l 2 the concentration of antibiotics in chongqing china ranged from 20 6 ng l to 188 1 ng l 3 the abuse of antibiotics leads to antibiotic pollution and accumulation in the environment this causes selective pressures on bacteria resulting in the formation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb 4 and consequently the production of args 5 some studies have pointed out that 11 types of args have been detected in the water sources of shanghai and the average concentration range was approximately 3 66 101 1 62 105 copy ml 6 the args in arb can be transmitted within and between species through vertical and horizontal gene transfer 7 moreover even though ozone can inactivate arb cell the dna carrying args can exist for a long time in the deoxynuclease therefore the persistence and easy spread of args will become a hidden danger are a major impact of environmental pollution caused by antibiotics 8 and highly relevant to ecological and human health the drinking water treatment process is an important potential route of exposure to antibiotics and args in humans 9 recently researchers have increasingly focused on the removal of antibiotics and args from drinking water using various treatment processes stackelberg et al found that granular activated carbon filtration can effectively remove erythromycin from water 10 song et al studied the removal efficiency of antibiotics in different water treatment plants and found that the flocculation unit contributed to a superior removal performance in one treatment plant while the disinfection process played an important role in another plant 11 hu et al found that compared with the conventional process the advanced process can effectively improve the removal efficiency of sulfonamide antibiotics moreover pre flocculation sedimentation and sand filtration are effective methods to reduce args in water 12 the spread of antibiotics and args in drinking water system poses a significant threat to human health however most studies focus on the distribution of antibiotics or args in drinking water or only on the removal of a class of antibiotics and args in drinking water treatment ignoring the antibiotic and arg removal effects and mechanisms in different treatment units therefore the removal mechanism of antibiotics and args by different drinking water treatment processes must be further investigated this study focused on the distribution of sulfonamides tetracyclines macrolides and quinolones including nine antibiotics sulfamethoxydiazine sulfameter sulfamerazine ofloxacin enrofloxacin tetracycline oxytetracycline erythromycin and roxithromycin nine args sul1 sul2 erma ermb qnrd qnrs tetm teto and tetw and one integron inti in two drinking water plants and compared the differences in antibiotic removal and args by different conventional treatment techniques simultaneously the effect and mechanism of advanced treatment on the removal of antibiotics and args were explored thus the study aimed to provide a basis for understanding the fate of antibiotics and args in drinking water systems 2 material and methods 2 1 drinking water treatment plants and sample collection in october 2020 samples were collected from drinking water treatment plants a and b wp a and wp b in wuhan city china both wp a and wp b used the same water source hanjiang river for the experiments 2 l water samples were collected by a water collector in wp a samples were collected from the raw water rw

substitutes were purchased from toronto research chemicals company while the internal standard atrazine 13c3 was purchased from dr ehrenstorfer all standard solutions were stored at 20 c the solid phase extraction column 500 mg 6 ml was purchased from waters usa and the chromatographic pure reagents such as methanol acetonitrile and formic acid were purchased from thermo fisher technology china co ltd 2 3 sample pretreatment for the pretreatment of water samples 0 5 g edta and 0 3 g ascorbic acid were added to a 1 l water sample the solution was thoroughly shaken the ph was adjusted to 2 3 with concentrated sulfuric acid and then 0 45 g ascorbic acid was added a volume of 1000 μl water sample was filtered using a cellulose acetate membrane to remove impurities and 10 μl substitute solution was added to the filtered sample and mixed an oasis hlb solid phase extraction column waters usa was used to extract a concentrated solution before pretreatment the extraction column was activated with 10 ml methanol and 10 ml millipore water after the water sample was filtered at a flow rate of 10 15 ml min the column was immediately washed with 10 ml millipore water and dried by purging with nitrogen then 10 ml methanol was used as eluent at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min and collected in a 10 ml glass tube the collected eluent was blown dry using nitrogen in a water bath at 40 c and 10 μl internal standard solution was added and made up the volume to 1 ml the samples were filtered by the organic phase filter membrane 0 45 μm cellulose acetate and stored in dark at 20 c before operation the methanol in the sample was replaced by the initial mobile phase the used membrane was cut into small fragments and placed in the powerbead tubes of fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa to isolate bacterial genomic dna before dna extraction and analysis the membrane fragments were stored at 80 c 2 4 quantification of antibiotics and args real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr of args was performed using a rapid real time pcr system jena qtower2 2 germany the qpcr system included 10 μl chamq universal sybr qpcr master mix 0 4 μl positive

threshold cyclic ct was considered to be valid data between 20 and 35 and the absolute abundance of args and 16srdna was calculated the reduction of args and 16srdna in this article is calculated by the following formula reduction log c1 c2 c1 and c2 are absolute concentrations of genes all figures are drawn by origin2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of antibiotics and args in raw and finished water 3 1 1 distribution of antibiotics in raw and finished water the removal effect of antibiotics in different drinking water treatment processes was determined by analyzing the concentration of antibiotics in rw and fw water in wp a and wp b the concentrations of antibiotics in the two water plants are summarized in table 1 nine antibiotics were tested in the rw of wp a and wp b and the detection rate for sulfonamides was 100 with smd accounting for the highest concentration followed by smx this may be due to the existence of livestock and aquaculture farms along the hanjiang river which commonly use sulfonamides and result in the high content of this group of antibiotics in the water source 13 moreover sulfonamides are hydrophilic and chemically stable with good environmental migration ability and can easily migrate to rivers during the rainy season resulting in their high contents in raw water 14 however enr and ofl were scarcely detected which may be because quinolones are readily adsorbed on the surface of solid particles resulting in a small amount of these antibiotics in the aqueous phase 15 tetracyclines are among the most widely used antibiotics in poultry breeding 16 however they are easily adsorbed onto particles and sediments and readily undergo hydrolysis or photolysis in water therefore the content of tetracyclines in the aqueous phase was low 17 in addition macrolides exhibited a low concentration in the aquatic environment because of their low water solubility high adsorption capacity to sediments and rapid conversion to biotransformation products through biodegradation or photodegradation 18 erythromycin is unstable in water and can be rapidly converted into dehydrated products 1 because the rw of both wp a and wp b originated from the same river the distribution of antibiotics in the rw was similar but the removal efficiency of antibiotics in the two water plants was different in wp a the detection rate of antibiotics was 55 6 with removal rates of 100 for sd and tc and less than 50 for smx smd and rox the detection rate of antibiotics in wp b was 66 7 with removal rates of 100 in sd tc and enr and more than 60 in smx smd and rox these differences may be due to the addition of advanced treatment processes including po and ac in wp b the advanced treatment process can effectively remove antibiotics from the water thereby reducing the concentration of antibiotics in the water treatment plants 3 1 2 distribution of args in raw and finished water in recent years args have often been detected in drinking water treated by water treatment plants arising widespread public concern table 2 lists the concentrations and removal rates of nine args inti and 16s rdna in the rw and fw of wp a and wp b although the water sources of both wp a and wp b originate from the same river the contents of args varied due to the different water intake points nine args and one mobile genetic element were detected in the rw of the two drinking water treatment plants in wp a the absolute concentration range of args and inti were 3 31 10 1 to 3 05 105 gene ml and 8 102 gene ml with sul1 exhibiting the lowest concentration and sul2 the highest concentration the sul gene was the dominant gene in wp a accounting for 99 3 of the total args in wp b the absolute concentration range of args and inti were 4 06 101 to 7 44 103 gene ml and 1 103 gene ml additionally sul gene was the dominant gene in wp b accounting for 81 5 of the total args the reason for the high abundance of sul gene may be that it is collected on mobile genetic elements which can improve the transmission and persistence of the gene in the aqueous environment 19 in addition in the process of preventing and controlling covid 19 the use of drugs rose sharply even some patients with mild symptoms used drugs at home and these drugs also entered natural water bodies including the yangtze river basin the concentration range of antibiotics is 2 61 1122 ng l which causes a selection pressure leading to an increased abundance of resistance genes in the water 20 overall the removal efficiency of wp a and wp b for most args ranged from 0 2 to 4 8 log however some args such as sul1 0 2 log ermb 1 1 log qnrs 0 8 log tetm 0 2 log and tetw 0 8 log exhibited significant negative growth in wp a this shows that the conventional treatment processes of wp a and wp b have limited effect on the removal of args thus the surface water treated by drinking water treatment processes is facing the risk of severe args pollution 3 2 removal of antibiotics and args by conventional treatment processes 3 2 1 comparison of wp a and wp b conventional processes for antibiotic removal the antibiotic concentrations in each unit of the conventional treatment process for wp a and wp b are presented in fig 2 different conventional treatment processes are found to have different removal effects on antibiotics the removal rate of total antibiotics in wp a was 36 11 while that in wp b was 31 76 in the rw flo process of wp a five types of antibiotics were detected the total antibiotic concentration decreased from 23 66 ng l to 14 06 ng l and the removal rate reached 40 57 the removal rate of rox was 45 82 followed by that of tc 44 66 this may be because rox and tc are readily adsorbed onto the sediments 21 in addition the addition of coagulant during the coagulation process leads to an increase in the ph while under alkaline conditions this promotes the negatively charged tc to attract active substances thus improving the degradation effect 22 in the sf the removal efficiencies of sd 95 96 and rox 49 29 were higher than the other antibiotics and the removal rates of smx smd and tc were less than 30 however the total removal rate of antibiotics in the sf was higher than that in the subsequent st and thus sf can effectively reduce the antibiotic load in the sedimentation tank in the process of rw flo the removal efficiency of wp b to total antibiotics was only 3 02 while that of wp a reached 28 64 this may be the reason that flo can remove inorganic particles and tetracyclines with strong adsorption capacities moreover in wp a the sf unit is set in front of flo unit which can remove some pollutants and improve subsequent flocculation effect and increase the removal effect of lipophilic antibiotics therefore the sf can effectively promote the removal of antibiotics in the flo st process the removal efficiency of antibiotics in wp a ranged from 22 to 70 additionally flo st had the maximum contribution in the removal of tc according to the structural characteristics of tc the hydrophobic bis tetraphenylbenzene skeleton can easily interact with the surface of solid particles resulting in its removal from the solid to the aqueous phase 11 the same phenomenon was observed in wp b implying that flocculation and sedimentation process cannot effectively eliminate hydrophilic compounds with low octanol water partition coefficient logkow values and high solubilities 23 this is also confirmed by the low removal efficiencies of sd smx and smd less than 30 in wp a and wp b during the filtration process the removal efficiencies of total antibiotics were poor in wp a and wp b less than 10 however the removal of efficiency in wp b was better than that in wp a because of the longer backwash time the backwash time of the dvf is longer than that of the vf resulting in the better adsorption performance of the filter material in the dvf than that of the vf in wp a thus backwashing can affect the performance of the filter unit in removing antibiotics the conventional treatment processes of the two treatment plants have a similar effect on the removal of total antibiotics in wp b the st improves the removal effect of antibiotics compared with wp b the removal effect is better in wp a when a sand filter is added before the st as the antibiotic load can be effectively reduced by sf this indicates that both the sf and st can effective removal of antibiotics 3 2 2 comparison of conventional processes in wp a and wp b in removing resistance genes the percentages and log reduction of the absolute concentration change in args during the conventional treatment processes in wp a and wp b are shown in fig 3 after treatment by the sf unit in wp a other args in the water increased by 0 16 3 88 log except for sul2 and erma the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen and total phosphorus increased after the treatment in sf as it induces the formation of biofilms on the filtration materials 24 moreover inti increases during the sf process which also poses the risk of horizontal gene transfer of args 25 furthermore aging biofilms that fall off from the filtration materials increase the concentration of args therefore the backwashing time and effect determine the effect of arg removal by sf the flo units can effectively remove the args in both wp a and wp b after treatment in the flo unit in wp a the args decreased by 0 16 log which was significantly lower than that of wp b 0 63 log this may be due to the solid liquid separation effect in the sf that removes the microorganisms adsorbed on the particle phase and reduces the content of intracellular args by reducing arb in the aqueous phase 26 this phenomenon might be the reason for the limited removal of args by flo in wp a both wp a and wp b use polyaluminum ferric chloride as coagulant which could produce positively charged flocculent particles with iron aluminum hydroxide in wp a the dosage of coagulant is 16 93 mg l and in wp b it is 39 08 mg l these particles can interact with negatively charged arb via electrostatic attraction to remove arb and reduce args 27 the coagulants could directly combine with extracellular args in water and finally remove the args through precipitation although the removal efficiency by flo is not high after sf unit in wp a the combined removal efficiency of args by sf and flo units is significantly higher than that in wp b this further shows that sf processes can effectively improve the removal efficiency of args sedimentation tanks are used in the treatment process to precipitate the large particle impurities and flocs in the water to the bottom of the tank through physical action the absolute abundance of args was reduced after the st treatment in wp a and wp b and decreased by 0 04 log and 0 24 log respectively in particular sul2 was the easiest to remove in wp a which decreased by 0 67 log while the removal effect of erma in wp b was the best 0 60 log this may be due to the different water quality in wp a and wp b which cause the discrepancy of types of args removal the decline in 16s rdna could explain the reduction of args achieved by decreasing the arb in water 12 in addition a few args increased in wp a and wp b during precipitation which might be due to the strong hydraulic agitation generated by the sludge discharge machine at the bottom of the sedimentation tank this causes the args adsorbed on the flocs to return to the water phase resulting in the increase of args 12 the v type filter was used in wp a and thus the abundance of most args increased by 0 2 3 6 log only four genes sul2 erma ermb and qnrd decreased by 0 06 0 36 log and the inti gene was reduced by 0 59 log in wp b the absolute abundances of erma tetd and tetw increased by 0 15 log 0 15 log and 0 06 log respectively in contrast the absolute abundance of the other args decreased by 0 01 0 15 log thus the removal effect of args by the filters in the two water treatment plants was not ideal this may be because most of the intracellular args were removed during precipitation but the shape flexibility of extracellular args which often exist in the form of transposons integrons and plasmids 28 increases their ability to pass through the filter 29 3 3 removal of antibiotics and args by advanced treatment processes 3 3 1 effect and analysis of antibiotic removal by advanced treatment table 3 shows the antibiotic concentration and removal rate in po bac fw epw unit compared with the conventional treatment process advanced treatment can effectively improve the removal efficiency of antibiotics ozone oxidation is widely considered an effective method to remove antibiotics due to the strong oxidizing effect of ozone it can react with compounds with carbon carbon double bonds 30 and the hydroxyl radicals produced by ozone decomposition in water do not selectively oxidize pollutants in water 10 in wp b the ozone dosage of po unit is 1 5 mg l the removal rates of sd tc enr and rox were higher than 40 furthermore tc was no longer detected in the water after treatment in the po unit therefore po is a promising method to remove tetracycline antibiotics 11 the increase in chemical oxygen demand after the po unit indicated that the biodegradability was slightly improved which also confirmed the degradation of some antibiotics 23 however in the study by yaru et al the removal of the sas were above 80 14 which significantly higher than that of po in wp b this may be due to the low ozone dosage in the po process in wp b causing only the partial degradation of antibiotics simultaneously the concentration of organic pollutants entering the po unit reaches 0 372 mg l which will also react with ozone and hydroxyl radicals forming a competitive relationship with the parent antibiotic and further inhibiting the removal of antibiotics furthermore ph can also affect the oxidation effect of ozone the ph of the po unit is alkaline which promotes the production of hydroxyl radicals 31 and the degradation rate increases with the increase in ph therefore alkaline water conditions are conducive to the removal of antibiotics by low concentration ozone 32 thus the ozone dosage and ph are important factors to determine the degradation efficiency of antibiotics additionally hydraulic retention time affects the removal of antibiotics by ozone in wp b the hydraulic retention time of po unit is only 10 min and the limitation of reaction time will also lead to the poorer efficacy of ozone in removing antibiotics at the same time the bubble type of ozone will also have an impact compared with millibubble ultrafine bubble have more advantages in removing antibiotics 33 ultrafine bubble increase the contact surface between ozone and pollutants increase the contact points and then increase the removal effect therefore when removing antibiotics in po unit ultrafine bubble can be used to improve the removal rate the removal efficiency of smd and smx in the po unit was 25 33 and 26 30 respectively which was less than 30 indicating that the removal efficiency of po units was limited this result is similar to the findings of guo et al 34 the removal rate of smx was only 51 after treatment in the po unit for 30 min the low removal efficiency of smx may be because the double bonds and aromatic rings are primarily oxidized by ozone 35 at ph 7 smx exists in the anionic form and develop electrostatic repulsion with hydroxyl radicals 34 which means the removal of smx relies on ozone simultaneously ozone can directly attack the benzene ring and cause the straight chain reaction 36 however ozone will be converted to produce hydroxyl radicals in water which will also lead to low ozone concentration thereby limiting the removal effect of smx similar to the research results of hu et al the removal effect of po unit on smd is poor yaru et al showed that the removal rate of smd in the ozonation unit was less than 40 and the removal effect of smd in the flocculation and sedimentation process was better than that of the po unit thus smd may be effectively removed by strengthening flocculation 14 after the flo unit treatment the removal effect of smd reached 28 81 which was higher than that of the po unit which also showed that the ozone and hydroxyl radical of po unit could not effectively oxidize smd in water but the removal effect was more effective in the form of flocculation the removal efficiency of the ac unit for all antibiotics was more than 30 wherein that of enr was the highest 53 69 followed by sd 50 60 the removal of trace organics by this process is mainly realized by the adsorptive capacity of ac and the formation of biofilm on the ac surface 23 which is conducive to the adsorption of organics the different logkow values of different antibiotics also lead to different adsorption effects of ac for different antibiotics 37 furthermore enr is a microorganism that is difficult to biodegrade 38 so its removal in the ac unit mainly depends on the physical adsorption of ac the lipophilicity of sulfonamides antibiotics is poor which is not easy to be adsorbed by ac therefore sd mainly depends on the degradation and removal of microorganisms however there are disadvantages through biodegradation in ac unit the residual antibiotics and some chemical substances on the biofilm may have a co selection effect on args leading to the expression of args 39 in addition the contact time can affect the removal effect of antibiotics prolonging the contact time can increase the number of available absorption sites 40 some studies show that the maximum adsorption capacity of ac to smx can reach 217 mg g without interference of other impurities 41 however in the actual biological activated carbon bac unit due to the complex water quality various organic pollutants will compete with the adsorption of antibiotics and the concentration of antibiotics in the actual water body only reaches the level of ng l which will greatly reduce the adsorption effect of ac to antibiotics in the study of bac improvement xu et al studied the removal effect of ac zero valent iron amended bioretention cells on smx and tc the results showed that the removal effect of ac zero valent iron modified bioretention cells was significantly higher than that of ac 42 this also shows that the removal effect of antibiotics can be improved by optimizing ac for bac units 3 3 2 effect and analysis of advanced treatment on removing args table 4 shows the log reduction and abundance of args in po bac fw epw unit in po unit except erma and tetw the other args increased by 0 07 0 59 log this result is similar to that reported by su et al that the absolute abundance of teta tetm tetw cfr cmla qnrb and qnrs increased after ozone treatment 43 a high concentration of ozone can destroy the cell proteins to increase the permeability of the cell membrane which is conducive to the release of args in cells and leads to the transfer of intracellular args to extracellular genes 44 the transfer of intracellular args to the extracellular space will directly lead to the increase of args in aqueous phase although o3 and hydroxyl radicals produced by its hydrolysis can oxidize the dna molecules carrying extracellular args organic compounds with double or unsaturated bonds in the aqueous phase can also consume the oxidizing substances in the water forming a competitive relationship with args and limiting the oxidation effect 45 in addition the limited mass transfer affects the efficiency of ozone transfer from the gas to liquid phase and then limits the concentration of ozone in liquid phase 46 in the actual po unit the removal of args is accompanied by a trace amount of antibiotics and the trace amount of antibiotics and the intermediate products produced in the process of ozone oxidation induce the drug resistance and sublethal stress reaction mechanism of arb which can make it resist the oxidation of ozone than non resistant microorganisms 47 at the same time it has also been shown that oxidative stress can induce the transfer of args in arb during ozone treatment 48 thereby increasing the abundance of args in the environment therefore for the removal of args in water by ozone it is necessary to consider increasing the dosage of ozone in water not only to inactivate the arb present but also to damage the dna of the arb to reduce the abundance of args in water the research has shown that when the concentration of o3 is 2 mg l the removal efficiency of sulfonamide args is only 34 5 49 2 49 however zhuang et al found that the removal rate of args increased significantly when the ozone concentration was increased to 61 mg l 50 this shows that the change of o3 concentration will also affect the removal effect of args the effect of ac on the removal of args was not significant and the change in the removal efficiency of args was between 0 15 log and 0 15 log which is similar to the result of yaru et al 12 51 meanwhile the removal rate of sul1 was 0 26 log which was similar to the results obtained by zhang et al who reported a removal rate of 0 3 log for sul1 52 the biofilm formed on ac during the treatment could partially adsorb the arb to reduce intracellular args in the aqueous phase 53 however the abundance of arb on the biofilm can facilitate the occurrence of horizontal and vertical gene transfers 54 which leads to the increase in args the increase in the inti concentration after ac treatment promotes bacterial reconciliation leading to the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer 55 simultaneously there is a risk that biofilm can fall into the water leading to an increase of microorganisms in the water resulting in a poor removal effect of args 56 in addition su et al found that compared with powdered activated carbon filtration pac granular activated carbon filtration almost did not remove args 43 which indicated that the type of ac also affects the removal efficiency of args in the actual bac unit the removal effect of bac is mainly improved by backwashing however some studies have shown that the relative abundance and absolute abundance of args in the bac unit after backwashing are rising and the accumulation of such args may be caused by the horizontal transfer of genes 57 3 4 removal of antibiotics and args by disinfection 3 4 1 effect and analysis of antibiotic removal by disinfection the rate of antibiotic removal by disinfection in wp a ranged from 1 to 6 in the disinfection process in wp b the removal rate of antibiotics was 4 100 and sd was not detected in the water after chlorine disinfection the removal efficiency of wp b was significantly higher than that of wp a which may be because the disinfectant used in wp b was sodium hypochlorite while that used in wp a was liquid chlorine in water liquid chlorine is hydrolyzed into hypochlorous acid which can remove organic matter by addition or electrophilic substitution reaction with unsaturated bond therefore hypochlorite is the main oxidizing substance 58 studies have shown that the removal rates of sulfonamides trimethoprim and carbadox were more than 90 in the presence of 0 5 1 mg l cl2 59 moreover in complex water systems the existence of organic matter affects the oxidation efficiency of antibiotics therefore the chlorine dosage is an important factor affecting the antibiotic removal efficiency however chlorine disinfection can readily generate chlorination and disinfection by products which are more toxic than the original compounds 10 zhuang et al found that the individual effect of chlorination or uv was significantly lower than the combined effect of chlorination and uv treatment 50 cristina et al showed that uv h2o2 can destroy the sulfonamide bond of sulfamethoxazole and the hydroxyl radical generated by h2o2 can further degrade the intermediate of sulfamethoxazole 60 therefore combined disinfection is an effective method to remove antibiotics 3 4 2 effect and analysis of arg removal by disinfection chlorination is widely used in disinfecting drinking water because of its advantages of high efficiency and continuous disinfection process studies have shown that a high dose of chlorine can destroy the cell wall of arb and enter the cytoplasm to react with dna inactivating the args 61 after chlorine disinfection in wp a the removal of most args ranged from 0 24 log to 1 57 log while in wp b the removal ranged from 0 07 log to 1 05 log these results are similar to those of stange et al 62 the gene copy number decreased at 0 25 mg l chlorine furthermore chlorine disinfection can not only effectively reduce the absolute abundance of args 63 but increasing the dosage of chlorine can also reduce the types of args present in the water 64 however studies have shown that the presence of antibiotics can enhance the transmission of args in the environment 65 the ermb increased by 1 3 log after chlorination which was similar to the results of liu et al who reported that chlorination could increase the concentration of ermb in extracellular args eargs 66 in addition when the chlorine concentration is lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration free chlorine promotes the spread of args 67 some studies have shown that chlorination can lead to the increase in cell membrane permeability and the horizontal transfer of args therefore args are enriched in chlorine resistant bacteria leading to the production of multi drug resistant bacteria 68 the removal efficiency of args highly varied from the water treatment plant to the epw in wp a qnrs was removed by 3 3 log while teto was enriched by 6 7 log for the total args the absolute concentration of args increased from 1 1 103 to 3 5 103 gene ml after passing through the pipeline distribution system in the pipe network distribution some bacterial communities have a competitive advantage because of their growth under such conditions 69 in addition the changes of temperature chlorine residue and nutrient content in the pipeline lead to the instability of microorganisms in the distribution system which leads to the differences in the types and amounts of args detected 69 therefore we should focus on the changes of antibiotics and args in drinking water in the future 4 conclusions this study investigated the occurrence and removal of nine antibiotics nine args and one integron in two drinking water treatment plants adding an sf unit before the flo unit in conventional treatment systems can effectively improve the removal efficiencies of antibiotics and args moreover the backwashing time and effect of the sf unit affects the removal efficiencies of antibiotics and args the po process is an effective method to remove antibiotics and args in advanced treatment and increasing the o3 dosage can be efficacious in improving the removal effect of antibiotics and args however due to the formation of biofilm on ac the removal effect of args using the ac unit is poor the effect of single disinfection treatment on antibiotic removal is limited but that of the combined disinfection process is excellent however even though chlorination can effectively remove args it can lead to the enrichment of args in chlorine resistant bacteria therefore the distribution characteristics and removal effects of antibiotics and args in different processes should be further investigated and the best process and optimal process parameters for removing antibiotics and args to avoid the increase of the concentration of antibiotics and args in the process of drinking water distribution should be explored to protect human health and safety funding this work was supported by the wuhan science and technology planning project 2018060401011313 credit authorship contribution

12726,the recovery of a high amount of dissolved methane from the anaerobic bioreactor permeate requires efficient degassing technologies such as membrane contractors mc the review work presented here provides a summary and analysis of the studies involving biomethane production by anaerobic treatments to distinguish the parameters affecting downstream mc used for methane recovery a general overview of mc principles and dissolved methane quantification is included the paper then presents a discussion and analysis of diverse membrane characteristics and liquid and gas phase hydrodynamics the challenges and promises of the membrane contactor operations are also addressed currently maximum recovery efficiencies obtained are close to 99 for short term experiments however additional resistances for the mass transfer can be detected during long term operation it is therefore required to focus on membrane modifications and fine tuning of the main parameters for reducing mass

uasb upflow anaerobic sludge 1 introduction global warming is an unsolved problem that has received substantial interest in recent decades it has harmful impacts on the earth s mean surface temperature and thus on weather conditions 1 methane is the second largest anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg and climate warmer due to its high heat trapping capacity it is 25 to 32 times more potent than co2 over 100 years 2 3 methane release continues to rise despite the efforts of numerous countries to lessen emissions and even legislation to control methane emissions 4 5 due to rising concerns about global climate change wastewater management has gained widespread attention and many treatment techniques are emerging however not all methane produced in a wastewater treatment system is collected and dissolved methane is discharged with the effluent into the environment and thence into the atmosphere 1 1 biological wastewater treatments of the conventional technologies for wastewater management biological techniques fungi algae bacteria microbial fuel cells 6 are the most frequently used in wastewater management due to their environmental and economic advantages 7 they can be implemented under aerobic anaerobic or combined conditions aerobic treatments are based on an anaerobic bacterial culture capable of converting organic matter to biomass and co2 8 with no methane production in contrast anaerobic treatments generate methane in the biogas stream as methane production is triggered by the methanogenic metabolism of microorganisms the breakdown of the wastewater s organic fraction yields an energetic by product methane 9 this latter configuration has been widely adopted in wastewater treatments due to several benefits anaerobic digestion treatments provide renewable methane energy production and offer low biomass production low energy consumption they do not require aeration low operational costs and a smaller footprint compared to traditional aerobic and conventional sludge treatments 10 11 anaerobic treatments at low temperatures have also been widely deployed to reduce heating costs 12 1 2 anaerobic wastewater treatments various processes focusing on anaerobic treatments have been developed recently especially low temperature ambient or psychrophilic 20 c treatments 13 up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor configurations are commonly implemented technologies that provide the essential requirements of a high rate treatment 14 15 the use of anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr is an alternative strategy that is widely adopted today even in full scale applications 16 coupled with a membrane filtration process this configuration can produce higher quality effluent 17 and a reduced footprint low strength wastewater can be also treated through many other emerging technologies such as submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactors sanmbr 18 19 and anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactors saf mbr 14 20 however low or psychrophilic temperatures are not always advantageous since a decrease in the operational temperature may intensify the solubility of methane in the treated wastewater the trapped methane is then released into the environment instead of being collected as biogas 21 typically only 55 60 is recovered in the biogas stream but in some cases when the temperature is too low below 15 c the dissolved methane fraction may exceed 80 of the total methane produced 22 this is a major challenging drawback and the majority of the research in this field aims to solve this problem for environmental economic and safety reasons 1 3 dissolved methane impacts and main emission sources methane is released into the environment from natural and human made sources emissions from natural sources represent 40 of total methane emissions while anthropogenic methane emissions constitute 60 23 waste energy and agriculture are the main sources of anthropogenic methane emissions 23 24 the contribution of waste is relatively high 19 20 61 including the methane emissions from solid waste landfill wastewater and waste combustion anthropogenic methane emissions by source for 2020 are shown in fig 1 wastewater management s contribution has been mitigated and remains stable in the range of 7 of global anthropogenic emissions in 2020 11 the critical point is that dissolved methane discharged in confined vessels may be a safety hazard for downstream processes given its highly explosive and flammable nature at atmospheric pressure and 25 c the lower explosion limit lel for ch4 in the air is 5 v v which is equivalent to 1 4 mg l 1 of dissolved ch4 in effluent this is commonly reduced by a factor of 10 for safety reasons 29 therefore abating dissolved methane concentration in effluents to 0 14 mg l 1 is crucial to ensure safe further processing moreover many environmental impacts may be triggered by a release of methane into the atmosphere affecting the carbon neutrality of a process 29 hippargi et al 2021 and smil 2015 30 31 note that methane is an energy source it can be harnessed as a fuel for the power sector automobiles domestic heating and cooking thus methane losses are considered energy losses in this regard since wastewater management has received a great deal of attention in the past decade and numerous wastewater management strategies have been developed it is critical to eliminate or mitigate its gaseous methane and dissolved methane discharges broadly speaking this problem can be addressed by implementing a degassing technology as a downstream process a range of technologies has been explored to ensure dissolved methane is recovered or removed from anaerobic effluents 1 4 degassing technologies physical methods based on dispersing liquid into a collector gas phase or vice versa are traditionally applied these include packed column bubble column spray aeration jet tower tray aerator and diffused aeration 32 despite being traditionally used physical technologies present various technical issues such as foaming channeling and flooding 33 biological techniques can also be useful for dissolved methane removal these generally rely on the biological transformation of methane to co2 and non toxic metabolites by methane oxidizing bacteria mob the methane produced through these techniques cannot be harnessed as an energy source due to its oxidization thus operational costs are not compensated in recent years membrane contactors mc comprised of hollow fiber membranes have emerged as a promising alternative for anaerobic effluent treatments 34 the number of publications discussing this technology has increased enormously compared to publications concerning conventional technologies between 2012 and 2022 as presented in fig 2 1 5 membrane contactors the use of mc is a degassing technique that has conventionally been implemented for gas absorption or dissolved gas mitigation 14 35 but has been newly applied to recover dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents 9 for this application this technology is currently at the research or pilot level 36 37 due to the membrane that separates the gas phase from the liquid phase this configuration is capable of achieving gas liquid mass transfer without dispersion of any phase into the other 38 39 this process may use a large number of membrane module geometries these include hollow fiber 40 41 tubular 42 flat sheet 43 and spiral wound 44 different membrane porosities can also be used 21 40 due to its numerous benefits compared to conventional techniques mc technology has been proposed as a promising alternative for dissolved methane recovery 36 45 in addition to avoiding traditional problems such as flooding and foaming membrane based technology is characterized by a high packing density for hollow fiber membrane modules that offers a high specific surface area per unit volume and therefore an enhanced mass transfer 46 this reduces the footprint scale and energy consumption of the degassing unit 9 moreover a membrane degassing unit is easy to operate 47 and to scale up nevertheless the use of mc is typically restricted by the additional mass transfer resistance caused by the membrane s resistance 21 36 an mc may be prone to fouling organic or inorganic wetting clogging capillary condensation and concentration polarization 48 therefore installing a pre filtration step and adopting cleaning strategies are crucial to limit pore clogging and enhance the long term stability of a membrane 21 36 in addition customizing membrane properties may be a useful way to avoid fouling and wetting problems 49 1 6 target and novelty of this work a few reviews have studied the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic reactors by different techniques 50 especially by hollow fiber mc hfmc 51 52 however the current literature does not fully examine and characterize the issues associated with the degassing process in hfmc as a result in light of changing problems increasing trends and emerging opportunities it is timely to provide an overview of advances in polymer based membranes for dissolved desorption from anaerobic effluents employing mc techniques among the literature multiple contributions have been made by heile et al 2017 li et al 2021 stazi et al 2021 and crone et al 2016 36 50 53 54 on the recovery or removal of dissolved methane via conventional techniques and mc from anaerobic effluents each technology is discussed in depth underlining its advantages and disadvantages under various bioreactor configurations and operational conditions with a particular focus on technological compatibility furthermore velasco et al 2018 2020 51 55 examines degassing methane from anmbr effluents analyzing gaseous and dissolved methane production and focusing on its economic aspect in addition numerous reviews have investigated the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents centeno mora and chernicharo 2020 52 for instance provided an updated evaluation concentrating on mc primary limitations alternative uses for the recovered methane and insights into mc economic feasibility moreover heile et al 2017 36 critically examined existing and proposed physical technologies to gas desorption in engineered anaerobic wastewater processes with a specific focus on technology compatibility and downstream gas phase management in his study similarly stazi et al 53 conducted a comparative study between physical and biological processes used for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluent highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of each technology crone et al 2016 54 investigated the use of membrane units in the degassing process and in the effluent of uasb and anmbr treatment systems by identifying the key parameters influencing dissolved methane recovery efficiency and conducting a deeper investigation into the economic feasibility of degassing membrane units using vacuum li et al 2021 50 on the other hand aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of existing and emerging technologies for managing dissolved methane while discussing their process suitability and major challenges while existing reviews primarily compare degassing technologies and examine the experimental recovery of dissolved methane by membrane contactors a critical assessment of the mass transfer phenomenon is currently lacking in the literature and is required for future modeling studies particularly for fouling and wetting phenomena additionally the effect of upstream anaerobic bioreactor parameters is not discussed in the literature and the general drawbacks of a membrane contactor are briefly examined and must be further elucidated in this regard the following research topics and gaps were considered mc experiences available in the literature for d ch4 removal and recovery section 3 ch4 mass transfer attainable in these systems section 4 anaerobic effluent conditioning requirements and operating issues section 5 recovered waste gas characteristics focussed on valorisation section 6 and energetic carbon footprint and economic theoretical considerations available in the literature when using mc for d ch4 recovery section 7 this review presents more details on an anaerobic bioreactor s main parameters and how they affect the concentration of d ch4 in the effluent it also outlines knowledge gaps and research requirements in the field this work covers a wide spectrum of literature including works that were not included in earlier literature reviews additionally the mass transfer phenomenon is investigated with a particular focus on the existing correlations for different operational conditions and for cases of fouling and wetting finally a further solution is provided to maintain a membrane based system s efficiency in long term operation and at full scale with these aims in mind this review begins by providing a brief overview of the upstream processes and defining the major parameters that could potentially impact an mc performance section 2 this is followed by a description of the degassing mechanism in hfmc with a particular focus on the theoretical approach and modeling section 3 the fourth section summarizes the major parameters affecting mc efficiency and productivity and the best operational strategies are highlighted finally the key challenges facing mc systems are addressed and potential solutions to enhance membrane performance are presented section 5 2 methane production in anaerobic bioreactors during anaerobic treatments the biogas produced downstream is a mixture of co2 methane and trace gases including hydrogen hydrogen sulfide nitrogen carbon monoxide oxygen argon ammonia and other volatile compounds 56 in particular methane is released and generated in anaerobic bioreactors by a sequence of processes as described in fig 3 this sequence begins by hydrolysis followed by acidogenesis complex organic molecules comprising proteins carbohydrates and fats are transformed into water soluble molecules monosaccharides fatty acids and amino acids and then into short chain volatile fatty acids vfas by fermentative bacteria metabolism 51 57 thereafter acetogenesis is triggered as a third stage supported by acetogenic bacteria this process transforms the vfas into acetic acid hydrogen and co2 eventually during methanogenesis methane is produced according to two different pathways 57 the first pathway consists of producing methane aceticlastic methanogenic bacteria split the acetic acid into methane and co2 58 it contributes to around 75 of the total methane production and the rest is produced by another pathway which relies on the conversion of hydrogen and co2 by hydrogenotrophic methanogenic bacteria 57 59 the biogas yield and its composition are generally governed by the bioreactor s mode of operation aerobic or anaerobic which can highly affect its biokinetics typically its growth phase 60 61 furthermore the relative methane composition in the biogas stream is correlated with physicochemical parameters temperature ph and alkalinity the relative abundance of methanogenic species and the waste composition such as the organic content to be consumed sulfates and nitrates 19 62 for instance a l smith skerlos and raskin 2015 63 studied dissolved methane oversaturation in a bench scale anmbr at psychrophilic temperatures ranging from 3 to 15 c it was shown that when the temperature decreases from 15 to 3 c methane oversaturation increases this requires a higher reliance on the biofilm for treatment and results in more methane generation in the biofilm which is represented by an increase from 45 to 90 in the biofilm s chemical oxygen demand cod removal numerous anaerobic bioreactor configurations have been developed for wastewater management particularly for domestic wastewater the most common anaerobic technologies for wastewater treatment are uasbs and egsbs the uasb configuration primarily creates a granular sludge layer suspended in the tank at which the anaerobic microorganisms digest the wastewater as it moves upward through the blanket the egsb is a derivative of the uasb configuration offering a higher upward flow velocity this is its differentiating characteristic the retention of biomass in these systems also known as high rate anaerobic reactors provides a competitive advantage by decoupling the hydraulic retention time hrt from the solids retention time srt 15 nevertheless the anmbr configuration provides a competitive advantage over these conventional technologies as it results in higher quality effluent the integration of ultrafiltration uf or microfiltration mf in the anaerobic system provides a complete decoupling of hrt and srt allowing for high biomass controllability in the digester while obtaining a high quality effluent free of suspended solids and pathogens all these anaerobic configurations are limited by the amount of methane dissolved in their outlet effluent caused by the low operational temperature especially in the low strength domestic wastewater treatments despite the efforts made by numerous studies to enhance biogas methane enrichment and the collection of methane in these systems a significant amount of methane remains dissolved in the liquid phase 2 1 effect of operating conditions on dissolved methane dissolved methane concentration in anaerobic effluents is a major drawback of low strength wastewater treatments that should be mitigated by controlling the main parameters aggravating this phenomenon the key parameters affecting dissolved methane content in anaerobic effluents and downstream membrane degassing mechanisms are summarized and referenced in table 1 this table is a summary of several experimental studies that estimate methane losses it is challenging to compare anaerobic bioreactor performance under different operating conditions however table 1 shows that a high amount of dissolved methane is generally observed at relatively low temperatures at high temperatures less methane remains dissolved in the liquid phase due to a decrease in methane solubility as stated by henry s law 40 64 a large number of studies have examined the influence of temperature on methane accumulation in the bioreactor permeate bandara et al 2011 64 using a uasb reactor show that an increase of the operational temperature from 15 c to 35 c led to a 10 reduction in methane losses in the liquid phase moreover giménez et al 2011 19 also revealed the connection between the concentration of methane in anaerobic effluent and temperature in an sanmbr in their study aqueous methane content varied from 12 3 mg l 1 to 15 4 mg l 1 when the operating temperature changed from 30 c to 15 c peña et al 2019 65 reveal that a rise of 15 c in the initial anmbr temperature led to a decline of 5 6 in methane losses a rise in methane concentration in the effluent can be also observed at a high biogas pressure y chen 2013 66 determined that their pressurized anmbr could generate 7 5 times more dissolved methane with a high biogas pressure of 0 9 mpa than with a biogas pressure of 0 1 mpa pang et al 2019 67 indicate that working under lower transmembrane pressure may lessen methane release in the effluent due to higher methane transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase despite its leading influence on methane dissolution these operating conditions are not thought to be sufficient to quantify methane losses temperature and pressure are thus associated with the oversaturation parameter when estimating methane releases the methane oversaturation phenomenon which has been defined as the ratio between the actual dissolved methane concentration and the theoretical concentration based on henry s law has been widely monitored in studies of conventional non membrane based anaerobic bioreactors 77 78 in these studies oversaturation was attributed to deficiencies in the liquid gas mass transfer in contrast working with an anmbr giménez et al 2012 71 did not witness a difference between the measured methane concentration in anaerobic effluents and that predicted from the equilibrium this observation was correlated with the biogas sparging which contributed to creating the gas liquid phase equilibrium this alternative for decreasing oversaturation in anaerobic effluent was also adopted by adam l smith skerlos and raskin 2013 13 when treating an anaerobic effluent using an anmbr at 21 c and 33 c eventually this technique resolved the mass transfer limitations even though methane oversaturation still existed and was recorded as high as 1 5 according to adam l smith skerlos and raskin 2013 13 methanogenic activity in the biofilm differential pressure and salinity conditions have been suggested as the sources of this oversaturation 13 15 63 this phenomenon was also elucidated by cookney et al 2016 40 using both uasb and anmbr bioreactors for the uasb case study an oversaturation index of 1 3 was noted and was linked to the formation of microbubbles in the bioreactor since the bubbles are entrained inside the organic matrix however there was no oversaturation in the anmbr configuration this was attributed to the absence of organic compounds in the permeate thus the mechanism responsible for methane oversaturation is as yet unclear 74 77 and additional studies are required to understand more completely the key regulators and sources of oversaturation methane oversaturation in the liquid phase can establish a mass transfer driving force based on a concentration gradient enhance the methane composition in the biogas generated and hence increase the methane content in anaerobic effluent 40 77 some authors also suggest that differences between the measured methane concentration and the expected equilibrium concentration could lead to a higher methane fraction in the liquid phase this could lead to under estimating of the methane losses due to a deficient liquid gas mass transfer 71 based on the data presented in table 1 the degree of oversaturation is related to the variation in the amount of dissolved methane the more methane concentration exceeds equilibrium concentration the more dissolved net methane remains in the liquid phase souza et al 68 treated wastewater with uasb technology at 25 c and recorded an oversaturation index of 1 64 and a methane concentration ranging from 18 to 22 mg l 1 at a similar temperature m henares et al 2017 37 found oversaturation of 1 8 and a relatively high dissolved methane concentration of 30 mg l 1 the oversaturation index is also dependent on the anaerobic reactor configuration since the anmbr is defined by its high upward flow velocity and stirring intensity biological fouling is mitigated and oversaturation reduced the observations of rongwong et al 2018 33 support this statement the authors demonstrate that the anmbr configuration has the advantage of retaining biomass by microfiltration or nanofiltration in the bioreactor it thus achieves an oversaturation index as low as 1 5 in contrast to the uasb configuration which had a dissolved methane concentration 6 9 times higher than the equilibrium concentration to prevent the problem of oversaturation it has been recommended to assist biogas with mixing which could guarantee a minimum concentration of dissolved methane in the effluent 37 71 in the study by ferrari et al 2019 6 regarding temperature changes during operation dissolved methane did not significantly decrease and remained at an average of 8 2 mg l 1 in the anaerobic effluent this was directly related to the mixing produced by a high recirculation rate in the membrane it can also be advantageous to utilize frequent back flushing of membrane modules to obtain a non saturated effluent as observed by giménez et al 2012 71 yeo et al 2015 72 propose confirming microbial reaction kinetics that trigger the methane production rate to lessen super saturation of dissolved methane especially in anmbrs in addition it has recently been reported that decreasing an anaerobic reactor s volumetric flowrate especially for anmbr is an alternative method to mitigate methane release in the effluent 15 in addition to oversaturation the release of methane gas in the headspace of an anaerobic reactor initially determines the concentration of dissolved methane in the effluent guo et al 2016 79 enumerate and evaluate the factors that affect the stability and transfer of methane in the gas phase temperature ph srt organic loading rate olr and hrt several authors have recognized the olr as a parameter affecting methane release in anaerobic effluents for instance a recent study by maría henares et al 2018 21 concludes that aqueous methane content increases progressively with the olr when feeding an egsb with an olr of 4 2 kgcod m 3 d 1 a methane concentration of 13 5 mg l 1 was registered with an olr of 30 2 kgcod m 3 d 1 the methane content was as high as 33 5 mg l 1 however galib et al 2016 73 report that the dissolved methane concentration reduced in their experiment from 54 mg l 1 to 25 mg l 1 while olr increased gradually to 3 2 kg m 3 d 1 there has been very limited assessment of this olr influence and further systematic and theoretical analysis are required regulating ph is also a promising option to mitigate methane releases in the liquid phase having a low ph lower than 6 may trigger methanogenic inhibition and therefore reduce the methane content in both the liquid and gas phases 80 in contrast when operating under high ph higher than 8 5 chemical precipitation of calcium magnesium and carbonate may occur this precipitation causes inorganic fouling which leads to higher methane losses as it potentially limits methane mass transfer throughout the mc 80 lastly methane generation in the liquid and gas phases may be influenced by the srt and the hrt thus longer srt and hrt leads to greater dissolved methane 81 this influence was quantified by yeo and lee 2013 82 with 57 higher methane losses for an srt of 40 days than an srt of 20 days this means that at higher srts the methane production rate does not exceed the methane transfer rate from the liquid phase to the gas phase their results also show that oversaturation was mitigated by an srt of 40 days thus working with a high srt guarantees a low oversaturation index however a low hrt combined with a high olr may generate fouling problems 79 furthermore bougie and iliuta 2013 83 discovered that with a shorter hrt of 1 h the methane content in the liquid phase increased up to 67 of the whole methane production as stated above defining the real foundations of the oversaturation phenomenon is one of the foremost challenges for researchers into methane recovery in anaerobic bioreactors processes thus controlling oversaturation from its source may be advantageous for mitigating methane release in the anaerobic permeate in the current research only a hypothesis is proposed and this should be examined in future studies furthermore the ambiguous findings signal the need for additional studies to understand more about the relationship between the olr effect and dissolved methane concentrations an anaerobic bioreactor should operate at high temperatures low biogas pressure and with a constantly maintained ph between 6 5 and 8 5 to mitigate methane releases 48 furthermore the wastewater feed to the anaerobic process should have low sulfate concentrations low salinity and a low organic rate to avoid fiber blocking and wetting issues a short srt is an excellent alternative for obtaining a low dissolved methane concentration approximatively equal to the equilibrium concentration in the anaerobic effluent finally it is also worth noting that the installation of a separation technique in upstream processes is crucial for avoiding clogging fouling and wetting problems in uasb and egsb effluents quantification of the dissolved methane concentration in anaerobic effluent is critical to clearly describe the effect of bioreactor operational parameters on the subsequent membrane degassing process this consequently enables accurate estimation of the bioreactor s performance 2 2 quantification of dissolved methane concentration quantification of the dissolved methane is generally achieved using henry s constant 21 40 which is mainly based on the gas liquid equilibrium in this method chromatography vials are placed under vacuum and sealed to enable closed atmosphere sampling after preparation of the vials samples are collected until the pressure is equilibrated following collection a gas liquid equilibrium is established by continuous stirring after equilibration a precise volume of the headspace is sampled and injected into a gas chromatograph hence the methane fraction in the headspace vials is quantified the dissolved methane concentration is then computed using the equation below 1 c m l c m g v g hv l v l where cm l and c m g are the concentration of dissolved methane and the methane gas concentration in the headspace after equilibrium mg l 1 respectively vl and vg are respectively the volumes of the liquid and gas phases in the vial ml and h is the dimensionless henry s law constant for methane defined as gas per liquid concentration c m g h c m l this equation may also be established by using bunsen s solubility coefficient α 84 this coefficient is defined as the volume of saturating gas that is absorbed by a unit volume of pure solvent at 273 15 k and 1 bar its expression is correlated to henry s constant as follows 2 h α r t o where t0 is 273 15 k α is the bunsen solubility coefficient r is the gas constant and h is henry s constant which is defined as follows 3 h c j d p j mol m 3 pa 1 where c j d is the concentration of a species in the aqueous phase and p j is the partial pressure of that species in the gas phase under equilibrium conditions since the parameters mentioned in section 2 1 are not always controlled methane can be trapped in the liquid phase and should be recovered by mc for economic and environmental reasons the next section discusses the main principles and basics of mc and develops the key theoretical approaches for this degassing unit 3 membrane contactors for dissolved methane degassing residual methane in anaerobic effluents can be harnessed to generate calorific energy and electrical power that can then be returned to the anaerobic bioreactor to achieve self sufficient wastewater treatment many technologies for removing or recovering dissolved methane in effluent from anaerobic wastewater treatment have been proposed these include aeration tray aerators spray aeration and diffused aeration gas stripping biological oxidation and degassing membranes such as mc of these technologies the use of mc is the most potent technique for recovering dissolved methane according to several studies due to its cost effectiveness energy efficiency operational robustness and versatility 14 49 however despite its high methane recovering efficiency compared to traditional techniques membrane use has not yet spread to large scale wastewater treatment plants due to the crucial need for additional pre treatment to avoid clogging and fouling issues 51 3 1 hollow fiber membrane contactor principles membrane contactors in our case hmfcs are a technology that offers non dispersive contact between two phases to initiate a mass transfer between them 85 in degassing anaerobic effluents the membrane is implemented as a barrier to isolate both phases through which a mass transfer transfer is established from the aqueous phase to the gas phase 38 as shown in fig 4 unlike conventional membrane technologies in which the separation process mainly occurs due to transmembrane pressure the driving force in mc is mainly the concentration gradient 14 during the dissolved methane recovery process a sweep gas or vacuum is usually applied fig 4 and the anaerobic effluent is brought into contact with a hydrophobic membrane that may be dense porous 21 86 or composite 64 87 within the membrane module one phase gas or liquid is channeled into the hollow fibers on the lumen side and the other phase flows on the shell side in different configurations co current counter current and cross flow configuration fig 4 a b and c operation is generally continuous aiming to maintain the impetus for the separation process 52 the use of hollow fiber membranes especially porous hollow fiber membranes in degassing systems has become widespread due to their small diameter high porosity and low wettability moreover hollow fiber membranes provide high packing densities with large membrane areas per unit volume up to 5000 m2 m 3 extensive literature has accumulated on the integration of dense and composite membranes a dense support coated with a porous layer in wastewater treatments for anaerobic effluents 3 2 theoretical mass transfer approach on a smaller scale the dissolved gas first diffuses from the bulk liquid phase to the liquid membrane boundary layer before permeating across the membrane pores porous membrane or through the membrane thickness dense membrane and then transferring from the membrane gas boundary layer to the gas phase 88 this section will be dedicated to discuss the theoretical estimation of the overall and the individual mass transfer coefficients 3 2 1 estimation of individual mass transfer coefficients the individual mass transfer coefficients kl kg and km depend on the flux characteristics in the liquid and gas phases these can be estimated using correlations depending on reynold s number re the sherwood number sh the schmidt number sc and the membrane module s geometries various empirical relationships have been established for estimating sherwood s dimensionless number 89 90 the most common correlations used in the literature to estimate the liquid mass transfer coefficient flowing on the shell or lumen side of a hollow fiber membrane the gas mass transfer coefficient and the membrane coefficient are summarized in table 2 for kl estimation on the lumen side lévèque s correlation has been shown to be the most accurate model if the graetz number gz or d h l re sc is higher than 4 this model avoids overestimation of the liquid mass transfer coefficient and hence overestimation of the methane recovery efficiency this is reinforced in studies by mcleod jefferson and mcadam 2016 and tai et al 1994 29 102 in which the theoretical data comply with the measured data at a gz or d h l re sc exceeding 4 to enhance the latter model s accuracy rongwong et al 2018 33 suggest a modification for a wider range of gz 0 4 to 100 an accurate model for the mass transfer coefficient has not yet been validated for the liquid phase for the shell side operation maría henares et al 2018 21 compare the two common existing models from the study prasad and sirkar s 1988 93 data is less conformable to experimental data than the dahuron and cussler 1988 94 model it has been reported that vacuum based operation is not compatible with dahuron and cussler 1988 94 model since it underestimates the liquid mass transfer resistance as with the liquid mass transfer coefficient lévèque s correlation is the commonly used equation for the quantification of the gas mass transfer coefficient finally regarding the membrane mass transfer coefficient the equations are dependent on the porosity of the membrane and are adapted for wetting the effect of fouling on membrane resistance is discussed in a later section current research on these mass transfer coefficient estimations leaves critical gaps despite the attention of researchers no one has determined new mathematical expressions or validated the current ones this is delaying the spread of mc installation because of the inability to predict the amount of dissolved methane recoverable and thus the efficiency of the system 3 2 2 estimation of the overall mass transfer coefficient the mass transfer phenomenon is based on a concentration difference between the lumen side and the shell side the molar flux j is therefore expressed using the effective dissolved gas s concentration and pressure as follows 7 j k g p g b p g m k m p g m p l m k l c l m c l b where kl km and kg are the individual mass transfer coefficients for liquid membrane and gas side respectively c and p correspond to the liquid concentration and the gas pressure the subscripts g b g m l m and l b represent gas bulk gas membrane interface liquid membrane interface and liquid bulk respectively referring to henry s law the gas partial pressure is correlated to the concentration of gas dissolved in the liquid phase at thermodynamic equilibrium 8 p l m h c l m where h is the henry s law constant the overall mass transfer coefficients kg in the gas phase and kl in the liquid phase can be written as follows 9 j k g p g b p eq k l c eq c l b 10 p eq h c l b 11 p g b h c eq according to eqs 7 to 11 12 1 k t g h k l 1 k m 1 k g is the overall mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase 13 1 k t l 1 h k t g 1 k l h k m h k g is the overall mass transfer coefficient in the liquid phase eqs 12 and 13 reveal that the mass transfer mechanism encounters three resistances in series on transfer from one phase to another and this gas liquid contacting process may be restricted by mass transfer limitations these resistances analogous to electrical resistances are shown in fig 5 the mass transfer resistances are liquid boundary layer resistance gas boundary layer and membrane resistance since gas diffusivity into the gas phase is much higher than gas diffusivity into the liquid phase d ch4 gas 10 6 m2 s 1 against d ch4 water 10 9 m2 s 1 the mass transfer resistance is usually controlled by the liquid phase s hydrodynamics 103 consequently the gas phase s boundary layer resistance may be considered negligible for partially soluble gases according to leiknes and semmens 2001 104 this is consistent with cookney et al s 2012 70 finding that no substantial change in methane removal efficiency occurred when the sweep gas s velocity was increased from 0 125 m s 1 to 3 11 m s 1 with a constant flowrate nevertheless this hypothesis is not applicable when working under low gas velocities and when the gas boundary layer is very thick many authors have developed and tested mathematical models for quantifying the overall mass transfer resistance in mc when no fouling or wetting occurs the overall mass transfer coefficient on the liquid side of mc may be expressed as resistance in series by the two film model in steady state conditions 103 based on the concentration gradient presented in fig 5 14 1 k t l d e 1 k l d e h k m d ln h k g d i liquid on shell side mode 15 1 k t l d e 1 k l d i h k m d ln h k g d e liquid on lumen side mode where kt l m s 1 is the overall mass transfer coefficient based on the liquid side and kl km and kg m s 1 are the individual mass transfer coefficients in liquid membrane and gas phases respectively h is the dimensionless henry s constant defined as gas per liquid concentration c m g h c m l and de dln and di m are the external diameter logarithmic mean diameter and inner diameter of the membrane respectively when working with a dense membrane the resistance is directly correlated to the dense membrane s thickness δ d m and the permeability perm of the desorbed methane within the dense membrane support in composite membranes under the same conditions the addition of a thin layer on the porous support should be highlighted and the contribution of this dense layer should be included in the model of the resistance in series as shown in table 3 in addition controlling operational parameters has been shown to be an effective means to enhance mc performance in the following section mc performance is assessed in terms of permeation flux and recovery efficiency the main operational parameters are also identified and their effects on the methane permeation flux the methane recovery efficiency and the individual mass transfer resistances are discussed 4 membrane contactor recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents relevant studies focusing on the use of mc have especially been undertaken for methane recovery from anaerobic effluents applications many authors aim to optimize the methane recovery process by testing the main parameters either experimentally or by means of simulations this optimization is constrained by the efficiency productivity and operational costs of the process in this state of the art work the primary focus is on the experimental perspective rather than the economic aspects of the process since the local mass transfer coefficients are challenging to quantify experimentally researchers mainly focus on determining the overall experimental mass transfer kt exp the methane s transmembrane flux j and the recovery efficiency re to quantify mc performance mc performance is dependent on several interconnected parameters as discussed in section 2 parameters related to the upstream anaerobic bioreactor configuration may have unfavorable consequences in addition altering the bioreactor s effluent composition the membrane s structure dense porous or composite and the membrane s main characteristics such as permeation area packing fraction φ and number of fibers n may optimize the recovery process furthermore the operational parameters are usually optimized for better performance these parameters include the mc temperature the transmembrane pressure the gas phase renewal method sweeping gas or vacuum the liquid and gas flowrates and the gas to liquid ratio 4 1 membrane characteristics the membrane configuration and its characteristics play a key role in providing a high mass transfer area between the liquid and gas phases which is essential to optimize mc performance several studies have lately focused on the effect of the membrane s properties on methane recovery efficiency these studies use typical hydrophobic polymeric materials such as polydimethylsiloxane pdms for dense membranes and polypropylene pp polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe for porous membranes polyethylene pe polyurethane pu and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf for composite membranes 49 105 a comparison of some of these membrane types and materials is shown in table 4 4 1 1 dense membranes a dense pdms membrane is an auto supported symmetrical membrane made of a single material fig 6 a it is a generally a highly permeable membrane with high methane 1200 barrer and co2 3020 barrer permeability values this membrane is depicted in table 4 with other polymeric membrane materials that may provide efficient recovery of dissolved methane 106 nevertheless permeability is limited by membrane thickness 65 1000 μm which can increase the membrane s resistance and therefore decrease methane permeation flux additionally other biogas compounds such as hydrogen sulfide 36 000 barrer and water vapor 60 000 barrer are characterized by higher permeability coefficients than methane through pdms dense membranes 32 107 hence these compounds permeate more easily than methane in the gas phase but at low concentrations non porous membranes are also capable of selectively recovering one component over another membrane selectivity may be defined as the ratio of the permeability coefficients of the gases to be separated and should be around 2 for effective separation in the case of dense membranes selectivity is related to the transport rate of each compound and the diffusion mechanism is dependent on the membrane material pdms which is a silicone rubber polymer is widely used to separate organic gases and records an average value of 3 4 for selection of co2 over methane 113 additionally some studies reveal that the rubbery copolymer poly ether b amide peba may be a promising alternative for the desorption of dissolved methane due to its outstanding sorption selectivity 114 for instance hao pritzker and feng 2009 investigated the separation of phenol from dilute aqueous solutions using pervaporation and a poly ether block amide pebax 2533 membrane the membrane showed remarkable phenol sorption preference over water the outlet sorbate in the membrane module reached a phenol concentration up to 80 90 wt at 353 k which is equivalent to a solubility separation factor of 450 4000 unfortunately membranes that select methane over co2 are not available at industrial scales and thus the implementation of an additional separation process downstream is crucial to purify the methane stream 115 4 1 2 porous membranes porous membranes are membranes formed of pores fig 6 b and provide a high permeation area as well as a small footprint 40 116 however like ptfe and pe membranes pp membranes have low porosity and can be subject to high membrane resistance it has been reported in the literature that a porous pp membrane can recover up to 99 of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluent 40 117 some authors have also evaluated the performance of mc when changing its porosity and showed that porous membranes outperformed dense membranes in recovery efficiency 33 40 117 for instance cookney et al 2016 40 show that the recovery efficiency for dissolved methane was always lower for a dense membrane 92 6 to 10 8 than for a porous membrane 98 9 to 63 3 when increasing the liquid velocity from 0 0004 m s 1 to 0 047 m s 1 this may be attributed to the high membrane thickness of pdms 250 μm that may increase the membrane transfer resistance up to 19 035 s m 1 especially at high liquid velocity table 4 indicates that porous pp membranes have low thickness compared to the other membrane types and intermediate contact angle values 100 118 nevertheless porous membranes are prone to wetting and clogging problems which could compromise mc performance 4 1 3 composite membranes to enhance the hydrophobicity and porosity of conventional membranes several studies used composite and modified membranes 87 103 this type of membrane comprises two main parts a dense selective layer and a porous support made from different materials as presented in fig 6 c this combination of dense selective and porous layers is commonly used to lower membrane mass transfer resistance while maintaining the same selectivity properties as the dense membranes table 4 shows that composite membranes provide very high water contact angles that guarantee high hydrophobicity of the membrane around 123 depending on the material used like the dense membranes composite membranes can tolerate high pressure and are generally characterized by high selectivity values for co2 over ch4 nevertheless sethunga karahan et al 2019 118 reveal that operating with a composite hollow fiber membrane with a thick coating could increase the contribution of the membrane to the total mass transfer resistance furthermore in a study conducted by ahmed semmens and voss 2004 119 evaluating oxygen mass transfer in composite membranes the membrane resistance contribution ranged from 53 to 82 of the overall mass transfer resistance when reynold s number was between 2500 and 5500 and water velocities between 0 8 and 1 8 m s 1 this observation may be applicable to methane analogous results could be expected since oxygen is a poorly soluble gas similar to methane in this regard 9 led a comparative theoretical study of commercial pdms and pp membranes and lab made composite membranes dhc pvdf and phm pdf he showed that the composite membrane phm pvdf had the lowest mass transfer resistance of 0 35 105 s m 1 for the whole range of velocities tested this membrane exhibited an experimental mass transfer resistance that was about 30 40 lower than the commercial pdms membrane and comparable to the commercial pp membrane for liquid velocity ranging from 0 15 to 0 30 m s 1 despite its larger pore size as showed in fig 7 phm pvdf presented a negligible membrane contribution to the overall mass transfer resistance and presented a theoretical liquid mass transfer resistance close to the experimental overall mass transfer resistance compared to porous membranes composite structures are generally characterized by high porosity up to 79 compared to 40 for a porous membrane and very small pore sizes as low as 0 055 μm surface porosity is a key characteristic of composite membranes since it reduces the overall mass transfer resistance as seen in fig 7 furthermore the tortuosity of composite membranes 1 8 seems to be lower than the tortuosity of porous membranes 6 4 these values suggest that composite membranes are characterized by low gas diffusivity in the membrane pores 120 in addition the small size of the membrane pores is beneficial allowing the composite structure to hinder the entry of water into the membrane pores limiting wetting issues the wetting problem is presented in section 5 when using composite and dense configurations in methane degassing processes no wetting phenomena occur according to maría henares et al 2018 2016 21 117 and the fouling effect is reduced according to the smoothness of the skin surface these problems are discussed in section 5 4 2 the composition of bioreactor effluent besides the membrane s properties many other parameters related to the effluent may greatly affect the performance of mc in downstream processing such parameters include the effluent composition particle size and total suspended solids according to sanchis perucho et al 2020 22 producing a high amount of sulfide an undesirable by product during biological digestion can have negative consequences metal sulfides may form and sulfur may be deposited on the inner fibers of the membrane leading to further clogging problems moreover due to its corrosive nature hydrogen sulfide can prevent an installation being used for long term operation clogging issues may also be associated with the presence of suspended solids and their relative size in the anaerobic effluent 52 at this stage anmbr is the most advantageous configuration it offers a high quality permeate that is generally free of suspended solids amounts are nearly negligible and it is characterized by low organic concentrations this is because anmbrs physically separate solids and microorganisms based on their dimensions conversely without a separation system upstream uasb and egsb effluents are dirtier than anmbr permeate due to their high concentrations of organics and suspended solids for instance cookney et al 2016 40 recorded a total cod concentration of 124 mg l 1 when working with a uasb configuration the effluent quality was enhanced when using an anmbr bioreactor for wastewater treatment concentrations of organic matter were as low as 18 mg l 1 thus coupling bioreactors and membrane technologies is very challenging due to the presence of natural biological foulant which is mainly organic matter such as microbial and extracellular polymer substances 21 despite its fouling effects organic matter may reduce the surface tension of effluent leading to a lower breakthrough pressure and hence inducing wetting problems in a downstream mc especially when operating with a porous membrane 21 40 83 121 the suspended solids content is the main factor limiting uasb and egsb deployment and adoption however many authors have experimented with the latter configuration such as bandara et al 2011 who noted total suspended solids of 28 mg l 1 when working with a uasb cookney et al 2016 found a total suspended solids content of 36 mg l 1 which is relatively high considering discharge requirements 122 thus high concentrations of this contaminant could generate overpressures in mc and create a poorly distributed flow through the membrane initiating clogging problems 52 particle size should also be taken into consideration to avoid pore blocking in mc many other contaminants such as moisture biosolids dust particles microorganisms organic carbons and inorganic salts may have a fouling effect and need to be lessened in anaerobic effluents 49 123 124 despite the fact that mc are less sensitive to fouling than pressure driven processes they can still be affected by fouling 21 for instance salt precipitation can lead to inorganic fouling and protein like foulants trigger organic and biological fouling by means of adsorption 103 these major problems are discussed in detail in section 5 4 3 operational parameters operational parameters are the main parameters that can be optimized and controlled to improve hfmc performance in this regard the most relevant experimental studies related to recovering dissolved methane from synthetic and real effluents are presented in table 5 this table permits accurate identification of the main operational parameters and describes their effect on mc system used for degassing 4 3 1 desorption or degassing mode sweep gas or vacuum desorption of dissolved gases is based on transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase through the permeation area of a membrane this mechanism is driven by a sweeping gas typically n2 in the lumen or shell side 70 127 or by continuously applying a vacuum or by both 126 there are many considerations in choosing the desorption or degassing mode including the processability of the operation the energy expenses and the energy demand for methane desorption vallieres and favre 2004 128 prove that the use of a sweep gas may be used to manage economic concerns for methane purification applying a vacuum is a promising option generally the highest recovery efficiencies have been obtained with sweep gas operation 70 90 these values can only be achieved with high vacuum values in the range of 800 to 940 mbar 80 000 to 94 000 pa 21 37 as an example sanchis perucho et al 2020 22 report a recovery efficiency of 80 in vacuum mode with a pressure vacuum of 800 mbar 80 000 pa a liquid flowrate of 50 l h 1 and a dense pdms membrane high vacuum may lower the gas side pressure and the gas s solubility therefore the gases are more likely to transfer to the gas phase which enhances the mass transfer between the liquid and the gas side of the mc 22 129 however cookney et al 2012 70 note a difference in the efficiency of dissolved methane recovery between the two methods when using sweep gas the recovery efficiency was as high as 72 when operating at the lowest liquid velocity the maximum recovery efficiency reported when applying a vacuum was around 80 under a vacuum of 308 mbar 30 800 pa this recovery efficiency at low vacuum pressure may be correlated to the low liquid velocity alongside the membrane 0 0056 m s 1 furthermore the authors detected a methane concentration of 0 028 v v in the recovered sweep gas at the highest recovery efficiency this could be attributed to the dilution of methane in the sweep gas stream furthermore in the studies cited in table 5 dense pdms membranes appear to be compatible with vacuums whereas porous pp membranes perform better with gas sweeping maría henares et al 2018 21 obtained recovery efficiencies as high as 98 with gas sweeping when using porous membranes with an egsb however this recovery efficiency slightly decreased when the gas phase renewal mode was switched to vacuum and remained at 93 when working under the same liquid flowrate 4 1 l h 1 these results were consistent with previous results that showed that maximum recovery efficiencies of 98 5 can be obtained when using pp porous membranes combined with a sweeping gas and low liquid flux maría henares et al 2018 and m henares et al 2016 21 117 report pore wetting when operating with a porous pp membrane and vacuum pressures of 140 800 mbar 14 000 80 000 pa 4 3 2 gas phase hydrodynamics 4 3 2 1 sweep gas mode mc performance is generally related to the gas phase hydrodynamics when working with a sweep gas because of dilution to examine this dilution effect and the gas phase hydrodynamics of an mc performance a large number of studies have tested the effect of the sweep gas s flowrate or velocity on methane content in the gas phase and on recovery efficiency 21 40 70 117 126 for instance cookney et al 2012 70 recorded a constant recovery efficiency of 25 when varying the sweep gas s velocity from 0 125 to 3 11 m s 1 which is equivalent to a range of re values between 26 and 651 at a fixed liquid velocity of 0 0125 m s 1 this is consistent with the results obtained by maría henares et al 2018 21 when increasing the sweep gas flowrate from 26 to 800 l h 1 the performance of the mc in terms of efficiency remained unchanged these observations may be explained by the low partial pressure of methane in the gas phase due to high dilution and the independence of gas phase hydrodynamics from the gas side mass transfer coefficient negligible resistance as stated in section 3 the gaseous phase boundary layer hence does not govern mass transfer since the gas phase s mass transfer resistance can be negligible as has previously been demonstrated for partially soluble gases similar to methane 130 additionally 29 report that at the lowest sweep gas flowrate 0 61 lh 1 the decline in recovery efficiency was more pronounced when increasing the liquid velocity to its maximum value of 1 2 10 5 m s 1 equivalent to 43 2 l h 1 in addition m henares et al 2016 117 report that recovery efficiency is enhanced when the gas flux is increased at high liquid flowrates these findings are in contrast with maría henares et al s 2018 21 results in which the gas flowrate did not affect the recovery performance when applying n2 flowrates in the range of 26 800 l h 1 these results are much higher than the sweep gas flowrate values tested by mcleod jefferson and mcadam 2016 29 4 3 2 2 vacuum mode since sweeping gas presents several non desirable effects vacuum use has been widely examined for recovering methane from anaerobic effluents combining the use of a vacuum with mc can improve the gas side purity of methane since no sweep gas is used nevertheless the polymeric membranes conventionally used have low selectivity values between methane and the other gases present in the gas side this is in line with sethunga et al s 2018 116 study in which the authors demonstrate that the interaction between co2 and ch4 can reduce the mole fraction of methane in the gas phase moreover the use of a vacuum has been widely adopted to obtain higher methane fluxes and increased mc productivity however it triggers several operational issues and requires the greatest energy expenditure 128 as an example bandara et al 2011 64 detected a significant quantity of air leakage in their vacuum based system that led to an underestimation of the amount of methane in the gas phase additionally m henares et al 2017 37 reveal that the use of vacuum pumps is noisy generates intense odors creates instability and causes malfunctions 4 3 2 3 the hybrid sweep gas and vacuum mode to overcome the drawbacks of desorption or degassing modes sweep gas and vacuum can be applied simultaneously using both renewal gas phase techniques may increase the impetus between the two phases however despite the considerable number of references on the removal of dissolved oxygen from water through hfmc 131 132 only a few authors use a combination mode to recover methane from anaerobic effluent 22 sanchis perucho et al 2020 22 reported that using a combination mode increases methane recovery efficiencies and lessens mass transfer resistances in comparison to the individual operational modes in the study almost 90 of the total dissolved methane was recovered at a vacuum pressure higher than 100 mbar 10 000 pa with the sweep gas s flowrate fixed at 0 5 l h 1 however in an earlier study maría henares et al 2018 21 obtained a similar recovery efficiency when applying only vacuum in the gas phase at a similar liquid flowrate and a vacuum pressure of 500 mbar 50 000 pa the results may reveal that for the combination mode high efficiencies are obtained at a relatively low vacuum pressure 100 mbar or 10 000 pa whereas for the vacuum mode alone similar efficiencies are recorded but at greater vacuum pressures 500 mbar or 50 000 pa thus energy consumption may be lower in the combination mode permitting a self sufficient process as the energy production is higher than the energy expenditure moreover some authors recommend implementing several modules in series to obtain higher methane purity and achieve the discharge content in closed vessels 29 40 this method appears to be an alternative for achieving better performances since it is economically viable according to mcleod jefferson and mcadam 2016 29 4 3 3 liquid phase hydrodynamics liquid flowrate is another key parameter to optimize to achieve better mc performances in the studies presented in table 5 several conclude that dissolved methane stripping performance is decreased when applying a high effluent flowrate 22 126 as an example cookney et al 2012 70 observed a reduction of approximately 60 when the liquid flow was set 20 times higher than the initial value these results agree well with the findings of bandara et al 2011 64 who obtained similar recovery efficiencies at higher liquid velocities maría henares et al 2018 21 also detected a decrease in the mc recovery efficiency from 98 to almost 67 when increasing the feed flowrate from 4 1 to 27 2 l h 1 in a lumen side mode this drop in the efficiency of stripping dissolved methane is due to the residence time in the mc the contact time between the two phases is reduced along with the recovery efficiencies in addition at high liquid flowrates membrane resistance may dominate as mentioned by maría henares et al 2018 and peng vane and liu 2003 21 133 however very low flow rates may induce stagnation at the membrane surface that may greatly contribute to an increase in the liquid side s mass transfer resistance reducing the overall mass transfer coefficient and therefore the methane permeation flux a compromise is needed between working with a low liquid flowrate which enhances the efficiency of recovering dissolved methane and working at high flowrates to improve the dissolved methane s permeation flux and the final methane concentration in the gas phase as stated by sanchis perucho et al 2020 22 4 3 4 flow configuration and operating mode aside from the aforementioned parameters the flow configuration appears to have a considerable influence on mc performance conventionally the liquid and gas fluids are conducted through the membrane in co current flow cross flow or counter current flow on opposite sides of the membrane 134 few studies examine the effect of the flow configuration on the efficiency of mass transfer according to demontigny tontiwachwuthikul and chakma 2006 135 mass transfer efficiencies are improved by 20 when working in counter current flow rather than in co current flow compared to co current and counter current flows transverse flow tends to exhibit better efficiency avoiding channeling bypassing drawbacks and showing scale up potential 136 137 to date no studies have been conducted on transverse flow for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents hence more work is necessary to examine mc performance in recovering dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents regarding the operating mode an mc may be operated with the effluent channeled either inside the fiber lumen side mode or outside shell side mode lumen side mode is frequently used in the studies reviewed in table 5 103 126 it is practical when the feed solution has low suspended solids and sulfide concentrations as is typical in an anmbr effluent or a uasb or egsb effluent pre treated by an upstream filtration process shell side mode is adopted to avoid clogging problems especially in long term operation 22 40 103 however working at low velocities in shell side mode may create membrane fouling as demonstrated by maría henares et al 2017 2018 21 37 despite its susceptibility to clogging issues working in lumen side mode provides a higher mass transfer area since all the fibers are traversed by the effluent and the efficiency of the process of stripping dissolved methane is consequently improved for instance m henares et al 2017 37 show that at low liquid velocities 0 5 l h 1 the recovery efficiencies of lumen side mode reached 77 and were greater than those obtained with shell side mode 35 however for high liquid velocities 6 l h 1 the two modes presented similar efficiencies as depicted in fig 8 b fig 8 a also demonstrates that when applying vacuum to mc the efficiency values when working in lumen or shell side mode at a fixed pvac of 800 mbar 80 000 pa are similar at a low liquid flowrate 0 5 l h 1 this re difference is more pronounced compared to sweep gas mode at a high liquid flowrate 6 l h 1 optimizing mc performance is a challenging task since it depends on various parameters a promising pathway is to use a combination of both vacuum and sweep gas methods to reach relatively high efficiencies with low energy expenditure in addition it is recommended to use an intermediate liquid velocity with a gas to liquid ratio of around 0 03 moreover transverse flow is generally recommended since it avoids channeling and bypass problems and is suitable for scaled up applications however counter current flow enhances mass transfer between the two phases concerning the operating mode lumen side is favored when the membrane has a low packing density and when the effluent is characterized by a high concentration of total suspended solids to prevent fiber clogging m henares et al 2016 117 observed severe channeling phenomenon when conducting the effluent in shell side mode as reported the permeation area did not fully contribute to the recovery process since the effluent did not pass through all the fibers this led to lower reynold s number values and hence a reduced mass transfer using a composite membrane may also be a helpful alternative for effective mc degassing due to the high permeation area although great efforts have been made to enhance the efficiency and productivity of mc systems especially in long term experiments the challenges that the dissolved methane stripping encounters have not been widely addressed in the literature 4 3 5 presence of other compounds along with methane co2 is a common gas in biogas contributing 30 50 of the total mass hence typical anaerobic effluents are characterized by a high amount of total inorganic carbon as a result it is expected that a large amount of co2 may be desorbed alongside methane during the recovery process few authors have investigated the effect of co2 desorption on the process of recovering dissolved methane it is reported by rongwong et al 2017 129 that co2 desorption improves the rate of ch4 recovery by lowering the partial pressure of ch4 in the gas phase and increasing the gas phase s mass transfer coefficient to assist ch4 desorption the desorbed co2 boosted the mass transfer impetus moreover the simultaneous desorption of these gaseous compounds increased the total gas molar flow rate therefore a higher mass transfer coefficient may be achieved in the gas phase through their modeling study the authors proved that without co2 desorption a methane recovery efficiency of 50 5 was recorded whereas this reached 65 when the recovery process was assisted by co2 desorption in contrast however the study conducted by dutta li and lee 2021 138 suggests that co2 has a negligible effect on the methane recovery process when varying the ph from 7 5 to 8 1 which corresponds to an increase in co2 concentration of a factor of 4 the methane concentration remained stable and similar recovery efficiency was recorded over 24 h of operation during the methane recovery process substantial water evaporation may occur resulting in high water vapor concentrations in the desorbed gas due to the presence of water vapor in the gas mixture energy intensive purification processes such as dehydration are required before the gas can be used in power and heat systems additionally the loss of latent heat due to water evaporation can significantly lower the input temperature resulting in higher methane solubility and as a result slowed methane desorption despite its noteworthy advantages such as a high mass transfer area high packing densities and low energy consumption industrial use of hfmc has been severely limited due to numerous operational challenges as a result the following section highlights contemporary concerns with hfmc focusing on membrane performance limitations caused by fouling wetting and clogging concentration polarization channeling and capillary condensation are also discussed since they can affect dissolved methane stripping 5 long term operation concentration polarization fouling and wetting challenges 5 1 concentration polarization concentration polarization is a major disadvantage in hfmc systems this phenomenon occurs in liquid solvent solute membrane separation when the solute is enriched in a thin boundary layer close to the membrane compared to its concentration in the bulk feed when a component has a high diffusivity compared to the diffusivity of other components it is preferentially transferred to the gas phase while the other components permeate more slowly through the membrane therefore the concentration of a slower compound in the liquid boundary layer is higher than its concentration in the gas phase this generates a concentration gradient and consequently an additional mass transfer resistance may form as shown in fig 9 a the severity of the impact of concentration polarization on both dense and porous membranes in the desorption of ch4 from water was assessed by cao lee and feng 2020 32 as the permeate pressure was reduced by applying greater vacuum pressure polarization became more severe using a high vacuum slows down the desorption process of methane in addition the study shows that an increased feed flow may reduce the influence of concentration polarization but this would limit recovery efficiency this issue is not widely examined in the literature and more studies should be undertaken to prevent additional mass transfer resistance and thus to enhance mc performance through a modeling study cao lee and feng 2020 32 also investigated the effect of the different resistance types on the extraction of dissolved methane from aqueous solutions the authors showed that liquid mass transfer resistance is a key factor for mitigating concentration polarization concentration polarization is negligible when membrane resistance dominates but it is significant when the liquid boundary layer s resistance controls the overall mass transfer coefficient hence the permeation flux and the permeate methane fraction are decreased and an optimum separation performance is not achieved 5 2 fouling fouling is generally defined as the accumulation of undesirable deposits in hfmc systems fig 9 b it generally leads to considerable harmful impacts depending on the fouling type that occurs during the methane recovery process we will present through this section the fouling types their main consequences and give some insights on how to limit fouling occurrence 5 2 1 fouling types when combining biological reactors and membrane technologies two main fouling mechanisms may occur internal and external fouling internal fouling generally known as clogging is triggered by foulants accumulating inside the membrane pores as a result of progressive pore narrowing or partial blocking it is generally caused by the presence of total suspended solids in the anaerobic effluent and can result in membrane overpressures and unfavorable flow distribution especially when the anaerobic effluent is fed on the shell side 21 139 in contrast external surface fouling depends on the impurities originally present in the anaerobic effluent that have a high affinity for the hydrophobic materials composing the membrane surface these may trigger organic fouling inorganic fouling and biofouling by the sorption mechanism depending on the material type the deposition from the feed of inorganic colloidal particles such as silicate sodium chloride and calcium carbonate causes inorganic fouling the formation of organic fouling is caused by the deposition of organic molecules such as fulvic acid finally microorganisms are mostly responsible for biological fouling by adsorption phenomena on the membrane surface the adsorbed organic and inorganic compounds may alter the membrane s hydrophobicity leading to increased wetting issues as a result a number of fouling issues may arise during dissolved methane recovery making fouling control more challenging furthermore pore blocking is an irreversible phenomenon that can damage the membrane surface fouling is reversible through adapted chemical cleaning techniques 5 2 2 fouling consequences the consequences of fouling depend on the fouling type for instance internal fouling may generate clogging issues and therefore membrane damage which alters considerably the membrane s hydrophobicity external fouling may trigger the formation of an additional fouling cake layer or scaling around the fiber this contributes to a considerable increase in the overall mass transfer resistance leading to lower methane fluxes through the membrane especially in long term experiments as depicted in fig 10 rongwong et al 2019 103 examined the formation of fouling when recovering dissolved methane from two different types of anaerobic effluent real uasb and anmbr effluents they used a surface modified pvdf hollow fiber membrane at the same effluent velocity of 0 021 0 029 m s 1 in the case of the uasb real effluent the initial methane flux decreased from 1 22 10 8 kmol m 2 s 1 to 7 32 10 9 kmol m 2 s 1 equivalent to a 40 drop within 5 h and to 1 22 10 9 kmol m 2 s 1 equivalent to a 90 drop after 38 h of operation however when using an anmbr effluent the reduction in methane permeation flux was less intense after 37 h of operation the flux had declined gradually from 8 49 10 9 kmol m 2 s 1 to 5 049 10 9 kmol m 2 s 1 which is equivalent to a 40 drop these results were correlated to potential biofouling since the results of the field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fesedm eds revealed the presence of protein like components based on the evenly distributed oxygen and nitrogen elemental mappings fig 11 a b within the cake layer but no inorganic fouling was detected furthermore they observed via excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence that the cake layer was mainly formed of polymeric substances eps rongwong et al s 2019 103 findings are consistent with maría henares et al s 2018 21 results they also recorded a decline in mc performance when using a porous pp membrane for 200 h of dissolved methane stripping however this recovery efficiency decline of 29 is less intense than the reduction recorded by rongwong et al s 2019 103 owing to the use of an unfiltered anmbr effluent maría henares et al s 2018 21 also attributed the fouling to organic and inorganic substances since 50 500 mg l 1 of suspended solids were detected in a sodium hydroxide cleaning solution after 120 min of cleaning according to m henares et al 2017 37 monitoring the ph is an alternative solution for characterizing the fouling layer when there is an increase or a decrease in the ph value throughout the membrane the concentrations of anions and cations are varying this indicates that salt has precipitated resulting in an inorganic fouling layer one of the challenges for researchers in this domain is to identify and quantify the effects of different fouling types on mc performance during dissolved methane recovery additional studies to understand more completely the key tenets of fouling are required besides the effluent type the liquid velocity appears to be an important parameter governing fouling rongwong et al s 2019 103 reveal that an increase in liquid velocities from 0 021 to 0 029 m s 1 led to a sharp flux decline from 47 to 68 it was concluded that a higher liquid velocity may trigger greater foulant concentrations that may interact with the membrane surface to generate more fouling these results are controversial with maría henares et al s 2018 21 findings suggesting that high liquid velocities may enhance the shear stress on the membrane surface which is a promising alternative method to bypass the adsorption of organic and inorganic compounds the effect of liquid phase hydrodynamics remains barely addressed in the literature as a result a more systematic and theoretical investigation is needed to better understand this topic furthermore the porosity of the membrane appears to have a significant impact on fouling for example a porous pp membrane has low productivity in long term experiments due to the wetting issue despite its capacity to recover a high amount of dissolved methane sethunga karahan et al 2019 118 report that after 10 days of operation with a uasb effluent the methane s permeation flux dropped sharply by 70 of the initial flux this is in agreement with maría henares et al s 2018 21 results which showed that when operating with an egsb configuration methane recovery declined from 98 to 10 after 180 h hence as reported by sethunga karahan et al 2019 118 flux decline may be mitigated to 20 over 10 days by recovering methane from anmbr effluents with a pvdf membrane even though the addition of a dense layer may trigger additional mass transfer resistance the flux decline remains 29 less than the flux obtained by using conventional membranes this may be attributed to the capacity of the additional layer to mitigate fouling which is usually responsible for decreasing methane permeation however the modification of a hollow fiber membrane surface with a commercial perfluoropolyether appears not to be efficient for long term experiments as rongwong et al s 2019 103 show after 24 h of operation the methane permeation flux dropped 53 when operating with a uasb at low liquid velocities 0 021 m s 1 despite the flux decline in long term operation salt precipitation and adsorption of organic compounds on the membrane surface via combined van der waals capillary and electrostatic forces of attraction may result in fouling layer formation this may create additional mass transfer resistance as described in fig 9 b this additional resistance may be added to the three resistance in series model and thus enhance the overall mass transfer resistance as expressed below 103 21 1 k t d e 1 k l d e 1 k f d lnf h k m d ln h k g d i liquid in shell side mode where dln f d e 2 δ f d e ln d e 2 δ f d e 22 1 k t d e 1 k l d i 1 k f d lnf h k m d ln h k g d e liquid in lumen side mode where dln f d i d i 2 δ f ln d i d i 2 δ f where kf m s 1 and dlnf m are respectively the mass transfer coefficient and the logarithmic mean diameter of the fouling layer since the dissolved methane faces fouling resistance when diffusing throughout a porous fouling layer this resistance can also be written as a function of the layer porosity ε f and tortuosity τf fouling thickness δf m and diffusivity of methane in the effluent dl 2 67 10 9 m2 s 1 according to rongwong et al s 2019 132 23 r f d e k f d lnf δ f d e τ f ε f d l dln f estimating the quantification of this fouling resistance may be achieved by estimating the mass transfer loss in the membrane as stated in the following equation 24 r f d e k f d lnf 1 k t t 1 k t t 0 where k t t 0 is the total mass transfer coefficient of the clean membrane and k t t is the total mass transfer coefficient under continuous operation at time t appropriate detection of fouling on the membrane surface is a key metric for improving membrane efficiency in this regard many authors have focused on developing methods for reducing fouling these methods mainly focus on optimizing membrane properties pore size contact angle and so on and on developing cleaning methods 5 2 3 strategies to limit fouling minimizing fouling in mc for dissolved methane stripping has been a major challenge for researchers it has been advised to implement a pre treatment strategy including micro and ultrafiltration 22 103 116 activated carbon adsorption micro screens and biofouling removal by non oxidizing biocides downstream of the anaerobic bioreactor 40 49 especially for uasb and egsb bioreactors table 6 resumes the use of each treatment strategy in compliance with the anaerobic effluent composition furthermore additional periodical cleaning strategies guarantee more stable performance in long term exp eriments typical physical and chemical cleanings have mainly been adopted maría henares et al 2017 2018 21 37 performed a daily 30 minute backwashing of the membrane with deionized water they also recommended chemical cleaning for a period of 2 h with citric acid 10 v v and naoh 2 v v to remove inorganic and organic fouling respectively another alternative emerging for reducing fouling deposits is the use of antifouling membranes since biofilm and organic carbon adhesions are less likely to form on the smooth surfaces of dense skin layers numerous studies have used a porous membrane covered by a dense layer for instance while using mc bandara et al 2011 2012 10 64 recovered dissolved ch4 from real anaerobic effluents using a composite membrane with a dense pe layer on a porous pu substrate during the 18 month operation they were unable to identify significant membrane fouling m henares et al 2017 37 used a pdms membrane for ch4 desorption when working in lumen side mode unlike the prior case the effectiveness of the ch4 removal was found to be steady for 120 h before the membrane began to foul after 175 h of operation the flux had dropped by 40 but the performance of the membrane was restored by simply washing it with water under the same liquid operational conditions the results for shell side mode operation were substantially different the first period of consistent performance re 35 was significantly shorter than that reported in lumen operation 50 h furthermore with conventional water cleaning the recovery efficiency was only slightly restored about 20 and even after two consecutive chemical cleanings the authors record a reduction in mc performance after 20 h non reversible biofouling may be the main source of the unsatisfactory outcomes in the liquid phase on the shell side janus membranes are also emerging as a promising option for reducing fouling these are new asymmetric membranes with a hydrophobic and hydrophilic layer on the same side of the membrane originally used in membrane distillation processes by co depositing a pda or peim layer or grafting an oxidant induced pda layer on a pvdf or pp hollow fiber support the antifouling qualities of these composite pvdf membranes were enhanced and a high membrane performance in terms of permeate flux was maintained 143 145 additionally omniphobic membranes have received extensive attention for different membrane applications especially for membrane distillation systems in the presence of water such membranes are highly hydrophobic but in low surface tension liquids they become highly oleophobic in anaerobic effluents it is believed that because of the compromised interactions between the feed solution and the structure of the membrane s surface foulant attachments on membrane surfaces are likely to be limited to a narrow area 146 147 these findings indicate that janus and omniphobic membranes may have great potential for reducing membrane fouling in dissolved ch4 stripping finally clogging issues do not occur while degassing anmbr effluents because the bioreactor has an inner prefiltration membrane for uasb and egsb the membrane is prone to clogging it is suggested to install a pre filtration system of 5 10 μm before the anaerobic bioreactor to avoid clogging of the fibers at present membrane fouling in mc processes is not well explored the unavailability of commercial scale mc desorption technologies may be one problem in addition the characterization of fouling layer composition and the quantification of fouling s contribution to performance losses are in the early stages in this context future research should concentrate on minimizing fouling within mc with a particular focus on identifying and characterizing the fouling layer s key components 5 3 wetting and capillary condensation membrane based techniques for recovering dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents particularly mc made of hollow fiber porous membranes may be prone to the wetting problem they also face capillary condensation problems 5 3 1 wetting when the feed pressure exceeds the breakthrough pressure or when high vacuum pressure is applied on the gas side gradual water penetration into the membrane s pores occurs over a lengthy period of operation the young equation is conventionally used to calculate the breakthrough pressure as follows 25 p limit 2 βγcosθ r max where r max is the maximum pore radius γ is the liquid s surface tension and θ is the contact angle for cylindrical pores a factor of β 1 is used while for irregular pores 0 β 1 is used p limit stands for the breakthrough pressure which identifies the minimum needed pressure on the liquid side to trigger liquid to penetrate the membrane s pores the most important criterion for the steady and high efficiency operation of a pp module at an industrial scale is to maintain the operational parameters below the critical pressure at which wetting occurs the above correlation indicates that membranes with smaller pores have a higher breakthrough pressure which means they are less likely to wet however gas transit via tight pores may be slowed resulting in a decreased desorption flux hence the membrane should ideally have a hydrophobic surface layer with a small pore size over a porous substrate with a large pore size in addition increasing the contact angle may enhance the breakthrough pressure it can be deduced from young s equation that the value of this contact angle should exceed 90 to achieve higher breakthrough pressures furthermore lower surface tensions may lower breakthrough pressures resulting in wetting aqueous phases containing organic compounds such as the anaerobic effluent from uasb and egsb reactors are prone to cause wetting in porous membranes due to their lower surface tension as they are characterized by high amounts of organic matter according to centeno mora and chernicharo 2020 52 wetting problems have gained widespread attention and numerous studies have attempted to optimize mc systems for effective dissolved methane recovery with no wetting issues for instance sethunga karahan et al 2019 118 investigated the impact of pore wetting on the overall mass transfer coefficient when removing dissolved methane from saturated water by hfmc over a porous pp membrane when the velocity was gradually increased from 0 05 m s 1 to 0 3 m s 1 the overall mass transfer coefficient dropped by around 50 this significant reduction was attributed to pore wetting even though the researchers were sweeping gas for ch4 recovery from artificially saturated tap water the pore wetting problem is expected to be more pronounced if the same operating conditions are used with a real anaerobic effluent however cookney et al 2016 40 reveal that no wetting issues were witnessed when using a porous pp membrane with sweep gas as a gas renewal phase method even at the greatest liquid velocities 0 045 m s 1 which are 10 to 15 lower than the velocities evaluated by sethunga karahan et al 2019 118 nevertheless in this study a reduction in the removal efficiency was observed even though the overall mass transfer coefficient did not significantly change it could be posited that wetting and fouling problems decreased the recovery efficiency as described in section 3 however further studies should be undertaken to estimate the individual contribution of pore wetting in the reduction of experimental mc performance additionally referring to table 7 maría henares et al 2018 21 state that wetting problems were detected when operating at a vacuum pressure in the range of 140 800 mbar 14 000 80 000 pa and a constant liquid velocity of 0 327 m s 1 but no water penetrated the gas filled pores in sweep gas mode increasing vacuum pressure may lead to wetting problems and no optimum tmp value and liquid velocity have been determined to avoid membrane wetting in porous membranes for recovering dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents a promising option for avoiding pore wetting in porous membranes was proposed by jiménez robles et al 2021 126 combining the use of vacuum and sweep gas as depicted by table 7 no wetting issues were detected when working with a vacuum pressure between 100 and 480 mbar 10 000 48 000 pa and a sweep gas flowrate of 0 5 1 5 l h 1 from the authors point of view the presence of sweep gas appears to have an extra effect on the membrane surface preventing the critical transmembrane pressure from being exceeded despite avoiding wetting problems the use of nonporous membranes may lessen the dissolved methane permeation flows through the membrane the choice of appropriate operational conditions and membrane types for this application appears to be critical while a porous module is more efficient at slower flow rates pressure a non porous membrane performs better when the process requires faster liquid flow rates one of the main disadvantages of the wetting phenomenon is that it increases the overall mass transfer resistance and hence diminishes dissolved methane transport through the mc as shown in fig 9 c an additional mass transfer membrane resistance is added to the initial resistances even though porous hydrophobic membranes are used after a long period of operation the liquid occupies the gas filled pores when the feed pressure exceeds the threshold pressure or when a vacuum is applied instead of a sweep gas consequently the transfer of gas molecules is restricted at this stage the overall mass transfer coefficient estimation may be biased due to wetting and the estimation of this resistance of partially wetted membranes is mainly based on the fraction of wetted pores 21 26 1 k t d e 1 k l d e h k m 1 x h k m x h k g d i liquid in shell side mode 27 1 k t d e 1 k l d i h k m 1 x h k m x h k g d e liquid in lumen side mode where x represents the wetted fraction of the filled pores and k m and k m are the mass transfer coefficient of the wetted and non wetted pores m s 1 the estimation of fouling and wetting resistances for all membrane types is yet not fully characterized in the literature further modeling studies should focus on the quantification of these resistances to accurately estimate mc performance during the methane recovery process in this regard numerous techniques are being explored for maintaining mc performance in long term experiments fabrication of hydrophobic porous or composite membranes with highly hydrophobic materials such as ptfe 32 87 changing the membrane surface structure and properties 103 118 or designing novel membranes such as mixed matrix membranes 148 as an example according to table 7 wongchitphimon et al 2017 87 demonstrate that the use of an in house polymer fluorinated silica composite hollow fiber membrane guarantees long term mc performance when conducting experiments with water saturated feed the recovered methane flux remained in the range of 2250 2500 mgch4 m2 h which is equivalent to a drop of 10 during 320 h additionally sethunga karahan et al 2019 118 show that using a pvdf composite membrane coated with pdms is beneficial for dissolved methane stripping from uasb and anmbr effluents for both anaerobic effluents the methane permeation flux decline did not exceed 25 when working with the composite membrane whereas for the commercial porous pp membrane the flux reduction was as high as 63 this flux reduction could be attributed to an increase in the membrane resistance due to water entry into the membrane s pores as rangwala 1996 149 and r wang et al 2005 150 indicate wetting reaching approximately 2 may induce significant membrane resistance 60 as high as the total mass transfer and thus a higher overall mass transfer resistance 5 3 2 capillary condensation the phenomena of capillary condensation which is a concern even for wetting proof membranes with strong hydrophobicity has also been identified as a challenge for porous membranes the vapor pressure difference between the two sides of a membrane causes water to evaporate producing a water vapor flux across the porous membrane that is the cause of capillary condensation the water vapor eventually condenses over the membrane pores increasing membrane resistance the smaller the pore size the higher the capillary condensation propensity of membranes because the local vapor pressure may be able to easily reach the critical vapor pressure of water 151 152 to prevent capillary condensation it has been advised to use hydrophobic membrane materials with a high contact angle utilize suitable pore forming agents and choose an optimum pore size many authors have fabricated membranes with optimum pore size and hydrophobicity for instance wongchitphimon et al 2017 fabricated a highly hydrophobic θ 123 125 polymer fluorinated silica composite hollow fiber membrane with a pore size of 0 055 μm f li et al 2018 153 also reveal that the use of ptfe as a membrane material may avoid wetting and channeling issues due to its high contact angle 133 6 economic aspect and energy consideration wastewater treatment plants can be used to generate reusable water energy and valuable nutrients by switching from conventional aerobic activated sludge to anaerobic digestion based processes one of the main key benefits of anaerobic wastewater treatment is the production and recovery of biogas which typically contains 68 85 methane ch4 5 25 carbon dioxide co2 and 5 15 nitrogen n2 154 155 hence anaerobic wastewater treatment plants can function as resource recovery facilities where any potential operating cost is outweighed by the biogas production 156 6 1 gas phase management management methane can be used to generate energy in combined heat and power engines such as microturbines and internal combustion engines 36 157 another potential application for recovered ch4 that necessitates additional consideration is the biorefining of marketable byproducts from various biological methanotrophic processes several by products can be produced from different assimilation pathways using ch4 as a substrate including polyhydroxyalkanoates phas extracellular polymeric products eps ectoine c40 carotenoids lactic acid succinic acid 1 4 butanediol isobutanol isoprene and farnes 158 carbon dioxide co2 has several possible applications like cooling acid replacement calcium carbonate production and carbon source for algae growth the recovery of co2 has been reported by many authors 117 129 but its content in the gas phase has been rarely reported dissolved ammonia can be extracted from wastewater and combined with sulfuric acid to produce ammonium sulphate for concentrations above 1000 mgnh3 l 1 36 the content of other gases dissolved in anaerobic effluents such as n2 o2 and h2s in the recovered waste gas have not yet been reported in the literature thus more experimental research is required for an optimal characterization of the recovered waste gas to determine its suitability for its further use 6 2 energy production in anaerobic bioreactors among all the anaerobic bioreactors configurations the anmbr especially submerged anmbr has been proposed as the most suitable candidate for establishing self sufficient wastewater treatment plant with a high energy independency ratio defined as measured energy potential to total energy demand owing its potential to produce methane rich biogas as an energy source the energy independency ratio of anmbr would depend on influent characteristics reactor type and fouling control and its operating conditions it has been demonstrated that this technology can reach up to 2 02 kwh kgcodremoved of energy production which is 7 times more than its energy requirement expenditure in case 98 of the influent cod concentration was converted to ch4 159 the energy independency of anaerobic systems could be altered when treating an influent with low sulphate concentrations high cod concentrations or when working under low temperatures 15 c this could result in a negative net energy balance of the anaerobic systems hence the recovery and reuse of dissolved methane from its effluent would be beneficial knowing that the energy requirements for recovering dissolved methane accounts for 3 5 of the total energy production equivalent to 0 01 kwh m3 54 in this regard the main purpose of using hfmc is to maximize the dissolved methane recovery from anaerobic effluents and therefore harvest the usable energy as demonstrated in previous sections the dissolved methane recovery efficiency is strongly influenced by membrane inherent properties and operational parameters the recovery effectiveness of such technology has been published in several research to illustrate the its potential advantages 160 161 more significantly several studies have included the cost and energy needed for the operation of hfmc in their economic study of net energy generation 33 70 6 3 dissolved methane recovery and reuse even though no experiments are being conducted to assess the use of ch4 recovered from anaerobic effluents in actual systems at any scale some studies have conducted theoretical calculations of the potential benefits of this application specifically in terms of energy balance and economic viability this section summarizes the key findings in this area and addresses several components that are missing from the literature in order to provide a comprehensive view of these factors 6 3 1 energy balance the application of hfmc for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents has been proved as a net energy positive operation meaning that the total energy expenditure is lower than the recovered one many authors have predicted in their studies a positive net energy production values for such applications for instance cookney et al 2012 162 obtained a net energy output of 0 04 kwh m3 of wastewater containing 25 4 mgch4 l in another study rongwong et al 2018 92 found that a high strip gas flow rate and slight low vacuum pressure gave the highest net energy at 0 0495 kwh m3 from an anaerobic effluent containing 15 4 mgch4 l they also showed out that the net energy was optimized when the percentage recovery of the dissolved ch4 was around 88 90 all the net energy values obtained for recovering dissolved methane by membrane contactors are 10 times less than the values obtained with other dissolved methane recovery techniques for instance an average dissolved methane concentration of 17 1 g m3 was observed in an anaerobic effluent at 30 c of which nearly 90 could be recovered by means of a mechanical degasser at an energy cost of 0 12 kwh m3 163 some efforts have been made to quantify theoretically the minimum threshold value of ch4 content in the membrane contactor gas outlet for a possible conversion of methane into electricity rongwong et al 2018 92 demonstrated that at least 35 of methane should be produced in order to be harnessed as an energy source this minimum value could be achieved by tuning several operational parameters including gas phase renewal mode the membrane contactor configuration the antifouling properties of the membrane and the dissolved methane concentration in the influent 6 3 1 1 parameters affecting the energy balance a use of vacuum sweep gas from an energy standpoint sweep gas is preferred as vallieres and favre 2004 showed they found that using the sweep mode would result in a lower energy demand and concluded that a vacuum should only be employed if a non diluted waste gas is wanted this could be the case of methane since 35 of the total biogas production is needed for its electric conversion rongwong et al 2018 92 have found contradictory results when considering the energetical value of the recovered ch4 they discussed that increasing the sweep gas flow rate would reduce the required length of membrane and the energy demand for the liquid pump however this would dilute the outlet gas content and would require higher energy demand from vacuum in this regard the authors proved that the maximum net electric energy production of 0 049 kwh m3 was achieved when combining a g l ratio of 0 08 with a vacuum pressure of 900 mbar for a recovery efficiency of 90 a similar net energy production of 0 04 kwh m3 was estimated by cookney et al 2012 162 for re of 72 moreover sanchis perucho et al 164 demonstrated that increasing the vacuum pressure to 800 mbar can increase the energy production from 0 01 to 0 08 kwh m3 when using vacuum as the gas phase renewal method this is in line with henares et al 2016 117 findings who estimated the share of the energy required in vacuum operations from the total energy production to 0 01 and showed that the saved energy defined as the difference between the recovered electrical and demand of vacuum operation energies per cubic meter of treated effluent is positive for the whole range of vacuum pressures 140 800 mbar as shown in fig 12 additionally an optimum value of liquid flow rate for lumen side operation around 0 05 0 15 m3 day 1 was found despite the fact that some authors have demonstrated the efficiency of combining sweeping gas and vacuum modes 29 160 its economic aspect has not been examined the economic feasibility of this gas phase combination mode should be validated in future studies for a potential scale up b membrane anti fouling properties and mc configuration the membrane anti fouling properties are also a very potent parameter for increasing the net energy production sethunga et al 2021 106 analyzed the re values from anmbr and uasb effluents for a membrane contactor employing a surface modified pdms pvdf membrane the membrane performance was maintained for 7 days with a mild fouling propensity when the liquid velocity was fixed at 0 06 m s 1 under vacuum operation apart from exanimating methane recovery efficiencies they also carried out economic analysis where net energy values for each membrane were calculated it has been found that the membrane with anti fouling layer pdms co p1 could extract 3 more energy than the pdms membrane implying that the control of membrane fouling is highly important to secure the net energy production it is noteworthy that such difference in net energy production would become greater and more evident during the long term operations 165 on the other hand ch4 recovery using membrane and solvent liquid liquid membrane contactor was suggested to be more energy efficient by li et al 2019 the author proved that dissolved methane could be harvested with a relatively low energy input as such the authors achieved a recovery efficiency exceeding 90 from an anaerobic effluent with an initial saturated dissolved methane concentration of 16 4 g m3 at 35 c through an omniphobic membrane based process by using 0 04 mj m3 equivalent to 0 01 kwh m3 with solvent based membrane the energy balance was positive with an independency ratio of 5 at 15 c to 8 at 35 c the authors also discussed that the main energy demand for solvent came from the liquid pump for circulation and vacuum pump for ch4 desorption only and no additional energy required for gas purification this energy consumption was 20 and 120 times lower than vacuum membrane at 15 c and 35 c respectively c ch4 inlet concentration the inlet methane concentration or in other terms the oversaturation defined in section 2 seems to have a significant impact on the net energy production of the membrane contactor degassing system a high influent ch4 amount would affect membrane area required to recover the dissolved methane 92 additionally having more methane dissolved in anaerobic effluents implies a larger amount of methane to be transferred from the liquid to the gas phase which will need a better mass transfer mechanism through either enhancing the liquid and gas phase hydrodynamics or increase the vacuum pressure therefore this would suggest providing more electricity to the vacuum pump and to the liquid pump and thus reducing the net energy production of the process cookney et al 2012 162 calculated a net energy production of 0 04 kwh m3 for a recovery efficiency of 72 and an inlet dissolved methane concentration of 12 2 mg l 1 while henares et al 2017 166 estimated an energy net production of 3 5 times higher with a similar recovery efficiency of re 70 and 30 mg l 1 of dissolved methane in the inlet anaerobic effluent 6 3 2 economic feasibility and viability according to the energy balance using membrane contactors for dissolved methane recovery could be a self sufficient process this energy independence however is insufficient for scaling up such systems in this regard some authors calculated the payback period for anmbr mc systems theoretically for example sanchis et al 2021 160 discovered that using a pdms membrane contacor to recover dissolved ch4 from an anmbr reactor with a dissolved methane inlet concentration of 12 mg l 1 under vacuum conditions and a capex of 0 30 0 40 m 2 and an energy cost of 0 05 0 09 kwh 1 could guarantee a payback period of 52 5 years in another study cookney et al 2016 40 investigated a theoretical model with a membrane capex cost of 40 m 2 and a life expectancy of 7 years as well as the membrane area required to produce a d ch4 recovery of 90 when having a dissolved methane concentration of 20 mg l 1 at the inlet compensating these costs with revenues from recovered waste gas energetical use 0 094 kwh 1 40 electrical conversion efficiency they discovered a positive financial return for a population of approximately 10 000 people when the mc modules were operated with a liquid flow rate ranging from 20 to 90 m3h 1 these estimations once again omitted the capex and opex of any possible pre treatment and gas upgrade and thus a complete economic feasibility study of the whole system is lacking in the literature a multiple dimensional evaluation framework of techniques for dissolved methane recovery as shown in fig 13 should be used as well for validating the feasibility of these systems in comparison to membrane contactors a mechanical degasser would not achieve energy neutral recovery of dissolved methane but it has the advantages of being chemical free having a simple structure having a low capital investment and having a smaller footprint finally it should be noted that dissolved methane recovery technologies are still in their infancy more research is required to make them technologically feasible economically viable and environmentally sustainable 7 conclusion and future perspectives this literature review presented the mc technology for dissolved methane degassing from anaerobic membrane bioreactor effluents outstanding efforts have lately been made to optimize mc performances in short term experiments nevertheless the scale up of this membrane based degassing system remains a challenging task mainly due to several drawbacks as discussed in section 2 oversaturation sources are yet unclear and further studies are needed to identify the main parameters affecting this index and therefore controlling the dissolved methane concentration in anaerobically treated effluent although the effect of the concentration of organic matter has been clearly identified ambiguous results have been reported concerning the olr moreover the concentration of other contaminants typically moisture biosolids dust particles microorganisms organic carbons and inorganic co2 and h2s should be monitored the ph should be adjusted for methanogenic inhibition low ph or the chemical precipitation of calcium magnesium or carbonate high ph and therefore detect inorganic fouling in addition controlling h2s levels prevents clogging problems caused by sulfur deposition in the fibers and protects the system from corrosion regarding mc operational conditions the combination mode sweeping gas and vacuum has been reported as the most suitable degassing mode however there is very scarce research focusing on combining sweeping gas and vacuum additional studies should be developed to identify an optimum for the tmp the pressure difference between the liquid liquid pressure and the gas phase vacuum pressure and the sweep gas flowrate fouling and wetting mechanisms should also be studied under these conditions to confirm the feasibility of this alternative in the studies reviewed a very limited number used transverse flow for the gas phase fed into the lumen side despite its ability to avoid channeling and bypassing issues and to improve mass transfer these conditions could be beneficial for full scale applications and more studies should be undertaken to identify mc behavior under these conditions develop theoretical correlations and validate the current equations reported in the literature additionally correlations for the estimation of individual mass transfer coefficients in counter current flow should also be validated and further mathematical models should be developed for more accurate estimation of individual mass transfer coefficients efforts should be additionally made to develop equations to estimate fouling and wetting resistances thus facilitating the evaluation of performance losses the development of anti wetting and anti fouling membranes is a critical matter for the use and application of hollow fiber membrane contactors recovering dissolved methane with hollow fiber membrane contactors while not experiencing fouling and wetting resistances necessitate frequent membrane cleaning and replacement lowering thus process s economic feasibility the majority of studies focused on commercial membranes with very few authors focusing on characterizing fouling and wetting issues notably biofouling is irreversible and difficult to address as microorganisms in anaerobic effluents can foul the surface of the hydrophilic layer over time furthermore the anti wetting property of the membrane should be properly addressed taking into account realistic conditions such as fouling although a hydrophobic membrane surface was successfully created the surface property of the membrane can be altered by the deposition of a fouling layer as a result it is recommended that high performance membranes with both anti wetting and anti fouling properties have to be developed therefore composite hydrophobic membranes should be implemented in mc since they offer high porosity and low sensitivity to pore wetting compared to commercial porous pp membrane high hydrophobicity is also generally recommended to avoid wetting problems in the case of anmbr effluents or uasb and egsb effluents combined with a post filtration process typically a 5 10 μm filtration in this regard materials with high contact angles such as ptfe or fluorinated compounds should be used in the membrane configuration in the case of relatively high concentrations of organic matter janus and omniphobic membranes are promising emerging membranes since they have high potential to reduce fouling in dissolved methane recovery 49 tuning membrane characteristics could also be used to limit wetting and fouling the presence of a membrane with small pores indicates that these membranes are less prone to wetting 200 nm although tight pore structure improves wetting resistance gas transport in tight pores can be reduced resulting in a lower methane desorption flux for highly efficient gas mass transfer in hfmc processes the membrane should ideally have a hydrophobic surface layer with a small pore size on a highly porous substrate with a large pore size on another hand obtaining high performance membranes should also have a low membrane mass transfer resistance which suggest having a low thickness dense or composite membrane and avoiding concentration polarization by enhancing turbulence through the hfmc aside from tuning the membrane characteristics no effective and accurate method of detecting and quantifying wetting was used for long term operations monitoring to close this gap studies quantifying the degree of wetting within a hollow fiber gas liquid membrane contactor over operation hours are necessary long term operation is not widely examined and the fouling wetting and concentration polarization are not fully characterized which is challenging for future scale ups lim evans and parameswaran 2019 125 reveal that a degassing mc is not suitable for dissolved methane stripping and further optimization of the operating mode the use of sweep gas or vacuum and the membrane area are necessary to enhance mc performance many pretreatment strategies for membrane contactors has been proposed through literature according to the anaerobic effluent composition for heavily polluted wastewaters that are high in suspended particles and organic matters a pre treatment should be installed to minimize membrane fouling in hmc operations including utra micro or nanofiltration depending on the downstream membrane pore size apart from the pre filtration systems activated carbon adsorption and non oxidizing biocides are suggested for the effluents with high biofoulants and nh3 concentration to avoid irreversible membrane biofouling and diminish the nh3 quantities in the outlet effluent furthermore several cleaning cycles such as water cleanings acid and basic cleanings have been recommended which increase operational costs these costs can be reduced by using the proper cleaning agents and adjusting the frequency of cleaning in comparison to osmotically driven processes foulants in hfmc are frequently less compacted these cake layers are thus easier to remove and do not always necessitate harsh treatments as a result implementing the best cleaning strategy based on data driven insights will not only improve cleaning efficiency and cost effectiveness but will also help in preserving membrane integrity for long term operations many novel membrane based techniques are newly being proposed as alternatives for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents for instance crone et al 2020 167 created a degassed anaerobic membrane bioreactor dambr which is an anaerobic treatment in which dense pdms hollow fiber membranes are implemented in situ to support the generation of attached biomass it has been revealed that the dissolved methane was instantly recovered when applying a vacuum on the lumen side this system outperformed mc with recovery efficiencies as high as 95 and it operated for 72 weeks with no need to control fouling solvent based mc which are liquid liquid mc may be a promising alternative for dissolved methane stripping a non polar organic solvent dodecane is generally introduced in the draw side permeate side counter currently to the feed flow since methane has low solubility in organic solutions a partial pressure gradient is established based on the solubility difference this initiates transport of the dissolved methane from the high pressure side effluent side to the low pressure side draw side two recent studies of x li et al 2019 2020 168 169 used these solvent based mc in the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents when using omniphobic membranes which are characterized by their low sensitivity to water and organic solvent wetting the authors record dissolved methane recovery efficiencies around 90 even after 24 h of operation it has been reported that the use of this kind of system may provide a selective recovery process distinguishing between dissolved methane and water vapor in addition dutta li and lee 2021 138 record dissolved methane recoveries of around 95 when using dodecane organic solvent however further studies should be conducted to approve the use of pressurized hollow fiber membranes instead of flat sheet membranes from an economic standpoint the omnipohobic membrane contactor has been proposed as an economically viable technique for recovering dissolved methane nonetheless the cost of chemicals and water required during the degassing process like alkaline acid and basic solutions for cleaning cycles as well as the possible rises of the operational and capital expenditures should also be taken into consideration when evaluating economic viability of the process moreover although dissolved methane recovery in anaerobic reactor effluents has been reported to be a net energy producing process none of these calculations took into serious account the additional energy demands of the pre treatment strategies especially for uasb and egsb to provide more convincing evidence to potential users more rigorous economic analysis based on data from large scale operations under realistic conditions is required practical parameters that must be considered in a long term operation under real conditions such as any pretreatments required for membrane fouling control periodic membrane cleaning and membrane replacement must be considered in such an analysis correspondingly while many studies claim that membrane processes are generally energy saving and cost effective the tangible outcomes for resource recovery processes remain ambiguous further comprehensive techno economic reviews of hfmc for resource recovery are necessary for evaluating the true benefits of such operations moreover reports on the capex and opex evaluation of the anmbr mc coupling for dissolved methane recovery are scarce but would provide useful preliminary information on the economic viability of using membrane contactors on an industrial scale this paper presented a critical review of the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobically treated effluents via hfmc among all the degassing technologies proposed mc seem to be the most suitable for efficiently stripping methane over a range of temperatures although the technical feasibility of the combination of hfmc with anaerobic bioreactors appears to be clear in the literature its application on an industrial scale remains challenging and economically non viable further research should be directed to scale up conventional mc systems and achieve an energy production that exceeds energy consumption thus developing a self sufficient or even energy positive recovery

12726,the recovery of a high amount of dissolved methane from the anaerobic bioreactor permeate requires efficient degassing technologies such as membrane contractors mc the review work presented here provides a summary and analysis of the studies involving biomethane production by anaerobic treatments to distinguish the parameters affecting downstream mc used for methane recovery a general overview of mc principles and dissolved methane quantification is included the paper then presents a discussion and analysis of diverse membrane characteristics and liquid and gas phase hydrodynamics the challenges and promises of the membrane contactor operations are also addressed currently maximum recovery efficiencies obtained are close to 99 for short term experiments however additional resistances for the mass transfer can be detected during long term operation it is therefore required to focus on membrane modifications and fine tuning of the main parameters for reducing mass

uasb upflow anaerobic sludge 1 introduction global warming is an unsolved problem that has received substantial interest in recent decades it has harmful impacts on the earth s mean surface temperature and thus on weather conditions 1 methane is the second largest anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg and climate warmer due to its high heat trapping capacity it is 25 to 32 times more potent than co2 over 100 years 2 3 methane release continues to rise despite the efforts of numerous countries to lessen emissions and even legislation to control methane emissions 4 5 due to rising concerns about global climate change wastewater management has gained widespread attention and many treatment techniques are emerging however not all methane produced in a wastewater treatment system is collected and dissolved methane is discharged with the effluent into the environment and thence into the atmosphere 1 1 biological wastewater treatments of the conventional technologies for wastewater management biological techniques fungi algae bacteria microbial fuel cells 6 are the most frequently used in wastewater management due to their environmental and economic advantages 7 they can be implemented under aerobic anaerobic or combined conditions aerobic treatments are based on an anaerobic bacterial culture capable of converting organic matter to biomass and co2 8 with no methane production in contrast anaerobic treatments generate methane in the biogas stream as methane production is triggered by the methanogenic metabolism of microorganisms the breakdown of the wastewater s organic fraction yields an energetic by product methane 9 this latter configuration has been widely adopted in wastewater treatments due to several benefits anaerobic digestion treatments provide renewable methane energy production and offer low biomass production low energy consumption they do not require aeration low operational costs and a smaller footprint compared to traditional aerobic and conventional sludge treatments 10 11 anaerobic treatments at low temperatures have also been widely deployed to reduce heating costs 12 1 2 anaerobic wastewater treatments various processes focusing on anaerobic treatments have been developed recently especially low temperature ambient or psychrophilic 20 c treatments 13 up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor configurations are commonly implemented technologies that provide the essential requirements of a high rate treatment 14 15 the use of anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr is an alternative strategy that is widely adopted today even in full scale applications 16 coupled with a membrane filtration process this configuration can produce higher quality effluent 17 and a reduced footprint low strength wastewater can be also treated through many other emerging technologies such as submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactors sanmbr 18 19 and anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactors saf mbr 14 20 however low or psychrophilic temperatures are not always advantageous since a decrease in the operational temperature may intensify the solubility of methane in the treated wastewater the trapped methane is then released into the environment instead of being collected as biogas 21 typically only 55 60 is recovered in the biogas stream but in some cases when the temperature is too low below 15 c the dissolved methane fraction may exceed 80 of the total methane produced 22 this is a major challenging drawback and the majority of the research in this field aims to solve this problem for environmental economic and safety reasons 1 3 dissolved methane impacts and main emission sources methane is released into the environment from natural and human made sources emissions from natural sources represent 40 of total methane emissions while anthropogenic methane emissions constitute 60 23 waste energy and agriculture are the main sources of anthropogenic methane emissions 23 24 the contribution of waste is relatively high 19 20 61 including the methane emissions from solid waste landfill wastewater and waste combustion anthropogenic methane emissions by source for 2020 are shown in fig 1 wastewater management s contribution has been mitigated and remains stable in the range of 7 of global anthropogenic emissions in 2020 11 the critical point is that dissolved methane discharged in confined vessels may be a safety hazard for downstream processes given its highly explosive and flammable nature at atmospheric pressure and 25 c the lower explosion limit lel for ch4 in the air is 5 v v which is equivalent to 1 4 mg l 1 of dissolved ch4 in effluent this is commonly reduced by a factor of 10 for safety reasons 29 therefore abating dissolved methane concentration in effluents to 0 14 mg l 1 is crucial to ensure safe further processing moreover many environmental impacts may be triggered by a release of methane into the atmosphere affecting the carbon neutrality of a process 29 hippargi et al 2021 and smil 2015 30 31 note that methane is an energy source it can be harnessed as a fuel for the power sector automobiles domestic heating and cooking thus methane losses are considered energy losses in this regard since wastewater management has received a great deal of attention in the past decade and numerous wastewater management strategies have been developed it is critical to eliminate or mitigate its gaseous methane and dissolved methane discharges broadly speaking this problem can be addressed by implementing a degassing technology as a downstream process a range of technologies has been explored to ensure dissolved methane is recovered or removed from anaerobic effluents 1 4 degassing technologies physical methods based on dispersing liquid into a collector gas phase or vice versa are traditionally applied these include packed column bubble column spray aeration jet tower tray aerator and diffused aeration 32 despite being traditionally used physical technologies present various technical issues such as foaming channeling and flooding 33 biological techniques can also be useful for dissolved methane removal these generally rely on the biological transformation of methane to co2 and non toxic metabolites by methane oxidizing bacteria mob the methane produced through these techniques cannot be harnessed as an energy source due to its oxidization thus operational costs are not compensated in recent years membrane contactors mc comprised of hollow fiber membranes have emerged as a promising alternative for anaerobic effluent treatments 34 the number of publications discussing this technology has increased enormously compared to publications concerning conventional technologies between 2012 and 2022 as presented in fig 2 1 5 membrane contactors the use of mc is a degassing technique that has conventionally been implemented for gas absorption or dissolved gas mitigation 14 35 but has been newly applied to recover dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents 9 for this application this technology is currently at the research or pilot level 36 37 due to the membrane that separates the gas phase from the liquid phase this configuration is capable of achieving gas liquid mass transfer without dispersion of any phase into the other 38 39 this process may use a large number of membrane module geometries these include hollow fiber 40 41 tubular 42 flat sheet 43 and spiral wound 44 different membrane porosities can also be used 21 40 due to its numerous benefits compared to conventional techniques mc technology has been proposed as a promising alternative for dissolved methane recovery 36 45 in addition to avoiding traditional problems such as flooding and foaming membrane based technology is characterized by a high packing density for hollow fiber membrane modules that offers a high specific surface area per unit volume and therefore an enhanced mass transfer 46 this reduces the footprint scale and energy consumption of the degassing unit 9 moreover a membrane degassing unit is easy to operate 47 and to scale up nevertheless the use of mc is typically restricted by the additional mass transfer resistance caused by the membrane s resistance 21 36 an mc may be prone to fouling organic or inorganic wetting clogging capillary condensation and concentration polarization 48 therefore installing a pre filtration step and adopting cleaning strategies are crucial to limit pore clogging and enhance the long term stability of a membrane 21 36 in addition customizing membrane properties may be a useful way to avoid fouling and wetting problems 49 1 6 target and novelty of this work a few reviews have studied the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic reactors by different techniques 50 especially by hollow fiber mc hfmc 51 52 however the current literature does not fully examine and characterize the issues associated with the degassing process in hfmc as a result in light of changing problems increasing trends and emerging opportunities it is timely to provide an overview of advances in polymer based membranes for dissolved desorption from anaerobic effluents employing mc techniques among the literature multiple contributions have been made by heile et al 2017 li et al 2021 stazi et al 2021 and crone et al 2016 36 50 53 54 on the recovery or removal of dissolved methane via conventional techniques and mc from anaerobic effluents each technology is discussed in depth underlining its advantages and disadvantages under various bioreactor configurations and operational conditions with a particular focus on technological compatibility furthermore velasco et al 2018 2020 51 55 examines degassing methane from anmbr effluents analyzing gaseous and dissolved methane production and focusing on its economic aspect in addition numerous reviews have investigated the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents centeno mora and chernicharo 2020 52 for instance provided an updated evaluation concentrating on mc primary limitations alternative uses for the recovered methane and insights into mc economic feasibility moreover heile et al 2017 36 critically examined existing and proposed physical technologies to gas desorption in engineered anaerobic wastewater processes with a specific focus on technology compatibility and downstream gas phase management in his study similarly stazi et al 53 conducted a comparative study between physical and biological processes used for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluent highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of each technology crone et al 2016 54 investigated the use of membrane units in the degassing process and in the effluent of uasb and anmbr treatment systems by identifying the key parameters influencing dissolved methane recovery efficiency and conducting a deeper investigation into the economic feasibility of degassing membrane units using vacuum li et al 2021 50 on the other hand aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of existing and emerging technologies for managing dissolved methane while discussing their process suitability and major challenges while existing reviews primarily compare degassing technologies and examine the experimental recovery of dissolved methane by membrane contactors a critical assessment of the mass transfer phenomenon is currently lacking in the literature and is required for future modeling studies particularly for fouling and wetting phenomena additionally the effect of upstream anaerobic bioreactor parameters is not discussed in the literature and the general drawbacks of a membrane contactor are briefly examined and must be further elucidated in this regard the following research topics and gaps were considered mc experiences available in the literature for d ch4 removal and recovery section 3 ch4 mass transfer attainable in these systems section 4 anaerobic effluent conditioning requirements and operating issues section 5 recovered waste gas characteristics focussed on valorisation section 6 and energetic carbon footprint and economic theoretical considerations available in the literature when using mc for d ch4 recovery section 7 this review presents more details on an anaerobic bioreactor s main parameters and how they affect the concentration of d ch4 in the effluent it also outlines knowledge gaps and research requirements in the field this work covers a wide spectrum of literature including works that were not included in earlier literature reviews additionally the mass transfer phenomenon is investigated with a particular focus on the existing correlations for different operational conditions and for cases of fouling and wetting finally a further solution is provided to maintain a membrane based system s efficiency in long term operation and at full scale with these aims in mind this review begins by providing a brief overview of the upstream processes and defining the major parameters that could potentially impact an mc performance section 2 this is followed by a description of the degassing mechanism in hfmc with a particular focus on the theoretical approach and modeling section 3 the fourth section summarizes the major parameters affecting mc efficiency and productivity and the best operational strategies are highlighted finally the key challenges facing mc systems are addressed and potential solutions to enhance membrane performance are presented section 5 2 methane production in anaerobic bioreactors during anaerobic treatments the biogas produced downstream is a mixture of co2 methane and trace gases including hydrogen hydrogen sulfide nitrogen carbon monoxide oxygen argon ammonia and other volatile compounds 56 in particular methane is released and generated in anaerobic bioreactors by a sequence of processes as described in fig 3 this sequence begins by hydrolysis followed by acidogenesis complex organic molecules comprising proteins carbohydrates and fats are transformed into water soluble molecules monosaccharides fatty acids and amino acids and then into short chain volatile fatty acids vfas by fermentative bacteria metabolism 51 57 thereafter acetogenesis is triggered as a third stage supported by acetogenic bacteria this process transforms the vfas into acetic acid hydrogen and co2 eventually during methanogenesis methane is produced according to two different pathways 57 the first pathway consists of producing methane aceticlastic methanogenic bacteria split the acetic acid into methane and co2 58 it contributes to around 75 of the total methane production and the rest is produced by another pathway which relies on the conversion of hydrogen and co2 by hydrogenotrophic methanogenic bacteria 57 59 the biogas yield and its composition are generally governed by the bioreactor s mode of operation aerobic or anaerobic which can highly affect its biokinetics typically its growth phase 60 61 furthermore the relative methane composition in the biogas stream is correlated with physicochemical parameters temperature ph and alkalinity the relative abundance of methanogenic species and the waste composition such as the organic content to be consumed sulfates and nitrates 19 62 for instance a l smith skerlos and raskin 2015 63 studied dissolved methane oversaturation in a bench scale anmbr at psychrophilic temperatures ranging from 3 to 15 c it was shown that when the temperature decreases from 15 to 3 c methane oversaturation increases this requires a higher reliance on the biofilm for treatment and results in more methane generation in the biofilm which is represented by an increase from 45 to 90 in the biofilm s chemical oxygen demand cod removal numerous anaerobic bioreactor configurations have been developed for wastewater management particularly for domestic wastewater the most common anaerobic technologies for wastewater treatment are uasbs and egsbs the uasb configuration primarily creates a granular sludge layer suspended in the tank at which the anaerobic microorganisms digest the wastewater as it moves upward through the blanket the egsb is a derivative of the uasb configuration offering a higher upward flow velocity this is its differentiating characteristic the retention of biomass in these systems also known as high rate anaerobic reactors provides a competitive advantage by decoupling the hydraulic retention time hrt from the solids retention time srt 15 nevertheless the anmbr configuration provides a competitive advantage over these conventional technologies as it results in higher quality effluent the integration of ultrafiltration uf or microfiltration mf in the anaerobic system provides a complete decoupling of hrt and srt allowing for high biomass controllability in the digester while obtaining a high quality effluent free of suspended solids and pathogens all these anaerobic configurations are limited by the amount of methane dissolved in their outlet effluent caused by the low operational temperature especially in the low strength domestic wastewater treatments despite the efforts made by numerous studies to enhance biogas methane enrichment and the collection of methane in these systems a significant amount of methane remains dissolved in the liquid phase 2 1 effect of operating conditions on dissolved methane dissolved methane concentration in anaerobic effluents is a major drawback of low strength wastewater treatments that should be mitigated by controlling the main parameters aggravating this phenomenon the key parameters affecting dissolved methane content in anaerobic effluents and downstream membrane degassing mechanisms are summarized and referenced in table 1 this table is a summary of several experimental studies that estimate methane losses it is challenging to compare anaerobic bioreactor performance under different operating conditions however table 1 shows that a high amount of dissolved methane is generally observed at relatively low temperatures at high temperatures less methane remains dissolved in the liquid phase due to a decrease in methane solubility as stated by henry s law 40 64 a large number of studies have examined the influence of temperature on methane accumulation in the bioreactor permeate bandara et al 2011 64 using a uasb reactor show that an increase of the operational temperature from 15 c to 35 c led to a 10 reduction in methane losses in the liquid phase moreover giménez et al 2011 19 also revealed the connection between the concentration of methane in anaerobic effluent and temperature in an sanmbr in their study aqueous methane content varied from 12 3 mg l 1 to 15 4 mg l 1 when the operating temperature changed from 30 c to 15 c peña et al 2019 65 reveal that a rise of 15 c in the initial anmbr temperature led to a decline of 5 6 in methane losses a rise in methane concentration in the effluent can be also observed at a high biogas pressure y chen 2013 66 determined that their pressurized anmbr could generate 7 5 times more dissolved methane with a high biogas pressure of 0 9 mpa than with a biogas pressure of 0 1 mpa pang et al 2019 67 indicate that working under lower transmembrane pressure may lessen methane release in the effluent due to higher methane transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase despite its leading influence on methane dissolution these operating conditions are not thought to be sufficient to quantify methane losses temperature and pressure are thus associated with the oversaturation parameter when estimating methane releases the methane oversaturation phenomenon which has been defined as the ratio between the actual dissolved methane concentration and the theoretical concentration based on henry s law has been widely monitored in studies of conventional non membrane based anaerobic bioreactors 77 78 in these studies oversaturation was attributed to deficiencies in the liquid gas mass transfer in contrast working with an anmbr giménez et al 2012 71 did not witness a difference between the measured methane concentration in anaerobic effluents and that predicted from the equilibrium this observation was correlated with the biogas sparging which contributed to creating the gas liquid phase equilibrium this alternative for decreasing oversaturation in anaerobic effluent was also adopted by adam l smith skerlos and raskin 2013 13 when treating an anaerobic effluent using an anmbr at 21 c and 33 c eventually this technique resolved the mass transfer limitations even though methane oversaturation still existed and was recorded as high as 1 5 according to adam l smith skerlos and raskin 2013 13 methanogenic activity in the biofilm differential pressure and salinity conditions have been suggested as the sources of this oversaturation 13 15 63 this phenomenon was also elucidated by cookney et al 2016 40 using both uasb and anmbr bioreactors for the uasb case study an oversaturation index of 1 3 was noted and was linked to the formation of microbubbles in the bioreactor since the bubbles are entrained inside the organic matrix however there was no oversaturation in the anmbr configuration this was attributed to the absence of organic compounds in the permeate thus the mechanism responsible for methane oversaturation is as yet unclear 74 77 and additional studies are required to understand more completely the key regulators and sources of oversaturation methane oversaturation in the liquid phase can establish a mass transfer driving force based on a concentration gradient enhance the methane composition in the biogas generated and hence increase the methane content in anaerobic effluent 40 77 some authors also suggest that differences between the measured methane concentration and the expected equilibrium concentration could lead to a higher methane fraction in the liquid phase this could lead to under estimating of the methane losses due to a deficient liquid gas mass transfer 71 based on the data presented in table 1 the degree of oversaturation is related to the variation in the amount of dissolved methane the more methane concentration exceeds equilibrium concentration the more dissolved net methane remains in the liquid phase souza et al 68 treated wastewater with uasb technology at 25 c and recorded an oversaturation index of 1 64 and a methane concentration ranging from 18 to 22 mg l 1 at a similar temperature m henares et al 2017 37 found oversaturation of 1 8 and a relatively high dissolved methane concentration of 30 mg l 1 the oversaturation index is also dependent on the anaerobic reactor configuration since the anmbr is defined by its high upward flow velocity and stirring intensity biological fouling is mitigated and oversaturation reduced the observations of rongwong et al 2018 33 support this statement the authors demonstrate that the anmbr configuration has the advantage of retaining biomass by microfiltration or nanofiltration in the bioreactor it thus achieves an oversaturation index as low as 1 5 in contrast to the uasb configuration which had a dissolved methane concentration 6 9 times higher than the equilibrium concentration to prevent the problem of oversaturation it has been recommended to assist biogas with mixing which could guarantee a minimum concentration of dissolved methane in the effluent 37 71 in the study by ferrari et al 2019 6 regarding temperature changes during operation dissolved methane did not significantly decrease and remained at an average of 8 2 mg l 1 in the anaerobic effluent this was directly related to the mixing produced by a high recirculation rate in the membrane it can also be advantageous to utilize frequent back flushing of membrane modules to obtain a non saturated effluent as observed by giménez et al 2012 71 yeo et al 2015 72 propose confirming microbial reaction kinetics that trigger the methane production rate to lessen super saturation of dissolved methane especially in anmbrs in addition it has recently been reported that decreasing an anaerobic reactor s volumetric flowrate especially for anmbr is an alternative method to mitigate methane release in the effluent 15 in addition to oversaturation the release of methane gas in the headspace of an anaerobic reactor initially determines the concentration of dissolved methane in the effluent guo et al 2016 79 enumerate and evaluate the factors that affect the stability and transfer of methane in the gas phase temperature ph srt organic loading rate olr and hrt several authors have recognized the olr as a parameter affecting methane release in anaerobic effluents for instance a recent study by maría henares et al 2018 21 concludes that aqueous methane content increases progressively with the olr when feeding an egsb with an olr of 4 2 kgcod m 3 d 1 a methane concentration of 13 5 mg l 1 was registered with an olr of 30 2 kgcod m 3 d 1 the methane content was as high as 33 5 mg l 1 however galib et al 2016 73 report that the dissolved methane concentration reduced in their experiment from 54 mg l 1 to 25 mg l 1 while olr increased gradually to 3 2 kg m 3 d 1 there has been very limited assessment of this olr influence and further systematic and theoretical analysis are required regulating ph is also a promising option to mitigate methane releases in the liquid phase having a low ph lower than 6 may trigger methanogenic inhibition and therefore reduce the methane content in both the liquid and gas phases 80 in contrast when operating under high ph higher than 8 5 chemical precipitation of calcium magnesium and carbonate may occur this precipitation causes inorganic fouling which leads to higher methane losses as it potentially limits methane mass transfer throughout the mc 80 lastly methane generation in the liquid and gas phases may be influenced by the srt and the hrt thus longer srt and hrt leads to greater dissolved methane 81 this influence was quantified by yeo and lee 2013 82 with 57 higher methane losses for an srt of 40 days than an srt of 20 days this means that at higher srts the methane production rate does not exceed the methane transfer rate from the liquid phase to the gas phase their results also show that oversaturation was mitigated by an srt of 40 days thus working with a high srt guarantees a low oversaturation index however a low hrt combined with a high olr may generate fouling problems 79 furthermore bougie and iliuta 2013 83 discovered that with a shorter hrt of 1 h the methane content in the liquid phase increased up to 67 of the whole methane production as stated above defining the real foundations of the oversaturation phenomenon is one of the foremost challenges for researchers into methane recovery in anaerobic bioreactors processes thus controlling oversaturation from its source may be advantageous for mitigating methane release in the anaerobic permeate in the current research only a hypothesis is proposed and this should be examined in future studies furthermore the ambiguous findings signal the need for additional studies to understand more about the relationship between the olr effect and dissolved methane concentrations an anaerobic bioreactor should operate at high temperatures low biogas pressure and with a constantly maintained ph between 6 5 and 8 5 to mitigate methane releases 48 furthermore the wastewater feed to the anaerobic process should have low sulfate concentrations low salinity and a low organic rate to avoid fiber blocking and wetting issues a short srt is an excellent alternative for obtaining a low dissolved methane concentration approximatively equal to the equilibrium concentration in the anaerobic effluent finally it is also worth noting that the installation of a separation technique in upstream processes is crucial for avoiding clogging fouling and wetting problems in uasb and egsb effluents quantification of the dissolved methane concentration in anaerobic effluent is critical to clearly describe the effect of bioreactor operational parameters on the subsequent membrane degassing process this consequently enables accurate estimation of the bioreactor s performance 2 2 quantification of dissolved methane concentration quantification of the dissolved methane is generally achieved using henry s constant 21 40 which is mainly based on the gas liquid equilibrium in this method chromatography vials are placed under vacuum and sealed to enable closed atmosphere sampling after preparation of the vials samples are collected until the pressure is equilibrated following collection a gas liquid equilibrium is established by continuous stirring after equilibration a precise volume of the headspace is sampled and injected into a gas chromatograph hence the methane fraction in the headspace vials is quantified the dissolved methane concentration is then computed using the equation below 1 c m l c m g v g hv l v l where cm l and c m g are the concentration of dissolved methane and the methane gas concentration in the headspace after equilibrium mg l 1 respectively vl and vg are respectively the volumes of the liquid and gas phases in the vial ml and h is the dimensionless henry s law constant for methane defined as gas per liquid concentration c m g h c m l this equation may also be established by using bunsen s solubility coefficient α 84 this coefficient is defined as the volume of saturating gas that is absorbed by a unit volume of pure solvent at 273 15 k and 1 bar its expression is correlated to henry s constant as follows 2 h α r t o where t0 is 273 15 k α is the bunsen solubility coefficient r is the gas constant and h is henry s constant which is defined as follows 3 h c j d p j mol m 3 pa 1 where c j d is the concentration of a species in the aqueous phase and p j is the partial pressure of that species in the gas phase under equilibrium conditions since the parameters mentioned in section 2 1 are not always controlled methane can be trapped in the liquid phase and should be recovered by mc for economic and environmental reasons the next section discusses the main principles and basics of mc and develops the key theoretical approaches for this degassing unit 3 membrane contactors for dissolved methane degassing residual methane in anaerobic effluents can be harnessed to generate calorific energy and electrical power that can then be returned to the anaerobic bioreactor to achieve self sufficient wastewater treatment many technologies for removing or recovering dissolved methane in effluent from anaerobic wastewater treatment have been proposed these include aeration tray aerators spray aeration and diffused aeration gas stripping biological oxidation and degassing membranes such as mc of these technologies the use of mc is the most potent technique for recovering dissolved methane according to several studies due to its cost effectiveness energy efficiency operational robustness and versatility 14 49 however despite its high methane recovering efficiency compared to traditional techniques membrane use has not yet spread to large scale wastewater treatment plants due to the crucial need for additional pre treatment to avoid clogging and fouling issues 51 3 1 hollow fiber membrane contactor principles membrane contactors in our case hmfcs are a technology that offers non dispersive contact between two phases to initiate a mass transfer between them 85 in degassing anaerobic effluents the membrane is implemented as a barrier to isolate both phases through which a mass transfer transfer is established from the aqueous phase to the gas phase 38 as shown in fig 4 unlike conventional membrane technologies in which the separation process mainly occurs due to transmembrane pressure the driving force in mc is mainly the concentration gradient 14 during the dissolved methane recovery process a sweep gas or vacuum is usually applied fig 4 and the anaerobic effluent is brought into contact with a hydrophobic membrane that may be dense porous 21 86 or composite 64 87 within the membrane module one phase gas or liquid is channeled into the hollow fibers on the lumen side and the other phase flows on the shell side in different configurations co current counter current and cross flow configuration fig 4 a b and c operation is generally continuous aiming to maintain the impetus for the separation process 52 the use of hollow fiber membranes especially porous hollow fiber membranes in degassing systems has become widespread due to their small diameter high porosity and low wettability moreover hollow fiber membranes provide high packing densities with large membrane areas per unit volume up to 5000 m2 m 3 extensive literature has accumulated on the integration of dense and composite membranes a dense support coated with a porous layer in wastewater treatments for anaerobic effluents 3 2 theoretical mass transfer approach on a smaller scale the dissolved gas first diffuses from the bulk liquid phase to the liquid membrane boundary layer before permeating across the membrane pores porous membrane or through the membrane thickness dense membrane and then transferring from the membrane gas boundary layer to the gas phase 88 this section will be dedicated to discuss the theoretical estimation of the overall and the individual mass transfer coefficients 3 2 1 estimation of individual mass transfer coefficients the individual mass transfer coefficients kl kg and km depend on the flux characteristics in the liquid and gas phases these can be estimated using correlations depending on reynold s number re the sherwood number sh the schmidt number sc and the membrane module s geometries various empirical relationships have been established for estimating sherwood s dimensionless number 89 90 the most common correlations used in the literature to estimate the liquid mass transfer coefficient flowing on the shell or lumen side of a hollow fiber membrane the gas mass transfer coefficient and the membrane coefficient are summarized in table 2 for kl estimation on the lumen side lévèque s correlation has been shown to be the most accurate model if the graetz number gz or d h l re sc is higher than 4 this model avoids overestimation of the liquid mass transfer coefficient and hence overestimation of the methane recovery efficiency this is reinforced in studies by mcleod jefferson and mcadam 2016 and tai et al 1994 29 102 in which the theoretical data comply with the measured data at a gz or d h l re sc exceeding 4 to enhance the latter model s accuracy rongwong et al 2018 33 suggest a modification for a wider range of gz 0 4 to 100 an accurate model for the mass transfer coefficient has not yet been validated for the liquid phase for the shell side operation maría henares et al 2018 21 compare the two common existing models from the study prasad and sirkar s 1988 93 data is less conformable to experimental data than the dahuron and cussler 1988 94 model it has been reported that vacuum based operation is not compatible with dahuron and cussler 1988 94 model since it underestimates the liquid mass transfer resistance as with the liquid mass transfer coefficient lévèque s correlation is the commonly used equation for the quantification of the gas mass transfer coefficient finally regarding the membrane mass transfer coefficient the equations are dependent on the porosity of the membrane and are adapted for wetting the effect of fouling on membrane resistance is discussed in a later section current research on these mass transfer coefficient estimations leaves critical gaps despite the attention of researchers no one has determined new mathematical expressions or validated the current ones this is delaying the spread of mc installation because of the inability to predict the amount of dissolved methane recoverable and thus the efficiency of the system 3 2 2 estimation of the overall mass transfer coefficient the mass transfer phenomenon is based on a concentration difference between the lumen side and the shell side the molar flux j is therefore expressed using the effective dissolved gas s concentration and pressure as follows 7 j k g p g b p g m k m p g m p l m k l c l m c l b where kl km and kg are the individual mass transfer coefficients for liquid membrane and gas side respectively c and p correspond to the liquid concentration and the gas pressure the subscripts g b g m l m and l b represent gas bulk gas membrane interface liquid membrane interface and liquid bulk respectively referring to henry s law the gas partial pressure is correlated to the concentration of gas dissolved in the liquid phase at thermodynamic equilibrium 8 p l m h c l m where h is the henry s law constant the overall mass transfer coefficients kg in the gas phase and kl in the liquid phase can be written as follows 9 j k g p g b p eq k l c eq c l b 10 p eq h c l b 11 p g b h c eq according to eqs 7 to 11 12 1 k t g h k l 1 k m 1 k g is the overall mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase 13 1 k t l 1 h k t g 1 k l h k m h k g is the overall mass transfer coefficient in the liquid phase eqs 12 and 13 reveal that the mass transfer mechanism encounters three resistances in series on transfer from one phase to another and this gas liquid contacting process may be restricted by mass transfer limitations these resistances analogous to electrical resistances are shown in fig 5 the mass transfer resistances are liquid boundary layer resistance gas boundary layer and membrane resistance since gas diffusivity into the gas phase is much higher than gas diffusivity into the liquid phase d ch4 gas 10 6 m2 s 1 against d ch4 water 10 9 m2 s 1 the mass transfer resistance is usually controlled by the liquid phase s hydrodynamics 103 consequently the gas phase s boundary layer resistance may be considered negligible for partially soluble gases according to leiknes and semmens 2001 104 this is consistent with cookney et al s 2012 70 finding that no substantial change in methane removal efficiency occurred when the sweep gas s velocity was increased from 0 125 m s 1 to 3 11 m s 1 with a constant flowrate nevertheless this hypothesis is not applicable when working under low gas velocities and when the gas boundary layer is very thick many authors have developed and tested mathematical models for quantifying the overall mass transfer resistance in mc when no fouling or wetting occurs the overall mass transfer coefficient on the liquid side of mc may be expressed as resistance in series by the two film model in steady state conditions 103 based on the concentration gradient presented in fig 5 14 1 k t l d e 1 k l d e h k m d ln h k g d i liquid on shell side mode 15 1 k t l d e 1 k l d i h k m d ln h k g d e liquid on lumen side mode where kt l m s 1 is the overall mass transfer coefficient based on the liquid side and kl km and kg m s 1 are the individual mass transfer coefficients in liquid membrane and gas phases respectively h is the dimensionless henry s constant defined as gas per liquid concentration c m g h c m l and de dln and di m are the external diameter logarithmic mean diameter and inner diameter of the membrane respectively when working with a dense membrane the resistance is directly correlated to the dense membrane s thickness δ d m and the permeability perm of the desorbed methane within the dense membrane support in composite membranes under the same conditions the addition of a thin layer on the porous support should be highlighted and the contribution of this dense layer should be included in the model of the resistance in series as shown in table 3 in addition controlling operational parameters has been shown to be an effective means to enhance mc performance in the following section mc performance is assessed in terms of permeation flux and recovery efficiency the main operational parameters are also identified and their effects on the methane permeation flux the methane recovery efficiency and the individual mass transfer resistances are discussed 4 membrane contactor recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents relevant studies focusing on the use of mc have especially been undertaken for methane recovery from anaerobic effluents applications many authors aim to optimize the methane recovery process by testing the main parameters either experimentally or by means of simulations this optimization is constrained by the efficiency productivity and operational costs of the process in this state of the art work the primary focus is on the experimental perspective rather than the economic aspects of the process since the local mass transfer coefficients are challenging to quantify experimentally researchers mainly focus on determining the overall experimental mass transfer kt exp the methane s transmembrane flux j and the recovery efficiency re to quantify mc performance mc performance is dependent on several interconnected parameters as discussed in section 2 parameters related to the upstream anaerobic bioreactor configuration may have unfavorable consequences in addition altering the bioreactor s effluent composition the membrane s structure dense porous or composite and the membrane s main characteristics such as permeation area packing fraction φ and number of fibers n may optimize the recovery process furthermore the operational parameters are usually optimized for better performance these parameters include the mc temperature the transmembrane pressure the gas phase renewal method sweeping gas or vacuum the liquid and gas flowrates and the gas to liquid ratio 4 1 membrane characteristics the membrane configuration and its characteristics play a key role in providing a high mass transfer area between the liquid and gas phases which is essential to optimize mc performance several studies have lately focused on the effect of the membrane s properties on methane recovery efficiency these studies use typical hydrophobic polymeric materials such as polydimethylsiloxane pdms for dense membranes and polypropylene pp polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe for porous membranes polyethylene pe polyurethane pu and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf for composite membranes 49 105 a comparison of some of these membrane types and materials is shown in table 4 4 1 1 dense membranes a dense pdms membrane is an auto supported symmetrical membrane made of a single material fig 6 a it is a generally a highly permeable membrane with high methane 1200 barrer and co2 3020 barrer permeability values this membrane is depicted in table 4 with other polymeric membrane materials that may provide efficient recovery of dissolved methane 106 nevertheless permeability is limited by membrane thickness 65 1000 μm which can increase the membrane s resistance and therefore decrease methane permeation flux additionally other biogas compounds such as hydrogen sulfide 36 000 barrer and water vapor 60 000 barrer are characterized by higher permeability coefficients than methane through pdms dense membranes 32 107 hence these compounds permeate more easily than methane in the gas phase but at low concentrations non porous membranes are also capable of selectively recovering one component over another membrane selectivity may be defined as the ratio of the permeability coefficients of the gases to be separated and should be around 2 for effective separation in the case of dense membranes selectivity is related to the transport rate of each compound and the diffusion mechanism is dependent on the membrane material pdms which is a silicone rubber polymer is widely used to separate organic gases and records an average value of 3 4 for selection of co2 over methane 113 additionally some studies reveal that the rubbery copolymer poly ether b amide peba may be a promising alternative for the desorption of dissolved methane due to its outstanding sorption selectivity 114 for instance hao pritzker and feng 2009 investigated the separation of phenol from dilute aqueous solutions using pervaporation and a poly ether block amide pebax 2533 membrane the membrane showed remarkable phenol sorption preference over water the outlet sorbate in the membrane module reached a phenol concentration up to 80 90 wt at 353 k which is equivalent to a solubility separation factor of 450 4000 unfortunately membranes that select methane over co2 are not available at industrial scales and thus the implementation of an additional separation process downstream is crucial to purify the methane stream 115 4 1 2 porous membranes porous membranes are membranes formed of pores fig 6 b and provide a high permeation area as well as a small footprint 40 116 however like ptfe and pe membranes pp membranes have low porosity and can be subject to high membrane resistance it has been reported in the literature that a porous pp membrane can recover up to 99 of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluent 40 117 some authors have also evaluated the performance of mc when changing its porosity and showed that porous membranes outperformed dense membranes in recovery efficiency 33 40 117 for instance cookney et al 2016 40 show that the recovery efficiency for dissolved methane was always lower for a dense membrane 92 6 to 10 8 than for a porous membrane 98 9 to 63 3 when increasing the liquid velocity from 0 0004 m s 1 to 0 047 m s 1 this may be attributed to the high membrane thickness of pdms 250 μm that may increase the membrane transfer resistance up to 19 035 s m 1 especially at high liquid velocity table 4 indicates that porous pp membranes have low thickness compared to the other membrane types and intermediate contact angle values 100 118 nevertheless porous membranes are prone to wetting and clogging problems which could compromise mc performance 4 1 3 composite membranes to enhance the hydrophobicity and porosity of conventional membranes several studies used composite and modified membranes 87 103 this type of membrane comprises two main parts a dense selective layer and a porous support made from different materials as presented in fig 6 c this combination of dense selective and porous layers is commonly used to lower membrane mass transfer resistance while maintaining the same selectivity properties as the dense membranes table 4 shows that composite membranes provide very high water contact angles that guarantee high hydrophobicity of the membrane around 123 depending on the material used like the dense membranes composite membranes can tolerate high pressure and are generally characterized by high selectivity values for co2 over ch4 nevertheless sethunga karahan et al 2019 118 reveal that operating with a composite hollow fiber membrane with a thick coating could increase the contribution of the membrane to the total mass transfer resistance furthermore in a study conducted by ahmed semmens and voss 2004 119 evaluating oxygen mass transfer in composite membranes the membrane resistance contribution ranged from 53 to 82 of the overall mass transfer resistance when reynold s number was between 2500 and 5500 and water velocities between 0 8 and 1 8 m s 1 this observation may be applicable to methane analogous results could be expected since oxygen is a poorly soluble gas similar to methane in this regard 9 led a comparative theoretical study of commercial pdms and pp membranes and lab made composite membranes dhc pvdf and phm pdf he showed that the composite membrane phm pvdf had the lowest mass transfer resistance of 0 35 105 s m 1 for the whole range of velocities tested this membrane exhibited an experimental mass transfer resistance that was about 30 40 lower than the commercial pdms membrane and comparable to the commercial pp membrane for liquid velocity ranging from 0 15 to 0 30 m s 1 despite its larger pore size as showed in fig 7 phm pvdf presented a negligible membrane contribution to the overall mass transfer resistance and presented a theoretical liquid mass transfer resistance close to the experimental overall mass transfer resistance compared to porous membranes composite structures are generally characterized by high porosity up to 79 compared to 40 for a porous membrane and very small pore sizes as low as 0 055 μm surface porosity is a key characteristic of composite membranes since it reduces the overall mass transfer resistance as seen in fig 7 furthermore the tortuosity of composite membranes 1 8 seems to be lower than the tortuosity of porous membranes 6 4 these values suggest that composite membranes are characterized by low gas diffusivity in the membrane pores 120 in addition the small size of the membrane pores is beneficial allowing the composite structure to hinder the entry of water into the membrane pores limiting wetting issues the wetting problem is presented in section 5 when using composite and dense configurations in methane degassing processes no wetting phenomena occur according to maría henares et al 2018 2016 21 117 and the fouling effect is reduced according to the smoothness of the skin surface these problems are discussed in section 5 4 2 the composition of bioreactor effluent besides the membrane s properties many other parameters related to the effluent may greatly affect the performance of mc in downstream processing such parameters include the effluent composition particle size and total suspended solids according to sanchis perucho et al 2020 22 producing a high amount of sulfide an undesirable by product during biological digestion can have negative consequences metal sulfides may form and sulfur may be deposited on the inner fibers of the membrane leading to further clogging problems moreover due to its corrosive nature hydrogen sulfide can prevent an installation being used for long term operation clogging issues may also be associated with the presence of suspended solids and their relative size in the anaerobic effluent 52 at this stage anmbr is the most advantageous configuration it offers a high quality permeate that is generally free of suspended solids amounts are nearly negligible and it is characterized by low organic concentrations this is because anmbrs physically separate solids and microorganisms based on their dimensions conversely without a separation system upstream uasb and egsb effluents are dirtier than anmbr permeate due to their high concentrations of organics and suspended solids for instance cookney et al 2016 40 recorded a total cod concentration of 124 mg l 1 when working with a uasb configuration the effluent quality was enhanced when using an anmbr bioreactor for wastewater treatment concentrations of organic matter were as low as 18 mg l 1 thus coupling bioreactors and membrane technologies is very challenging due to the presence of natural biological foulant which is mainly organic matter such as microbial and extracellular polymer substances 21 despite its fouling effects organic matter may reduce the surface tension of effluent leading to a lower breakthrough pressure and hence inducing wetting problems in a downstream mc especially when operating with a porous membrane 21 40 83 121 the suspended solids content is the main factor limiting uasb and egsb deployment and adoption however many authors have experimented with the latter configuration such as bandara et al 2011 who noted total suspended solids of 28 mg l 1 when working with a uasb cookney et al 2016 found a total suspended solids content of 36 mg l 1 which is relatively high considering discharge requirements 122 thus high concentrations of this contaminant could generate overpressures in mc and create a poorly distributed flow through the membrane initiating clogging problems 52 particle size should also be taken into consideration to avoid pore blocking in mc many other contaminants such as moisture biosolids dust particles microorganisms organic carbons and inorganic salts may have a fouling effect and need to be lessened in anaerobic effluents 49 123 124 despite the fact that mc are less sensitive to fouling than pressure driven processes they can still be affected by fouling 21 for instance salt precipitation can lead to inorganic fouling and protein like foulants trigger organic and biological fouling by means of adsorption 103 these major problems are discussed in detail in section 5 4 3 operational parameters operational parameters are the main parameters that can be optimized and controlled to improve hfmc performance in this regard the most relevant experimental studies related to recovering dissolved methane from synthetic and real effluents are presented in table 5 this table permits accurate identification of the main operational parameters and describes their effect on mc system used for degassing 4 3 1 desorption or degassing mode sweep gas or vacuum desorption of dissolved gases is based on transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase through the permeation area of a membrane this mechanism is driven by a sweeping gas typically n2 in the lumen or shell side 70 127 or by continuously applying a vacuum or by both 126 there are many considerations in choosing the desorption or degassing mode including the processability of the operation the energy expenses and the energy demand for methane desorption vallieres and favre 2004 128 prove that the use of a sweep gas may be used to manage economic concerns for methane purification applying a vacuum is a promising option generally the highest recovery efficiencies have been obtained with sweep gas operation 70 90 these values can only be achieved with high vacuum values in the range of 800 to 940 mbar 80 000 to 94 000 pa 21 37 as an example sanchis perucho et al 2020 22 report a recovery efficiency of 80 in vacuum mode with a pressure vacuum of 800 mbar 80 000 pa a liquid flowrate of 50 l h 1 and a dense pdms membrane high vacuum may lower the gas side pressure and the gas s solubility therefore the gases are more likely to transfer to the gas phase which enhances the mass transfer between the liquid and the gas side of the mc 22 129 however cookney et al 2012 70 note a difference in the efficiency of dissolved methane recovery between the two methods when using sweep gas the recovery efficiency was as high as 72 when operating at the lowest liquid velocity the maximum recovery efficiency reported when applying a vacuum was around 80 under a vacuum of 308 mbar 30 800 pa this recovery efficiency at low vacuum pressure may be correlated to the low liquid velocity alongside the membrane 0 0056 m s 1 furthermore the authors detected a methane concentration of 0 028 v v in the recovered sweep gas at the highest recovery efficiency this could be attributed to the dilution of methane in the sweep gas stream furthermore in the studies cited in table 5 dense pdms membranes appear to be compatible with vacuums whereas porous pp membranes perform better with gas sweeping maría henares et al 2018 21 obtained recovery efficiencies as high as 98 with gas sweeping when using porous membranes with an egsb however this recovery efficiency slightly decreased when the gas phase renewal mode was switched to vacuum and remained at 93 when working under the same liquid flowrate 4 1 l h 1 these results were consistent with previous results that showed that maximum recovery efficiencies of 98 5 can be obtained when using pp porous membranes combined with a sweeping gas and low liquid flux maría henares et al 2018 and m henares et al 2016 21 117 report pore wetting when operating with a porous pp membrane and vacuum pressures of 140 800 mbar 14 000 80 000 pa 4 3 2 gas phase hydrodynamics 4 3 2 1 sweep gas mode mc performance is generally related to the gas phase hydrodynamics when working with a sweep gas because of dilution to examine this dilution effect and the gas phase hydrodynamics of an mc performance a large number of studies have tested the effect of the sweep gas s flowrate or velocity on methane content in the gas phase and on recovery efficiency 21 40 70 117 126 for instance cookney et al 2012 70 recorded a constant recovery efficiency of 25 when varying the sweep gas s velocity from 0 125 to 3 11 m s 1 which is equivalent to a range of re values between 26 and 651 at a fixed liquid velocity of 0 0125 m s 1 this is consistent with the results obtained by maría henares et al 2018 21 when increasing the sweep gas flowrate from 26 to 800 l h 1 the performance of the mc in terms of efficiency remained unchanged these observations may be explained by the low partial pressure of methane in the gas phase due to high dilution and the independence of gas phase hydrodynamics from the gas side mass transfer coefficient negligible resistance as stated in section 3 the gaseous phase boundary layer hence does not govern mass transfer since the gas phase s mass transfer resistance can be negligible as has previously been demonstrated for partially soluble gases similar to methane 130 additionally 29 report that at the lowest sweep gas flowrate 0 61 lh 1 the decline in recovery efficiency was more pronounced when increasing the liquid velocity to its maximum value of 1 2 10 5 m s 1 equivalent to 43 2 l h 1 in addition m henares et al 2016 117 report that recovery efficiency is enhanced when the gas flux is increased at high liquid flowrates these findings are in contrast with maría henares et al s 2018 21 results in which the gas flowrate did not affect the recovery performance when applying n2 flowrates in the range of 26 800 l h 1 these results are much higher than the sweep gas flowrate values tested by mcleod jefferson and mcadam 2016 29 4 3 2 2 vacuum mode since sweeping gas presents several non desirable effects vacuum use has been widely examined for recovering methane from anaerobic effluents combining the use of a vacuum with mc can improve the gas side purity of methane since no sweep gas is used nevertheless the polymeric membranes conventionally used have low selectivity values between methane and the other gases present in the gas side this is in line with sethunga et al s 2018 116 study in which the authors demonstrate that the interaction between co2 and ch4 can reduce the mole fraction of methane in the gas phase moreover the use of a vacuum has been widely adopted to obtain higher methane fluxes and increased mc productivity however it triggers several operational issues and requires the greatest energy expenditure 128 as an example bandara et al 2011 64 detected a significant quantity of air leakage in their vacuum based system that led to an underestimation of the amount of methane in the gas phase additionally m henares et al 2017 37 reveal that the use of vacuum pumps is noisy generates intense odors creates instability and causes malfunctions 4 3 2 3 the hybrid sweep gas and vacuum mode to overcome the drawbacks of desorption or degassing modes sweep gas and vacuum can be applied simultaneously using both renewal gas phase techniques may increase the impetus between the two phases however despite the considerable number of references on the removal of dissolved oxygen from water through hfmc 131 132 only a few authors use a combination mode to recover methane from anaerobic effluent 22 sanchis perucho et al 2020 22 reported that using a combination mode increases methane recovery efficiencies and lessens mass transfer resistances in comparison to the individual operational modes in the study almost 90 of the total dissolved methane was recovered at a vacuum pressure higher than 100 mbar 10 000 pa with the sweep gas s flowrate fixed at 0 5 l h 1 however in an earlier study maría henares et al 2018 21 obtained a similar recovery efficiency when applying only vacuum in the gas phase at a similar liquid flowrate and a vacuum pressure of 500 mbar 50 000 pa the results may reveal that for the combination mode high efficiencies are obtained at a relatively low vacuum pressure 100 mbar or 10 000 pa whereas for the vacuum mode alone similar efficiencies are recorded but at greater vacuum pressures 500 mbar or 50 000 pa thus energy consumption may be lower in the combination mode permitting a self sufficient process as the energy production is higher than the energy expenditure moreover some authors recommend implementing several modules in series to obtain higher methane purity and achieve the discharge content in closed vessels 29 40 this method appears to be an alternative for achieving better performances since it is economically viable according to mcleod jefferson and mcadam 2016 29 4 3 3 liquid phase hydrodynamics liquid flowrate is another key parameter to optimize to achieve better mc performances in the studies presented in table 5 several conclude that dissolved methane stripping performance is decreased when applying a high effluent flowrate 22 126 as an example cookney et al 2012 70 observed a reduction of approximately 60 when the liquid flow was set 20 times higher than the initial value these results agree well with the findings of bandara et al 2011 64 who obtained similar recovery efficiencies at higher liquid velocities maría henares et al 2018 21 also detected a decrease in the mc recovery efficiency from 98 to almost 67 when increasing the feed flowrate from 4 1 to 27 2 l h 1 in a lumen side mode this drop in the efficiency of stripping dissolved methane is due to the residence time in the mc the contact time between the two phases is reduced along with the recovery efficiencies in addition at high liquid flowrates membrane resistance may dominate as mentioned by maría henares et al 2018 and peng vane and liu 2003 21 133 however very low flow rates may induce stagnation at the membrane surface that may greatly contribute to an increase in the liquid side s mass transfer resistance reducing the overall mass transfer coefficient and therefore the methane permeation flux a compromise is needed between working with a low liquid flowrate which enhances the efficiency of recovering dissolved methane and working at high flowrates to improve the dissolved methane s permeation flux and the final methane concentration in the gas phase as stated by sanchis perucho et al 2020 22 4 3 4 flow configuration and operating mode aside from the aforementioned parameters the flow configuration appears to have a considerable influence on mc performance conventionally the liquid and gas fluids are conducted through the membrane in co current flow cross flow or counter current flow on opposite sides of the membrane 134 few studies examine the effect of the flow configuration on the efficiency of mass transfer according to demontigny tontiwachwuthikul and chakma 2006 135 mass transfer efficiencies are improved by 20 when working in counter current flow rather than in co current flow compared to co current and counter current flows transverse flow tends to exhibit better efficiency avoiding channeling bypassing drawbacks and showing scale up potential 136 137 to date no studies have been conducted on transverse flow for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents hence more work is necessary to examine mc performance in recovering dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents regarding the operating mode an mc may be operated with the effluent channeled either inside the fiber lumen side mode or outside shell side mode lumen side mode is frequently used in the studies reviewed in table 5 103 126 it is practical when the feed solution has low suspended solids and sulfide concentrations as is typical in an anmbr effluent or a uasb or egsb effluent pre treated by an upstream filtration process shell side mode is adopted to avoid clogging problems especially in long term operation 22 40 103 however working at low velocities in shell side mode may create membrane fouling as demonstrated by maría henares et al 2017 2018 21 37 despite its susceptibility to clogging issues working in lumen side mode provides a higher mass transfer area since all the fibers are traversed by the effluent and the efficiency of the process of stripping dissolved methane is consequently improved for instance m henares et al 2017 37 show that at low liquid velocities 0 5 l h 1 the recovery efficiencies of lumen side mode reached 77 and were greater than those obtained with shell side mode 35 however for high liquid velocities 6 l h 1 the two modes presented similar efficiencies as depicted in fig 8 b fig 8 a also demonstrates that when applying vacuum to mc the efficiency values when working in lumen or shell side mode at a fixed pvac of 800 mbar 80 000 pa are similar at a low liquid flowrate 0 5 l h 1 this re difference is more pronounced compared to sweep gas mode at a high liquid flowrate 6 l h 1 optimizing mc performance is a challenging task since it depends on various parameters a promising pathway is to use a combination of both vacuum and sweep gas methods to reach relatively high efficiencies with low energy expenditure in addition it is recommended to use an intermediate liquid velocity with a gas to liquid ratio of around 0 03 moreover transverse flow is generally recommended since it avoids channeling and bypass problems and is suitable for scaled up applications however counter current flow enhances mass transfer between the two phases concerning the operating mode lumen side is favored when the membrane has a low packing density and when the effluent is characterized by a high concentration of total suspended solids to prevent fiber clogging m henares et al 2016 117 observed severe channeling phenomenon when conducting the effluent in shell side mode as reported the permeation area did not fully contribute to the recovery process since the effluent did not pass through all the fibers this led to lower reynold s number values and hence a reduced mass transfer using a composite membrane may also be a helpful alternative for effective mc degassing due to the high permeation area although great efforts have been made to enhance the efficiency and productivity of mc systems especially in long term experiments the challenges that the dissolved methane stripping encounters have not been widely addressed in the literature 4 3 5 presence of other compounds along with methane co2 is a common gas in biogas contributing 30 50 of the total mass hence typical anaerobic effluents are characterized by a high amount of total inorganic carbon as a result it is expected that a large amount of co2 may be desorbed alongside methane during the recovery process few authors have investigated the effect of co2 desorption on the process of recovering dissolved methane it is reported by rongwong et al 2017 129 that co2 desorption improves the rate of ch4 recovery by lowering the partial pressure of ch4 in the gas phase and increasing the gas phase s mass transfer coefficient to assist ch4 desorption the desorbed co2 boosted the mass transfer impetus moreover the simultaneous desorption of these gaseous compounds increased the total gas molar flow rate therefore a higher mass transfer coefficient may be achieved in the gas phase through their modeling study the authors proved that without co2 desorption a methane recovery efficiency of 50 5 was recorded whereas this reached 65 when the recovery process was assisted by co2 desorption in contrast however the study conducted by dutta li and lee 2021 138 suggests that co2 has a negligible effect on the methane recovery process when varying the ph from 7 5 to 8 1 which corresponds to an increase in co2 concentration of a factor of 4 the methane concentration remained stable and similar recovery efficiency was recorded over 24 h of operation during the methane recovery process substantial water evaporation may occur resulting in high water vapor concentrations in the desorbed gas due to the presence of water vapor in the gas mixture energy intensive purification processes such as dehydration are required before the gas can be used in power and heat systems additionally the loss of latent heat due to water evaporation can significantly lower the input temperature resulting in higher methane solubility and as a result slowed methane desorption despite its noteworthy advantages such as a high mass transfer area high packing densities and low energy consumption industrial use of hfmc has been severely limited due to numerous operational challenges as a result the following section highlights contemporary concerns with hfmc focusing on membrane performance limitations caused by fouling wetting and clogging concentration polarization channeling and capillary condensation are also discussed since they can affect dissolved methane stripping 5 long term operation concentration polarization fouling and wetting challenges 5 1 concentration polarization concentration polarization is a major disadvantage in hfmc systems this phenomenon occurs in liquid solvent solute membrane separation when the solute is enriched in a thin boundary layer close to the membrane compared to its concentration in the bulk feed when a component has a high diffusivity compared to the diffusivity of other components it is preferentially transferred to the gas phase while the other components permeate more slowly through the membrane therefore the concentration of a slower compound in the liquid boundary layer is higher than its concentration in the gas phase this generates a concentration gradient and consequently an additional mass transfer resistance may form as shown in fig 9 a the severity of the impact of concentration polarization on both dense and porous membranes in the desorption of ch4 from water was assessed by cao lee and feng 2020 32 as the permeate pressure was reduced by applying greater vacuum pressure polarization became more severe using a high vacuum slows down the desorption process of methane in addition the study shows that an increased feed flow may reduce the influence of concentration polarization but this would limit recovery efficiency this issue is not widely examined in the literature and more studies should be undertaken to prevent additional mass transfer resistance and thus to enhance mc performance through a modeling study cao lee and feng 2020 32 also investigated the effect of the different resistance types on the extraction of dissolved methane from aqueous solutions the authors showed that liquid mass transfer resistance is a key factor for mitigating concentration polarization concentration polarization is negligible when membrane resistance dominates but it is significant when the liquid boundary layer s resistance controls the overall mass transfer coefficient hence the permeation flux and the permeate methane fraction are decreased and an optimum separation performance is not achieved 5 2 fouling fouling is generally defined as the accumulation of undesirable deposits in hfmc systems fig 9 b it generally leads to considerable harmful impacts depending on the fouling type that occurs during the methane recovery process we will present through this section the fouling types their main consequences and give some insights on how to limit fouling occurrence 5 2 1 fouling types when combining biological reactors and membrane technologies two main fouling mechanisms may occur internal and external fouling internal fouling generally known as clogging is triggered by foulants accumulating inside the membrane pores as a result of progressive pore narrowing or partial blocking it is generally caused by the presence of total suspended solids in the anaerobic effluent and can result in membrane overpressures and unfavorable flow distribution especially when the anaerobic effluent is fed on the shell side 21 139 in contrast external surface fouling depends on the impurities originally present in the anaerobic effluent that have a high affinity for the hydrophobic materials composing the membrane surface these may trigger organic fouling inorganic fouling and biofouling by the sorption mechanism depending on the material type the deposition from the feed of inorganic colloidal particles such as silicate sodium chloride and calcium carbonate causes inorganic fouling the formation of organic fouling is caused by the deposition of organic molecules such as fulvic acid finally microorganisms are mostly responsible for biological fouling by adsorption phenomena on the membrane surface the adsorbed organic and inorganic compounds may alter the membrane s hydrophobicity leading to increased wetting issues as a result a number of fouling issues may arise during dissolved methane recovery making fouling control more challenging furthermore pore blocking is an irreversible phenomenon that can damage the membrane surface fouling is reversible through adapted chemical cleaning techniques 5 2 2 fouling consequences the consequences of fouling depend on the fouling type for instance internal fouling may generate clogging issues and therefore membrane damage which alters considerably the membrane s hydrophobicity external fouling may trigger the formation of an additional fouling cake layer or scaling around the fiber this contributes to a considerable increase in the overall mass transfer resistance leading to lower methane fluxes through the membrane especially in long term experiments as depicted in fig 10 rongwong et al 2019 103 examined the formation of fouling when recovering dissolved methane from two different types of anaerobic effluent real uasb and anmbr effluents they used a surface modified pvdf hollow fiber membrane at the same effluent velocity of 0 021 0 029 m s 1 in the case of the uasb real effluent the initial methane flux decreased from 1 22 10 8 kmol m 2 s 1 to 7 32 10 9 kmol m 2 s 1 equivalent to a 40 drop within 5 h and to 1 22 10 9 kmol m 2 s 1 equivalent to a 90 drop after 38 h of operation however when using an anmbr effluent the reduction in methane permeation flux was less intense after 37 h of operation the flux had declined gradually from 8 49 10 9 kmol m 2 s 1 to 5 049 10 9 kmol m 2 s 1 which is equivalent to a 40 drop these results were correlated to potential biofouling since the results of the field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fesedm eds revealed the presence of protein like components based on the evenly distributed oxygen and nitrogen elemental mappings fig 11 a b within the cake layer but no inorganic fouling was detected furthermore they observed via excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence that the cake layer was mainly formed of polymeric substances eps rongwong et al s 2019 103 findings are consistent with maría henares et al s 2018 21 results they also recorded a decline in mc performance when using a porous pp membrane for 200 h of dissolved methane stripping however this recovery efficiency decline of 29 is less intense than the reduction recorded by rongwong et al s 2019 103 owing to the use of an unfiltered anmbr effluent maría henares et al s 2018 21 also attributed the fouling to organic and inorganic substances since 50 500 mg l 1 of suspended solids were detected in a sodium hydroxide cleaning solution after 120 min of cleaning according to m henares et al 2017 37 monitoring the ph is an alternative solution for characterizing the fouling layer when there is an increase or a decrease in the ph value throughout the membrane the concentrations of anions and cations are varying this indicates that salt has precipitated resulting in an inorganic fouling layer one of the challenges for researchers in this domain is to identify and quantify the effects of different fouling types on mc performance during dissolved methane recovery additional studies to understand more completely the key tenets of fouling are required besides the effluent type the liquid velocity appears to be an important parameter governing fouling rongwong et al s 2019 103 reveal that an increase in liquid velocities from 0 021 to 0 029 m s 1 led to a sharp flux decline from 47 to 68 it was concluded that a higher liquid velocity may trigger greater foulant concentrations that may interact with the membrane surface to generate more fouling these results are controversial with maría henares et al s 2018 21 findings suggesting that high liquid velocities may enhance the shear stress on the membrane surface which is a promising alternative method to bypass the adsorption of organic and inorganic compounds the effect of liquid phase hydrodynamics remains barely addressed in the literature as a result a more systematic and theoretical investigation is needed to better understand this topic furthermore the porosity of the membrane appears to have a significant impact on fouling for example a porous pp membrane has low productivity in long term experiments due to the wetting issue despite its capacity to recover a high amount of dissolved methane sethunga karahan et al 2019 118 report that after 10 days of operation with a uasb effluent the methane s permeation flux dropped sharply by 70 of the initial flux this is in agreement with maría henares et al s 2018 21 results which showed that when operating with an egsb configuration methane recovery declined from 98 to 10 after 180 h hence as reported by sethunga karahan et al 2019 118 flux decline may be mitigated to 20 over 10 days by recovering methane from anmbr effluents with a pvdf membrane even though the addition of a dense layer may trigger additional mass transfer resistance the flux decline remains 29 less than the flux obtained by using conventional membranes this may be attributed to the capacity of the additional layer to mitigate fouling which is usually responsible for decreasing methane permeation however the modification of a hollow fiber membrane surface with a commercial perfluoropolyether appears not to be efficient for long term experiments as rongwong et al s 2019 103 show after 24 h of operation the methane permeation flux dropped 53 when operating with a uasb at low liquid velocities 0 021 m s 1 despite the flux decline in long term operation salt precipitation and adsorption of organic compounds on the membrane surface via combined van der waals capillary and electrostatic forces of attraction may result in fouling layer formation this may create additional mass transfer resistance as described in fig 9 b this additional resistance may be added to the three resistance in series model and thus enhance the overall mass transfer resistance as expressed below 103 21 1 k t d e 1 k l d e 1 k f d lnf h k m d ln h k g d i liquid in shell side mode where dln f d e 2 δ f d e ln d e 2 δ f d e 22 1 k t d e 1 k l d i 1 k f d lnf h k m d ln h k g d e liquid in lumen side mode where dln f d i d i 2 δ f ln d i d i 2 δ f where kf m s 1 and dlnf m are respectively the mass transfer coefficient and the logarithmic mean diameter of the fouling layer since the dissolved methane faces fouling resistance when diffusing throughout a porous fouling layer this resistance can also be written as a function of the layer porosity ε f and tortuosity τf fouling thickness δf m and diffusivity of methane in the effluent dl 2 67 10 9 m2 s 1 according to rongwong et al s 2019 132 23 r f d e k f d lnf δ f d e τ f ε f d l dln f estimating the quantification of this fouling resistance may be achieved by estimating the mass transfer loss in the membrane as stated in the following equation 24 r f d e k f d lnf 1 k t t 1 k t t 0 where k t t 0 is the total mass transfer coefficient of the clean membrane and k t t is the total mass transfer coefficient under continuous operation at time t appropriate detection of fouling on the membrane surface is a key metric for improving membrane efficiency in this regard many authors have focused on developing methods for reducing fouling these methods mainly focus on optimizing membrane properties pore size contact angle and so on and on developing cleaning methods 5 2 3 strategies to limit fouling minimizing fouling in mc for dissolved methane stripping has been a major challenge for researchers it has been advised to implement a pre treatment strategy including micro and ultrafiltration 22 103 116 activated carbon adsorption micro screens and biofouling removal by non oxidizing biocides downstream of the anaerobic bioreactor 40 49 especially for uasb and egsb bioreactors table 6 resumes the use of each treatment strategy in compliance with the anaerobic effluent composition furthermore additional periodical cleaning strategies guarantee more stable performance in long term exp eriments typical physical and chemical cleanings have mainly been adopted maría henares et al 2017 2018 21 37 performed a daily 30 minute backwashing of the membrane with deionized water they also recommended chemical cleaning for a period of 2 h with citric acid 10 v v and naoh 2 v v to remove inorganic and organic fouling respectively another alternative emerging for reducing fouling deposits is the use of antifouling membranes since biofilm and organic carbon adhesions are less likely to form on the smooth surfaces of dense skin layers numerous studies have used a porous membrane covered by a dense layer for instance while using mc bandara et al 2011 2012 10 64 recovered dissolved ch4 from real anaerobic effluents using a composite membrane with a dense pe layer on a porous pu substrate during the 18 month operation they were unable to identify significant membrane fouling m henares et al 2017 37 used a pdms membrane for ch4 desorption when working in lumen side mode unlike the prior case the effectiveness of the ch4 removal was found to be steady for 120 h before the membrane began to foul after 175 h of operation the flux had dropped by 40 but the performance of the membrane was restored by simply washing it with water under the same liquid operational conditions the results for shell side mode operation were substantially different the first period of consistent performance re 35 was significantly shorter than that reported in lumen operation 50 h furthermore with conventional water cleaning the recovery efficiency was only slightly restored about 20 and even after two consecutive chemical cleanings the authors record a reduction in mc performance after 20 h non reversible biofouling may be the main source of the unsatisfactory outcomes in the liquid phase on the shell side janus membranes are also emerging as a promising option for reducing fouling these are new asymmetric membranes with a hydrophobic and hydrophilic layer on the same side of the membrane originally used in membrane distillation processes by co depositing a pda or peim layer or grafting an oxidant induced pda layer on a pvdf or pp hollow fiber support the antifouling qualities of these composite pvdf membranes were enhanced and a high membrane performance in terms of permeate flux was maintained 143 145 additionally omniphobic membranes have received extensive attention for different membrane applications especially for membrane distillation systems in the presence of water such membranes are highly hydrophobic but in low surface tension liquids they become highly oleophobic in anaerobic effluents it is believed that because of the compromised interactions between the feed solution and the structure of the membrane s surface foulant attachments on membrane surfaces are likely to be limited to a narrow area 146 147 these findings indicate that janus and omniphobic membranes may have great potential for reducing membrane fouling in dissolved ch4 stripping finally clogging issues do not occur while degassing anmbr effluents because the bioreactor has an inner prefiltration membrane for uasb and egsb the membrane is prone to clogging it is suggested to install a pre filtration system of 5 10 μm before the anaerobic bioreactor to avoid clogging of the fibers at present membrane fouling in mc processes is not well explored the unavailability of commercial scale mc desorption technologies may be one problem in addition the characterization of fouling layer composition and the quantification of fouling s contribution to performance losses are in the early stages in this context future research should concentrate on minimizing fouling within mc with a particular focus on identifying and characterizing the fouling layer s key components 5 3 wetting and capillary condensation membrane based techniques for recovering dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents particularly mc made of hollow fiber porous membranes may be prone to the wetting problem they also face capillary condensation problems 5 3 1 wetting when the feed pressure exceeds the breakthrough pressure or when high vacuum pressure is applied on the gas side gradual water penetration into the membrane s pores occurs over a lengthy period of operation the young equation is conventionally used to calculate the breakthrough pressure as follows 25 p limit 2 βγcosθ r max where r max is the maximum pore radius γ is the liquid s surface tension and θ is the contact angle for cylindrical pores a factor of β 1 is used while for irregular pores 0 β 1 is used p limit stands for the breakthrough pressure which identifies the minimum needed pressure on the liquid side to trigger liquid to penetrate the membrane s pores the most important criterion for the steady and high efficiency operation of a pp module at an industrial scale is to maintain the operational parameters below the critical pressure at which wetting occurs the above correlation indicates that membranes with smaller pores have a higher breakthrough pressure which means they are less likely to wet however gas transit via tight pores may be slowed resulting in a decreased desorption flux hence the membrane should ideally have a hydrophobic surface layer with a small pore size over a porous substrate with a large pore size in addition increasing the contact angle may enhance the breakthrough pressure it can be deduced from young s equation that the value of this contact angle should exceed 90 to achieve higher breakthrough pressures furthermore lower surface tensions may lower breakthrough pressures resulting in wetting aqueous phases containing organic compounds such as the anaerobic effluent from uasb and egsb reactors are prone to cause wetting in porous membranes due to their lower surface tension as they are characterized by high amounts of organic matter according to centeno mora and chernicharo 2020 52 wetting problems have gained widespread attention and numerous studies have attempted to optimize mc systems for effective dissolved methane recovery with no wetting issues for instance sethunga karahan et al 2019 118 investigated the impact of pore wetting on the overall mass transfer coefficient when removing dissolved methane from saturated water by hfmc over a porous pp membrane when the velocity was gradually increased from 0 05 m s 1 to 0 3 m s 1 the overall mass transfer coefficient dropped by around 50 this significant reduction was attributed to pore wetting even though the researchers were sweeping gas for ch4 recovery from artificially saturated tap water the pore wetting problem is expected to be more pronounced if the same operating conditions are used with a real anaerobic effluent however cookney et al 2016 40 reveal that no wetting issues were witnessed when using a porous pp membrane with sweep gas as a gas renewal phase method even at the greatest liquid velocities 0 045 m s 1 which are 10 to 15 lower than the velocities evaluated by sethunga karahan et al 2019 118 nevertheless in this study a reduction in the removal efficiency was observed even though the overall mass transfer coefficient did not significantly change it could be posited that wetting and fouling problems decreased the recovery efficiency as described in section 3 however further studies should be undertaken to estimate the individual contribution of pore wetting in the reduction of experimental mc performance additionally referring to table 7 maría henares et al 2018 21 state that wetting problems were detected when operating at a vacuum pressure in the range of 140 800 mbar 14 000 80 000 pa and a constant liquid velocity of 0 327 m s 1 but no water penetrated the gas filled pores in sweep gas mode increasing vacuum pressure may lead to wetting problems and no optimum tmp value and liquid velocity have been determined to avoid membrane wetting in porous membranes for recovering dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents a promising option for avoiding pore wetting in porous membranes was proposed by jiménez robles et al 2021 126 combining the use of vacuum and sweep gas as depicted by table 7 no wetting issues were detected when working with a vacuum pressure between 100 and 480 mbar 10 000 48 000 pa and a sweep gas flowrate of 0 5 1 5 l h 1 from the authors point of view the presence of sweep gas appears to have an extra effect on the membrane surface preventing the critical transmembrane pressure from being exceeded despite avoiding wetting problems the use of nonporous membranes may lessen the dissolved methane permeation flows through the membrane the choice of appropriate operational conditions and membrane types for this application appears to be critical while a porous module is more efficient at slower flow rates pressure a non porous membrane performs better when the process requires faster liquid flow rates one of the main disadvantages of the wetting phenomenon is that it increases the overall mass transfer resistance and hence diminishes dissolved methane transport through the mc as shown in fig 9 c an additional mass transfer membrane resistance is added to the initial resistances even though porous hydrophobic membranes are used after a long period of operation the liquid occupies the gas filled pores when the feed pressure exceeds the threshold pressure or when a vacuum is applied instead of a sweep gas consequently the transfer of gas molecules is restricted at this stage the overall mass transfer coefficient estimation may be biased due to wetting and the estimation of this resistance of partially wetted membranes is mainly based on the fraction of wetted pores 21 26 1 k t d e 1 k l d e h k m 1 x h k m x h k g d i liquid in shell side mode 27 1 k t d e 1 k l d i h k m 1 x h k m x h k g d e liquid in lumen side mode where x represents the wetted fraction of the filled pores and k m and k m are the mass transfer coefficient of the wetted and non wetted pores m s 1 the estimation of fouling and wetting resistances for all membrane types is yet not fully characterized in the literature further modeling studies should focus on the quantification of these resistances to accurately estimate mc performance during the methane recovery process in this regard numerous techniques are being explored for maintaining mc performance in long term experiments fabrication of hydrophobic porous or composite membranes with highly hydrophobic materials such as ptfe 32 87 changing the membrane surface structure and properties 103 118 or designing novel membranes such as mixed matrix membranes 148 as an example according to table 7 wongchitphimon et al 2017 87 demonstrate that the use of an in house polymer fluorinated silica composite hollow fiber membrane guarantees long term mc performance when conducting experiments with water saturated feed the recovered methane flux remained in the range of 2250 2500 mgch4 m2 h which is equivalent to a drop of 10 during 320 h additionally sethunga karahan et al 2019 118 show that using a pvdf composite membrane coated with pdms is beneficial for dissolved methane stripping from uasb and anmbr effluents for both anaerobic effluents the methane permeation flux decline did not exceed 25 when working with the composite membrane whereas for the commercial porous pp membrane the flux reduction was as high as 63 this flux reduction could be attributed to an increase in the membrane resistance due to water entry into the membrane s pores as rangwala 1996 149 and r wang et al 2005 150 indicate wetting reaching approximately 2 may induce significant membrane resistance 60 as high as the total mass transfer and thus a higher overall mass transfer resistance 5 3 2 capillary condensation the phenomena of capillary condensation which is a concern even for wetting proof membranes with strong hydrophobicity has also been identified as a challenge for porous membranes the vapor pressure difference between the two sides of a membrane causes water to evaporate producing a water vapor flux across the porous membrane that is the cause of capillary condensation the water vapor eventually condenses over the membrane pores increasing membrane resistance the smaller the pore size the higher the capillary condensation propensity of membranes because the local vapor pressure may be able to easily reach the critical vapor pressure of water 151 152 to prevent capillary condensation it has been advised to use hydrophobic membrane materials with a high contact angle utilize suitable pore forming agents and choose an optimum pore size many authors have fabricated membranes with optimum pore size and hydrophobicity for instance wongchitphimon et al 2017 fabricated a highly hydrophobic θ 123 125 polymer fluorinated silica composite hollow fiber membrane with a pore size of 0 055 μm f li et al 2018 153 also reveal that the use of ptfe as a membrane material may avoid wetting and channeling issues due to its high contact angle 133 6 economic aspect and energy consideration wastewater treatment plants can be used to generate reusable water energy and valuable nutrients by switching from conventional aerobic activated sludge to anaerobic digestion based processes one of the main key benefits of anaerobic wastewater treatment is the production and recovery of biogas which typically contains 68 85 methane ch4 5 25 carbon dioxide co2 and 5 15 nitrogen n2 154 155 hence anaerobic wastewater treatment plants can function as resource recovery facilities where any potential operating cost is outweighed by the biogas production 156 6 1 gas phase management management methane can be used to generate energy in combined heat and power engines such as microturbines and internal combustion engines 36 157 another potential application for recovered ch4 that necessitates additional consideration is the biorefining of marketable byproducts from various biological methanotrophic processes several by products can be produced from different assimilation pathways using ch4 as a substrate including polyhydroxyalkanoates phas extracellular polymeric products eps ectoine c40 carotenoids lactic acid succinic acid 1 4 butanediol isobutanol isoprene and farnes 158 carbon dioxide co2 has several possible applications like cooling acid replacement calcium carbonate production and carbon source for algae growth the recovery of co2 has been reported by many authors 117 129 but its content in the gas phase has been rarely reported dissolved ammonia can be extracted from wastewater and combined with sulfuric acid to produce ammonium sulphate for concentrations above 1000 mgnh3 l 1 36 the content of other gases dissolved in anaerobic effluents such as n2 o2 and h2s in the recovered waste gas have not yet been reported in the literature thus more experimental research is required for an optimal characterization of the recovered waste gas to determine its suitability for its further use 6 2 energy production in anaerobic bioreactors among all the anaerobic bioreactors configurations the anmbr especially submerged anmbr has been proposed as the most suitable candidate for establishing self sufficient wastewater treatment plant with a high energy independency ratio defined as measured energy potential to total energy demand owing its potential to produce methane rich biogas as an energy source the energy independency ratio of anmbr would depend on influent characteristics reactor type and fouling control and its operating conditions it has been demonstrated that this technology can reach up to 2 02 kwh kgcodremoved of energy production which is 7 times more than its energy requirement expenditure in case 98 of the influent cod concentration was converted to ch4 159 the energy independency of anaerobic systems could be altered when treating an influent with low sulphate concentrations high cod concentrations or when working under low temperatures 15 c this could result in a negative net energy balance of the anaerobic systems hence the recovery and reuse of dissolved methane from its effluent would be beneficial knowing that the energy requirements for recovering dissolved methane accounts for 3 5 of the total energy production equivalent to 0 01 kwh m3 54 in this regard the main purpose of using hfmc is to maximize the dissolved methane recovery from anaerobic effluents and therefore harvest the usable energy as demonstrated in previous sections the dissolved methane recovery efficiency is strongly influenced by membrane inherent properties and operational parameters the recovery effectiveness of such technology has been published in several research to illustrate the its potential advantages 160 161 more significantly several studies have included the cost and energy needed for the operation of hfmc in their economic study of net energy generation 33 70 6 3 dissolved methane recovery and reuse even though no experiments are being conducted to assess the use of ch4 recovered from anaerobic effluents in actual systems at any scale some studies have conducted theoretical calculations of the potential benefits of this application specifically in terms of energy balance and economic viability this section summarizes the key findings in this area and addresses several components that are missing from the literature in order to provide a comprehensive view of these factors 6 3 1 energy balance the application of hfmc for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents has been proved as a net energy positive operation meaning that the total energy expenditure is lower than the recovered one many authors have predicted in their studies a positive net energy production values for such applications for instance cookney et al 2012 162 obtained a net energy output of 0 04 kwh m3 of wastewater containing 25 4 mgch4 l in another study rongwong et al 2018 92 found that a high strip gas flow rate and slight low vacuum pressure gave the highest net energy at 0 0495 kwh m3 from an anaerobic effluent containing 15 4 mgch4 l they also showed out that the net energy was optimized when the percentage recovery of the dissolved ch4 was around 88 90 all the net energy values obtained for recovering dissolved methane by membrane contactors are 10 times less than the values obtained with other dissolved methane recovery techniques for instance an average dissolved methane concentration of 17 1 g m3 was observed in an anaerobic effluent at 30 c of which nearly 90 could be recovered by means of a mechanical degasser at an energy cost of 0 12 kwh m3 163 some efforts have been made to quantify theoretically the minimum threshold value of ch4 content in the membrane contactor gas outlet for a possible conversion of methane into electricity rongwong et al 2018 92 demonstrated that at least 35 of methane should be produced in order to be harnessed as an energy source this minimum value could be achieved by tuning several operational parameters including gas phase renewal mode the membrane contactor configuration the antifouling properties of the membrane and the dissolved methane concentration in the influent 6 3 1 1 parameters affecting the energy balance a use of vacuum sweep gas from an energy standpoint sweep gas is preferred as vallieres and favre 2004 showed they found that using the sweep mode would result in a lower energy demand and concluded that a vacuum should only be employed if a non diluted waste gas is wanted this could be the case of methane since 35 of the total biogas production is needed for its electric conversion rongwong et al 2018 92 have found contradictory results when considering the energetical value of the recovered ch4 they discussed that increasing the sweep gas flow rate would reduce the required length of membrane and the energy demand for the liquid pump however this would dilute the outlet gas content and would require higher energy demand from vacuum in this regard the authors proved that the maximum net electric energy production of 0 049 kwh m3 was achieved when combining a g l ratio of 0 08 with a vacuum pressure of 900 mbar for a recovery efficiency of 90 a similar net energy production of 0 04 kwh m3 was estimated by cookney et al 2012 162 for re of 72 moreover sanchis perucho et al 164 demonstrated that increasing the vacuum pressure to 800 mbar can increase the energy production from 0 01 to 0 08 kwh m3 when using vacuum as the gas phase renewal method this is in line with henares et al 2016 117 findings who estimated the share of the energy required in vacuum operations from the total energy production to 0 01 and showed that the saved energy defined as the difference between the recovered electrical and demand of vacuum operation energies per cubic meter of treated effluent is positive for the whole range of vacuum pressures 140 800 mbar as shown in fig 12 additionally an optimum value of liquid flow rate for lumen side operation around 0 05 0 15 m3 day 1 was found despite the fact that some authors have demonstrated the efficiency of combining sweeping gas and vacuum modes 29 160 its economic aspect has not been examined the economic feasibility of this gas phase combination mode should be validated in future studies for a potential scale up b membrane anti fouling properties and mc configuration the membrane anti fouling properties are also a very potent parameter for increasing the net energy production sethunga et al 2021 106 analyzed the re values from anmbr and uasb effluents for a membrane contactor employing a surface modified pdms pvdf membrane the membrane performance was maintained for 7 days with a mild fouling propensity when the liquid velocity was fixed at 0 06 m s 1 under vacuum operation apart from exanimating methane recovery efficiencies they also carried out economic analysis where net energy values for each membrane were calculated it has been found that the membrane with anti fouling layer pdms co p1 could extract 3 more energy than the pdms membrane implying that the control of membrane fouling is highly important to secure the net energy production it is noteworthy that such difference in net energy production would become greater and more evident during the long term operations 165 on the other hand ch4 recovery using membrane and solvent liquid liquid membrane contactor was suggested to be more energy efficient by li et al 2019 the author proved that dissolved methane could be harvested with a relatively low energy input as such the authors achieved a recovery efficiency exceeding 90 from an anaerobic effluent with an initial saturated dissolved methane concentration of 16 4 g m3 at 35 c through an omniphobic membrane based process by using 0 04 mj m3 equivalent to 0 01 kwh m3 with solvent based membrane the energy balance was positive with an independency ratio of 5 at 15 c to 8 at 35 c the authors also discussed that the main energy demand for solvent came from the liquid pump for circulation and vacuum pump for ch4 desorption only and no additional energy required for gas purification this energy consumption was 20 and 120 times lower than vacuum membrane at 15 c and 35 c respectively c ch4 inlet concentration the inlet methane concentration or in other terms the oversaturation defined in section 2 seems to have a significant impact on the net energy production of the membrane contactor degassing system a high influent ch4 amount would affect membrane area required to recover the dissolved methane 92 additionally having more methane dissolved in anaerobic effluents implies a larger amount of methane to be transferred from the liquid to the gas phase which will need a better mass transfer mechanism through either enhancing the liquid and gas phase hydrodynamics or increase the vacuum pressure therefore this would suggest providing more electricity to the vacuum pump and to the liquid pump and thus reducing the net energy production of the process cookney et al 2012 162 calculated a net energy production of 0 04 kwh m3 for a recovery efficiency of 72 and an inlet dissolved methane concentration of 12 2 mg l 1 while henares et al 2017 166 estimated an energy net production of 3 5 times higher with a similar recovery efficiency of re 70 and 30 mg l 1 of dissolved methane in the inlet anaerobic effluent 6 3 2 economic feasibility and viability according to the energy balance using membrane contactors for dissolved methane recovery could be a self sufficient process this energy independence however is insufficient for scaling up such systems in this regard some authors calculated the payback period for anmbr mc systems theoretically for example sanchis et al 2021 160 discovered that using a pdms membrane contacor to recover dissolved ch4 from an anmbr reactor with a dissolved methane inlet concentration of 12 mg l 1 under vacuum conditions and a capex of 0 30 0 40 m 2 and an energy cost of 0 05 0 09 kwh 1 could guarantee a payback period of 52 5 years in another study cookney et al 2016 40 investigated a theoretical model with a membrane capex cost of 40 m 2 and a life expectancy of 7 years as well as the membrane area required to produce a d ch4 recovery of 90 when having a dissolved methane concentration of 20 mg l 1 at the inlet compensating these costs with revenues from recovered waste gas energetical use 0 094 kwh 1 40 electrical conversion efficiency they discovered a positive financial return for a population of approximately 10 000 people when the mc modules were operated with a liquid flow rate ranging from 20 to 90 m3h 1 these estimations once again omitted the capex and opex of any possible pre treatment and gas upgrade and thus a complete economic feasibility study of the whole system is lacking in the literature a multiple dimensional evaluation framework of techniques for dissolved methane recovery as shown in fig 13 should be used as well for validating the feasibility of these systems in comparison to membrane contactors a mechanical degasser would not achieve energy neutral recovery of dissolved methane but it has the advantages of being chemical free having a simple structure having a low capital investment and having a smaller footprint finally it should be noted that dissolved methane recovery technologies are still in their infancy more research is required to make them technologically feasible economically viable and environmentally sustainable 7 conclusion and future perspectives this literature review presented the mc technology for dissolved methane degassing from anaerobic membrane bioreactor effluents outstanding efforts have lately been made to optimize mc performances in short term experiments nevertheless the scale up of this membrane based degassing system remains a challenging task mainly due to several drawbacks as discussed in section 2 oversaturation sources are yet unclear and further studies are needed to identify the main parameters affecting this index and therefore controlling the dissolved methane concentration in anaerobically treated effluent although the effect of the concentration of organic matter has been clearly identified ambiguous results have been reported concerning the olr moreover the concentration of other contaminants typically moisture biosolids dust particles microorganisms organic carbons and inorganic co2 and h2s should be monitored the ph should be adjusted for methanogenic inhibition low ph or the chemical precipitation of calcium magnesium or carbonate high ph and therefore detect inorganic fouling in addition controlling h2s levels prevents clogging problems caused by sulfur deposition in the fibers and protects the system from corrosion regarding mc operational conditions the combination mode sweeping gas and vacuum has been reported as the most suitable degassing mode however there is very scarce research focusing on combining sweeping gas and vacuum additional studies should be developed to identify an optimum for the tmp the pressure difference between the liquid liquid pressure and the gas phase vacuum pressure and the sweep gas flowrate fouling and wetting mechanisms should also be studied under these conditions to confirm the feasibility of this alternative in the studies reviewed a very limited number used transverse flow for the gas phase fed into the lumen side despite its ability to avoid channeling and bypassing issues and to improve mass transfer these conditions could be beneficial for full scale applications and more studies should be undertaken to identify mc behavior under these conditions develop theoretical correlations and validate the current equations reported in the literature additionally correlations for the estimation of individual mass transfer coefficients in counter current flow should also be validated and further mathematical models should be developed for more accurate estimation of individual mass transfer coefficients efforts should be additionally made to develop equations to estimate fouling and wetting resistances thus facilitating the evaluation of performance losses the development of anti wetting and anti fouling membranes is a critical matter for the use and application of hollow fiber membrane contactors recovering dissolved methane with hollow fiber membrane contactors while not experiencing fouling and wetting resistances necessitate frequent membrane cleaning and replacement lowering thus process s economic feasibility the majority of studies focused on commercial membranes with very few authors focusing on characterizing fouling and wetting issues notably biofouling is irreversible and difficult to address as microorganisms in anaerobic effluents can foul the surface of the hydrophilic layer over time furthermore the anti wetting property of the membrane should be properly addressed taking into account realistic conditions such as fouling although a hydrophobic membrane surface was successfully created the surface property of the membrane can be altered by the deposition of a fouling layer as a result it is recommended that high performance membranes with both anti wetting and anti fouling properties have to be developed therefore composite hydrophobic membranes should be implemented in mc since they offer high porosity and low sensitivity to pore wetting compared to commercial porous pp membrane high hydrophobicity is also generally recommended to avoid wetting problems in the case of anmbr effluents or uasb and egsb effluents combined with a post filtration process typically a 5 10 μm filtration in this regard materials with high contact angles such as ptfe or fluorinated compounds should be used in the membrane configuration in the case of relatively high concentrations of organic matter janus and omniphobic membranes are promising emerging membranes since they have high potential to reduce fouling in dissolved methane recovery 49 tuning membrane characteristics could also be used to limit wetting and fouling the presence of a membrane with small pores indicates that these membranes are less prone to wetting 200 nm although tight pore structure improves wetting resistance gas transport in tight pores can be reduced resulting in a lower methane desorption flux for highly efficient gas mass transfer in hfmc processes the membrane should ideally have a hydrophobic surface layer with a small pore size on a highly porous substrate with a large pore size on another hand obtaining high performance membranes should also have a low membrane mass transfer resistance which suggest having a low thickness dense or composite membrane and avoiding concentration polarization by enhancing turbulence through the hfmc aside from tuning the membrane characteristics no effective and accurate method of detecting and quantifying wetting was used for long term operations monitoring to close this gap studies quantifying the degree of wetting within a hollow fiber gas liquid membrane contactor over operation hours are necessary long term operation is not widely examined and the fouling wetting and concentration polarization are not fully characterized which is challenging for future scale ups lim evans and parameswaran 2019 125 reveal that a degassing mc is not suitable for dissolved methane stripping and further optimization of the operating mode the use of sweep gas or vacuum and the membrane area are necessary to enhance mc performance many pretreatment strategies for membrane contactors has been proposed through literature according to the anaerobic effluent composition for heavily polluted wastewaters that are high in suspended particles and organic matters a pre treatment should be installed to minimize membrane fouling in hmc operations including utra micro or nanofiltration depending on the downstream membrane pore size apart from the pre filtration systems activated carbon adsorption and non oxidizing biocides are suggested for the effluents with high biofoulants and nh3 concentration to avoid irreversible membrane biofouling and diminish the nh3 quantities in the outlet effluent furthermore several cleaning cycles such as water cleanings acid and basic cleanings have been recommended which increase operational costs these costs can be reduced by using the proper cleaning agents and adjusting the frequency of cleaning in comparison to osmotically driven processes foulants in hfmc are frequently less compacted these cake layers are thus easier to remove and do not always necessitate harsh treatments as a result implementing the best cleaning strategy based on data driven insights will not only improve cleaning efficiency and cost effectiveness but will also help in preserving membrane integrity for long term operations many novel membrane based techniques are newly being proposed as alternatives for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents for instance crone et al 2020 167 created a degassed anaerobic membrane bioreactor dambr which is an anaerobic treatment in which dense pdms hollow fiber membranes are implemented in situ to support the generation of attached biomass it has been revealed that the dissolved methane was instantly recovered when applying a vacuum on the lumen side this system outperformed mc with recovery efficiencies as high as 95 and it operated for 72 weeks with no need to control fouling solvent based mc which are liquid liquid mc may be a promising alternative for dissolved methane stripping a non polar organic solvent dodecane is generally introduced in the draw side permeate side counter currently to the feed flow since methane has low solubility in organic solutions a partial pressure gradient is established based on the solubility difference this initiates transport of the dissolved methane from the high pressure side effluent side to the low pressure side draw side two recent studies of x li et al 2019 2020 168 169 used these solvent based mc in the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents when using omniphobic membranes which are characterized by their low sensitivity to water and organic solvent wetting the authors record dissolved methane recovery efficiencies around 90 even after 24 h of operation it has been reported that the use of this kind of system may provide a selective recovery process distinguishing between dissolved methane and water vapor in addition dutta li and lee 2021 138 record dissolved methane recoveries of around 95 when using dodecane organic solvent however further studies should be conducted to approve the use of pressurized hollow fiber membranes instead of flat sheet membranes from an economic standpoint the omnipohobic membrane contactor has been proposed as an economically viable technique for recovering dissolved methane nonetheless the cost of chemicals and water required during the degassing process like alkaline acid and basic solutions for cleaning cycles as well as the possible rises of the operational and capital expenditures should also be taken into consideration when evaluating economic viability of the process moreover although dissolved methane recovery in anaerobic reactor effluents has been reported to be a net energy producing process none of these calculations took into serious account the additional energy demands of the pre treatment strategies especially for uasb and egsb to provide more convincing evidence to potential users more rigorous economic analysis based on data from large scale operations under realistic conditions is required practical parameters that must be considered in a long term operation under real conditions such as any pretreatments required for membrane fouling control periodic membrane cleaning and membrane replacement must be considered in such an analysis correspondingly while many studies claim that membrane processes are generally energy saving and cost effective the tangible outcomes for resource recovery processes remain ambiguous further comprehensive techno economic reviews of hfmc for resource recovery are necessary for evaluating the true benefits of such operations moreover reports on the capex and opex evaluation of the anmbr mc coupling for dissolved methane recovery are scarce but would provide useful preliminary information on the economic viability of using membrane contactors on an industrial scale this paper presented a critical review of the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobically treated effluents via hfmc among all the degassing technologies proposed mc seem to be the most suitable for efficiently stripping methane over a range of temperatures although the technical feasibility of the combination of hfmc with anaerobic bioreactors appears to be clear in the literature its application on an industrial scale remains challenging and economically non viable further research should be directed to scale up conventional mc systems and achieve an energy production that exceeds energy consumption thus developing a self sufficient or even energy positive recovery

an important raw material used in the manufacture of polycarbonate epoxy resin and other polymers however bpa increases the risk of obesity by interfering with the human endocrine system 1 has adverse effects on female oocytes 2 and has a negative impact on the ecosystems in sewage treatment plants 3 rapid treatment of bpa at wastewater treatment plants is difficult because it is present in relatively low concentrations 4 6 adsorption advanced oxidation and membrane technologies are potentially effective approaches for removal of low concentrations of bpa issues with traditional sewage treatment technologies include that they generate secondary pollutants have high energy requirements and are labor intensive environmental biotechnology raises concern for its eliminating pollutants restore ecosystem functions 7 in a previous study a constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc was applied to treatment of bpa containing wastewater 8 the cw mfc performance under different hydraulic detention times was compared with that of a constructed wetland cw the results showed that bpa damaged the microbial community and the bacterial abundance changed at the phylum and genus levels further study of the microbial community is required to understand the device performance intraspecific interactions are essential for microbial responses to environmental changes 55 and these relationships affect the bacterial community structure and function 56 to date methods to reduce anode microbial damage or improve the device performance have not been investigated in a cw mfc organic matter is degraded by anaerobic microorganisms at the anode to produce protons and electrons protons are transferred to the cathode by the solution and electrons are transferred by copper wires under aerobic conditions in the cathode the protons and electrons react with oxygen to generate electricity eq 1 to date cw mfcs have been applied to polluted water containing caffeine 57 and salt 9 landfill leachate and municipal wastewater 58 and sewer overflow 59 the performance of the cw mfc can be enhanced by optimizing the device operation patterns 60 wetland plants 61 electrode materials 10 and substrate compositions 11 the efficiency of wastewater purification and electricity production have been used to evaluate the cw mfc performance these studies have explained the device performance at a molecular level and have shown that anode materials and microbes on their surfaces play an important role in cw mfc systems 1 nc h 2 o n h 2 o nc o 2 4 n e 4 n h 4 n e n o 2 4 n h 2 n h 2 these materials and microbes determine the number of electrons and transfer rates in the circuit 12 the anode material needs to serve both as an electron donor and a carrier for microbial growth 13 14 62 currently iron pyrite 10 and nano zero valent iron nzvi 15 are the main materials used as the anode these materials have excellent electrical conductivity and biocompatibility with different biocatalysts however sulfate is produced during long term operation and causes water acidification which damages the cw biota nzvi does not acidify the environment but is readily lost in the effluent to overcome this nzvi is commonly fixed in the system by loading it onto activated carbon or biochar however this requires the use of extra reagents and increases the cost the use of fe3c as an anode material overcomes the issues associated with other materials it contains carbon has iron for its zero valence characteristics and is not readily lost in the effluent because of its electrical conductivity fe3c can act as the central domain for microbe mediated metabolism promoting the metabolic activities of microorganisms 16 microorganisms can act as exoelectrogens to transfer electrons from the electrode surface to soluble or insoluble electron acceptors 17 the bacteria s functional characteristics can be enhanced by iron which acts as an exogenous electron donor however few studies have investigated fe3c in terms of mfc performance or clarified the background bacterial response mechanism we hypothesized that fe3c could act as an anodic exogenous electron donor in cw mfc water purification to affect electricity production and the bacterial community structure and diversity it could also influence the microbial potential function and intraspecific interactions the specific objectives of this work were to i determine the removal efficiencies of various pollutants and evaluate the electricity production performance of two cw mfcs ii assess the water purification and electrochemical performances of reactors in terms of microbial community structure and composition and iii forecast functional diversity and investigate ecological impacts 2 materials and methods 2 1

results 3 1 wastewater treatment efficiency the eg had better water purification performance than the cg fig 2 the bpa and cod removal efficiency in eg was much higher than that in cg from the beginning of the experiment fig 2d the total n removal efficiencies in the eg and cg were not significantly different but nh4 n in the eg was much greater than that in the cg during steady state operation conditions fig 2a and b 3 2 electricity production the voltage curve and cod removal efficiency relationship are shown in fig 3a the eg reactor had a much higher average voltage 352 13 mv than the cg reactor 269 39 mv during steady state operation the internal resistance values in the cg and eg reactors were 514 70 ω and 541 28 ω respectively fig 3b the highest power density and current density achieved with the eg were 3 88 mw m2 and 17 48 ma m2 respectively the power density and current density of the cg were 2 61 mw m2 and 14 31 ma m2 respectively the ce for the eg was 3 31 and that for the cg was 3 20 3 3 anode electrode biofilm characterization sem micrographs of the biofilm on the anode are shown fig s1 dense biofilm structure was observed in eg anode comparing inoculated sludge and cg as shown in fig s2 the live proportion is 23 3 5 4 77 6 8 4 in cg and eg the content of biofilm protein and eg was 90 55 7 83 108 37 10 28 mg g in cg respectively they have no significance protein and polysaccharides are the main composition of eps eg anode eps content was lower than cg fig s3 the composition of eps between cg and eg anode is different fig s4 and table s3 eps attracted from cg comprised of tyrosine like tryptophan like b1 t1 marked in fig s4 a and smaller amount of humic like substance m marked in fig s4 b apart from above substance eps from eg have tyrosine like b2 and fulvic like a 3 4 microbial community 3 4 1 microbial community diversity the alpha diversities fig 4 of the ck ega and cga were not significantly different p 0 05 the microbial community diversity indices at the cathodes of the two cw mfcs were significantly lower than those at the anode p 0 05 for the microbial communities of ega and cga the richness of the cga microbial community was significantly higher than that of the ega p 0 05 3 4 2 bacterial community composition structure and function proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were the dominant bacterial communities at the phylum level fig 5a gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria were the dominant bacteria at the class level fig 5b and biomarker bacteria at the class level fig 6 burkholderiaceae were key bacteria at the family level and showed symbiosis with other functional bacteria i e nitrosomoonadaceae and rhodanobacteraceae fig 5c proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi were the key taxa fig 5d the degree distributions of the networks are shown in fig s7 in the network analysis 576 nodes and 6882 edges were obtained 67 42 positive and 32 58 negative lefse was used to find biomarkers figs 6 s6 bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were the biomarkers in cg and eg anode samples at the phylum level caulobacter were the key bacteria at the genus level fig 6 c alphaproteobacteria and p proteobacteria which are both electroactive bacteria eab were the main microbes in the cg and eg cathode samples the operational taxonomic unit values for eab dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria dirb feammox and dissimilatory nitrate reducing bacteria dnb improved when fe3c was used as the anode material p 0 05 a higher proportion of geobacter p 0 05 and relatively low proportion of pseudomonas were observed in the ega compared with those in the cga table 1 3 4 3 functional microbial prediction using the kegg database as the main biological metabolic pathway analysis database 22 the abundance values of six metabolic pathways were calculated fig s3 the contributions of amino acid metabolism metabolism of co factors and vitamins carbohydrate metabolism and biodegradation and metabolism of xenobiotics were significantly improved the value for the ko00920 pathway which is related to sulfur metabolism in ega 330 92 1 12 was significantly higher than that in cga 356 57 4 38 when comparing the anode and cathode of eg 95 80 8 590 and 223 22 13 25 respectively and cg 76 44 2 09 and 189 42 20 94 respectively the ko00363 pathway related to bisphenol degradation was significant p 0 05 for the two electrodes 4 discussion 4 1 water pollutant removal bpa can be used as a direct source of carbon and energy the bpa degradation products are 4 hydroxybenzonicacid 4 hydroxyacetophenone 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 propanol and 2 3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 2 propanediol 23 in addition to bacterial degradation adsorption plays an important role in removal of pollutants by a cw mfc 9 cws also take up pollutants through root absorption 24 in previous studies the average bpa removal efficiencies were 73 3 for a cw planted with heliconia 25 and 78 7 for a cw mfc 8 compared with that in the above studies the bpa removal efficiency in the present study was higher because of enhancements provided by the anode material and functional bacteria for example pseudomonas species play an important role in benzene ring cleavage and the high proportion of pseudomonas species in the eg promoted removal of bpa table 1 the cod removal was primarily dependent on the metabolism of microorganisms and contributed to the voltage fig 3a improvements in cod removal with changes in the anode material and attached bacteria are thought to be achieved in two ways studies have shown that mfcs provide an anode dependent extracellular electron process to enhance the cod removal efficiency 26 conductive material addition can extend the electroactive scope of the anode to adjacent filling material and contribute to electroactive bacterial community format ion 27 28 the improvement we observed in geobacter verified this phenomenon the cod removal in the present study was better than that in most previous studies table s1 ammonium oxidation is a significant process in a mfc anode anaerobic extracellular respiration is beneficial for nh4 n removal 29 30 in addition ammonium ions can be used as the sole electron donor in the presence of iron with an extracellular electron acceptor called ferric ammonium oxidation ferric ammonium oxidation bacteria feammox were more abundant in the eg than in the cg table 1 nitrite may be produced in the process and oxidized to nitrate geobacter is a typical feammox bacterium a high abundance geobacter in the eg anode would contribute to high nh4 n removal and this could explain the interesting nitrogen removal phenomenon 11 this process may produce nitrite which would be moved with the current to the cathode where it would produce nitrate this may be the reason why the total n removal was not significant total p removal depends on substrate adsorption 12 the cg and eg reactor configurations had the same setup and total p removal was similar in both fig 2c the phosphorus accumulating bacteria pao content in eg was significantly higher than that in cg which explained why the eg had a higher total p efficiency than the cg for example thermomonas is not only associated with pao but also electroactive bacteria eab consequently it is capable of producing electricity while removing phosphorus 4 2 evaluation of electricity production in the cw mfc using fe3c as an anodic exogenous electron donor can facilitate electricity production in a cw mfc in the present study the maximum power density of the eg 3 88 mw m2 and the ce were higher than those in previous studies that used graphite and cylindrical activated carbon table s2 the ce range was 0 04 87 31 ce loss in a cw mfc mainly occurs because of 1 oxygen release from plant roots and diffusion to the anode causing electron loss and 2 bacterial use of organic matter for sustenance rather than conversion to electrons 5 microorganism metabolic activity also affects the internal resistance 32 33 and as the number of bacteria in the community increases the internal resistance of the organism diminishes microbe richness in the cg reactor was greater than that in the eg reactor which resulted in lower internal resistance in addition the higher ce and cod removal in the eg than in the cg indicated that there was higher cod conversion to electricity generation electrochemical oxidation of iron can be accelerated by iron oxidizing bacteria the zero valence iron in fe3c provides exogenous electrons and stimulates the production of h ions by the microorganisms which increases the rate of electron transfer 24 voltage output increases under this bioelectrochemical process 34 in this context fe3c as an anodic exogenous electron donor should enhance electricity production 4 3 anode bacterial characterization analysis sem and clsm results showed that fe3c addition strengthened anode bacterial biofilm formation and activity it accounted for eg having better water purification and electricity production and is consistent with previous study 35 studies showed that a higher portion of energy was consumed for the synthesis of eps rather than for bacterial growth 36 37 it can explain cg have lower ce and electricity production eg reactor anode biomass was abundant eps content lower biomass has disadvantage in mass transfer efficiency 32 33 which can illustrate eg had higher internal resistance it is widely accepted that the energy for microorganism is essential to maintain bacterial metabolization however the bacterial may produce eps when growing on the anode surface consuming energy for bacterial growth 38 it is commonly to detect eps existence on the anode in bioelectrochemical systems eps could account for 50 90 of the total organic carbon of biofilms and possess many functions such as attributing the initial attachment of microorganisms to electrode materials enhancing biofilm resistance to environmental stress accelerating electron transfer 39 in this study the biomass was improved for fe3c addition enhancing bacterial activity although protein content in eps benefit to electron transfer is lower in eg higher electricity production was observed for iron valence state conversion facilitating electron transfer 40 similarly iron addition improved bacterial activity and bacterial metabolites more complex 41 it can state eps composition more complex in eg fulvic like only occurred in eps of fe3c enhanced anode and is confirmed to accelerate electron transfer 42 that is fit for eg has higher electricity production potential and proved fe3c as anodic exogenous electron donor friendly to anode bacterial community 4 4 microbial community analysis 4 4 1 analysis of the microbial community diversity the anode material electron acceptors donors energy supply substances compounds and reactor operating conditions all affect microbial richness and evenness 43 microbial diversity is also influenced by the ambient environment including the temperature and humidity 44 electricity production and wastewater treatment occurs primarily at the anode resulting in greater diversity of microorganisms at the anode than at the cathode the fe3c anode in the mfc was beneficial for degradation of bpa and microbial evolution resulted in an uneven community that was consistent with the observed pielou s index values 45 fe3c addition did not negatively affect the eg bacterial diversity 4 4 2 evolution of the microbial community composition structure and function bacterial community analysis at the phylum level allows us to understand bacterial community structure changes fig 5a and b proteobacteria reportedly include nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria that can participate in the c and n cycles 64 in a previous study the cathode had the highest proteobacteria content for anaerobic ammonium oxidation in a mfc integrated hybrid cw 29 30 proteobacteria was also identified as the dominant eab in another study 31 proteobacteria include different types of iron oxidizing bacteria 46 that can degrade bpa 47 bacteroidetes which are electroactive bacteria were the second most dominant phylum 65 this may explain why the bpa removal and electricity generation performance differed between the cg and eg gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria are vital eab and play an important role in biogeochemical cycles gammaproteobacteria may be responsible for phosphorus removal 48 and they could also contribute to the high denitrification and dephosphorization efficiencies observed in the two cw mfc configurations gammaproteobacteria can transfer electrons from the cytochrome to the outer membrane and the cell wall to improve electrical performance in a mfc 49 the circuit environment promoted electrochemical bacteria abundance the degree distributions of the networks are shown in fig s5 in the network analysis 576 nodes and 6882 edges were obtained 67 42 positive and 32 58 negative and explained the cooperative relationships in the anode bacterial community this suggested that fe3c addition resulted in a stronger ability to resist disturbances burkholderiaceae are ammonia oxidizing bacteria table 1 that can convert ammonia to nitrite 50 furthermore burkholderiaceae are eab and can transfer extracellular electrons to the surface of the electrode directly or through intermediaries 51 fe3c enhances the anode function of ammonia oxidation and electricity production which is consistent with the ega having a high proportion of burkholderiaceae previous reports have shown that caulobacter is a vital eab and is abundant in samples table 1 these bacteria can promote pollutant removal and improve the efficiency of electricity generation in mfcs 52 geobacter and desulfovibrio are both classified as respiratory dirb while pseudomonas is dirb geobacter and desulfovibrio use ferric iron as an electron acceptor at the end of their respiratory chains for metabolism and energy by contrast pseudomonas does not use an electron acceptor and only produces energy through fermentation 53 geobacter and pseudomonas are both members of the feammox and eab groups the proportion of geobacter was significantly higher than that of pseudomonas p 0 05 the proportions of pseudomonas in the eg and cg were not significantly different p 0 05 these results may explain why the electricity production and ammonium nitrogen removal efficiency were higher in the eg reactor than in the cg reactor 4 4 3 prediction of the functional genes the amino acid metabolism metabolism of co factors and vitamins carbohydrate metabolism and biodegradation and metabolism of xenobiotics are all examples of processes that are frequently associated with microbial metabolism comparison of the ega and cga showed that the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins in the ega was significantly higher p 0 05 which also depended on the valence state of the iron riboflavin is a cofactor which implies that it acts as an electron intermediary and promotes the electron transfer mechanism 54 sulfur has a different valency in terms of electron transfer than oxygen the ko00920 pathway which is related to sulfur metabolism was consistent with the eg having a higher electricity production rate the ko00363 pathway which is related to bisphenol degradation was significant p 0 05 for the two electrodes and improved the bpa removal performance 5 conclusions our results demonstrated that fe3c as an external anode electron donor significantly improved the device performance decreased bpa biotoxicity and had excellent biocompatibility the eg performed well in the removal of chemical oxygen demand 76 44 2 25 total phosphorus 98 40 0 17 ammonium nitrogen 91 62 0 85 and bpa 91 62 0 85 and had a higher voltage 352 13 31 48 mv and power density 3 88 mw m2 than the cg bacteria in the cga had higher alpha diversity and lower structural complexity than in the ega these results suggest that fe3c addition improves the ability of the system to resist disturbances proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were the dominant bacterial communities in the anode and keystone taxa correlation analysis demonstrated bacterial cooperation increased with fe3c functional prediction analysis illustrated that fe3c addition not only altered the bacterial community structure and composition but also changed the functional properties furthermore fe3c addition enhanced the device performance by influencing the bacterial community structure and function to optimize bioelectrochemical processes declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflicts to declare

restore ecosystem functions 7 in a previous study a constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc was applied to treatment of bpa containing wastewater 8 the cw mfc performance under different hydraulic detention times was compared with that of a constructed wetland cw the results showed that bpa damaged the microbial community and the bacterial abundance changed at the phylum and genus levels further study of the microbial community is required to understand the device performance intraspecific interactions are essential for microbial responses to environmental changes 55 and these relationships affect the bacterial community structure and function 56 to date methods to reduce anode microbial damage or improve the device performance have not been investigated in a cw mfc organic matter is degraded by anaerobic microorganisms at the anode to produce protons and electrons protons are transferred to the cathode by the solution and electrons are transferred by copper wires under aerobic conditions in the cathode the protons and electrons react with oxygen to generate electricity eq 1 to date cw mfcs have been applied to polluted water containing caffeine 57 and salt 9 landfill leachate and municipal wastewater 58 and sewer overflow 59 the performance of the cw mfc can be enhanced by optimizing the device operation patterns 60 wetland plants 61 electrode materials 10 and substrate compositions 11 the efficiency of wastewater purification and electricity production have been used to evaluate the cw mfc performance these studies have explained the device performance at a molecular level and have shown that anode materials and microbes on their surfaces play an important role in cw mfc systems 1 nc h 2 o n h 2 o nc o 2 4 n e 4 n h 4 n e n o 2 4 n h 2 n h 2 these materials and microbes determine the number of electrons and transfer rates in the circuit 12 the anode material needs to serve both as an electron donor and a carrier for microbial growth 13 14 62 currently iron pyrite 10 and nano zero valent iron nzvi 15 are the main materials used as the anode these materials have excellent electrical conductivity and biocompatibility with different biocatalysts however sulfate is produced during long term operation and causes water acidification which damages the cw biota nzvi does not acidify the environment but is readily lost in the effluent to overcome this nzvi is commonly fixed in the system by loading it onto activated carbon or biochar however this requires the use of extra reagents and increases the cost the use of fe3c as an anode material overcomes the issues associated with other materials it contains carbon has iron for its zero valence characteristics and is not readily lost in the effluent because of its electrical conductivity fe3c can act as the central domain for microbe mediated metabolism promoting the metabolic activities of microorganisms 16 microorganisms can act as exoelectrogens to transfer electrons from the electrode surface to soluble or insoluble electron acceptors 17 the bacteria s functional characteristics can be enhanced by iron which acts as an exogenous electron donor however few studies have investigated fe3c in terms of mfc performance or clarified the background bacterial response mechanism we hypothesized that fe3c could act as an anodic exogenous electron donor in cw mfc water purification to affect electricity production and the bacterial community structure and diversity it could also influence the microbial potential function and intraspecific interactions the specific objectives of this work were to i determine the removal efficiencies of various pollutants and evaluate the electricity production performance of two cw mfcs ii assess the water purification and electrochemical performances of reactors in terms of microbial community structure and composition and iii forecast functional diversity and investigate ecological impacts 2 materials and methods 2 1

results 3 1 wastewater treatment efficiency the eg had better water purification performance than the cg fig 2 the bpa and cod removal efficiency in eg was much higher than that in cg from the beginning of the experiment fig 2d the total n removal efficiencies in the eg and cg were not significantly different but nh4 n in the eg was much greater than that in the cg during steady state operation conditions fig 2a and b 3 2 electricity production the voltage curve and cod removal efficiency relationship are shown in fig 3a the eg reactor had a much higher average voltage 352 13 mv than the cg reactor 269 39 mv during steady state operation the internal resistance values in the cg and eg reactors were 514 70 ω and 541 28 ω respectively fig 3b the highest power density and current density achieved with the eg were 3 88 mw m2 and 17 48 ma m2 respectively the power density and current density of the cg were 2 61 mw m2 and 14 31 ma m2 respectively the ce for the eg was 3

significance protein and polysaccharides are the main composition of eps eg anode eps content was lower than cg fig s3 the composition of eps between cg and eg anode is different fig s4 and table s3 eps attracted from cg comprised of tyrosine like tryptophan like b1 t1 marked in fig s4 a and smaller amount of humic like substance m marked in fig s4 b apart from above substance eps from eg have tyrosine like b2 and fulvic like a 3 4 microbial community 3 4 1 microbial community diversity the alpha diversities fig 4 of the ck ega and cga were not significantly different p 0 05 the microbial community diversity indices at the cathodes of the two cw mfcs were significantly lower than those at the anode p 0 05 for the microbial communities of ega and cga the richness of the cga microbial community was significantly higher than that of the ega p 0 05 3 4 2 bacterial community composition structure and function proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were the dominant bacterial communities at the phylum level fig 5a gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria were the dominant bacteria at the class level fig 5b and biomarker bacteria at the class level fig 6 burkholderiaceae were key bacteria at the family level and showed symbiosis with other functional bacteria i e nitrosomoonadaceae and rhodanobacteraceae fig 5c proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi were the key taxa fig 5d the degree distributions of the networks are shown in fig s7 in the network analysis 576 nodes and 6882 edges were obtained 67 42 positive and 32 58 negative lefse was used to find biomarkers figs 6 s6 bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were the biomarkers in cg and eg anode samples at the phylum level caulobacter were the key bacteria at the genus level fig 6 c alphaproteobacteria and p proteobacteria which are both electroactive bacteria eab were the main microbes in the cg and eg cathode samples the operational taxonomic unit values for eab dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria dirb feammox and dissimilatory nitrate reducing bacteria dnb improved when fe3c was used as the anode material p 0 05 a higher proportion of geobacter p 0 05 and relatively low proportion of pseudomonas were observed in the ega compared with those in the cga table 1 3 4 3 functional microbial prediction using the kegg database as the main biological metabolic pathway analysis database 22 the abundance values of six metabolic pathways were calculated fig s3 the contributions of amino acid metabolism metabolism of co factors and vitamins carbohydrate metabolism and biodegradation and metabolism of xenobiotics were significantly improved the value for the ko00920 pathway which is related to sulfur metabolism in ega 330 92 1 12 was significantly higher than that in cga 356 57 4 38 when comparing the anode and cathode of eg 95 80 8 590 and 223 22 13 25 respectively and cg 76 44 2 09 and 189 42 20 94 respectively the ko00363 pathway related to bisphenol degradation was significant p 0 05 for the two electrodes 4 discussion 4 1 water pollutant removal bpa can be used as a direct source of carbon and energy the bpa degradation products are 4 hydroxybenzonicacid 4 hydroxyacetophenone 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 propanol and 2 3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 2 propanediol 23 in addition to bacterial degradation adsorption plays an important role in removal of pollutants by a cw mfc 9 cws also take up pollutants through root absorption 24 in previous studies the average bpa removal efficiencies were 73 3 for a cw planted with heliconia 25 and 78 7 for a cw mfc 8 compared with that in the above studies the bpa removal efficiency in the present study was higher because of enhancements provided by the anode material and functional bacteria for example pseudomonas species play an important role in benzene ring cleavage and the high proportion of pseudomonas species in the eg promoted removal of bpa table 1 the cod removal was primarily dependent on the metabolism of microorganisms and contributed to the voltage fig 3a improvements in cod removal with changes in the anode material and attached bacteria are thought to be achieved in two ways studies have shown that mfcs provide an anode dependent extracellular electron process to enhance the cod removal efficiency 26 conductive material addition can extend the electroactive scope of the anode to adjacent filling material and contribute to electroactive bacterial community format ion 27 28 the improvement we observed in geobacter verified this phenomenon the cod removal in the present study was better than that in most previous studies table s1 ammonium oxidation is a significant process in a mfc anode anaerobic extracellular respiration is beneficial for nh4 n removal 29 30 in addition ammonium ions can be used as the sole electron donor in the presence of iron with an extracellular electron acceptor called ferric ammonium oxidation ferric ammonium oxidation bacteria feammox were more abundant in the eg than in the cg table 1 nitrite may be produced in the process and oxidized to nitrate geobacter is a typical feammox bacterium a high abundance geobacter in the eg anode would contribute to high nh4 n removal and this could explain the interesting nitrogen removal phenomenon 11 this process may produce nitrite which would be moved with the current to the cathode where it would produce nitrate this may be the reason why the total n removal was not significant total p removal depends on substrate adsorption 12 the cg and eg reactor configurations had the same setup and total p removal was similar in both fig 2c the phosphorus accumulating bacteria pao content in eg was significantly higher than that in cg which explained why the eg had a higher total p efficiency than the cg for example thermomonas is not only associated with pao but also electroactive bacteria eab consequently it is capable of producing electricity while removing phosphorus 4 2 evaluation of electricity production in the cw mfc using fe3c as an anodic exogenous electron donor can facilitate electricity production in a cw mfc in the present study the maximum power density of the eg 3 88 mw m2 and the ce were higher than those in previous studies that used graphite and cylindrical activated carbon table s2 the ce range was 0 04 87 31 ce loss in a cw mfc mainly occurs because of 1 oxygen release from plant roots and diffusion to the anode causing electron loss and 2 bacterial use of organic matter for sustenance rather than conversion to electrons 5 microorganism metabolic activity also affects the internal resistance 32 33 and as the number of bacteria in the community increases the internal resistance of the organism diminishes microbe richness in the cg reactor was greater than that in the eg reactor which resulted in lower internal resistance in addition the higher ce and cod removal in the eg than in the cg indicated that there was higher cod conversion to electricity generation electrochemical oxidation of iron can be accelerated by iron oxidizing bacteria the zero valence iron in fe3c provides exogenous electrons and stimulates the production of h ions by the microorganisms which increases the rate of electron transfer 24 voltage output increases under this bioelectrochemical process 34 in this context fe3c as an anodic exogenous electron donor should enhance electricity production 4 3 anode bacterial characterization analysis sem and clsm results showed that fe3c addition strengthened anode bacterial biofilm formation and activity it accounted for eg having better water purification and electricity production and is consistent with previous study 35 studies showed that a higher portion of energy was consumed for the synthesis of eps rather than for bacterial growth 36 37 it can explain cg have lower ce and electricity production eg reactor anode biomass was abundant eps content lower biomass has disadvantage in mass transfer efficiency 32 33 which can illustrate eg had higher internal resistance it is widely accepted that the energy for microorganism is essential to maintain bacterial metabolization however the bacterial may produce eps when growing on the anode surface consuming energy for bacterial growth 38 it is commonly to detect eps existence on the anode in bioelectrochemical systems eps could account for 50 90 of the total organic carbon of biofilms and possess many functions such as attributing the initial attachment of microorganisms to electrode materials enhancing biofilm resistance to environmental stress accelerating electron transfer 39 in this study the biomass was improved for fe3c addition enhancing bacterial activity although protein content in eps benefit to electron transfer is lower in eg higher electricity production was observed for iron valence state conversion facilitating electron transfer 40 similarly iron addition improved bacterial activity and bacterial metabolites more complex 41 it can state eps composition more complex in eg fulvic like only occurred in eps of fe3c enhanced anode and is confirmed to accelerate electron transfer 42 that is fit for eg has higher electricity production potential and proved fe3c as anodic exogenous electron donor friendly to anode bacterial community 4 4 microbial community analysis 4 4 1 analysis of the microbial community diversity the anode material electron acceptors donors energy supply substances compounds and reactor operating conditions all affect microbial richness and evenness 43 microbial diversity is also influenced by the ambient environment including the temperature and humidity 44 electricity production and wastewater treatment occurs primarily at the anode resulting in greater diversity of microorganisms at the anode than at the cathode the fe3c anode in the mfc was beneficial for degradation of bpa and microbial evolution resulted in an uneven community that was consistent with the observed pielou s index values 45 fe3c addition did not negatively affect the eg bacterial diversity 4 4 2 evolution of the microbial community composition structure and function bacterial community analysis at the phylum level allows us to understand bacterial community structure changes fig 5a and b proteobacteria reportedly include nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria that can participate in the c and n cycles 64 in a previous study the cathode had the highest proteobacteria content for anaerobic ammonium oxidation in a mfc integrated hybrid cw 29 30 proteobacteria was also identified as the dominant eab in another study 31 proteobacteria include different types of iron oxidizing bacteria 46 that can degrade bpa 47 bacteroidetes which are electroactive bacteria were the second most dominant phylum 65 this may explain why the bpa removal and electricity generation performance differed between the cg and eg gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria are vital eab and play an important role in biogeochemical cycles gammaproteobacteria may be responsible for phosphorus removal 48 and they could also contribute to the high denitrification and dephosphorization efficiencies observed in the two cw mfc configurations gammaproteobacteria can transfer electrons from the cytochrome to the outer membrane and the cell wall to improve electrical performance in a mfc 49 the circuit environment promoted electrochemical bacteria abundance the degree distributions of the networks are shown in fig s5 in the network analysis 576 nodes and 6882 edges were obtained 67 42 positive and 32 58 negative and explained the cooperative relationships in the anode bacterial community this suggested that fe3c addition resulted in a stronger ability to resist disturbances burkholderiaceae are ammonia oxidizing bacteria table 1 that can convert ammonia to nitrite 50 furthermore burkholderiaceae are eab and can transfer extracellular electrons to the surface of the electrode directly or through intermediaries 51 fe3c enhances the anode function of ammonia oxidation and electricity production which is consistent with the ega having a high proportion of burkholderiaceae previous reports have shown that caulobacter is a vital eab and is abundant in samples table 1 these bacteria can promote pollutant removal and improve the efficiency of electricity generation in mfcs 52 geobacter and desulfovibrio are both classified as respiratory dirb while pseudomonas is dirb geobacter and desulfovibrio use ferric iron as an electron acceptor at the end of their respiratory chains for metabolism and energy by contrast pseudomonas does not use an electron acceptor and only produces energy through fermentation 53 geobacter and pseudomonas are both members of the feammox and eab groups the proportion of geobacter was significantly higher than that of pseudomonas p 0 05 the proportions of pseudomonas in the eg and cg were not significantly different p 0 05 these results may explain why the electricity production and ammonium nitrogen removal efficiency were higher in the eg reactor than in the cg reactor 4 4 3 prediction of the functional genes the amino acid metabolism metabolism of co factors and vitamins carbohydrate metabolism and biodegradation and metabolism of xenobiotics are all examples of processes that are frequently associated with microbial metabolism comparison of the ega and cga showed that the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins in the ega was significantly higher p 0 05 which also depended on the valence state of the iron riboflavin is a cofactor which implies that it acts as an electron intermediary and promotes the electron transfer mechanism 54 sulfur has a different valency in terms of electron transfer than oxygen the ko00920 pathway which is related to sulfur metabolism was consistent with the eg having a higher electricity production rate the ko00363 pathway which is related to bisphenol degradation was significant p 0 05 for the two electrodes and improved the bpa removal performance 5 conclusions our results demonstrated that fe3c as an external anode electron donor significantly improved the device performance decreased bpa biotoxicity and had excellent biocompatibility the eg performed well in the removal of chemical oxygen demand 76 44 2 25 total phosphorus 98 40 0 17 ammonium nitrogen 91 62 0 85 and bpa 91 62 0 85 and had a higher voltage 352 13 31 48 mv and power density 3 88 mw m2 than the cg bacteria in the cga had higher alpha diversity and lower structural complexity than in the ega these results suggest that fe3c addition improves the ability of the system to resist disturbances proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were the dominant bacterial communities in the anode and keystone taxa correlation analysis demonstrated bacterial cooperation increased with fe3c functional prediction analysis illustrated that fe3c addition not only altered the bacterial community structure and composition but also changed the functional properties furthermore fe3c addition enhanced the device performance by influencing the bacterial community structure and function to optimize bioelectrochemical processes declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflicts to declare

12728,the electrocoagulation ec process was conducted to treat the vinasse waste with a variation of agitation speeds of 0 250 and 500 rpm which can be expressed in reynolds re numbers of 0 5 47 104 and 1 09 105 respectively the goal of this study was to investigate the effect of agitation speed on the ec process build a novel mechanistic model and analyze the effect of agitation speed through the proposed mechanistic model the measured parameters during the ec process were the changes in anode weight electrical voltage liquid temperature liquid ph liquid volume cod concentration fe

the wastewater treatments can be applied to treat various wastewater 1 6 ec utilizes the electrical current to do an electrolysis reaction the anode and cathode are needed to connect the direct current dc or alternating current ac power supply to the liquid wastes therefore they have to be immersed in the wastes 2 4 7 anode and cathode are connected to the positive and negative poles of the dc power supply one type of metal commonly used in ec as the anode and the cathode is iron fe 2 8 when the electrical current flows the oxidation and reduction reactions occur at the anode and the cathode respectively in the oxidation reaction the anode fe is oxidized to either fe2 or fe3 ions while in the reduction reaction the water is reduced to oh ions and h2 gas then a chemical reaction between fe2 or fe3 ions and oh ions results in coagulants of fe oh 2 or fe oh 3 2 9 the coagulants adsorb pollutants to form flocs the flocs are reacted to each other to form bigger flocs further the bigger flocs will settle as sludge or be pushed by h2 gas to the surface of the liquid as scum 4 10 based on the information above the ec can change the concentration of pollutants and electrode metal ions in wastewater and produce sludge and scum 3 5 commonly the concentration of organic pollutants in wastewater is measured as the concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod 11 however in detail the ec also changes the liquid ph liquid temperature and liquid volume 12 therefore the ec mechanism process is very complex it is very interesting to model the ec process based on its mechanism process through modeling the effect of affecting factors in the ec process can be studied clearly and deeply the mechanistic models were successfully built by some previous studies syaichurrozi et al 12 built a simple mechanistic model involving the changes in cod mass sludge mass and scum mass furthermore a more detailed mechanistic model was built by syaichurrozi et al 13 by considering the changes in cod concentration fe concentration sludge mass and scum mass but the liquid volume was assumed to be constant furthermore syaichurrozi et al 14 modified the mechanistic model by considering the change in liquid volume and then syaichurrozi et al 15 improved the mechanistic model by considering not only the change in liquid volume but also the changes in liquid ph and temperature however the profile of liquid volume ph and temperature during the ec process was approximated with the quadratic line as a function of time in those studies 14 15 in order words the kinetics of changes in the volume ph and temperature of liquid were not built through the theoretical ec process mechanism the summary of the mechanistic models from the previous studies is shown in table 1 therefore the mechanistic model has to be improved in this study with the target shown in table 1 vinasse is a liquid waste with a very high cod content 12 16 bioethanol industries release 8 20 l vinasse when producing 1 l bioethanol 16 due to its big volume and high cod content vinasse is to be a serious liquid waste prior discharged to the environment it has to be treated one of the treatment methods that can be utilized to treat the vinasse is ec 13 14 in indonesia the local vinasse contains a very high cod content 100 g l 12 utilization of ec to treat the local vinasse has been conducted by our team the application of ec to treat the local vinasse has been studied with variation of initial phs 4 35 5 6 13 variation of electrical voltages 7 5 10 12 5 v 14 variation of electrical currents 2 5 3 3 5 a 12 another factor that is important in ec is agitation speed 17 19 therefore this study will investigate the effect of agitation speed on the ec process in treating the local vinasse this study was new in experiment and modeling in treating the vinasse by ec method at various agitation speeds the aims of this study are 1 to study the effect of agitation speed on the ec process 2 to build a detailed mechanistic model and 3 to investigate the effect of agitation speed on the ec process quantitatively with the mechanistic model developed 2 mechanism of the ec process all the reactions that occur during the ec process are assumed as chemical reactions with irreversible processes during the ec process the oxidation and reduction reactions occur at the anode and cathode respectively 1 2 in the oxidation reaction the iron fe is oxidized to fe2 ion eq 1 many studies 13 14 20 21 proved that the product of the oxidation reaction at the iron anode is fe2 ion not fe3 ion 1 fe s k o fe 2 aq 2 e in the reduction reaction the water is reduced to oh ion and h2 gas eq 2 2 2 h 2 o l 2 e k r h 2 g 2 oh aq furthermore the fe2 ions react with oh ions to form coagulants of fe oh 2 1 2 eq 3 hydrolysis reaction the fe oh 3 can also be produced from the fe2 ion when the liquid contains high dissolved oxygen 1 but the vinasse contains a very low dissolved oxygen 22 therefore this study assumed that the type of coagulant produced in the liquid during the ec process was fe oh 2 3 fe 2 aq 2 oh aq k h fe oh 2 s furthermore the fe oh 2 adsorbs pollutants assuming that every mol fe oh 2 can adsorb n mol of cod to form flocs then the flocs react with each other to form bigger flocs which then settle to sludge as shown in eq 4a 4a fe oh 2 s n cod aq k a sludge s it is assumed that k a is a second order reaction rate constant that is not affected by the total mol of fe oh 2 and cod in the reaction shown in eq 4a because of spontaneous hydrolysis of fe2 to the coagulants the rate determining step is the generation of fe2 electrolytically 23 for simplifying eq 4a can be modified to eq 4b 4b fe 2 aq n cod aq k a sludge s the sludge can be separated by sedimentation however a part of sludge can go up as scum due to flotation by evolved h2 during the ec process eq 5 13 5 sludge s k f scum s 3 modeling the mechanistic model is built based on the chemical process given in eqs 1 5 3 1 net production rate of fe2 mass the production rate of fe2 mol by oxidation reaction follows the faraday s law 14 eq 6 6 d n fe 2 dt i zf the consumption rate of fe2 mol by adsorbing the cod is written in eq 7 7 d n fe 2 dt k a fe 2 cod v hence the net production rate of fe2 mol is shown in eq 8 d n fe 2 dt i zf k a fe 2 cod v 8 d n fe 2 dt i zf k a n fe 2 n cod v therefore the production rate of fe2 mass is shown in eq 9 9 d m fe 2 dt m w fe i zf k a m fe 2 m cod v m w cod 3 2 net consumption rate of cod mass the net consumption rate of cod mol is shown in eq 10 10 d n cod dt n k a n fe 2 n cod v therefore the net consumption rate of cod mass is shown in eq 11 11 d m cod dt n k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe 3 3 net production rate of sludge mass the production rate of sludge mass can be expressed through eq 12 d n sludge dt k a n fe 2 n cod v 12 d n sludge dt k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod based on eq 4b the sludge can be expressed as fe cod n therefore the molecular weight of sludge can be written in eq 13 13 m w s m w fe n m w cod hence eq 12 is modified to eq 14 14 d m sludge d t m w fe n m w cod k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod the consumption rate of sludge mass due to flotation can be written in eq 15 15 d m sludge dt k f m sludge the net production rate of sludge mass can be written in eq 16 16 d m sludge dt m w fe n m w cod k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod k f m sludge 3 4 net production rate of scum mass the net production rate of scum mass is expressed in eq 17 17 d m scum dt k f m sludge 3 5 reduction rate of liquid volume during the ec process the liquid volume decreases as a function of time a decrease in liquid volume can be caused by 1 reduction reaction eq 2 and 2 scum production 14 the decrease in liquid volume due to the reduction reaction can be written in eq 18 18 dv dt 2 i zf m w h 2 o ρ h 2 o the decrease in liquid volume due to the scum production is written in eq 19 19 dv dt k v m scum hence the complete equation for the reduction rate of liquid volume is shown in eq 20 20 dv dt 2 i zf m w h 2 o ρ h 2 o k v m scum 3 6 the changes in ph based on eqs 1 3 the net production rate of oh ion mol is twice as much as the net production rate of fe2 ion mol therefore the net production rate of oh ion mol is shown in eq 21 d n oh dt 2 d n fe 2 dt d n oh dt 2 i zf k a n fe 2 n cod v 21 d n oh dt 2 i zf k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod furthermore eq 21 is modified to eq 22 d oh v dt 2 i zf k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod v d oh dt oh dv dt 2 i zf k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod 22 d oh dt 2 i zf k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod oh dv dt v furthermore the liquid ph can be calculated through eq 23 23 dph dt k ph 14 log oh 3 7 the changes in voltage a correlation between electrical voltage current and resistance is shown in eq 24 14 24 v ir for i constant eq 24 is modified to eq 25 25 dv dt i dr dt the electrical resistance has a straight relationship with the sludge concentration furthermore it has a reverse relationship with the fe2 concentration ph and surface area of the electrode hence it can be written through eq 26 26 dr dt k ri m slu d ge v k rd ph m fe 2 v a e hence dv dt i k ri m sludge v k rd ph m fe 2 a e v 27 dv dt i k ri m sludge v k rd ph m fe 2 l e v 0 v a b w e v 3 8 the changes in liquid temperature during the ec process the energy supplied to the liquid can be predicted by eq 28 14 28 dq dt vi thus the energy supplied to the liquid increases the liquid temperature eq 29 24 25 29 dq dt m c p dt dt substituting eq 28 to eq 29 to get eq 30 30 dt dt vi m c p the energy loss to the surroundings is assumed to follow the newton s law of cooling 26 written in eq 31 31 dt dt k c t t o the total net energy supplied to the liquid can be written in eq 32 dt dt vi m c p k c t t o 32 dt dt vi v ρ c p k c t t o for simplifying the ρ and c p are assumed to be constant during the ec process so eq 32 is modified to eq 33 with k h t 1 ρ c p 33 dt dt k h t vi v k c t t o all equations included in the mechanistic model are presented in table 2 4 materials and methods 4 1 local vinasse local vinasse was obtained from one of the bioethanol industries in indonesia the waste has cod of 113 70 g l total fe of 0 11 g l and ph of 4 1 the density and viscosity of the vinasse are 1036 34 g l and 0 1392 g dm s respectively 4 2 experimental set up ec reactor was built from 1 l beaker glass cylinder shape with outer diameter inner diameter and height of 1 1 dm 1 05 dm and 1 52 dm respectively the experimental set up of this study followed the previous studies of 13 14 the irons fe were used as electrodes having length width and thickness of 2 dm 0 3 dm and 0 03 dm respectively the anode and cathode were placed vertically at a distance of 0 55 dm the vinasse volume in the ec reactor was 1 l the active electrode dimension of length width and thickness was 0 95 dm 0 3 dm and 0 03 dm respectively the glass agitator with impeller length and width of 0 53 dm and 0 06 dm respectively a dc power supply long wei series of lw k3010d 0 30 v 0 10 a was used as an electrical source the experimental set up of the laboratory scale ec process is shown in fig 1 4 3 experimental design and procedures before used in the ec process the anode and cathode were immersed in hcl 5 v v for 15 min then they were rinsed using the distilled water after that they were dried using the oven at a mercury temperature of 105 110 c for 2 h and then weighed the clean anode and cathode were placed vertically at a distance of 0 55 dm in the ec reactor containing 1 l of vinasse the anode and cathode were connected to the positive and negative poles of the dc power supply the ec process was run under the batch system for 8 h with a constant electrical current of 3a the agitation speed was varied to be 0 250 and 500 rpm during the process per 1 h the changes in electrical voltage liquid temperature liquid ph and surface liquid height were measured the liquid temperature and ph were measured by using a mercury temperature and a digital ph meter the scum produced on the liquid surface was taken by using a plastic spoon and then dried in the oven with a temperature of 105 110 c for at least 2 h and weighed meanwhile the liquid sample of 10 ml was taken and placed in reaction tubes for settling for 24 h the supernatants formed in the tubes were taken for the cod and total fe analyses the cod analysis was conducted through the open reflux and titration method of sni 06 6989 15 2004 the total fe in the solution was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas after the ec process the anode was rinsed using distilled water dried in the oven and weighed the sludge mass was measured using a method proposed in a previous study of 14 the experiments in this study were conducted without replication the process control was ec process without agitation agitation speed 0 rpm this study studied the effect of the agitation speeds of 0 250 and 500 rpm for generalization the agitation speed rpm was changed to be the reynolds re number with eq 34 27 for simplification the density and viscosity of the vinasse are assumed constant during the ec process 34 re ρ n s d a 2 μ by using eq 34 the agitation speed of 0 250 and 500 rpm was equal to re of 0 5 47 104 and 1 09 105 respectively 4 4 kinetic analysis the measured data obtained during the experiment were cod concentration total fe concentration scum mass sludge mass electrical voltage liquid temperature liquid ph and liquid volume per 1 h a curve fitting between experimental data and modeled data was graphed the deviation of those two was calculated using a sum of squares of errors sse eq 35 35 sse i 1 n experimental data modeled data 2 the adjustable kinetic constants in the mechanistic model are k a n k v k f k ph k ri k rd k ht k c the values of the kinetic constants are obtained by minimizing the sse value with help of ms excel 5 results and discussion 5 1 experimental data the ec process at various agitation speeds was successfully conducted and the experimental data were shown in table 3 the experimental data in this study included anode weight loss g electrical voltage v liquid temperature k liquid ph liquid volume ml cod concentration g l total fe concentration g l scum mass g and sludge mass g 5 1 1 anode fe cod mass profiles the anode weight decreased due to the oxidation of anode iron to fe2 in this study the electrical current was maintained constant at a value of 3 a the anode weight loss can be predicted through eq 36 36 anode weight los s g m w fe it zf where m wfe 56 g mol i 3 a z 2 f 96 500c mol t time in second by using eq 36 the value of anode weight loss was predicted to be 25 07 g experimentally the anode weight loss in this study was almost the same as the prediction which was 24 60 24 94 g table 3 if the z 3 the value of anode weight loss was predicted to be 16 71 g therefore it confirmed that the correct z value was 2 and the product of the oxidation reaction of fe was fe2 not fe3 the agitation speed re number did not affect the anode weight loss because based on eq 36 the anode weight loss was just affected by electrical current and electrolysis time the remaining fe mass in liquid is shown in table 3 the remaining fe mass in the liquid was around 8 51 12 91 or the fe mass involved in coagulant formation was around 87 09 91 49 the cod mass in the solution is also shown in table 3 the cod mass decreased from the beginning until the end of the process the coagulants adsorbed the cod to form sludge the cod mass removal for 0 250 and 500 rpm was 63 44 67 62 and 42 27 respectively based on these values an agitation speed of 250 rpm re of 5 47 104 resulted in a better cod mass removal than the others a lower and a higher than the agitation speed of 250 rpm the ec process was not effective a previous study reported that electrooxidation of organic pollutants in wastewater occurs when the wastewater contains a high chloride concentration about 40 g l 28 the oxidation process occurs because chloride cl in liquid turns into chlorine cl2 at the anode furthermore the cl2 reacts with h2o to form hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite ion ocl under acidic conditions the concentration of hypochlorous acid is more dominant than the hypochlorite ion furthermore the hypochlorous acid has a stronger oxidizing power than the hypochlorite ion so organic pollutants are easily oxidized at acidic ph however this study used the local vinasse with a very low chloride concentration about 1 1 g l 12 therefore the decrease in cod concentration in this study was caused by the adsorption by the coagulant not by the oxidation by hypochlorous acid 5 1 2 sludge and scum mass profiles sludge and scum production at various agitation speeds during the ec process are shown in table 3 and fig 2 after the ec process for 8 h the total mass of sludge and scum produced at agitation speeds of 0 250 500 rpm was 94 56 99 96 and 70 04 g respectively fig 2 the agitation speed of 250 rpm resulted in a more total mass of sludge and scum than the others it means that the adsorption process of cod on the coagulants at 250 rpm was more effective than the other agitation speeds in more detail the percentage of scum mass increased while the percentage of sludge mass decreased during the ec process at all various agitation speeds fig 2 the final percentage ratios after 8 h of scum sludge at 0 250 and 500 rpm was 54 93 45 07 61 11 38 89 and 26 50 73 50 respectively the percentage of scum mass 54 93 at 0 rpm was lower than that at 250 rpm 61 11 because the adsorption process occurred effectively and resulted in much more flocs at 250 rpm than that at 0 rpm so the flocs at 250 rpm were easier to be pushed on the liquid surface by h2 gas than another meanwhile the scum mass at 500 rpm 26 50 was lower than that at 250 rpm 61 11 because too high agitation speed caused the contact time between coagulants and pollutants too short so the adsorption process was not effective and the floc mass was produced in a little amount meanwhile too high agitation speed broke the h2 bubbles so the flotation process was low and the scum mass were produced in a little amount 5 1 3 the liquid volume profiles the liquid volume decreased during the ec process a decrease in volume can be caused by 2 the reduction reaction of water and 2 scum production 14 the rate of the decrease in liquid volume at 250 rpm was faster than that at 0 and 500 rpm table 3 because of the electrical current of 3a applied for all various agitation speeds the decrease in liquid volume by reduction reaction of water is almost the same for all variables therefore the decrease in liquid volume by the scum production was more dominant than that by the reduction reaction of water the agitation speed of 250 rpm resulted in more scum mass than the other agitation speeds fig 2 so the rate of the decrease in liquid volume at 250 rpm was higher than that at 0 and 500 rpm 5 1 4 the liquid ph and temperature profiles the liquid ph during the ec process is shown in table 3 the liquid ph increased from the beginning to the end of the process an increase in liquid ph was caused by the oh accumulation in the liquid 13 at the cathode the water is reduced to oh ion and h2 gas the oh reacts with fe2 to form fe oh 2 the remaining oh in solution was accumulated and then increased the liquid ph 12 the liquid temperature increased from the beginning to the end of the process table 3 the increase in liquid temperature was caused by energy supplied from the electrical current continuously input to the liquid 14 5 1 5 the electrical voltage profiles in this study the electrical current was kept constant at 3 a hence the electrical voltage changed during the ec process because the electrical resistance changed a correlation between electrical current i voltage v and resistance r is presented in eq 37 14 37 v ir based on eq 37 an increase in the r value increased the v value from the beginning to the middle of the process the voltage decreased due to the decrease in the electrical resistance the ions fe2 and oh in the high amounts at beginning of the process can decrease the electrical resistance furthermore from the middle to the end of the process the voltage increased at the time range the number of ions fe2 and oh decreased but the sludge increased so the electrical resistance increased and the voltage increased too 5 2 modeling the mechanistic model table 2 successfully predicted the ec process the fitting between the experimental data and modeled data were shown in figs 3 5 based on fig 6 the mechanistic model can work well with a very high r2 which was 0 9977 0 9988 meanwhile the kinetic constant values k a n k v k f k ph k ri k rd k ht k c were presented in table 4 furthermore an analysis was conducted to judge which kinetic constants were affected or not affected by the agitation speed or re number the relative standard deviation rsd is usually used in analytical chemistry to express the precision of an assay the rsd formula is written in eq 38 38 rsd standard deviation sd mean 100 the less the rsd value the smaller the spread of the data and the higher the precision level the acceptable value of the rsd value is not 20 29 30 in this study the rsd is used to judge which kinetic constants are affected or not affected by the agitation speed or re number if the rsd is below 20 the kinetic constants are not affected by the agitation speed or re number table 4 shows the rsd for all kinetic constants based on the rsd value kinetic constants of n k v k f were affected by re number because their rsd values are above 20 in which the value of the kinetic constants spread widely in other words the value of the kinetic constants was the function of the re number on the opposite side the rsd value for k a k ph k ri k rd k ht k c was below or equal to 20 it means the kinetic values were not affected by the re number 5 3 kinetic analysis 5 3 1 the kinetic constants of k a and n based on table 4 the kinetic constant of k a was not affected by the re number this kinetic constant presented the adsorption reaction between the coagulant and the cod the higher the k a value the more the fe2 ions were to be coagulant and contributed to the adsorption reaction variation of agitation speeds in the range of 0 to 500 rpm or re number in the range of 0 to 1 09 105 resulted in the not significant k a values which were 1 06 10 4 1 10 10 4 l mol s it means the amount of fe2 contributing to the adsorption reaction was almost the same for all various re numbers based on experimental data the fe2 contributing in coagulant and then in flocs formation was around 87 09 91 49 for all various agitation speeds re number furthermore the value of n increased from 6 00 to 6 28 with increasing the re number from 0 to 5 47 104 table 4 the kinetic constant of n presented the amount of cod that can be adsorbed by each fe2 coagulant therefore increasing the re number from 0 to 5 47 104 successfully increased the ability of each coagulant to adsorb the cod however a further increase in the re number from 5 47 104 to 1 09 105 decreased the value of n table 4 it means that the ability of the coagulant decreased along with an increase in the re number from 5 47 104 to 1 09 105 too high the re number was not recommended because the adsorption of cod on coagulants was not effective so the rate of cod mass removal at the re of 1 09 105 was lower than that at the re of 5 47 104 the highest value of n of 6 28 was obtained at re of 5 47 104 hence the re number of 5 47 104 250 rpm was more effective than the two others 5 3 2 the kinetic constant of k f the sludge resulted from the reaction between the coagulant and the cod hence the higher the n value the more the flocs can be resulted due to the re of 5 47 104 having a higher n value a higher amount of flocs was resulted at the re number furthermore the kinetic constant of k f showed the rate of flotation reaction it means the higher the k f value the faster the flotation reaction occurred re number of 5 47 104 resulted in a higher k f value 8 62 10 5 s than the other re numbers 3 17 10 5 8 22 10 5 s table 4 the re number of 5 47 104 resulted in a higher amount of flocs than the two others because it had a higher n value than the two others the more the flocs mass the easier the scum was formed 5 3 3 the kinetic constant of k v based on table 4 the increase in re number from 0 to 1 09 105 increased the k v value from 1 22 10 6 to 1 98 10 6 l g s table 4 the kinetic constant of k v represent the amount of the liquid volume that can be included in the scum formation scum was formed from flocs that were pushed by hydrogen gas bubbles to the surface of the liquid the high agitation speed can break the big hydrogen bubbles into small hydrogen bubbles the smaller the hydrogen bubble size the wider the contact area of the bubbles on the liquid therefore more liquid can be brought by the smaller bubbles finally the liquid included in the scum formation was more at a faster agitation speed re number 5 3 4 the kinetic constant of k ph k ri k rd k ht k c the kinetic constant of k ph presented the rate of increase in liquid ph during the ec process the k ph values were not affected by the re numbers because the values were almost the same 7 71 10 6 9 12 10 6 s table 4 furthermore the kinetic constant of k ri and k rd presented the rate of increase and decrease in electrical resistance respectively these kinetic constants were not affected by the re number based on the rsd value of 19 20 moreover the kinetic constant of k ht and k c presented the rate of increase and decrease in liquid temperature respectively these kinetic constants were also not affected by the re number based on the rsd value of 4 6 5 4 advanced mechanistic model as a function of re number based on table 4 the agitation speed re number affected the kinetic constant values of n k v k f but not values of k a k ph k ri k rd k ht k c hence it was important to build correlations between the re number and the value of n k v k f and fig 7 shows those correlations the equations of the correlation are shown in eqs 39 41 39 n 4 10 10 re 2 3 10 5 re 6 40 k v 1 10 16 re 2 5 10 12 re 1 10 6 41 k f 1 10 14 re 2 6 10 10 re 8 10 5 furthermore the mean values of k a k ph k ri k rd k ht k c table 4 can be used as the universal values that can predict the ec process with the re range of 0 1 09 105 the mechanistic model in table 2 with the kinetic constant values of n k v k f as a function of re number eqs 39 41 and the mean value of kinetic constants of k a k ph k ri k rd k ht k c can be used to predict the ec process at various re numbers with a range from 0 to 1 09 105 the optimization can be conducted to find the optimum re number which results in the maximum cod mass removal value based on an optimization the best re number was 3 82 104 with a cod mass removal of 70 01 the ec process at re of 3 82 104 can be predicted and is shown in fig 8 6 conclusion the agitation speed in the ec process was varied to 0 250 and 500 rpm which can be converted to the re number of 0 5 47 104 and 1 09 105 respectively after 8 h the ec process at the re of 0 5 47 104 and 1 09 105 resulted in the cod mass removal of 63 44 67 62 and 42 27 respectively meanwhile the re of 0 5 47 104 and 1 09 105 resulted in a total mass of sludge and scum of 94 56 99 96 and 70 04 g respectively furthermore a detailed mechanistic model was successfully built with nine kinetic constants of k a n k v k f k ph k ri k rd k ht k c the mechanistic model was successfully used to simulate the ec process at the agitation speeds with a very high r2 of 0 9977 0 9988 based on simulation results the re number affected the value of n k v k f but not the value of k a k ph k ri k rd k ht k c furthermore the equations expressing the values of n k v k f as a function of re number were built finally the optimization was conducted to find the optimum re number to result in the maximum cod mass removal the predicted optimum re was 3 82 104 with maximum cod mass removal of 70 01 or maximum cod concentration removal of 44 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12728,the electrocoagulation ec process was conducted to treat the vinasse waste with a variation of agitation speeds of 0 250 and 500 rpm which can be expressed in reynolds re numbers of 0 5 47 104 and 1 09 105 respectively the goal of this study was to investigate the effect of agitation speed on the ec process build a novel mechanistic model and analyze the effect of agitation speed through the proposed mechanistic model the measured parameters during the ec process were the changes in anode weight electrical voltage liquid temperature liquid ph liquid volume cod concentration fe

the wastewater treatments can be applied to treat various wastewater 1 6 ec utilizes the electrical current to do an electrolysis reaction the anode and cathode are needed to connect the direct current dc or alternating current ac power supply to the liquid wastes therefore they have to be immersed in the wastes 2 4 7 anode and cathode are connected to the positive and negative poles of the dc power supply one type of metal commonly used in ec as the anode and the cathode is iron fe 2 8 when the electrical current flows the oxidation and reduction reactions occur at the anode and the cathode respectively in the oxidation reaction the anode fe is oxidized to either fe2 or fe3 ions while in the reduction reaction the water is reduced to oh ions and h2 gas then a chemical reaction between fe2 or fe3 ions and oh ions results in coagulants of fe oh 2 or fe oh 3 2 9 the coagulants adsorb pollutants to form flocs the flocs are reacted to each other to form bigger flocs further the bigger flocs will settle as sludge or be pushed by h2 gas to the surface of the liquid as scum 4 10 based on the information above the ec can change the concentration of pollutants and electrode metal ions in wastewater and produce sludge and scum 3 5 commonly the concentration of organic pollutants in wastewater is measured as the concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod 11 however in detail the ec also changes the liquid ph liquid temperature and liquid volume 12 therefore the ec mechanism process is very complex it is very interesting to model the ec process based on its mechanism process through modeling the effect of affecting factors in the ec process can be studied clearly and deeply the mechanistic models were successfully built by some previous studies syaichurrozi et al 12 built a simple mechanistic model involving the changes in cod mass sludge mass and scum mass furthermore a more detailed mechanistic model was built by syaichurrozi et al 13 by considering the changes in cod concentration fe concentration sludge mass and scum mass but the liquid volume was assumed to be constant furthermore syaichurrozi et al 14 modified the mechanistic model by considering the change in liquid volume and then syaichurrozi et al 15 improved the mechanistic model by considering not only the change in liquid volume but also the changes in liquid ph and temperature however the profile of liquid volume ph and temperature during the ec process was approximated with the quadratic line as a function of time in those studies 14 15 in order words the kinetics of changes in the volume ph and temperature of liquid were not built through the theoretical ec process mechanism the summary of the mechanistic models from the previous studies is shown in table 1 therefore the mechanistic model has to be improved in this study with the target shown in table 1 vinasse is a liquid waste with a very high cod content 12 16 bioethanol industries release 8 20 l vinasse when producing 1 l bioethanol 16 due to its big volume and high cod content vinasse is to be a serious liquid waste prior discharged to the environment it has to be treated one of the treatment methods that can be utilized to treat the vinasse is ec 13 14 in indonesia the local vinasse contains a very high cod content 100 g l 12 utilization of ec to treat the local vinasse has been conducted by our team the application of ec to treat the local vinasse has been studied with variation of initial phs 4 35 5 6 13 variation of electrical voltages 7 5 10 12 5 v 14 variation of electrical currents 2 5 3 3 5 a 12 another factor that is important in ec is agitation speed 17 19 therefore this study will investigate the effect of agitation speed on the ec process in treating the local vinasse this study was new in experiment and modeling in treating the vinasse by ec method at various agitation speeds the aims of this study are 1 to study the effect of agitation speed on the ec process 2 to build a detailed mechanistic model and 3 to investigate the effect of agitation speed on the ec process quantitatively with the mechanistic model developed 2 mechanism of the ec process all the reactions that occur during the ec process are assumed as chemical reactions with irreversible processes during the ec process the oxidation and reduction reactions occur at the anode and cathode respectively 1 2 in the oxidation reaction the iron fe is oxidized to fe2 ion eq 1 many studies 13 14 20 21 proved that the product of the oxidation reaction at the iron anode is fe2 ion not fe3 ion 1 fe s k o fe 2 aq 2 e in the reduction reaction the water is reduced to oh ion and h2 gas eq 2 2 2 h 2 o l 2 e k r h 2 g 2 oh aq furthermore the fe2 ions react with oh ions to form coagulants of fe oh 2 1 2 eq 3 hydrolysis reaction the fe oh 3 can also be produced from the fe2 ion when the liquid contains high dissolved oxygen 1 but the vinasse contains a very low dissolved oxygen 22 therefore this study assumed that the type of coagulant produced in the liquid during the ec process was fe oh 2 3 fe 2 aq 2 oh aq k h fe oh 2 s furthermore the fe oh 2 adsorbs pollutants assuming that every mol fe oh 2 can adsorb n mol of cod to form flocs then the flocs react with each other to form bigger flocs which then settle to sludge as shown in eq 4a 4a fe oh 2 s n cod aq k a sludge s it is assumed that k a is a second order reaction rate constant that is not affected by the total mol of fe oh 2 and cod in the reaction shown in eq 4a because of spontaneous hydrolysis of fe2 to the coagulants the rate determining step is the generation of fe2 electrolytically 23 for simplifying eq 4a can be modified to eq 4b 4b fe 2 aq n cod aq k a sludge s the sludge can be separated by sedimentation however a part of sludge can go up as scum due to flotation by evolved h2 during the ec process eq 5 13 5 sludge s k f scum s 3 modeling the mechanistic model is built based on the chemical process given in eqs 1 5 3 1 net production rate of fe2 mass the production rate of fe2 mol by oxidation reaction follows the faraday s law 14 eq 6 6 d n fe 2 dt i zf the consumption rate of fe2 mol by adsorbing the cod is written in eq 7 7 d n fe 2 dt k a fe 2 cod v hence the net production rate of fe2 mol is shown in eq 8 d n fe 2 dt i zf k a fe 2 cod v 8 d n fe 2 dt i zf k a n fe 2 n cod v therefore the production rate of fe2 mass is shown in eq 9 9 d m fe 2 dt m w fe i zf k a m fe 2 m cod v m w cod 3 2 net consumption rate of cod mass the net consumption rate of cod mol is shown in eq 10 10 d n cod dt n k a n fe 2 n cod v therefore the net consumption rate of cod mass is shown in eq 11 11 d m cod dt n k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe 3 3 net production rate of sludge mass the production rate of sludge mass can be expressed through eq 12 d n sludge dt k a n fe 2 n cod v 12 d n sludge dt k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod based on eq 4b the sludge can be expressed as fe cod n therefore the molecular weight of sludge can be written in eq 13 13 m w s m w fe n m w cod hence eq 12 is modified to eq 14 14 d m sludge d t m w fe n m w cod k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod the consumption rate of sludge mass due to flotation can be written in eq 15 15 d m sludge dt k f m sludge the net production rate of sludge mass can be written in eq 16 16 d m sludge dt m w fe n m w cod k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod k f m sludge 3 4 net production rate of scum mass the net production rate of scum mass is expressed in eq 17 17 d m scum dt k f m sludge 3 5 reduction rate of liquid volume during the ec process the liquid volume decreases as a function of time a decrease in liquid volume can be caused by 1 reduction reaction eq 2 and 2 scum production 14 the decrease in liquid volume due to the reduction reaction can be written in eq 18 18 dv dt 2 i zf m w h 2 o ρ h 2 o the decrease in liquid volume due to the scum production is written in eq 19 19 dv dt k v m scum hence the complete equation for the reduction rate of liquid volume is shown in eq 20 20 dv dt 2 i zf m w h 2 o ρ h 2 o k v m scum 3 6 the changes in ph based on eqs 1 3 the net production rate of oh ion mol is twice as much as the net production rate of fe2 ion mol therefore the net production rate of oh ion mol is shown in eq 21 d n oh dt 2 d n fe 2 dt d n oh dt 2 i zf k a n fe 2 n cod v 21 d n oh dt 2 i zf k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod furthermore eq 21 is modified to eq 22 d oh v dt 2 i zf k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod v d oh dt oh dv dt 2 i zf k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod 22 d oh dt 2 i zf k a m fe 2 m cod v m w fe m w cod oh dv dt v furthermore the liquid ph can be calculated through eq 23 23 dph dt k ph 14 log oh 3 7 the changes in voltage a correlation between electrical voltage current and resistance is shown in eq 24 14 24 v ir for i constant eq 24 is modified to eq 25 25 dv dt i dr dt the electrical resistance has a straight relationship with the sludge concentration furthermore it has a reverse relationship with the fe2 concentration ph and surface area of the electrode hence it can be written through eq 26 26 dr dt k ri m slu d ge v k rd ph m fe 2 v a e hence dv dt i k ri m sludge v k rd ph m fe 2 a e v 27 dv dt i k ri m sludge v k rd ph m fe 2 l e v 0 v a b w e v 3 8 the changes in liquid temperature during the ec process the energy supplied to the liquid can be predicted by eq 28 14 28 dq dt vi thus the energy supplied to the liquid increases the liquid temperature eq 29 24 25 29 dq dt m c p dt dt substituting eq 28 to eq 29 to get eq 30 30 dt dt vi m c p the energy loss to the surroundings is assumed to follow the newton s law of cooling 26 written in eq 31 31 dt dt k c t t o the total net energy supplied to the liquid can be written in eq 32 dt dt vi m c p k c t t o 32 dt dt vi v ρ c p k c t t o for simplifying the ρ and c p are assumed to be constant during the ec process so eq 32 is modified to eq 33 with k h t 1 ρ c p 33 dt dt k h t vi v k c t t o all equations included in the mechanistic model are presented in table 2 4 materials and methods 4 1 local vinasse local vinasse was obtained from one of the bioethanol industries in indonesia the waste has cod of 113 70 g l total fe of 0 11 g l and ph of 4 1 the density and viscosity of the vinasse are 1036 34 g l and 0 1392 g dm s respectively 4 2 experimental set up ec reactor was built from 1 l beaker glass cylinder shape with outer diameter inner diameter and height of 1 1 dm 1 05 dm and 1 52 dm respectively the experimental set up of this study followed the previous studies of 13 14 the irons fe were used as electrodes having length width and thickness of 2 dm 0 3 dm and 0 03 dm respectively the anode and cathode were placed vertically at a distance of 0 55 dm the vinasse volume in the ec reactor was 1 l the active electrode dimension of length width and thickness was 0 95 dm 0 3 dm and 0 03 dm respectively the glass agitator with impeller length and width of 0 53 dm and 0 06 dm respectively a dc power supply long wei series of lw k3010d 0 30 v 0 10 a was used as an electrical source the experimental set up of the laboratory scale ec process is shown in fig 1 4 3 experimental design and procedures before used in the ec process the anode and cathode were immersed in hcl 5 v v for 15 min then they were rinsed using the distilled water after that they were dried using the oven at a mercury temperature of 105 110 c for 2 h and then weighed the clean anode and cathode were placed vertically at a distance of 0 55 dm in the ec reactor containing 1 l of vinasse the anode and cathode were connected to the positive and negative poles of the dc power supply the ec process was run under the batch system for 8 h with a constant electrical current of 3a the agitation speed was varied to be 0 250 and 500 rpm during the process per 1 h the changes in electrical voltage liquid temperature liquid ph and surface liquid height were measured the liquid temperature and ph were measured by using a mercury temperature and a digital ph meter the scum produced on the liquid surface was taken by using a plastic spoon and then dried in the oven with a temperature of 105 110 c for at least 2 h and weighed meanwhile the liquid sample of 10 ml was taken and placed in reaction tubes for settling for 24 h the supernatants formed in the tubes were taken for the cod and total fe analyses the cod analysis was conducted through the open reflux and titration method of sni 06 6989 15 2004 the total fe in the solution was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas after the ec process the anode was rinsed using distilled water dried in the oven and weighed the sludge mass was measured using a method proposed in a previous study of 14 the experiments in this study were conducted without replication the process control was ec process without agitation agitation speed 0 rpm this study studied the effect of the agitation speeds of 0 250 and 500 rpm for generalization the agitation speed rpm was changed to be the reynolds re number with eq 34 27 for simplification the density and viscosity of the vinasse are assumed constant during the ec process 34 re ρ n s d a 2 μ by using eq 34 the agitation speed of 0 250 and 500 rpm was equal to re of 0 5 47 104 and 1 09 105 respectively 4 4 kinetic analysis the measured data obtained during the experiment were cod concentration total fe concentration scum mass sludge mass electrical voltage liquid temperature liquid ph and liquid volume per 1 h a curve fitting between experimental data and modeled data was graphed the deviation of those two was calculated using a sum of squares of errors sse eq 35 35 sse i 1 n experimental data modeled data 2 the adjustable kinetic constants in the mechanistic model are k a n k v k f k ph k ri k rd k ht k c the values of the kinetic constants are obtained by minimizing the sse value with help of ms excel 5 results and discussion 5 1 experimental data the ec process at various agitation speeds was successfully conducted and the experimental data were shown in table 3 the experimental data in this study included anode weight loss g electrical voltage v liquid temperature k liquid ph liquid volume ml cod concentration g l total fe concentration g l scum mass g and sludge mass g 5 1 1 anode fe cod mass profiles the anode weight decreased due to the oxidation of anode iron to fe2 in this study the electrical current was maintained constant at a value of 3 a the anode weight loss can be predicted through eq 36 36 anode weight los s g m w fe it zf where m wfe 56 g mol i 3 a z 2 f 96 500c mol t time in second by using eq 36 the value of anode weight loss was predicted to be 25 07 g experimentally the anode weight loss in this study was almost the same as the prediction which was 24 60 24 94 g table 3 if the z 3 the value of anode weight loss was predicted to be 16 71 g therefore it confirmed that the correct z value was 2 and the product of the oxidation reaction of fe was fe2 not fe3 the agitation speed re number did not affect the anode weight loss because based on eq 36 the anode weight loss was just affected by electrical current and electrolysis time the remaining fe mass in liquid is shown in table 3 the remaining fe mass in the liquid was around 8 51 12 91 or the fe mass involved in coagulant formation was around 87 09 91 49 the cod mass in the solution is also shown in table 3 the cod mass decreased from the beginning until the end of the process the coagulants adsorbed the cod to form sludge the cod mass removal for 0 250 and 500 rpm was 63 44 67 62 and 42 27 respectively based on these values an agitation speed of 250 rpm re of 5 47 104 resulted in a better cod mass removal than the others a lower and a higher than the agitation speed of 250 rpm the ec process was not effective a previous study reported that electrooxidation of organic pollutants in wastewater occurs when the wastewater contains a high chloride concentration about 40 g l 28 the oxidation process occurs because chloride cl in liquid turns into chlorine cl2 at the anode furthermore the cl2 reacts with h2o to form hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite ion ocl under acidic conditions the concentration of hypochlorous acid is more dominant than the hypochlorite ion furthermore the hypochlorous acid has a stronger oxidizing power than the hypochlorite ion so organic pollutants are easily oxidized at acidic ph however this study used the local vinasse with a very low chloride concentration about 1 1 g l 12 therefore the decrease in cod concentration in this study was caused by the adsorption by the coagulant not by the oxidation by hypochlorous acid 5 1 2 sludge and scum mass profiles sludge and scum production at various agitation speeds during the ec process are shown in table 3 and fig 2 after the ec process for 8 h the total mass of sludge and scum produced at agitation speeds of 0 250 500 rpm was 94 56 99 96 and 70 04 g respectively fig 2 the agitation speed of 250 rpm resulted in a more total mass of sludge and scum than the others it means that the adsorption process of cod on the coagulants at 250 rpm was more effective than the other agitation speeds in more detail the percentage of scum mass increased while the percentage of sludge mass decreased during the ec process at all various agitation speeds fig 2 the final percentage ratios after 8 h of scum sludge at 0 250 and 500 rpm was 54 93 45 07 61 11 38 89 and 26 50 73 50 respectively the percentage of scum mass 54 93 at 0 rpm was lower than that at 250 rpm 61 11 because the adsorption process occurred effectively and resulted in much more flocs at 250 rpm than that at 0 rpm so the flocs at 250 rpm were easier to be pushed on the liquid surface by h2 gas than another meanwhile the scum mass at 500 rpm 26 50 was lower than that at 250 rpm 61 11 because too high agitation speed caused the contact time between coagulants and pollutants too short so the adsorption process was not effective and the floc mass was produced in a little amount meanwhile too high agitation speed broke the h2 bubbles so the flotation process was low and the scum mass were produced in a little amount 5 1 3 the liquid volume profiles the liquid volume decreased during the ec process a decrease in volume can be caused by 2 the reduction reaction of water and 2 scum production 14 the rate of the decrease in liquid volume at 250 rpm was faster than that at 0 and 500 rpm table 3 because of the electrical current of 3a applied for all various agitation speeds the decrease in liquid volume by reduction reaction of water is almost the same for all variables therefore the decrease in liquid volume by the scum production was more dominant than that by the reduction reaction of water the agitation speed of 250 rpm resulted in more scum mass than the other agitation speeds fig 2 so the rate of the decrease in liquid volume at 250 rpm was higher than that at 0 and 500 rpm 5 1 4 the liquid ph and temperature profiles the liquid ph during the ec process is shown in table 3 the liquid ph increased from the beginning to the end of the process an increase in liquid ph was caused by the oh accumulation in the liquid 13 at the cathode the water is reduced to oh ion and h2 gas the oh reacts with fe2 to form fe oh 2 the remaining oh in solution was accumulated and then increased the liquid ph 12 the liquid temperature increased from the beginning to the end of the process table 3 the increase in liquid temperature was caused by energy supplied from the electrical current continuously input to the liquid 14 5 1 5 the electrical voltage profiles in this study the electrical current was kept constant at 3 a hence the electrical voltage changed during the ec process because the electrical resistance changed a correlation between electrical current i voltage v and resistance r is presented in eq 37 14 37 v ir based on eq 37 an increase in the r value increased the v value from the beginning to the middle of the process the voltage decreased due to the decrease in the electrical resistance the ions fe2 and oh in the high amounts at beginning of the process can decrease the electrical resistance furthermore from the middle to the end of the process the voltage increased at the time range the number of ions fe2 and oh decreased but the sludge increased so the electrical resistance increased and the voltage increased too 5 2 modeling the mechanistic model table 2 successfully predicted the ec process the fitting between the experimental data and modeled data were shown in figs 3 5 based on fig 6 the mechanistic model can work well with a very high r2 which was 0 9977 0 9988 meanwhile the kinetic constant values k a n k v k f k ph k ri k rd k ht k c were presented in table 4 furthermore an analysis was conducted to judge which kinetic constants were affected or not affected by the agitation speed or re number the relative standard deviation rsd is usually used in analytical chemistry to express the precision of an assay the rsd formula is written in eq 38 38 rsd standard deviation sd mean 100 the less the rsd value the smaller the spread of the data and the higher the precision level the acceptable value of the rsd value is not 20 29 30 in this study the rsd is used to judge which kinetic constants are affected or not affected by the agitation speed or re number if the rsd is below 20 the kinetic constants are not affected by the agitation speed or re number table 4 shows the rsd for all kinetic constants based on the rsd value kinetic constants of n k v k f were affected by re number because their rsd values are above 20 in which the value of the kinetic constants spread widely in other words the value of the kinetic constants was the function of the re number on the opposite side the rsd value for k a k ph k ri k rd k ht k c was below or equal to 20 it means the kinetic values were not affected by the re number 5 3 kinetic analysis 5 3 1 the kinetic constants of k a and n based on table 4 the kinetic constant of k a was not affected by the re number this kinetic constant presented the adsorption reaction between the coagulant and the cod the higher the k a value the more the fe2 ions were to be coagulant and contributed to the adsorption reaction variation of agitation speeds in the range of 0 to 500 rpm or re number in the range of 0 to 1 09 105 resulted in the not significant k a values which were 1 06 10 4 1 10 10 4 l mol s it means the amount of fe2 contributing to the adsorption reaction was almost the same for all various re numbers based on experimental data the fe2 contributing in coagulant and then in flocs formation was around 87 09 91 49 for all various agitation speeds re number furthermore the value of n increased from 6 00 to 6 28 with increasing the re number from 0 to 5 47 104 table 4 the kinetic constant of n presented the amount of cod that can be adsorbed by each fe2 coagulant therefore increasing the re number from 0 to 5 47 104 successfully increased the ability of each coagulant to adsorb the cod however a further increase in the re number from 5 47 104 to 1 09 105 decreased the value of n table 4 it means that the ability of the coagulant decreased along with an increase in the re number from 5 47 104 to 1 09 105 too high the re number was not recommended because the adsorption of cod on coagulants was not effective so the rate of cod mass removal at the re of 1 09 105 was lower than that at the re of 5 47 104 the highest value of n of 6 28 was obtained at re of 5 47 104 hence the re number of 5 47 104 250 rpm was more effective than the two others 5 3 2 the kinetic constant of k f the sludge resulted from the reaction between the coagulant and the cod hence the higher the n value the more the flocs can be resulted due to the re of 5 47 104 having a higher n value a higher amount of flocs was resulted at the re number furthermore the kinetic constant of k f showed the rate of flotation reaction it means the higher the k f value the faster the flotation reaction occurred re number of 5 47 104 resulted in a higher k f value 8 62 10 5 s than the other re numbers 3 17 10 5 8 22 10 5 s table 4 the re number of 5 47 104 resulted in a higher amount of flocs than the two others because it had a higher n value than the two others the more the flocs mass the easier the scum was formed 5 3 3 the kinetic constant of k v based on table 4 the increase in re number from 0 to 1 09 105 increased the k v value from 1 22 10 6 to 1 98 10 6 l g s table 4 the kinetic constant of k v represent the amount of the liquid volume that can be included in the scum formation scum was formed from flocs that were pushed by hydrogen gas bubbles to the surface of the liquid the high agitation speed can break the big hydrogen bubbles into small hydrogen bubbles the smaller the hydrogen bubble size the wider the contact area of the bubbles on the liquid therefore more liquid can be brought by the smaller bubbles finally the liquid included in the scum formation was more at a faster agitation speed re number 5 3 4 the kinetic constant of k ph k ri k rd k ht k c the kinetic constant of k ph presented the rate of increase in liquid ph during the ec process the k ph values were not affected by the re numbers because the values were almost the same 7 71 10 6 9 12 10 6 s table 4 furthermore the kinetic constant of k ri and k rd presented the rate of increase and decrease in electrical resistance respectively these kinetic constants were not affected by the re number based on the rsd value of 19 20 moreover the kinetic constant of k ht and k c presented the rate of increase and decrease in liquid temperature respectively these kinetic constants were also not affected by the re number based on the rsd value of 4 6 5 4 advanced mechanistic model as a function of re number based on table 4 the agitation speed re number affected the kinetic constant values of n k v k f but not values of k a k ph k ri k rd k ht k c hence it was important to build correlations between the re number and the value of n k v k f and fig 7 shows those correlations the equations of the correlation are shown in eqs 39 41 39 n 4 10 10 re 2 3 10 5 re 6 40 k v 1 10 16 re 2 5 10 12 re 1 10 6 41 k f 1 10 14 re 2 6 10 10 re 8 10 5 furthermore the mean values of k a k ph k ri k rd k ht k c table 4 can be used as the universal values that can predict the ec process with the re range of 0 1 09 105 the mechanistic model in table 2 with the kinetic constant values of n k v k f as a function of re number eqs 39 41 and the mean value of kinetic constants of k a k ph k ri k rd k ht k c can be used to predict the ec process at various re numbers with a range from 0 to 1 09 105 the optimization can be conducted to find the optimum re number which results in the maximum cod mass removal value based on an optimization the best re number was 3 82 104 with a cod mass removal of 70 01 the ec process at re of 3 82 104 can be predicted and is shown in fig 8 6 conclusion the agitation speed in the ec process was varied to 0 250 and 500 rpm which can be converted to the re number of 0 5 47 104 and 1 09 105 respectively after 8 h the ec process at the re of 0 5 47 104 and 1 09 105 resulted in the cod mass removal of 63 44 67 62 and 42 27 respectively meanwhile the re of 0 5 47 104 and 1 09 105 resulted in a total mass of sludge and scum of 94 56 99 96 and 70 04 g respectively furthermore a detailed mechanistic model was successfully built with nine kinetic constants of k a n k v k f k ph k ri k rd k ht k c the mechanistic model was successfully used to simulate the ec process at the agitation speeds with a very high r2 of 0 9977 0 9988 based on simulation results the re number affected the value of n k v k f but not the value of k a k ph k ri k rd k ht k c furthermore the equations expressing the values of n k v k f as a function of re number were built finally the optimization was conducted to find the optimum re number to result in the maximum cod mass removal the predicted optimum re was 3 82 104 with maximum cod mass removal of 70 01 or maximum cod concentration removal of 44 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12729,the application of a novel two stage anoxic oxic moving bed biofilm reactor ts a o mbbr was validated in a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp and its working mechanism was analysed for biological nitrogen removal in this study over one year at a hydraulic residence time of only 9 8 h the effluent chemical oxygen demand ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen tn concentrations remained below 40 2 and 15 mg l which met strict emission standards the seven compartments in this unit performed different functions and together accomplished organics and nitrogen removal tn removal could be controlled by the external carbon sources dosage added to the postanoxic compartments to cost effectively meet the standard with the lowest cost the maximum tn removal efficiency and minimum effluent tn concentration reached 91 76 and 4 12 mg l respectively the bacterial communities differed in the suspended solids and preoxic postanoxic and oxic biofilms r 0 87 and p 0 001 the top 30 most abundant identified bacterial genera in biofilms included 24 denitrifying genera and 2 nitrifying genera the most abundant biofilm genus was methylotenera which played important roles in denitrification in the anoxic compartments 1 and 24 denitrifying genera were only abundant in the postanoxic and preanoxic compartments respectively nitrosomonas and nitrospira were abundant in the oxic compartments and played roles in nitrification this study verified the feasibility of the ts a o mbbr process in a full scale wwtp and investigated its working mechanism graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords moving bed biofilm reactor nitrification denitrification wastewater treatment plant biological nitrogen removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water eutrophication has turned out to be a global environmental threat 1 wastewater treatment plants wwtps remove pollutants from municipal wastewater before discharging which is of great significance to prevent eutrophication 2 3 however as populations grow and industrialization accelerates the discharge of treated wastewater continues to increase 4 in recent years many countries and regions have increased the stringency of effluent requirements for wwtps to protect public water bodies 4 5 however conventional wwtps have limited efficiency in removing nutrients especially nitrogen 6 therefore it is imperative to develop a novel and effective process that is capable of achieving the required removal efficiency conventional biological nitrogen removal by nitrification and denitrification has been widely used all over the world and has long been the most feasible option 3 7 however the effectiveness of conventional nitrification and denitrification processes based on activated sludge depends on the hydraulic retention time biomass concentration and return sludge flow rate 8 and these processes require a large footprint and disposal and management of the produced sludge 4 moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr has turned out to be a successful process 9 with the benefit of a small footprint and minimal sludge production 10 moreover mbbrs are as flexible and simple in terms of flow process as activated sludge systems and they allow multiple compartments to be configured in series to achieve treatment objectives 11 the most common configuration of mbbr is the anoxic oxic a o mbbr and many studies have been done based on this system 12 14 however it is difficult for the a o mbbr to achieve a high nitrogen removal efficiency because it is limited by the internal recycling ratio 15 to meet high nitrogen removal requirements many processes with mbbr based on post denitrification have been proposed such as the bardenpho mbbr 1 and two stage a o mbbr ts a o mbbr 9 16 among them the ts a o mbbr process stands out because of its stable high nitrogen removal efficiency small footprint and small sludge production for example zhou et al 16 showed that this process could reach up to 91 8 total inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency in a pilot scale system at a hydraulic retention time of 11 2 h it should be noted that the previous studies of the ts a o mbbr mostly focused on the lab scale or the pilot scale system however the full scale study of ts a o mbbr is limited a wwtp in qingdao city shandong province china with a target wastewater treatment capacity of 80 000 m3 d had an actual treatment capacity of only 60 000 m3 d and it was in dire need of expansion there were two difficulties to overcome for the expansion i the available footprint was limited ii the designed total nitrogen tn removal efficiency was as high as 80 in this case a novel ts a o mbbr process was chosen and it was designed meticulously with multiple compartments in this study the overall performance in terms of the organic matter and nitrogen removal of the unit in the wwtp was investigated and the detailed functions of all the compartments of the unit in terms of organic matter and nitrogen removal were analysed in addition microscope scanning was used to observe the biofilm morphology in this unit at the micro scale and high throughput sequencing was used to explore the bacterial communities in this unit this study verified the feasibility of the ts a o mbbr process in a full scale wwtp explored the microbial community of this system and provided a novel case for the wwtps that required both small footprint and high nitrogen removal efficiency which were of engineering novelty 2 material and methods 2 1 set up of ts a o mbbr unit in a wwtp a diagram and photo of the ts a o mbbr unit in the full scale wwtp are shown in fig 1 the unit consisted of seven cylindrical tanks in total three of which were divided into two compartments the raw wastewater entered the first pairs of compartments a1 and a2 in two equal lines and then entered the next pairs of compartments in parallel finally the wastewater in the two lines converged into the last compartment o3 and was then discharged to the next treatment unit among these compartments a1 and a2 were the preanoxic compartments o1 and o2 were the preoxic compartments a3 were the postanoxic compartments and o3 was the postoxic compartment internal recycling was set up from o2 to a1 and the ratio was set at 0 5 2 5 and was adjusted in real time by the automatic control the total effective volume of the two a1 compartments was 1400 m3 as was that of the two a2 compartments the total effective volume of the two o1 compartments was 1802 m3 so was that of the two o2 compartments the total effective volume of the two a3 compartments was totally 1500 m3 and the working volume of the o3 compartment was 233 m3 therefore the designed total hydraulic residence time was only 9 8 h sodium acetate was added to a1 and a3 by the automatic control the carriers were spr iii from qingdao spring water treatment co ltd they were made of high density polyethylene hdpe with the diameter height and thickness of 25 0 5 mm 10 1 mm and 0 35 0 10 mm their specific surface area was 800 m2 m3 they were added to all compartments with the filling fractions of 50 in anoxic compartments a1 a2 and a3 and 55 in oxic compartments o1 o2 and o3 mechanical mixers were used to circulate and mix the water and biocarriers in anoxic compartments and aeration was used to circulate and mix the water and biocarriers in oxic compartments the biofilm carrier retention screens were installed at the outlet of all compartments 17 so that the biocarriers always stayed in the compartments it was important to emphasize that there was no sludge return in this unit which saved the power cost therefore biofilms attached to the carriers were the dominant microorganism for wastewater treatment in both anoxic and oxic compartments of the ts a o mbbr unit which greatly reduced sludge disposal 2 2 wastewater characteristics the designed inflow of the ts a o mbbr unit was 20 000 m3 d the designed chemical oxygen demand cod concentration ammonia nitrogen nh4 n concentration and tn concentration of influent were 500 mg l 60 mg l and 72 mg l respectively however inflow and concentrations of the feed wastewater changed consistent with real municipal wastewater the maximum inflow was 28 800 m3 d during the experimental operating period while the cod nh4 n and tn concentrations ranged from 125 69 mg l to 538 74 mg l from 5 68 mg l to 55 41 mg l and from 20 72 mg l to 100 00 mg l respectively moreover the ph was 6 9 the total phosphorus concentration was 3 0 6 5 mg l and the suspended solids ss concentration was 115 314 mg l 2 3 chemical analytical methods samples of the influent and effluent water in the unit were taken every 3 h the samples from a single day were uniform mixed into a composite sample the samples in all reactors were taken every season in a hydraulic retention time the samples were filtered before test of cod nh4 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and tn concentrations these three concentrations and the ss concentration were investigated by standard methods 18 2 4 biofilm morphology scanning the biocarriers samples were taken randomly to be scanned scanning electron microscope sem quanta 250 feg fei usa was used to observe biofilm morphology at the micro scale the biofilm thickness was measured by industrial microscope ao hd228sd aosvi china and more than three places inside the biocarriers were randomly selected for biofilm thickness measurement 2 5 high throughput sequencing methods samples were taken from the ss and biofilms in all compartments every season and the samples from all seasons were uniform mixed into one composite sample high throughput sequencing was investigated in accordance with standard steps by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 19 the v3 v4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the primer pairs 338f and 806r 16 all the data analysis for high throughput sequencing was performed on the online platform of majorbio cloud platform www majorbio com 20 the raw data were submitted to national center for biotechnology information ncbi and the accession number was prjna861015 3 results 3 1 overall performance fig 2 shows the overall performance of the two stage a o unit of the wwtp over the course of one year according to emission standards cod nh4 n and tn concentrations should be controlled below 40 2 and 15 mg l respectively although the influent concentrations temperature and flow fluctuated the effluent concentrations always met the standards with a real total hydraulic retention time of 7 4 18 9 h and a temperature of 13 27 c the effluent cod nh4 n and tn concentrations were 26 58 3 49 0 27 0 26 and 10 00 2 46 mg l respectively and the average removal efficiencies were 91 68 99 11 and 74 03 respectively the effluent tn concentration was regulated automatically by the addition amount of external carbon sources to save costs when the external carbon sources were sufficient the highest tn removal efficiency reached 91 76 and the minimum effluent tn concentration was 4 12 mg l compared to the traditional anaerobic anoxic oxic activated sludge process 61 7 21 and the typical a o mbbr process 50 at an internal recycling ratio of 100 12 the ts a o mbbr process performed better in terms of tn removal efficiency in addition the ts a o mbbr process exhibited comparable nitrogen removal efficiency to that of the bardenpho mbbr process 84 3 1 but it had the advantage of much less sludge production therefore the ts a o mbbr process has been proven to have good performance in biological nitrogen removal in a full scale municipal wwtp which is a considerable achievement in particular it must be mentioned that the effluent ss of this biological treatment unit was 173 36 mg l which allowed the use of some efficient separation reactor instead of traditional settling tank in addition biofilms were difficult to alternate between anaerobic and aerobic conditions so biological phosphorus removal is in a finite way in the ts a o mbbr therefore chemical coagulation for ss and phosphorus removal with magnetic coagulation for flocculation separation with a small footprint was used in the following unit the ts a o mbbr unit covered a small area of below 1800 m2 and the full scale wastewater treatment process based on this unit required only proximately 4300 m2 in total due to the high pollutant removal rate and the low effluent ss of this unit 3 2 variations of pollutant concentrations cod was mostly removed in a1 and o1 and the concentrations decreased by 48 28 2 63 and 27 81 0 83 mg l respectively fig 3a the cod removal rates of a1 and o1 were 3 34 and 1 95 g cod m2 d respectively the difference between the two compartments was that a1 used raw and external organic matter as carbon sources for denitrification 22 while o1 removed the residual organic matter from the preanoxic reactors using oxygen as electron acceptor 23 nh4 n was mostly removed in o1 and o2 and the concentration decreased by 7 05 and 7 44 mg l in o1 and o2 respectively fig 3b the nh4 n removal rates of o1 and o2 were 0 49 and 0 52 g nh4 n m2 d respectively the nh4 n concentration could be reduced to a low level by o2 but o2 may not have reached its maximum processing capacity due to the limited substrate concentration tn was mostly removed in a1 a2 and a3 and the concentration decreased by 14 62 3 71 and 5 75 mg l fig 3c a1 used raw and external carbon sources for denitrification while a3 used only external carbon sources for denitrification and the c n consumption ratios of a1 and a3 were 6 19 0 97 and 4 51 1 68 respectively the removal rate of a1 was 1 16 g tn m2 d the tn removal of a3 could be controlled by the addition of external carbon sources to minimize the cost required to meet the tn standard which made this unit flexible the supposed role of a2 was to complement a1 and remove tn by denitrification using raw and external carbon sources but sometimes this role was not successfully achieved because of limited nitrate substrate concentrations however a2 would play an important role in nitrogen removal when the influent nitrogen load was high o3 was set up to avoid carbon leakage with a minimum volume the nitrogen mass balance was analysed in fig 3d which clearly showed nitrogen transformation in compartments of the ts a o mbbr unit the no2 n concentrations in all compartments were always below 1 0 mg l so no2 n was not considered here as can be seen that 370 20 kg d no3 n was removed in a1 by denitrification and then a2 removed a small amount of residual no3 n 17 28 kg d from a1 however 119 53 kg d organic nitrogen was removed in a1 and 147 91 kg d and 17 28 kg d nh4 n was removed in a1 and a2 respectively speculating that there were anammox in a1 and a2 o1 and o2 removed 309 19 kg d and 324 44 kg d nh4 n by transferring them to no3 n by nitrification a3 removed the rest 138 32 kg d no3 n by denitrification in conclusion the different compartments of the ts a o mbbr unit played different roles and they together accomplished organics and nitrogen removal in the wwtp 3 3 biofilm morphology as shown in fig 4a and b the biofilms were well attached to the surface of the carriers the biofilms in anoxic and oxic compartments showed different colours which were caused by the different functions and operating conditions 11 sem graphs fig 4c and d showed that all the biofilms had a rough surface and were distributed with different forms of microorganisms and extracellular polymers which formed complex miniature ecosystem there were some holes on the surface of the biofilms which was the transfer channel of substrate matrix 24 the surface structure in anoxic and oxic compartments were also different the extracellular polymers in oxic compartments were more compact than in anoxic compartments and the microorganisms were mainly globular bacteria in oxic compartments while there were rod shaped and globular bacteria in anoxic compartments the thickness of biofilms in a1 a2 and a3 were about 138 34 32 39 μm 76 29 11 44 μm and 104 89 28 37 μm fig 5a while the thickness of biofilms in o1 o2 and o3 were about 282 99 148 09 μm 199 05 50 25 μm and 243 99 125 89 μm fig 5b the biofilms in oxic compartments were significantly thicker than in anoxic compartments p 0 01 moreover biofilms in the first compartments a1 and o1 were thicker than in the second compartments a2 and o2 of the same tanks because of more sufficient substrate 3 4 bacterial community principle component analysis pca revealed differences in the bacterial community among the ss and biofilm samples fig 6 a the samples were clustered into four groups ss biofilms in the preanoxic compartments biofilms in the postanoxic compartments and biofilms in the oxic compartments analysis of similarities anosim confirmed the significant variations among the four groups r 0 87 and p 0 001 the ss samples were tightly clustered into a group and anosim further confirmed that there were no significant differences in bacterial community among the ss samples p 0 05 these findings indicated that different functional bacterial communities of various compartments did not occur in the ss which was similar to the activated sludge 25 however there were obvious different bacterial communities in the biofilms of the preanoxic postanoxic and oxic compartments r 0 83 and p 0 001 because most of the active biomass was retained continually in each compartment 11 the biofilms in different compartments were formed functionalization the biocarriers in the mbbr system promoted the biomass segregation between ss and biofilms resulting in the formation of functionalization of the whole system 26 linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was used to explore the specific bacteria leading to differences in the community among the four groups and the results are presented in a cladogram fig 6b there were 66 bacteria particularly enriched α 0 05 lda score 4 at the phylum level notably the phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteriota were significantly enriched in the postanoxic biofilms and oxic biofilms respectively some proteobacteria are closely related to denitrification 27 which was consistent with the fact that the postanoxic compartments played important roles in denitrification actinobacteriota was reported to consist of heterotrophic bacteria 14 which can remove organic matter which was consistent with the fact that the oxic compartments played important roles in organic matter removal acidobacteriota bacteroidota and chloroflexi were significantly enriched in the preanoxic biofilms acidobacteriota are related to nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment 28 bacteroidota are associated with hydrolysis of macromolecules under anaerobic or anoxic conditions 27 chloroflexi was considered to be correlated with the degradation of organics 27 the enrichment of these bacteria was also consistent with the roles of the preanoxic compartments in organic matter and nitrogen removal at the genus level gemmobacter rhodobacter pseudorhodobacter simplicispira unclassified genus of the family comamonadaceae unclassified f comamonadaceae thermomonas and thiothrix were the dominant discriminating genera in ss most of these genera related to denitrification 29 33 except the unclassified genus of comamonadaceae unclassified f comamonadaceae whose function is unknown therefore the bacteria in ss may play some roles in denitrification however the ss concentrations in all compartments were 100 300 mg l while the biofilm concentration in mbbr were generally 1000 5000 mg l 11 so biofilms were much more numerous and played much important roles in wastewater treatment therefore the bacterial genera of biofilms in various compartments should be further analysed the relative abundances of the top thirty abundant bacterial genera that were clearly identified in the biofilms of the compartments are exhibited in fig 7 a among the thirty genera twenty four genera were related to denitrification 27 30 32 34 49 methylotenera which was reported to be essential for denitrification 39 was the most abundant and it was abundant in all compartments number of sequences 50 the same below fig 7b some denitrifying bacterial genera were abundant in the oxic compartments and three genera novosphingobium hirschia jgi 0001001 h03 were abundant only in the oxic compartments however denitrification was not observed obviously in the oxic compartments because denitrification is inhibited under high dissolved oxygen conditions 50 one genus mycobacterium was abundant only in the postanoxic compartments fourteen genera trichococcus thermomonas devosia simplicispira defluviimonas mesorhizobium ferruginibacter sphingobium rhodobacter lautropia hydrogenophaga cl500 29 marine group dokdonella arenimonas were abundant only in the preanoxic compartments and seven genera methylotenera trichococcus denitratisoma hyphomicrobium flavobacterium terrimonas brevundimonas were abundant in both preanoxic and postanoxic compartments therefore denitrifying bacterial communities were more diverse in the preanoxic compartments than in the postanoxic compartments which may be because the organic matter of the raw water was only used in the preanoxic compartments for denitrification however these twenty genera all played important roles in denitrification in the preanoxic or postanoxic compartments moreover there were nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonas and nitrospira among the thirty genera fig 7a corresponding to ammonia oxidizing genus and nitrite oxidizing genus respectively 51 they were mainly found in the oxic compartments fig 7b which led to more nitrification in the oxic compartments even though o2 did not achieve its maximum capacity the relative abundances of nitrifying genera in o2 were the greatest so o2 had great potential for nitrification in addition there were candidatus brocadia found in this unit which was reported to be anammox 52 which was consisted with the phenomenon at the macro scale that organic nitrogen and nh4 n was removed in a1 and a2 this genus was significantly more abundant in preanoxic compartments than in other compartments p 0 05 because this genus was more competitive in the presence of organic matter 52 54 however compared to the reactor with enhanced nitrogen removal via anammox 0 40 0 61 52 and the partial nitritation anammox system with the flocs 1 3 and the floc aggregations 4 3 55 candidatus brocadia was less abundant in preanoxic compartments of this unit 0 31 0 22 therefore anammox in this unit was in a finite way and denitrification for nitrogen removal was dominant it can be seen from hierarchical clustering results that the samples from the oxic and anoxic compartments were separated into two lineages fig 7a the samples from the preanoxic and postanoxic compartments were further separated into two lineages as were the samples from the preoxic and postoxic compartments indicating that their bacterial characteristics were different correspondingly the bacteria in these compartments played different roles in pollutant removal in summary there were different bacterial communities in the biofilms of different compartments resulting in different functions in nitrogen metabolism 4 discussion a novel ts a o mbbr process was applied successfully in a full scale municipal wwtp as results from this study the process could reach a high nitrogen removal efficiency 91 76 to always meet the stringent emission standards this study on the biofilm information as well as the pilot scale research in our previous study 16 56 showed that there were specific functional biofilms formed in different functional compartments of the ts a o mbbr unit which led to these advantages as follows i high nh4 n and tn removal rates were get in specific compartments due to biofilms functionalization so that the hrt was short with the minimal real hrt of only 7 4 h which further led to a small footprint ii possibilities for precise management were provided in the ts a o mbbr unit due to the explicit functionality flexible partitioning and adjustable operation so that the internal recycling ratio the do concentrations and the dosage of external carbon sources could be in a precise control which further led to less cost in addition there was no sludge return in this unit which saved the power cost due to the low effluent ss concentration 250 mg l the wwtp base on the ts a o mbbr process was allowed the use of any efficient separation reactors such as magnetic coagulation in this wwtp and chemical phosphorus removal was performed in this separation reactor at the same time it is also another reason why the wwtp with the ts a o mbbr unit was such compact as for the external carbon sources dosage it was unavoidable for all the processes based on the traditional nitrification denitrification including this ts a o mbbr process but traditional nitrogen removal technology also made it easy to implement in a full scale wwtp with the fluctuating influent concentrations temperature and inlet flow the amount of the external carbon sources had been minimized in the ts a o mbbr unit due to the biofilms functionalization which led to the possibilities for precise management concretely the internal recycling ratio could be automatically controlled precisely by the organics in raw water and the effluent nitrate of the preoxic compartments to maximize the utilization of carbon sources in raw water the dosage of the carbon sources in a3 was automatically controlled precisely according to the nitrogen emission standards to avoid the carbon sources waste and the carbon source could be added in a1 to further ensure meet the stringent emission standards when the hrt of a3 was not long enough in conclusion the advantages of the ts a o mbbr process in the external carbon sources dosage lied in making full use of raw water carbon sources and avoiding carbon sources waste in fact the annual operating cost of the wwtp based on ts a o mbbr process was comparable to traditional pre denitrification activated sludge process but obtain better tn removal performance and smaller footprint furthermore because anammox bacteria were found in the preanoxic compartments it should be enriched and played greater roles in nitrogen removal by operating control to reduce the amount of the external carbon sources which is the focus of future research 5 conclusions a novel ts a o mbbr process was applied in a full scale wwtp to treat municipal wastewater in this study it was found that this process exhibited good cod nh4 n and tn removal performance the different compartments in the unit played different roles in pollutant removal biofilm morphology showed different in anoxic and oxic compartments moreover high throughput sequencing revealed the bacterial community of ss and biofilm samples the results showed that there were different bacterial communities in the biofilms of the preanoxic postanoxic and oxic compartments which was different from the ss characteristics a variety of denitrifying genera including methylotenera played roles in denitrification in the anoxic compartments and nitrosomonas and nitrospira played roles in nitrification in the oxic compartments the different bacterial communities of biofilms in different compartments resulted in the biofilm functionalization in the ts a o mbbr unit which led to the advantages of high nitrogen removal efficiency small footprint and flexible operation declaration of

12729,the application of a novel two stage anoxic oxic moving bed biofilm reactor ts a o mbbr was validated in a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp and its working mechanism was analysed for biological nitrogen removal in this study over one year at a hydraulic residence time of only 9 8 h the effluent chemical oxygen demand ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen tn concentrations remained below 40 2 and 15 mg l which met strict emission standards the seven compartments in this unit performed different functions and together accomplished organics and nitrogen removal tn removal could be controlled by the external carbon sources dosage added to the postanoxic compartments to cost effectively meet the standard with the lowest cost the maximum tn removal efficiency and minimum effluent tn concentration reached 91 76 and 4 12 mg l respectively the bacterial communities differed in the suspended solids and preoxic postanoxic and oxic biofilms r 0 87 and p 0 001 the top 30 most abundant identified bacterial genera in biofilms included 24 denitrifying genera and 2 nitrifying genera the most abundant biofilm genus was methylotenera which played important roles in denitrification in the anoxic compartments 1 and 24 denitrifying genera were only abundant in the postanoxic and preanoxic compartments respectively nitrosomonas and nitrospira were abundant in the oxic compartments and played roles in nitrification this study verified the feasibility of the ts a o mbbr process in a full scale wwtp and investigated its working mechanism graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords moving bed biofilm reactor nitrification denitrification wastewater treatment plant biological nitrogen removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water eutrophication has turned out to be a global environmental threat 1 wastewater treatment plants wwtps remove pollutants from municipal wastewater before discharging which is of great significance to prevent eutrophication 2 3 however as populations grow and industrialization accelerates the discharge of treated wastewater continues to increase 4 in recent years many countries and regions have increased the stringency of effluent requirements for wwtps to protect public water bodies 4 5 however conventional wwtps have limited efficiency in removing nutrients especially nitrogen 6 therefore it is imperative to develop a novel and effective process that is capable of achieving the required removal efficiency conventional biological nitrogen removal by nitrification and denitrification has been widely used all over the world and has long been the most feasible option 3 7 however the effectiveness of conventional nitrification and denitrification processes based on activated sludge depends on the hydraulic retention time biomass concentration and return sludge flow rate 8 and these processes require a large footprint and disposal and management of the produced sludge 4 moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr has turned out to be a successful process 9 with the benefit of a small footprint and minimal sludge production 10 moreover mbbrs are as flexible and simple in terms of flow process as activated sludge systems and they allow multiple compartments to be configured in series to achieve treatment objectives 11 the most common configuration of mbbr is the anoxic oxic a o mbbr and many studies have been done based on this system 12 14 however it is difficult for the a o mbbr to achieve a high nitrogen removal efficiency because it is limited by the internal recycling ratio 15 to meet high nitrogen removal requirements many processes with mbbr based on post denitrification have been proposed such as the bardenpho mbbr 1 and two stage a o mbbr ts a o mbbr 9 16 among them the ts a o mbbr process stands out because of its stable high nitrogen removal efficiency small footprint and small sludge production for example zhou et al 16 showed that this process could reach up to 91 8 total inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency in a pilot scale system at a hydraulic retention time of 11 2 h it should be noted that the previous studies of the ts a o mbbr mostly focused on the lab scale or the pilot scale system however the full scale study of ts a o mbbr is limited a wwtp in qingdao city shandong province china with a target wastewater treatment capacity of 80 000 m3 d had an actual treatment capacity of only 60 000 m3 d and it was in dire need of expansion there were two difficulties to overcome for the expansion i the available footprint was limited ii the designed total nitrogen tn removal efficiency was as high as 80 in this case a novel ts a o mbbr process was chosen and it was designed meticulously with multiple compartments in this study the overall performance in terms of the organic matter and nitrogen removal of the unit in the wwtp was investigated and the detailed functions of all the compartments of the unit in terms of organic matter and nitrogen removal were analysed in addition microscope scanning was used to observe the biofilm morphology in this unit at the micro scale and high throughput sequencing was used to explore the bacterial communities in this unit this study verified the feasibility of the ts a o mbbr process in a full scale wwtp explored the microbial community of this system and provided a novel case for the wwtps that required both small footprint and high nitrogen removal efficiency which were of engineering novelty 2 material and methods 2 1 set up of ts a o mbbr unit in a wwtp a diagram and photo of the ts a o mbbr unit in the full scale wwtp are shown in fig 1 the unit consisted of seven cylindrical tanks in total three of which were divided into two compartments the raw wastewater entered the first pairs of compartments a1 and a2 in two equal lines and then entered the next pairs of compartments in parallel finally the wastewater in the two lines converged into the last compartment o3 and was then discharged to the next treatment unit among these compartments a1 and a2 were the preanoxic compartments o1 and o2 were the preoxic compartments a3 were the postanoxic compartments and o3 was the postoxic compartment internal recycling was set up from o2 to a1 and the ratio was set at 0 5 2 5 and was adjusted in real time by the automatic control the total effective volume of the two a1 compartments was 1400 m3 as was that of the two a2 compartments the total effective volume of the two o1 compartments was 1802 m3 so was that of the two o2 compartments the total effective volume of the two a3 compartments was totally 1500 m3 and the working volume of the o3 compartment was 233 m3 therefore the designed total hydraulic residence time was only 9 8 h sodium acetate was added to a1 and a3 by the automatic control the carriers were spr iii from qingdao spring water treatment co ltd they were made of high density polyethylene hdpe with the diameter height and thickness of 25 0 5 mm 10 1 mm and 0 35 0 10 mm their specific surface area was 800 m2 m3 they were added to all compartments with the filling fractions of 50 in anoxic compartments a1 a2 and a3 and 55 in oxic compartments o1 o2 and o3 mechanical mixers were used to circulate and mix the water and biocarriers in anoxic compartments and aeration was used to circulate and mix the water and biocarriers in oxic compartments the biofilm carrier retention screens were installed at the outlet of all compartments 17 so that the biocarriers always stayed in the compartments it was important to emphasize that there was no sludge return in this unit which saved the power cost therefore biofilms attached to the carriers were the dominant microorganism for wastewater treatment in both anoxic and oxic compartments of the ts a o mbbr unit which greatly reduced sludge disposal 2 2 wastewater characteristics the designed inflow of the ts a o mbbr unit was 20 000 m3 d the designed chemical oxygen demand cod concentration ammonia nitrogen nh4 n concentration and tn concentration of influent were 500 mg l 60 mg l and 72 mg l respectively however inflow and concentrations of the feed wastewater changed consistent with real municipal wastewater the maximum inflow was 28 800 m3 d during the experimental operating period while the cod nh4 n and tn concentrations ranged from 125 69 mg l to 538 74 mg l from 5 68 mg l to 55 41 mg l and from 20 72 mg l to 100 00 mg l respectively moreover the ph was 6 9 the total phosphorus concentration was 3 0 6 5 mg l and the suspended solids ss concentration was 115 314 mg l 2 3 chemical analytical methods samples of the influent and effluent water in the unit were taken every 3 h the samples from a single day were uniform mixed into a composite sample the samples in all reactors were taken every season in a hydraulic retention time the samples were filtered before test of cod nh4 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and tn concentrations these three concentrations and the ss concentration were investigated by standard methods 18 2 4 biofilm morphology scanning the biocarriers samples were taken randomly to be scanned scanning electron microscope sem quanta 250 feg fei usa was used to observe biofilm morphology at the micro scale the biofilm thickness was measured by industrial microscope ao hd228sd aosvi china and more than three places inside the biocarriers were randomly selected for biofilm thickness measurement 2 5 high throughput sequencing methods samples were taken from the ss and biofilms in all compartments every season and the samples from all seasons were uniform mixed into one composite sample high throughput sequencing was investigated in accordance with standard steps by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 19 the v3 v4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the primer pairs 338f and 806r

biotechnology information ncbi and the accession number was prjna861015 3 results 3 1 overall performance fig 2 shows the overall performance of the two stage a o unit of the wwtp over the course of one year according to emission standards cod nh4 n and tn concentrations should be controlled below 40 2 and 15 mg l respectively although the influent concentrations temperature and flow fluctuated the effluent concentrations always met the standards with a real total hydraulic retention time of 7 4 18 9 h and a temperature of 13 27 c the effluent cod nh4 n and tn concentrations were 26 58 3 49 0 27 0 26 and 10 00 2 46 mg l respectively and the average removal efficiencies were 91 68 99 11 and 74 03 respectively the effluent tn concentration was regulated automatically by the addition amount of external carbon sources to save costs when the external carbon sources were sufficient the highest tn removal efficiency reached 91 76 and the minimum effluent tn concentration was 4 12 mg l compared to the traditional anaerobic anoxic oxic activated sludge process 61 7 21 and the typical a o mbbr process 50 at an internal recycling ratio of 100 12 the ts a o mbbr process performed better in terms of tn removal efficiency in addition the ts a o mbbr process exhibited comparable nitrogen removal efficiency to that of the bardenpho mbbr process 84 3 1 but it had the advantage of much less sludge production therefore the ts a o mbbr process has been proven to have good performance in biological nitrogen removal in a full scale municipal wwtp which is a considerable achievement in particular it must be mentioned that the effluent ss of this biological treatment unit was 173 36 mg l which allowed the use of some efficient separation reactor instead of traditional settling tank in addition biofilms were difficult to alternate between anaerobic and aerobic conditions so biological phosphorus removal is in a finite way in the ts a o mbbr therefore chemical coagulation for ss and phosphorus removal with magnetic coagulation for flocculation separation with a small footprint was used in the following unit the ts a o mbbr unit covered a small area of below 1800 m2 and the full scale wastewater treatment process based on this unit required only proximately 4300 m2 in total due to the high pollutant removal rate and the low effluent ss of this unit 3 2 variations of pollutant concentrations cod was mostly removed in a1 and o1 and the concentrations decreased by 48 28 2 63 and 27 81 0 83 mg l respectively fig 3a the cod removal rates of a1 and o1 were 3 34 and 1 95 g cod m2 d respectively the difference between the two compartments was that a1 used raw and external organic matter as carbon sources for denitrification 22 while o1 removed the residual organic matter from the preanoxic reactors using oxygen as electron acceptor 23 nh4 n was mostly removed in o1 and o2 and the concentration decreased by 7 05 and 7 44 mg l in o1 and o2 respectively fig 3b the nh4 n removal rates of o1 and o2 were 0 49 and 0 52 g nh4 n m2 d respectively the nh4 n concentration could be reduced to a low level by o2 but o2 may not have reached its maximum processing capacity due to the limited substrate concentration tn was mostly removed in a1 a2 and a3 and the concentration decreased by 14 62 3 71 and 5 75 mg l fig 3c a1 used raw and external carbon sources for denitrification while a3 used only external carbon sources for denitrification and the c n consumption ratios of a1 and a3 were 6 19 0 97 and 4 51 1 68 respectively the removal rate of a1 was 1 16 g tn m2 d the tn removal of a3 could be controlled by the addition of external carbon sources to minimize the cost required to meet the tn standard which made this unit flexible the supposed role of a2 was to complement a1 and remove tn by denitrification using raw and external carbon sources but sometimes this role was not successfully achieved because of limited nitrate substrate concentrations however a2 would play an important role in nitrogen removal when the influent nitrogen load was high o3 was set up to avoid carbon leakage with a minimum volume the nitrogen mass balance was analysed in fig 3d which clearly showed nitrogen transformation in compartments of the ts a o mbbr unit the no2 n concentrations in all compartments were always below 1 0 mg l so no2 n was not considered here as can be seen that 370 20 kg d no3 n was removed in a1 by denitrification and then a2 removed a small amount of residual no3 n 17 28 kg d from a1 however 119 53 kg d organic nitrogen was removed in a1 and 147 91 kg d and 17 28 kg d nh4 n was removed in a1 and a2 respectively speculating that there were anammox in a1 and a2 o1 and o2 removed 309 19 kg d and 324 44 kg d nh4 n by transferring them to no3 n by nitrification a3 removed the rest 138 32 kg d no3 n by denitrification in conclusion the different compartments of the ts a o mbbr unit played different roles and they together accomplished organics and nitrogen removal in the wwtp 3 3 biofilm morphology as shown in fig 4a and b the biofilms were well attached to the surface of the carriers the biofilms in anoxic and oxic compartments showed different colours which were caused by the different functions and operating conditions 11 sem graphs fig 4c and d showed that all the biofilms had a rough surface and were

channel of substrate matrix 24 the surface structure in anoxic and oxic compartments were also different the extracellular polymers in oxic compartments were more compact than in anoxic compartments and the microorganisms were mainly globular bacteria in oxic compartments while there were rod shaped and globular bacteria in anoxic compartments the thickness of biofilms in a1 a2 and a3 were about 138 34 32 39 μm 76 29 11 44 μm and 104 89 28 37 μm fig 5a while the thickness of biofilms in o1 o2 and o3 were about 282 99 148 09 μm 199 05 50 25 μm and 243 99 125 89 μm fig 5b the biofilms in oxic compartments were significantly thicker than in anoxic compartments p 0 01 moreover biofilms in the first compartments a1 and o1 were thicker than in the second compartments a2 and o2 of the same tanks because of more sufficient substrate 3 4 bacterial community principle component analysis pca revealed differences in the bacterial community among the ss and biofilm samples fig 6 a the samples were clustered into four groups ss biofilms in the preanoxic compartments biofilms in the postanoxic compartments and biofilms in the oxic compartments analysis of similarities anosim confirmed the significant variations among the four groups r 0 87 and p 0 001 the ss samples were tightly clustered into a group and anosim further confirmed that there were no significant differences in bacterial community among the ss samples p 0 05 these findings indicated that different functional bacterial communities of various compartments did not occur in the ss which was similar to the activated sludge 25 however there were obvious different bacterial communities in the biofilms of the preanoxic postanoxic and oxic compartments r 0 83 and p 0 001 because most of the active biomass was retained continually in each compartment 11 the biofilms in different compartments were formed functionalization the biocarriers in the mbbr system promoted the biomass segregation between ss and biofilms resulting in the formation of functionalization of the whole system 26 linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was used to explore the specific bacteria leading to differences in the community among the four groups and the results are presented in a cladogram fig 6b there were 66 bacteria particularly enriched α 0 05 lda score 4 at the phylum level notably the phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteriota were significantly enriched in the postanoxic biofilms and oxic biofilms respectively some proteobacteria are closely related to denitrification 27 which was consistent with the fact that the postanoxic compartments played important roles in denitrification actinobacteriota was reported to consist of heterotrophic bacteria 14 which can remove organic matter which was consistent with the fact that the oxic compartments played important roles in organic matter removal acidobacteriota bacteroidota and chloroflexi were significantly enriched in the preanoxic biofilms acidobacteriota are related to nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment 28 bacteroidota are associated with hydrolysis of macromolecules under anaerobic or anoxic conditions 27 chloroflexi was considered to be correlated with the degradation of organics 27 the enrichment of these bacteria was also consistent with the roles of the preanoxic compartments in organic matter and nitrogen removal at the genus level gemmobacter rhodobacter pseudorhodobacter simplicispira unclassified genus of the family comamonadaceae unclassified f comamonadaceae thermomonas and thiothrix were the dominant discriminating genera in ss most of these genera related to denitrification 29 33 except the unclassified genus of comamonadaceae unclassified f comamonadaceae whose function is unknown therefore the bacteria in ss may play some roles in denitrification however the ss concentrations in all compartments were 100 300 mg l while the biofilm concentration in mbbr were generally 1000 5000 mg l 11 so biofilms were much more numerous and played much important roles in wastewater treatment therefore the bacterial genera of biofilms in various compartments should be further analysed the relative abundances of the top thirty abundant bacterial genera that were clearly identified in the biofilms of the compartments are exhibited in fig 7 a among the thirty genera twenty four genera were related to denitrification 27 30 32 34 49 methylotenera which was reported to be essential for denitrification 39 was the most abundant and it was abundant in all compartments number of sequences 50 the same below fig 7b some denitrifying bacterial genera were abundant in the oxic compartments and three genera novosphingobium hirschia jgi 0001001 h03 were abundant only in the oxic compartments however denitrification was not observed obviously in the oxic compartments because denitrification is inhibited under high dissolved oxygen conditions 50 one genus mycobacterium was abundant only in the postanoxic compartments fourteen genera trichococcus thermomonas devosia simplicispira defluviimonas mesorhizobium ferruginibacter sphingobium rhodobacter lautropia hydrogenophaga cl500 29 marine group dokdonella arenimonas were abundant only in the preanoxic compartments and seven genera methylotenera trichococcus denitratisoma hyphomicrobium flavobacterium terrimonas brevundimonas were abundant in both preanoxic and postanoxic compartments therefore denitrifying bacterial communities were more diverse in the preanoxic compartments than in the postanoxic compartments which may be because the organic matter of the raw water was only used in the preanoxic compartments for denitrification however these twenty genera all played important roles in denitrification in the preanoxic or postanoxic compartments moreover there were nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonas and nitrospira among the thirty genera fig 7a corresponding to ammonia oxidizing genus and nitrite oxidizing genus respectively 51 they were mainly found in the oxic compartments fig 7b which led to more nitrification in the oxic compartments even though o2 did not achieve its maximum capacity the relative abundances of nitrifying genera in o2 were the greatest so o2 had great potential for nitrification in addition there were candidatus brocadia found in this unit which was reported to be anammox 52 which was consisted with the phenomenon at the macro scale that organic nitrogen and nh4 n was removed in a1 and a2 this genus was significantly more abundant in preanoxic compartments than in other compartments p 0 05 because this genus was more competitive in the presence of organic matter 52 54 however compared to the reactor with enhanced nitrogen removal via anammox 0 40 0 61 52 and the partial nitritation anammox system with the flocs 1 3 and the floc aggregations 4 3 55 candidatus brocadia was less abundant in preanoxic compartments of this unit 0 31 0 22 therefore anammox in this unit was in a finite way and denitrification for nitrogen removal was dominant it can be seen from hierarchical clustering results that the samples from the oxic and anoxic compartments were separated into two lineages fig 7a the samples from the preanoxic and postanoxic compartments were further separated into two lineages as were the samples from the preoxic and postoxic compartments indicating that their bacterial characteristics were different correspondingly the bacteria in these compartments played different roles in pollutant removal in summary there were different bacterial communities in the biofilms of different compartments resulting in different functions in nitrogen metabolism 4 discussion a novel ts a o mbbr process was applied successfully in a full scale municipal wwtp as results from this study the process could reach a high nitrogen removal efficiency 91 76 to always meet the stringent emission standards this study on the biofilm information as well as the pilot scale research in our previous study 16 56 showed that there were specific functional biofilms formed in different functional compartments of the ts a o mbbr unit which led to these advantages as follows i high nh4 n and tn removal rates were get in specific compartments due to biofilms functionalization so that the hrt was short with the minimal real hrt of only 7 4 h which further led to a small footprint ii possibilities for precise management were provided in the ts a o mbbr unit due to the explicit functionality flexible partitioning and adjustable operation so that the internal recycling ratio the do concentrations and the dosage of external carbon sources could be in a precise control which further led to less cost in addition there was no sludge return in this unit which saved the power cost due to the low effluent ss concentration 250 mg l the wwtp base on the ts a o mbbr process was allowed the use of any efficient separation reactors such as magnetic coagulation in this wwtp and chemical phosphorus removal was performed in this separation reactor at the same time it is also another reason why the wwtp with the ts a o mbbr unit was such compact as for the external carbon sources dosage it was unavoidable for all the processes based on the traditional nitrification denitrification including this ts a o mbbr process but traditional nitrogen removal technology also made it easy to implement in a full scale wwtp with the fluctuating influent concentrations temperature and inlet flow the amount of the external carbon sources had been minimized in the ts a o mbbr unit due to the biofilms functionalization which led to the possibilities for precise management concretely the internal recycling ratio could be automatically controlled precisely by the organics in raw water and the effluent nitrate of the preoxic compartments to maximize the utilization of carbon sources in raw water the dosage of the carbon sources in a3 was automatically controlled precisely according to the nitrogen emission standards to avoid the carbon sources waste and the carbon source could be added in a1 to further ensure meet the stringent emission standards when the hrt of a3 was not long enough in conclusion the advantages of the ts a o mbbr process in the external carbon sources dosage lied in making full use of raw water carbon sources and avoiding carbon sources waste in fact the annual operating cost of the wwtp based on ts a o mbbr process was comparable to traditional pre denitrification activated sludge process but obtain better tn removal performance and smaller footprint furthermore because anammox bacteria were found in the preanoxic compartments it should be enriched and played greater roles in nitrogen removal by operating control to reduce the amount of the external carbon sources which is the focus of future research 5 conclusions a novel ts a o mbbr process was applied in a full scale wwtp to treat municipal wastewater in this study it was found that this process exhibited good cod nh4 n and tn removal performance the different compartments in the unit played different roles in pollutant removal biofilm morphology showed different in anoxic and oxic compartments moreover high throughput sequencing revealed the bacterial community of ss and biofilm samples the results showed that there were different bacterial communities in the biofilms of the preanoxic postanoxic and oxic compartments which was different from the ss characteristics a variety of denitrifying genera including methylotenera played roles in denitrification in the anoxic compartments and nitrosomonas and nitrospira played roles in nitrification in the oxic compartments the different bacterial communities of biofilms in different compartments resulted in the biofilm functionalization in the ts a o mbbr unit which led to the advantages of high nitrogen removal efficiency small footprint and flexible operation declaration of
