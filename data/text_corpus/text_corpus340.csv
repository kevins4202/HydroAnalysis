1700,presented in this paper is an introduction to the study on sky rivers especially the concept theory and implications a sky river is in essence a generalization for a rich variety of meteorological systems including tropical cyclones extratropical frontal cyclones shear lines and others from the viewpoint of fluid mechanics all these meteorological systems share a common feature that there exists a contacting surface between two air masses with contrasting velocities temperatures humidity and pressures under the forces caused by large gradients of state variables normal to the contacting surfaces and other forces concentrated water vapor flows along paths on the contacting surfaces like river channels on earth surface characterized by cloud and precipitation processes along the paths a simplified and direct approach to identify the sky rivers is proposed on the basis of their physical interpretation results show that the sky rivers globally exist and have close relations with precipitation in mathematics the sky rivers are the discontinuity surfaces of the governing equations for atmospheric flows and they are formulated in this study as the characteristic surfaces where the characteristic values are real and the derivatives normal to the surface do not exist by means of general theory for partial differential equations to provide a description for time space evolution of the sky rivers finally future study areas regarding the sky rivers are discussed keywords sky river atmospheric water water cycle characteristic surface 1 introduction water affects every aspect of life on earth development utilization and protection of water resources have long been the central tasks of human societies however shortage of fresh water is a serious natural and social problem according to the report by world resources institute luo et al 2015 currently 33 countries of the world are facing extremely high water stress and this number will be expanded to as much as 59 in 2040 in china water issues are even more complicated the country is now suffering from severe water shortage with the 28 of the world average per capita availability of water resources and 75 of the world average per capita annual consumption of water resources to feed 1 5 of the world s population meanwhile the traditional water management techniques now almost reach their upper limits for example more than 85 000 reservoirs have been completed in china since the 1950s yu 2011 particularly in the basin of the yellow river the total reservoir capacity exceeds annual runoff xia et al 2014 therefore seeking new measures to alleviate water stress is of significance for the countries suffered from severe shortage of water resources development of atmospheric water resources may be a potential solution since 1950s numerous studies and experiments of cloud water utilization have been conducted in china and the rest of the world to alleviate drought issues but it is far from efficient for instance the total incoming water vapor of china is close to 20 trillion m3 per year cai 2008 approximately 4 times of average annual rainfall while the increment of water resources by cloud water utilization is only about 50 billion m3 national development and reform commission china meteorological administration 2014 in the current practice atmospheric water resources are still classified as unconventional water resources and cannot be fully brought into the water resources management systems and thus resulting in the failure of coupling with conventional surface water resources to achieve a comprehensive development of atmosphere surface water resource therefore what are the key factors that lead to the difficulty in exploiting atmospheric water resources in addition to developing efficient cloud seeding techniques it is necessary to recognize that there still exist several theoretical issues that are not completely resolved in the utilization of atmospheric water for instance as a type of natural water materials what makes atmospheric water as a resource must be well defined however the stochastic feature of cloud and precipitation processes causes difficulties in providing a reasonable definition of atmospheric water resources it seems like a meteorological or hydrological issue but actually beyond that first it is necessary to understand which part of atmospheric water could be potentially transformed into surface water and then analyze its temporal and spatial variation here our primary interest is not only on short term processes such as synoptic processes but also on the long term i e usually on a century scale evolution dynamics spanning the life cycles of water resource configuration infrastructure second as a natural resource like others the ownership of atmospheric water resource must be well clarified for this purpose we have to figure out whether there exists a concept of basin in the atmospheric water resources and if so where is the basin how do atmospheric water flow between the basins obviously these two problems make the atmospheric water resources development no longer a simple meteorological issue numerous studies have been conducted regarding the mechanisms of atmospheric water vapor transport see the comprehensive review by gimeno et al 2014 and have achieved great progress especially since the concept of atmospheric rivers ars was raised zhu and newell 1998 most studies focused on the meteorological processes related to the occurrence of ars a few works are devoted to exploring the role of ars in extreme events extreme precipitation and flood indeed studies on ars may help shed light on the transport of atmospheric water however as explained before it is still insufficient to have a full picture of long term cycle of the atmospheric water resource within this context we proposed a concept of sky river in 2015 wang et al 2016 to explain how the atmospheric water could be utilized presented in this paper is a follow up work reported by wang et al 2016 in this paper we begin with the description of the concept of the sky rivers section 2 in section 3 a simple method to identify the global sky rivers is proposed followed by a case study of the extreme precipitation event occurred in beijing on july 21 2012 to illustrate the relationship between the sky rivers and precipitation then mathematical formulation of the sky rivers is given in section 4 to describe the dynamics of the sky rivers and the simplified equations are also given to describe the major features of the governing equations of the sky rivers finally a short summary of this paper and the future study as well as its implications are presented in section 5 2 concept of sky river it is no doubt that state of the art research concerning each of the meteorological phenomena is highly valuable in weather forecasting additional to its scientific importance in understanding the nature we live on however when we consider the cloud and precipitation processes from the angle of global water cycle using the principles of fluid mechanics our immediate concern is not only on the details of the phenomena but also on their general behaviors and underlying mechanisms as well if we take a more careful examination into the mechanisms related to cloud processes and possible precipitation as the results of tropical cyclones extratropical cyclones or frontal cyclones and gust fronts in deep convections regardless of the differences in their names their occurrence frequencies and their temporal and spatial scales we may learn from the descriptions in text books of meteorology that they all are marked by a most common feature that is all of them are closely related to the contacts of air masses within the fields of density velocity temperature pressure and humidity different from each other wallace and hobbs 2006 barry and chorley 2009 furthermore in every case when two different air masses meet each other in the atmospheric flows the ascending of the warm and moist air mass usually causes water vapor to condense and results in a variety of types of clouds and possible rainfalls for instance extratropical fronts or frontal cyclones are typical synoptic phenomena in atmospheric flows due to the contact of two air masses with different temperature velocity pressure and humidity baroclinic instability leads to ageostrophic vertical circulation and accompanied updraft of warm air at frontal zones meanwhile the airflows there are affected considerably by the temperature gradient and thus geostrophic wind is significantly changed by the wind shear due to thermal wind resulting in concentrated water vapor flows along the lines of fronts toward the lows which are usually referred to as prefrontal low level jets fllj carbone 1982 with nearly saturated air flows accompanied by heavy rainfalls bao et al 2006 cordeira et al 2013 tropical cyclone is another example of which high rate of evaporation occurs in the vicinity of the eyewall then warm and moist air ascends to meet ambient cooler air which is also the key mechanism to develop intense storms anthes 2016 the rise and sink of air at the eyewall and eye of a tropical cyclone can also be treated as a contacting system of different air masses therefore it can be concluded that typical phenomena regarding cloud and precipitation processes result from the contacts of different air masses no matter they are found in tropical cyclones extratropical frontal cyclones and shear lines among many others in other words the contacting surface separating two different air masses in the atmospheric flows is in essence the region where water vapor changes into cloud droplets possibly leading to rainfalls for this reason from a viewpoint of hydrology the contacting surfaces between different air masses and the processes occurring there are exactly our study of interest in the water cycle usually the contacting surfaces exhibit as narrow cloud or rain bands along which intensive transport of atmospheric water are found behaving in a similar manner as river channels on the surface of the earth for this reason we termed the contacting surfaces as the sky rivers by this definition it is inferred that the atmospheric water flowing in the sky rivers has high potential to reach the surface of the ground through precipitation 3 identification and spatial distribution of sky rivers 3 1 identification of sky rivers according to the physical nature of the sky rivers they are formed through the contact between air masses with different velocity pressure temperature and humidity based on the knowledge of fluid mechanics fluids in different states especially those with different densities and temperatures contact each other to form a discontinuity at the contacting interface with the lighter and warmer fluids uplifted under steady state conditions the continuous equation of atmospheric water mainly water vapor can be written as 1 α w 1 α w 0 z 0 z 1 α u x α v y d z where u and v is the horizontal wind component w1 and w0 is the vertical wind component at z1 and z0 and α is the specific humidity from eq 1 when α u x α v y 0 it implies that convergence of the flow occurs and atmospheric water within z0 z1 is more likely to be uplifted i e α w 1 α w 0 0 therefore from a viewpoint of fluid mechanics updraft is always linked to the convergence in a given flow filed consequently a succinct way to find the discontinuity surfaces or the sky rivers is to analyze the convergence in the flow field in fact analysis on the convergence of the flow fields is also a common method in meteorology to diagnose precipitations simmonds et al 1999 banacos and schultz 2005 lavers et al 2014 when considering the distribution of the sky rivers in a large scale it is advisable to analyze vertically integrated atmospheric water transport flux and identify the convergence lines in the atmospheric flows which is given by 2 q 1 g p s 0 α u d p where q is the vertically integrated horizontal atmospheric water transport flux p is the pressure and ps is the surface pressure and u is the horizontal wind vector from helmholtz s theorem of fluid mechanics q can be decomposed into the rotational divergence free field and divergent vorticity free field chen 1985 wu et al 1993 that is 3 q h ϕ k h ψ where k is the unit vector normal to the earth surface ϕ is the potential function ψ is the stream function and h x y is the gradient operator applying the divergence operator on the both sides of eq 3 one can obtain 4 h 2 ϕ h q combining eq 4 with the conservation equation of atmospheric water within a column which has a unit bottom area i e 5 w t h q p e where w is the atmospheric water mass within the air column p and e denotes precipitation and evaporation respectively we write 6 w t h 2 ϕ p e here w t can be neglected because it is usually much smaller than the other terms in eq 6 when large scale processes are concerned eq 6 implies that the potential function ϕ i e the divergent field of atmospheric water transport flux is closely related to the variability in atmospheric water mass precipitation and evaporation if h q 0 i e atmospheric water converges the potential function ϕ reaches minimum value with p e if h q 0 i e atmospheric water is in divergence the potential function ϕ reaches maximum value with p e as has been defined earlier a sky river is the region where atmospheric flows converge and thus this feature indicates that the sky rivers as convergence lines on a certain pressure level match with troughs of corresponding potential function at that level in the present study we treat the potential ϕ x y as the topography of the sky rivers just as the surface topography for the ordinary surface rivers this allows us to identify the sky rivers using the same algorithms to extract surface rivers with the spatial distribution of sky river channels as well as their basins determined accordingly 3 2 global distribution of sky rivers with the use of the method described in subsection 3 1 the sky rivers in the range of global scale are identified day by day from january 1 1979 to december 31 2016 based on the era interim reanalysis data dee et al 2011 specifically the vertically integrated horizontal water vapor flux data from the era interim dataset is initially decomposed into the rotational field k h ψ and divergent field h ϕ and then the troughs of ϕ are extracted by using the ordinary watershed channel extraction algorithm as a result fig 1 shows the global distribution of the sky river system on july 21 2012 in which one can find several obvious branches over the west and south asia the indian ocean region and the west pacific by counting the occurrence times of the sky rivers on each grid point global geographic grid with spatial resolution of 0 75 degree year by year we obtain the average annual occurrence frequency of the sky rivers for a comparatively long period shown in fig 2 the result suggests that there is a high frequency zone coinciding with the itcz intertropical convergence zone around the equatorial region mainly the equatorial pacific with the average occurrence frequency range from 30 to 50 days per annum over the northern india and tibetan plateau of china the average occurrence frequency of the sky rivers is between 40 and 50 days per annum on the northern shore of the pacific ocean and the south polar regions the frequency varies from 20 to 30 days per annum moreover the highest frequency appears in southwest china central sichuan and southern tibet with more than 60 days per annum 3 3 relationship between sky river and precipitation fig 3 shows the annual mean precipitation rate 1983 2016 as can be seen from the results presented in figs 2 and 3 the global mean distribution of the sky rivers is remarkably similar to precipitation moreover the sky rivers also have a close relation with the specific precipitation events as an example meteorological records show from 10 00 a m on july 21st 2012 to 02 00 a m on 22nd beijing experienced the strongest precipitation event fig 4 since august 8 1963 numerous studies from the perspective of meteorology were conducted to analyze this extreme precipitation event and in this study we will reexamine this event from the view of the sky rivers to reveal their connection fig 5 shows the distribution of precipitable water at 12 00p m on july 21 2012 it can be seen that significantly higher water vapor content occurs over beijing and southern hebei ranging from 62 1 mm to 70 9 mm meanwhile fig 6 shows the vertically integrated water vapor flux these results in figs 5 and 6 jointly indicate that the water vapor fluxes continuously transport water vapor from the northwestern subtropical high and the south china sea to beijing with the highest intensity as much as 971 7 kg m s the potential function and the corresponding divergent flux can be achieved by performing the helmholtz decomposition of the water vapor flux field fig 7 obviously shows that water vapor flows from the area with high value of the potential function to adjacent area with low value with a significant convergence zone around beijing and thus forming the contacting surfaces namely the sky rivers due to the difference in the density speed pressure temperature and humidity of water vapor masses the sky rivers are located through the method given in section 3 1 and plotted in fig 8 it seems that almost all converging centers of the sky rivers are coinciding with the precipitation centers especially over beijing and also sichuan and guizhou province of china the south china sea the northwestern pacific and the equatorial west pacific also the high precipitation bands seem to be all accompanied by one or more sky rivers as shown in figs 3 and 8 the sky rivers are generally characterized with strong convergence of water vapor flux which usually consists of deep convection shear lines and other synoptic systems all of which have close relationships with precipitation field as a matter of fact these distinct properties attached to the sky rivers are major factors in developing atmospheric water resources 4 mathematical description of sky rivers in the section 3 a simplified method to identify the sky rivers using fundamental principles of fluid mechanics and the global distributions of sky rivers are elaborated in detail however the following questions still remain to be answered 1 what drives the sky rivers 2 what is the underpinning mechanism responsible for the temporal and spatial evolution of the sky rivers 3 can the sky rivers be successfully predicted to achieve this in the following a mathematical description of the sky rivers will be provided to lay a foundation for the theoretical studies of the sky rivers in the future as has been discussed before a sky river can be physically interpreted as a surface that separates the air masses with different temperatures humidity velocities and pressures in atmospheric circulations the thickness of a contacting surface between two air masses is much smaller than that of the geometric scales of atmospheric circulations and it can immediately be deduced that there must exist large or even nonexistent gradients of flow fields normal to the contacting surfaces therefore from a perspective of fluid mechanics the physical nature of a sky river is actually a special boundary layer developed by air masses of different dynamical and thermo dynamical states when they meet each other in the troposphere intensive boundary layer flows usually occur as a result of strong gradients associated with state parameters like temperature velocity and humidity so the sky rivers can also be regarded as discontinuities in the atmospheric flow fields at the same time when we view the contacting surface of two different air masses from an angle of mathematics this generalized picture of a sky river permits us to formulate it as a discontinuity in flow fields of the geophysical fluids which propagates as a certain type of waves in the sense of large scale circulations in atmosphere discontinuities in flows and their propagations are classical research work in fluid mechanics whitham 1974 here if considering the discontinuity surfaces from a mathematical point of view especially the characteristic theory for partial differential equations we immediately find that the discontinuity surfaces formed between air masses are exactly the characteristic surfaces with real characteristic values and nonexistent normal derivatives of the governing equations for the atmospheric flows hilber and courant 1989 therefore this generalization allows us to study cloud and precipitation processes in a more general way 4 1 governing equations in the field of meteorological science the atmosphere may be regarded as simple single phase flow or complex multi phase mixing flow indeed single phase flow models were developed to simplify mathematical complexity and reduce computing time and thus are favored in the realm of meteorology and other relevant disciplines including most fundamental theories of the geophysical fluid flows however the atmospheric flows strictly speaking are multi phase mixture commonly composed of dry air water vapor cloud or rain drops or ice flakes therefore the atmospheric flows as one of the representative multi components and multi phase systems are significantly affected by phasic differences phase changes and accompanied mechanical and thermal dynamical processes although simplification of the multiphase flows into simple single phase is helpful in reducing the complexity associated with the most fundamental processes involved in atmospheric flows this will mask some of important and essential features of multiphase flows for this reason we will treat atmospheric flows using multiphase flow model and adopt the continuum theory to explore flows in the sky rivers the continuum theory for multiphase flows is sophisticated and has been employed extensively in studying the flow components with distinctive differences between individual phases as for the atmospheric flows hereinafter we divide the materials within the flow into two categories namely 1 fluid phase and 2 particulate phase the former is composed of water vapor and air while the latter comprises liquid drops and solid particles for a general description of multiphase flows the density velocity pressure and energy of each phase are necessary parameters to depict the flows and symbolically expressed as ρ k u k p k and e k where subscript k stands for total energy of the phase then the governing equations for the multiphase flows can be given in a general form as follows drew and passman 1999 7 a k u k t b k x u k f k where u k ρ k u k p k e k a k and b k b kx b ky b kz are coefficients x x y z is the gradient operator a k is presumably invertible without loss generality f k is the source term and the jacob matrix f k u k is implicitly assumed to exist and be invertible in eq 7 it follows a common assumption in the study of large scale processes within atmospheric circulations by including the diffusion in the source term the source term in eq 7 is also a function of the state variable u k which usually represents an impulse on the system at time t this is true when the source term f k in a time scale much smaller than other terms however as far as the multiphase geophysical fluids flows are considered the physical processes included in the source term are usually responsible for large scale circulations and impose long term memory effects on flows for instance the rotation effect or conventionally referred to as coriolis effect is the key factor that participates in the formation of the rossby waves holton and hakim 2012 also phase changes for example condensation of water vapor may release large amount of latent heat during a storm and affect behavior of the system in order to explicitly take into account the memory effects of source term on flows the following manipulations of the original equation is carried out firstly we differentiate eq 7 with respect to the time t such that 8 a k 2 u k t 2 b k x u k t f k t a k t u k t b k t x u k subsequently differentiating eq 7 with respect to the space leads to 9 a k x u k t b k x 2 u k x f k x a k u k t x b k x u k combining eqs 8 and 9 yields 10 u k t c k x u k j k 1 2 t 2 e k x 2 u k n k where c k j k 1 e k j k j k a k 1 u k f k e k a k 1 b k and the nonlinear term is given by 11 n j k 1 a k 1 a k t u k t b k t x u k j k 1 a k 1 b k a k x a k u k t x b k x u k clearly the simple manipulation of the original equations for multiphase flows results in a set of second order partial equations with the derivative of the source term newly introduced into the equations as permits eq 10 to account for the memory effects arising from the source term 4 2 governing equations for sky rivers the characteristic surface for a partial differential system is defined as a super surface normal to which the derivatives of the state variables do not exist hilber and courant 1989 this feature coincides with the mathematical idealization of the sky rivers i e the contacting surface with extremely large gradients in flow fields formed by two different air masses therefore a sounded mathematical description of sky rivers can immediately be formulated once the characteristic surfaces in atmospheric flows are identified in order to make the definition of the sky rivers have a clear physical interpretation it should be noted that in the following sections the focus is solely on the characteristic surfaces with real characteristic values assume φ φ x t is the contacting surface of two different air masses in the atmospheric flows and by the transform of t φ t φ and x x φ φ the equation for atmospheric flows is thus written as 12 c φ φ u k e φ φ 2 u k n φ where 13 c φ φ t c k x φ 14 e φ j k 1 φ t 2 e k x φ 2 and φ u k represents the differentiation normal to the characteristic surface of φ φ x t it implies that flows on the contacting surfaces are mainly dominated by two distinct processes the first process is described by a first order derivative which behaves as wave propagating normal to the boundary layer at the velocity c φ the second is given by a second order derivative which behaves as diffusion normal to the boundary layer with the viscosity of e φ as have been mentioned earlier if our attention is restricted to large scale flows in the atmosphere i e the dimension of flows measured at the magnitude much larger than the thickness of the boundary layer developed by two contacting atmosphere masses in distinct states then the diffusion term can be reasonably ignored in this context the contacting surface is a characteristic surface and thus the derivatives normal to the surface do not exist as leads to that hilber and courant 1989 15 f φ t x φ c φ φ t c k x φ 0 eq 15 is the characteristic function of eq 10 which essentially defines the characteristic surfaces evolving with time and space apparently f φ t x φ is a first order differential equation following the characteristic approach for the first order partial differential equations we found that hilber and courant 1989 16 d x d t f n d n d t f x n f φ d φ d t n f n where n x φ eq 15 along with eq 16 gives a systematic description of temporal and spatial evolution of the sky rivers based on the characteristic theory for the partial differential equations one may realize that the sky rivers are in fact a type of waves in the atmospheric flows it is necessary to emphasize again that the foregoing flows in the sky rivers are a special type of boundary layer flows in nature which can be described by the following way when tracking along the waves given by eq 15 i e expanding the high order term on the right hand of eq 10 at the wave front we can let whitham 1974 17 t c k x on the right hand side of eq 10 and then at the wave front we had that 18 u k t c k x u k d k x 2 u k n k where the diffusion operator on the right hand side of eq 18 is defined as 19 d k x 2 j k 1 c k x 2 e k x 2 eq 18 is the governing equation for the boundary layer flows on the characteristic surfaces i e the sky rivers which is a general version of convection diffusion equation we see that the convection is apparently influenced by phase changes from the definition of c k j k 1 e k j k while the diffusion is due to the propagation of the high order waves in relative to the convection 4 3 shallow water model for sky rivers in order to give a more direct mathematical description of the sky rivers eqs 15 and 18 a shallow water model for atmospheric flows is adopted to illustrate the mechanism involved in the sky rivers since we focus mainly the transport of water vapor in the atmospheric flows our analysis will start with the equation of mass conservation of the water vapor in the atmosphere as follows 20 α h t h α h u α 0 where h is the depth of the atmosphere uα is the velocity of water vapor in the shallow water model for the atmospheric flows the equation of momentum conservation for the water vapor with the effect of phase change on momentum transfer neglected can be written as 21 α h u α t h α h u α u α α g h 1 2 h 2 α h f k u α 0 where f is the coriolis coefficient and g is the gravitational acceleration eqs 20 and 21 can be transformed to matrix form similar to eq 18 when we denoted u h u α v α t f ω f v α f u α t of which ω α 1 h d α d t is the rate of phase change consequently the convection and diffusion operator are given respectively as c α h u α g ω v f g ω u ω v f ω h f 2 h g ω v 2 f ω h 0 u α 0 g ω h f g ω u f u α g ω v f x 22 v α g ω u f f 2 h g ω u 2 f ω h g ω u ω v f ω h g ω h f v α g ω u f g ω v f 0 0 v α y and d α h 2 g 2 u α ω h 2 ω u m 1 f 2 ω h 2 gh ω h 2 ω u 2 u α ω h g 1 g ω u f 2 h ω v h 1 f 2 ω h 2 g ω h ω u l 1 g 2 h 1 f 2 ω h 2 g 2 u α ω h g ω u f 2 g h ω h 2 u α ω u f 2 g l 1 f 2 g 2 f u α g ω v f 2 g f h ω h g ω u ω v f 2 ω h g g 2 f 2 ω h 2 x 2 23 g 2 v α ω h 2 ω v m 1 f 2 ω h 2 g ω h ω v l 2 g 1 h 2 f 2 ω h 2 gh ω h 2 ω v 2 v α ω h g 2 g ω v f 2 h ω u h 2 f 2 ω h 2 g 2 f v α g ω u f 2 g g 1 f 2 ω h g f h ω h g ω u ω v f 2 ω h g 2 v α ω h g ω v f 2 g l 2 f 2 g h ω h 2 v α ω v f 2 2 y 2 of which m 1 f g ω u ω v g ω h ω u 2 ω v 2 g 1 f 2 h g ω u 2 g 2 f 2 h g ω v 2 h 1 2 f u α g ω v h 2 2 f v α g ω u 24 l 1 f h 2 u α ω v l 2 f h 2 v α ω u with ω h ω h ω u ω u α and ω v ω v α for the sake of simplicity the terms of the cross derivative with respect to x and y in the diffusion operator can be neglected accordingly the characteristic form of the system is given by 25 f φ t x φ φ t c α h φ φ t u α φ x v α φ y φ t u α φ x v α φ y 2 g h φ x 2 φ y 2 it shows that in the application of the shallow water model for atmospheric flows the characteristic surfaces are degenerated into characteristic lines furthermore according to characteristic theory for partial differential equations the disturbances propagate as a monge cone at a speed of gh hilber and courant 1989 which implies that the sky rivers are a special class of gravitational waves when the shallow water model for atmospheric flows is adopted moreover the characteristic surfaces i e the sky rivers can be either dissipated or be amplified depending on the diffusion operator d α h 2 j α 1 c α h 2 e α h 2 as a consequence of the special dynamics of the boundary layer flows on the characteristic surface see eqs 18 and 23 of which the diffusion operator is a complex result of convection and forcing due to phase change if d α h 2 is positively defined then sky rivers tend to be dissipated along the paths they propagate in contrary if d α h 2 is negatively defined the waves as the characteristic surfaces are more likely to be enhanced and the sky rivers become intensified this can be regarded as the criterion that disturbances in the atmospheric flows develop into the sky rivers by means of gravitational waves for instance considering an idealized case with the flow field assumed to be stationary i e u α 0 and with the nonlinear term neglected then the governing equation for boundary layer flows is simply reduced to 26 h t c α h h d α h 2 h where h is the disturbance on the depth of atmosphere and 27 c α h g ω v f x g ω u f y 28 d α h 2 g 2 f ω u ω v ω h ω u 2 ω v 2 f 2 ω h 2 2 x 2 2 y 2 eq 26 gives the evolution of the disturbance on the height of atmosphere purely due to phase change and coriolis effect it is interesting to deduce from eq 28 that the disturbance of h is to be diffused in one direction while inversely diffused in its perpendicular direction as implies that a point disturbance is to be developed into a strip finally this is one of the main reasons for the development of the sky rivers the inverse diffusion collects mass from one direction while its counterpart diffuses mass perpendicularly to form stripes given the complexity in solving the governing equations of sky rivers it should be admitted that the theory described in this section remains to be investigated and improved in the future for the purpose to fully describe the behaviors of sky rivers as a result an alternative method given in section 3 to locate sky rivers should be considered nevertheless both the simplified locating method and well formulated theory are developed on the basis of the discontinuity nature of sky rivers it is believed that the distribution of sky rivers found in section 3 can be fully explained by the mechanism covered in this section following insightful research in the future 5 conclusions and implications although water existing in the atmosphere of the earth occupies about 0 1 of the total water in the hydrosphere of the earth it plays an extremely important role in water cycle as a key linkage of water in the oceans and the land with the largest exchange rates in the earth system therefore studies with respect to atmospheric water have long been one of the central topics in hydrology this study is expected to provide us with a different perspective of atmospheric water transport and correlated precipitation from the angle of general theory of fluid mechanics based on the general formulation of the sky rivers reported in this study though details with respect to the dynamics of the sky rivers are not fully recovered the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the sky rivers discussed in this paper have the physical essence that they are contacting surfaces of air masses with different states the flows in the sky rivers are a special type of boundary layer flows due to large gradients of state variables normal to the contacting surfaces the physical and mathematical generalization of water vapor transport made in this paper permit us to view the transport of water materials in the atmosphere in a universal way which is well developed in fluid mechanics 2 a simple but efficient way to identify the sky rivers is proposed based on general principles of fluid mechanics a general conclusion drawn in fluid mechanics is that the relatively lighter one ascends along the contacting surfaces accompanied by convergence of flows when two air masses with different dynamic and thermo dynamics states meet together using this conclusion we proposed a simple approach to identify the sky rivers it shows that the sky rivers identified in this study coincide with the main rain bands which is concerned in the study of water cycle and development of atmospheric water resource 3 by invoking characteristic theory for partial differential equations the governing equations for the sky rivers are derived which show that the sky rivers are a type of waves in the atmospheric flows with the help of a simple shallow water model for atmospheric circulations it is found that there exists an inverse diffusion perpendicular to the normal diffusion which can lead a point disturbance develops to a strip one of the major mechanisms responsible for the development of the sky rivers although the meteorological phenomena mentioned in this paper are familiar to meteorologist and hydrologist the study presented in this paper implies that 1 the study helps us to have a new vision to study the water cycle according to the nature of the sky rivers defined in this paper we find that water vapor flowing in the sky rivers is the atmospheric water that most likely to precipitate onto the earth surface moreover the physical generalization that the sky rivers as the contacting surfaces of different air masses enables us to describe the sky rivers by means of well established characteristic theory for partial different equation therefore this study is expected to provide us a fundamental tool to view the cloud processes and precipitation in a new angle although details with respect to the sky rivers provided by eqs 15 16 and 18 wait for further studies in the future 2 the study helps us to investigate long term statistics of atmospheric water resource meteorology mainly focuses on meso scale atmospheric processes with timescales varying from days to weeks in contrast hydrologists concern about processes with timescales ranging from hours to hundreds of years since we suggested the concept of sky rivers as a generalization of a variety of meteorological processes by virtue of characteristic surfaces which are well defined and extensively studied in fluid mechanics we are permitted to study both short term meteorology events and long term statistics of atmospheric water resource universally with theory approach and models well developed in fluid mechanics 3 the study helps us to analyze the long term coupling of the atmospheric water resource and surface runoff identifying the sky rivers especially their statistical distribution in the atmosphere gives us a picture that which part of the atmospheric water is closely associated with surface runoff this is key to develop a novel strategy in developing atmospheric water resources by joint management of atmospheric and surface water resources the best way to bring the air water resource into the water resources configuration systems acknowledgements this research is supported by the joint sponsored state key laboratory of plateau ecology and agriculture qinghai

1700,presented in this paper is an introduction to the study on sky rivers especially the concept theory and implications a sky river is in essence a generalization for a rich variety of meteorological systems including tropical cyclones extratropical frontal cyclones shear lines and others from the viewpoint of fluid mechanics all these meteorological systems share a common feature that there exists a contacting surface between two air masses with contrasting velocities temperatures humidity and pressures under the forces caused by large gradients of state variables normal to the contacting surfaces and other forces concentrated water vapor flows along paths on the contacting surfaces like river channels on earth surface characterized by cloud and precipitation processes along the paths a simplified and direct approach to identify the sky rivers is proposed on the basis of their physical interpretation results show that the sky rivers globally exist and have close relations with precipitation in mathematics the sky rivers are the discontinuity surfaces of the governing equations for atmospheric flows and they are formulated in this study as the characteristic surfaces where the characteristic values are real and the derivatives normal to the surface do not exist by means of general theory for partial differential equations to provide a description for time space evolution of the sky rivers finally future study areas regarding the sky rivers are discussed keywords sky river atmospheric water water cycle characteristic surface 1 introduction water affects every aspect of life on earth development utilization and protection of water resources have long been the central tasks of human societies however shortage of fresh water is a serious natural and social problem according to the report by world resources institute luo et al 2015 currently 33 countries of the world are facing extremely high water stress and this number will be expanded to as much as 59 in 2040 in china water issues are even more complicated the country is now suffering from severe water shortage with the 28 of the world average per capita availability of water resources and 75 of the world average per capita annual consumption of water resources to feed 1 5 of the world s population meanwhile the traditional water management techniques now almost reach their upper limits for example more than 85 000 reservoirs have been completed in china since the 1950s yu 2011 particularly in the basin of the yellow river the total reservoir capacity exceeds annual runoff xia et al 2014 therefore seeking new measures to alleviate water stress is of significance for the countries suffered from severe shortage of water resources development of atmospheric water resources may be a potential solution since 1950s numerous studies and experiments of cloud water utilization have been conducted in china and the rest of the world to alleviate drought issues but it is far from efficient for instance the total incoming water vapor of china is close to 20 trillion m3 per year cai 2008 approximately 4 times of average annual rainfall while the increment of water resources by cloud water utilization is only about 50 billion m3 national development and reform commission china meteorological administration 2014 in the current practice atmospheric water resources are still classified as unconventional water resources and cannot be fully brought into the water resources management systems and thus resulting in the failure of coupling with conventional surface water resources to achieve a comprehensive development of atmosphere surface water resource therefore what are the key factors that lead to the difficulty in exploiting atmospheric water resources in addition to developing efficient cloud seeding techniques it is necessary to recognize that there still exist several theoretical issues that are not completely resolved in the utilization of atmospheric water for instance as a type of natural water materials what makes atmospheric water as a resource must be well defined however the stochastic feature of cloud and precipitation processes causes difficulties in providing a reasonable definition of atmospheric water resources it seems like a meteorological or hydrological issue but actually beyond that first it is necessary to understand which part of atmospheric water could be potentially transformed into surface water and then analyze its temporal and spatial variation here our primary interest is not only on short term processes such as synoptic processes but also on the long term i e usually on a century scale evolution dynamics spanning the life cycles of water resource configuration infrastructure second as a natural resource like others the ownership of atmospheric water resource must be well clarified for this purpose we have to figure out whether there exists a concept of basin in the atmospheric water resources and if so where is the basin how do atmospheric water flow between the basins obviously these two problems make the atmospheric water resources development no longer a simple meteorological issue numerous studies have been conducted regarding the mechanisms of atmospheric water vapor transport see the comprehensive review by gimeno et al 2014 and have achieved great progress especially since the concept of atmospheric rivers ars was raised zhu and newell 1998 most studies focused on the meteorological processes related to the occurrence of ars a few works are devoted to exploring the role of ars in extreme events extreme precipitation and flood indeed studies on ars may help shed light on the transport of atmospheric water however as explained before it is still insufficient to have a full picture of long term cycle of the atmospheric water resource within this context we proposed a concept of sky river in 2015 wang et al 2016 to explain how the atmospheric water could be utilized presented in this paper is a follow up work reported by wang et al 2016 in this paper we begin with the description of the concept of the sky rivers section 2 in section 3 a simple method to identify the global sky rivers is proposed followed by a case study of the extreme precipitation event occurred in beijing on july 21 2012 to illustrate the relationship between the sky rivers and precipitation then mathematical formulation of the sky rivers is given in section 4 to describe the dynamics of the sky rivers and the simplified equations are also given to describe the major features of the governing equations of the sky rivers finally a short summary of this paper and the future study as well as its implications are presented in section 5 2 concept of sky river it is no doubt that state of the art research concerning each of the meteorological phenomena is highly valuable in weather forecasting additional to its scientific importance in understanding the nature we live on however when we consider the cloud and precipitation processes from the angle of global water cycle using the principles of fluid mechanics our immediate concern is not only on the details of the phenomena but also on their general behaviors and underlying mechanisms as well if we take a more careful examination into the mechanisms related to cloud processes and possible precipitation as the results of tropical cyclones extratropical cyclones or frontal cyclones and gust fronts in deep convections regardless of the differences in their names their occurrence frequencies and their temporal and spatial scales we may learn from the descriptions in text books of meteorology that they all are marked by a most common feature that is all of them are closely related to the contacts of air masses within the fields of density velocity temperature pressure and humidity different from each other wallace and hobbs 2006 barry and chorley 2009 furthermore in every case when two different air masses meet each other in the atmospheric flows the ascending of the warm and moist air mass usually causes water vapor to condense and results in a variety of types of clouds and possible rainfalls for instance extratropical fronts or frontal cyclones are typical synoptic phenomena in atmospheric flows due to the contact of two air masses with different temperature velocity pressure and humidity baroclinic instability leads to ageostrophic vertical circulation and accompanied updraft of warm air at frontal zones meanwhile the airflows there are affected considerably by the temperature gradient and thus geostrophic wind is significantly changed by the wind shear due to thermal wind resulting in concentrated water vapor flows along the lines of fronts toward the lows which are usually referred to as prefrontal low level jets fllj carbone 1982 with nearly saturated air flows accompanied by heavy rainfalls bao et al 2006 cordeira et al 2013 tropical cyclone is another example of which high rate of evaporation occurs in the vicinity of the eyewall then warm and moist air ascends to meet ambient cooler air which is also the key mechanism to develop intense storms anthes 2016 the rise and sink of air at the eyewall and eye of a tropical cyclone can also be treated as a contacting system of different air masses therefore it can be concluded that typical phenomena regarding cloud and precipitation processes result from the contacts of different air masses no matter they are found in tropical cyclones extratropical frontal cyclones and shear lines among many others in other words the contacting surface separating two different air masses in the atmospheric flows is in essence the region where water vapor changes into cloud droplets possibly leading to rainfalls for this reason from a viewpoint of hydrology the contacting surfaces between different air masses and the processes occurring there are exactly our study of interest in the water cycle usually the contacting surfaces exhibit as narrow cloud or rain bands along which intensive transport of atmospheric water are found behaving in a similar manner as river channels on the surface of the earth for this reason we termed the contacting surfaces as the sky rivers by this definition it is inferred that the atmospheric water flowing in the sky rivers has high potential to reach the surface of the ground through precipitation 3 identification and spatial distribution of sky rivers 3 1 identification of sky rivers according to the physical nature of the sky rivers they are formed through the contact between air masses with different velocity pressure temperature and humidity based on the knowledge of fluid mechanics fluids in different states especially those with different densities and temperatures contact each other to form a discontinuity at the contacting interface with the lighter and warmer fluids uplifted under steady state conditions the continuous equation of atmospheric water mainly water vapor can be written as 1 α w 1 α w 0 z 0 z 1 α u x α v y d z where u and v is the horizontal wind component w1 and w0 is the vertical wind component at z1 and z0 and α is the specific humidity from eq 1 when α u x α v y 0 it implies that convergence of the flow occurs and atmospheric water within z0 z1 is more likely to be uplifted i e α w 1 α w 0 0 therefore from a viewpoint of fluid mechanics updraft is always linked to the convergence in a given flow filed consequently a succinct way to find the discontinuity surfaces or the sky rivers is to analyze the convergence in the flow field in fact analysis on the convergence of the flow fields is also a common method in meteorology to diagnose precipitations simmonds et al 1999 banacos and schultz 2005 lavers et al 2014 when considering the distribution of the sky rivers in a large scale it is advisable to analyze vertically integrated atmospheric water transport flux and identify the convergence lines in the atmospheric flows which is given by 2 q 1 g p s 0 α u d p where q is the vertically integrated horizontal atmospheric water transport flux p is the pressure and ps is the surface pressure and u is the horizontal wind vector from helmholtz s theorem of fluid mechanics q can be decomposed into the rotational divergence free field and divergent vorticity free field chen 1985 wu et al 1993 that is 3 q h ϕ k h ψ where k is the unit vector normal to the earth surface ϕ is the potential function ψ is the stream function and h x y is the gradient operator applying the divergence operator on the both sides of eq 3 one can obtain 4 h 2 ϕ h q combining eq 4 with the conservation equation of atmospheric water within a column which has a unit bottom area i e 5 w t h q p e where w is the atmospheric water mass within the air column p and e denotes precipitation and evaporation respectively we write 6 w t h 2 ϕ p e here w t can be neglected because it is usually much smaller than the other terms in eq 6 when large scale processes are concerned eq 6 implies that the potential function ϕ i e the divergent field of atmospheric water transport flux is closely related to the variability in atmospheric water mass precipitation and evaporation if h q 0 i e atmospheric water converges the potential function ϕ reaches minimum value with p e if h q 0 i e atmospheric water is in divergence the potential function ϕ reaches maximum value with p e as has been defined earlier a sky river is the region where atmospheric flows converge and thus this feature indicates that the sky rivers as convergence lines on a certain pressure level match with troughs of corresponding potential function at that level in the present study we treat the potential ϕ x y as the topography of the sky rivers just as the surface topography for the ordinary surface rivers this allows us to identify the sky rivers using the same algorithms to extract surface rivers with the spatial distribution of sky river channels as well as their basins determined accordingly 3 2 global distribution of sky rivers with the use of the method described in subsection 3 1 the sky rivers in the range of global scale are identified day by day from january 1 1979 to december 31 2016 based on the era interim reanalysis data dee et al 2011 specifically the vertically integrated horizontal water vapor flux data from the era interim dataset is initially decomposed into the rotational field k h ψ and divergent field h ϕ and then the troughs of ϕ are extracted by using the ordinary watershed channel extraction algorithm as a result fig 1 shows the global distribution of the sky river system on july 21 2012 in which one can find several obvious branches over the west and south asia the indian ocean region and the west pacific by counting the occurrence times of the sky rivers on each grid point global geographic grid with spatial resolution of 0 75 degree year by year we obtain the average annual occurrence frequency of the sky rivers for a comparatively long period shown in fig 2 the result suggests that there is a high frequency zone coinciding with the itcz intertropical convergence zone around the equatorial region mainly the equatorial pacific with the average occurrence frequency range from 30 to 50 days per annum over the northern india and tibetan plateau of china the average occurrence frequency of the sky rivers is between 40 and 50 days per annum on the northern shore of the pacific ocean and the south polar regions the frequency varies from 20 to 30 days per annum moreover the highest frequency appears in southwest china central sichuan and southern tibet with more than 60 days per annum 3 3 relationship between sky river and precipitation fig 3 shows the annual mean precipitation rate 1983 2016 as can be seen from the results presented in figs 2 and 3 the global mean distribution of the sky rivers is remarkably similar to precipitation moreover the sky rivers also have a close relation with the specific precipitation events as an example meteorological records show from 10 00 a m on july 21st 2012 to 02 00 a m on 22nd beijing experienced the strongest precipitation event fig 4 since august 8 1963 numerous studies from the perspective of meteorology were conducted to analyze this extreme precipitation event and in this study we will reexamine this event from the view of the sky rivers to reveal their connection fig 5 shows the distribution of precipitable water at 12 00p m on july 21 2012 it can be seen that significantly higher water vapor content occurs over beijing and southern hebei ranging from 62 1 mm to 70 9 mm meanwhile fig 6 shows the vertically integrated water vapor flux these results in figs 5 and 6 jointly indicate that the water vapor fluxes continuously transport water vapor from the northwestern subtropical high and the south china sea to beijing with the highest intensity as much as 971 7 kg m s the potential function and the corresponding divergent flux can be achieved by performing the helmholtz decomposition of the water vapor flux field fig 7 obviously shows that water vapor flows from the area with high value of the potential function to adjacent area with low value with a significant convergence zone around beijing and thus forming the contacting surfaces namely the sky rivers due to the difference in the density speed pressure temperature and humidity of water vapor masses the sky rivers are located through the method given in section 3 1 and plotted in fig 8 it seems that almost all converging centers of the sky rivers are coinciding with the precipitation centers especially over beijing and also sichuan and guizhou province of china the south china sea the northwestern pacific and the equatorial west pacific also the high precipitation bands seem to be all accompanied by one or more sky rivers as shown in figs 3 and 8 the sky rivers are generally characterized with strong convergence of water vapor flux which usually consists of deep convection shear lines and other synoptic systems all of which have close relationships with precipitation field as a matter of fact these distinct properties attached to the sky rivers are major factors in developing atmospheric water resources 4 mathematical description of sky rivers in the section 3 a simplified method to identify the sky rivers using fundamental principles of fluid mechanics and the global distributions of sky rivers are elaborated in detail however the following questions still remain to be answered 1 what drives the sky rivers 2 what is the underpinning mechanism responsible for the temporal and spatial evolution of the sky rivers 3 can the sky rivers be successfully predicted to achieve this in the following a mathematical description of the sky rivers will be provided to lay a foundation for the theoretical studies of the sky rivers in the future as has been discussed before a sky river can be physically interpreted as a surface that separates the air masses with different temperatures humidity velocities and pressures in atmospheric circulations the thickness of a contacting surface between two air masses is much smaller than that of the geometric scales of atmospheric circulations and it can immediately be deduced that there must exist large or even nonexistent gradients of flow fields normal to the contacting surfaces therefore from a perspective of fluid mechanics the physical nature of a sky river is actually a special boundary layer developed by air masses of different dynamical and thermo dynamical states when they meet each other in the troposphere intensive boundary layer flows usually occur as a result of strong gradients associated with state parameters like temperature velocity and humidity so the sky rivers can also be regarded as discontinuities in the atmospheric flow fields at the same time when we view the contacting surface of two different air masses from an angle of mathematics this generalized picture of a sky river permits us to formulate it as a discontinuity in flow fields of the geophysical fluids which propagates as a certain type of waves in the sense of large scale circulations in atmosphere discontinuities in flows and their propagations are classical research work in fluid mechanics whitham 1974 here if considering the discontinuity surfaces from a mathematical point of view especially the characteristic theory for partial differential equations we immediately find that the discontinuity surfaces formed between air masses are exactly the characteristic surfaces with real characteristic values and nonexistent normal derivatives of the governing equations for the atmospheric flows hilber and courant 1989 therefore this generalization allows us to study cloud and precipitation processes in a more general way 4 1 governing equations in the field of meteorological science the atmosphere may be regarded as simple single phase flow or complex multi phase mixing flow indeed single phase flow models were developed to simplify mathematical complexity and reduce computing time and thus are favored in the realm of meteorology and other relevant disciplines including most fundamental theories of the geophysical fluid flows however the atmospheric flows strictly speaking are multi phase mixture commonly composed of dry air water vapor cloud or rain drops or ice flakes therefore the atmospheric flows as one of the representative multi components and multi phase systems are significantly affected by phasic differences phase changes and accompanied mechanical and thermal dynamical processes although simplification of the multiphase flows into simple single phase is helpful in reducing the complexity associated with the most fundamental processes involved in atmospheric flows this will mask some of important and essential features of multiphase flows for this reason we will treat atmospheric flows using multiphase flow model and adopt the continuum theory to explore flows in the sky rivers the continuum theory for multiphase flows is sophisticated and has been employed extensively in studying the flow components with distinctive differences between individual phases as for the atmospheric flows hereinafter we divide the materials within the flow into two categories namely 1 fluid phase and 2 particulate phase the former is composed of water vapor and air while the latter comprises liquid drops and solid particles for a general description of multiphase flows the density velocity pressure and energy of each phase are necessary parameters to depict the flows and symbolically expressed as ρ k u k p k and e k where subscript k stands for total energy of the phase then the governing equations for the multiphase flows can be given in a general form as follows drew and passman 1999 7 a k u k t b k x u k f k where u k ρ k u k p k e k a k and b k b kx b ky b kz are coefficients x x y z is the gradient operator a k is presumably invertible without loss generality f k is the source term and the jacob matrix f k u k is implicitly assumed to exist and be invertible in eq 7 it follows a common assumption in the study of large scale processes within atmospheric circulations by including the diffusion in the source term the source term in eq 7 is also a function of the state variable u k which usually represents an impulse on the system at time t this is true when the source term f k in a time scale much smaller than other terms however as far as the multiphase geophysical fluids flows are considered the physical processes included in the source term are usually responsible for large scale circulations and impose long term memory effects on flows for instance the rotation effect or conventionally referred to as coriolis effect is the key factor that participates in the formation of the rossby waves holton and hakim 2012 also phase changes for example condensation of water vapor may release large amount of latent heat during a storm and affect behavior of the system in order to explicitly take into account the memory effects of source term on flows the following manipulations of the original equation is carried out firstly we differentiate eq 7 with respect to the time t such that 8 a k 2 u k t 2 b k x u k t f k t a k t u k t b k t x u k subsequently differentiating eq 7 with respect to the space leads to 9 a k x u k t b k x 2 u k x f k x a k u k t x b k x u k combining eqs 8 and 9 yields 10 u k t c k x u k j k 1 2 t 2 e k x 2 u k n k where c k j k 1 e k j k j k a k 1 u k f k e k a k 1 b k and the nonlinear term is given by 11 n j k 1 a k 1 a k t u k t b k t x u k j k 1 a k 1 b k a k x a k u k t x b k x u k clearly the simple manipulation of the original equations for multiphase flows results in a set of second order partial equations with the derivative of the source term newly introduced into the equations as permits eq 10 to account for the memory effects arising from the source term 4 2 governing equations for sky rivers the characteristic surface for a partial differential system is defined as a super surface normal to which the derivatives of the state variables do not exist hilber and courant 1989 this feature coincides with the mathematical idealization of the sky rivers i e the contacting surface with extremely large gradients in flow fields formed by two different air masses therefore a sounded mathematical description of sky rivers can immediately be formulated once the characteristic surfaces in atmospheric flows are identified in order to make the definition of the sky rivers have a clear physical interpretation it should be noted that in the following sections the focus is solely on the characteristic surfaces with real characteristic values assume φ φ x t is the contacting surface of two different air masses in the atmospheric flows and by the transform of t φ t φ and x x φ φ the equation for atmospheric flows is thus written as 12 c φ φ u k e φ φ 2 u k n φ where 13 c φ φ t c k x φ 14 e φ j k 1 φ t 2 e k x φ 2 and φ u k represents the differentiation normal to the characteristic surface of φ φ x t it implies that flows on the contacting surfaces are mainly dominated by two distinct processes the first process is described by a first order derivative which behaves as wave propagating normal to the boundary layer at the velocity c φ the second is given by a second order derivative which behaves as diffusion normal to the boundary layer with the viscosity of e φ as have been mentioned earlier if our attention is restricted to large scale flows in the atmosphere i e the dimension of flows measured at the magnitude much larger than the thickness of the boundary layer developed by two contacting atmosphere masses in distinct states then the diffusion term can be reasonably ignored in this context the contacting surface is a characteristic surface and thus the derivatives normal to the surface do not exist as leads to that hilber and courant 1989 15 f φ t x φ c φ φ t c k x φ 0 eq 15 is the characteristic function of eq 10 which essentially defines the characteristic surfaces evolving with time and space apparently f φ t x φ is a first order differential equation following the characteristic approach for the first order partial differential equations we found that hilber and courant 1989 16 d x d t f n d n d t f x n f φ d φ d t n f n where n x φ eq 15 along with eq 16 gives a systematic description of temporal and spatial evolution of the sky rivers based on the characteristic theory for the partial differential equations one may realize that the sky rivers are in fact a type of waves in the atmospheric flows it is necessary to emphasize again that the foregoing flows in the sky rivers are a special type of boundary layer flows in nature which can be described by the following way when tracking along the waves given by eq 15 i e expanding the high order term on the right hand of eq 10 at the wave front we can let whitham 1974 17 t c k x on the right hand side of eq 10 and then at the wave front we had that 18 u k t c k x u k d k x 2 u k n k where the diffusion operator on the right hand side of eq 18 is defined as 19 d k x 2 j k 1 c k x 2 e k x 2 eq 18 is the governing equation for the boundary layer flows on the characteristic surfaces i e the sky rivers which is a general version of convection diffusion equation we see that the convection is apparently influenced by phase changes from the definition of c k j k 1 e k j k while the diffusion is due to the propagation of the high order waves in relative to the convection 4 3 shallow water model for sky rivers in order to give a more direct mathematical description of the sky rivers eqs 15 and 18 a shallow water model for atmospheric flows is adopted to illustrate the mechanism involved in the sky rivers since we focus mainly the transport of water vapor in the atmospheric flows our analysis will start with the equation of mass conservation of the water vapor in the atmosphere as follows 20 α h t h α h u α 0 where h is the depth of the atmosphere uα is the velocity of water vapor in the shallow water model for the atmospheric flows the equation of momentum conservation for the water vapor with the effect of phase change on momentum transfer neglected can be written as 21 α h u α t h α h u α u α α g h 1 2 h 2 α h f k u α 0 where f is the coriolis coefficient and g is the gravitational acceleration eqs 20 and 21 can be transformed to matrix form similar to eq 18 when we denoted u h u α v α t f ω f v α f u α t of which ω α 1 h d α d t is the rate of phase change consequently the convection and diffusion operator are given respectively as c α h u α g ω v f g ω u ω v f ω h f 2 h g ω v 2 f ω h 0 u α 0 g ω h f g ω u f u α g ω v f x 22 v α g ω u f f 2 h g ω u 2 f ω h g ω u ω v f ω h g ω h f v α g ω u f g ω v f 0 0 v α y and d α h 2 g 2 u α ω h 2 ω u m 1 f 2 ω h 2 gh ω h 2 ω u 2 u α ω h g 1 g ω u f 2 h ω v h 1 f 2 ω h 2 g ω h ω u l 1 g 2 h 1 f 2 ω h 2 g 2 u α ω h g ω u f 2 g h ω h 2 u α ω u f 2 g l 1 f 2 g 2 f u α g ω v f 2 g f h ω h g ω u ω v f 2 ω h g g 2 f 2 ω h 2 x 2 23 g 2 v α ω h 2 ω v m 1 f 2 ω h 2 g ω h ω v l 2 g 1 h 2 f 2 ω h 2 gh ω h 2 ω v 2 v α ω h g 2 g ω v f 2 h

g 2 f 2 h g ω v 2 h 1 2 f u α g ω v h 2 2 f v α g ω u 24 l 1 f h 2 u α ω v l 2 f h 2 v α ω u with ω h ω h ω u ω u α and ω v ω v α for the sake of simplicity the terms of the cross derivative with respect to x and y in the diffusion operator can be neglected accordingly the characteristic form of the system is given by 25 f φ t x φ φ t c α h φ φ t u α φ x v α φ y φ t u α φ x v α φ y 2 g h φ x 2 φ y 2 it shows that in the application of the shallow water model for atmospheric flows the characteristic surfaces are degenerated into characteristic lines furthermore according to characteristic theory for partial differential equations the disturbances propagate as a monge cone at a speed of gh hilber and courant 1989 which implies that the sky rivers are a special class of gravitational waves when the shallow water model for atmospheric flows is adopted moreover the characteristic surfaces i e the sky rivers can be either dissipated or be amplified depending on the diffusion operator d α h 2 j α 1 c α h 2 e α h 2 as a consequence of the special dynamics of the boundary layer flows on the characteristic surface see eqs 18 and 23 of which the diffusion operator is a complex result of convection and forcing due to phase change if d α h 2 is positively defined then sky rivers tend to be dissipated along the paths they propagate in contrary if d α h 2 is negatively defined the waves as the characteristic surfaces are more likely to be enhanced and the sky rivers become intensified this can be regarded as the criterion that disturbances in the atmospheric flows develop into the sky rivers by means of gravitational waves for instance considering an idealized case with the flow field assumed to be stationary i e u α 0 and with the nonlinear term neglected then the governing equation for boundary layer flows is simply reduced to 26 h t c α h h d α h 2 h where h is the disturbance on the depth of atmosphere and 27 c α h g ω v f x g ω u f y 28 d α h 2 g 2 f ω u ω v ω h ω u 2 ω v 2 f 2 ω h 2 2 x 2 2 y 2 eq 26 gives the evolution of the disturbance on the height of atmosphere purely due to phase change and coriolis effect it is interesting to deduce from eq 28 that the disturbance of h is to be diffused in one direction while inversely diffused in its perpendicular direction as implies that a point disturbance is to be developed into a strip finally this is one of the main reasons for the development of the sky rivers the inverse diffusion collects mass from one direction while its counterpart diffuses mass perpendicularly to form stripes given the complexity in solving the governing equations of sky rivers it should be admitted that the theory described in this section remains to be investigated and improved in the future for the purpose to fully describe the behaviors of sky rivers as a result an alternative method given in section 3 to locate sky rivers should be considered nevertheless both the simplified locating method and well formulated theory are developed on the basis of the discontinuity nature of sky rivers it is believed that the distribution of sky rivers found in section 3 can be fully explained by the mechanism covered in this section following insightful research in the future 5 conclusions and implications although water existing in the atmosphere of the earth occupies about 0 1 of the total water in the hydrosphere of the earth it plays an extremely important role in water cycle as a key linkage of water in the oceans and the land with the largest exchange rates in the earth system therefore studies with respect to atmospheric water have long been one of the central topics in hydrology this study is expected to provide us with a different perspective of atmospheric water transport and correlated precipitation from the angle of general theory of fluid mechanics based on the general formulation of the sky rivers reported in this study though details with respect to the dynamics of the sky rivers are not fully recovered the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the sky rivers discussed in this paper have the physical essence that they are contacting surfaces of air masses with different states the flows in the sky rivers are a special type of boundary layer flows due to large gradients of state variables normal to the contacting surfaces the physical and mathematical generalization of water vapor transport made in this paper permit us to view the transport of water materials in the atmosphere in a universal way which is well developed in fluid mechanics 2 a simple but efficient way to identify the sky rivers is proposed based on general principles of fluid mechanics a general conclusion drawn in fluid mechanics is that the relatively lighter one ascends along the contacting surfaces accompanied by convergence of flows when two air masses with different dynamic and thermo dynamics states meet together using this conclusion we proposed a simple approach to identify the sky rivers it shows that the sky rivers identified in this study coincide with the main rain bands which is concerned in the study of water cycle and development of atmospheric water resource 3 by invoking characteristic theory for partial differential equations the governing equations for the sky rivers are derived which show that the sky rivers are a type of waves in the atmospheric flows with the help of a simple shallow water model for atmospheric circulations it is found that there exists an inverse diffusion perpendicular to the normal diffusion which can lead a point disturbance develops to a strip one of the major mechanisms responsible for the development of the sky rivers although the meteorological phenomena mentioned in this paper are familiar to meteorologist and hydrologist the study presented in this paper implies that 1 the study helps us to have a new vision to study the water cycle according to the nature of the sky rivers defined in this paper we find that water vapor flowing in the sky rivers is the atmospheric water that most likely to precipitate onto the earth surface moreover the physical generalization that the sky rivers as the contacting surfaces of different air masses enables us to describe the sky rivers by means of well established characteristic theory for partial different equation therefore this study is expected to provide us a fundamental tool to view the cloud processes and precipitation in a new angle although details with respect to the sky rivers provided by eqs 15 16 and 18 wait for further studies in the future 2 the study helps us to investigate long term statistics of atmospheric water resource meteorology mainly focuses on meso scale atmospheric processes with timescales varying from days to weeks in contrast hydrologists concern about processes with timescales ranging from hours to hundreds of years since we suggested the concept of sky rivers as a generalization of a variety of meteorological processes by virtue of characteristic surfaces which are well defined and extensively studied in fluid mechanics we are permitted to study both short term meteorology events and long term statistics of atmospheric water resource universally with theory approach and models well developed in fluid mechanics 3 the study helps us to analyze the long term coupling of the atmospheric water resource and surface runoff identifying the sky rivers especially their statistical distribution in the atmosphere gives us a picture that which part of the atmospheric water is closely associated with surface runoff this is key to develop a novel strategy in developing atmospheric water resources by joint management of atmospheric and surface water resources the best way to bring the air water resource into the water resources configuration systems acknowledgements this research is supported by the joint sponsored state key laboratory of plateau ecology and agriculture qinghai

1701,quantifying the water flux between surface water sw and groundwater gw bodies is important for determining water balances and understanding controls on surface water quality and sustainable allocation of water resources methods that quantify water exchange at point scales are highly desirable due to the heterogeneous nature of sw gw connectivity porewater radon 222 222rn profiles can be easily collected and variations of 222rn activity within the sediments below sw bodies can be used to infer water flow and residence times the current models used to interpret these profiles assume downward flows limiting their use in gaining or dynamic environments we investigate the use of a new analytical solution based on a finite solution of the advection dispersion equation to predict bi directional water fluxes using 222rn profiles in riverbed sediments we apply this solution to profiles collected from the swan estuary in western australia the estimated fluxes of water from the estuary to groundwater were up to 2 07 m day and fluxes from the groundwater to the estuary were up to 1 79 m day at various times estimates made with a previously applied piston flow model were broadly consistent when predicting fluxes from the estuary to the groundwater however the method was unable to predict fluxes from the groundwater to the estuary as degassing in the surface water meant that all profiles indicated ageing with depth and hence downward flow the reversal of fluxes was predicted for a period of seasonally high groundwater levels our results highlight that not accounting correctly for upward flows can impact predictions of groundwater exchange with surface water bodies such as estuaries this may lead to errors in water and chemical balances in stream lake and estuarine environments and sustainable allocation of freshwater resources between ecosystems and human demands keywords radon 222 analytical solution surface water groundwater interaction data

contaminated surface water infiltrating into the subsurface affects the water quality of aquifers borchardt et al 2004 malaguerra et al 2013 groundwater pumping proximal to rivers or wetlands can reduce the volume of streamflow or result in the drying of surface water bodies e g lakes barlow and leake 2012 gleeson and richter 2018 and the reduction of water levels in streams has negative consequences on ecosystem health within the riparian zone stromberg et al 1996 this can be critical for systems classified as groundwater dependent ecosystems human and environmental impacts affect the quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater resources and understanding their interaction through recharge and discharge of groundwater systems is crucial for holistic and sustainable water management the accurate estimation of recharge and discharge fluxes poses difficulties due to spatial and temporal variability scanlon et al 2002 lowry et al 2007 king et al 2017 recharge and discharge fluxes within the interface of surface water and aquifers are influenced by factors such as the water level elevation of the two water bodies the hydraulic conductivity of bed sediments stream morphology vertical variations of lithology and the hyporheic environment kalbus et al 2009 lateral and vertical heterogeneity of bed sediments influences the flow and transport of solutes and contaminants from streams to aquifers and vice versa conant et al 2004 earon et al 2020 various techniques have been developed to estimate the recharge and discharge of groundwater to surface water bodies at point scales kalbus et al 2006 healy and scanlon 2010 these include heat tracer and seepage meter approaches kalbus et al 2006 data analysis in temperature profiling is complex and inverse solutions are not always unique scanlon et al 2002 furthermore the method is only valid in areas with a significant temperature gradient between groundwater and surface water or a measurable daily oscillation of temperature that penetrates significantly into the subsurface seepage meters produce variable flux results due to effects of rainfall streamflow to the instrument seiches waves erosion around the drum and evapotranspiration processes rosenberry et al 2020 environmental tracers have increasingly been utilised to quantify surface water groundwater exchanges one of them is radon 222 222rn a noble radioactive gas produced by the radioactive decay of 226ra that is present in various groundwater systems cecil and green 2000 surface water has low 222rn concentrations relative to groundwater due to gas loss to the atmosphere especially during turbulent flows and to a lesser extent radioactive decay in the surface water hoehn and von gunten 1989 and high concentrations in the groundwater due to constant production from the parent radioisotope in the sediment an increase in 222rn concentrations in surface water likely indicates the discharge of groundwater close to the measurement point cook et al 2006 radon 222 has been applied to delineate recharge and discharge zones and quantify discharge flux from groundwater to surface water lamontagne and cook 2007 cardenas et al 2010 cartwright et al 2011 mccallum et al 2012 smith et al 2012 frei and gilfedder 2015 pittroff et al 2017 avery et al 2018 xie et al 2016 quantify recharge from rivers to pumping wells hoehn and von gunten 1989 bertin and bourg 1994 close et al 2014 frei and gilfedder 2021 determine residence time and reaction rates in the hyporheic zone pittroff et al 2017 frei et al 2019 gilfedder et al 2019 and estimate groundwater recharge fluxes from rivers to aquifers stellato et al 2013 several calculation methods may be utilised to quantify flux rates between the surface and groundwater using 222rn pore water profiles the residence time estimated from radon activities may be used in conjunction with the depth below the surface water and assumed 1d flow to determine the downward velocity of water hoehn and von gunten 1989 hoehn et al 1992 bertin and bourg 1994 stellato et al 2013 cranswick et al 2014 close et al 2014 the residence time approach assumes a piston flow scenario where an initial 222rn activity is observed at the origin of the flow path and 222rn activity increases along a flow path due to subsurface production before reaching equilibrium due to gas transfer between the surface water and atmosphere 222rn will have lower concentrations in surface water than groundwater liao et al 2021 therefore using the piston flow assumption always suggest exchange is occurring from the surface water to the groundwater further the piston flow assumption neglects dispersion along the flow path in the past a few analytical solutions which include dispersion but rely on the use of infinite boundary conditions have been proposed hoehn et al 1992 the choice of infinite boundary conditions also limits the applicability of the solutions to cases where flow is from the surface water to groundwater numerical models have also been implemented in determining bi directional stream bed fluxes cranswick et al 2014 xie et al 2016 but the relatively simple conditions may be solved faster using analytical solutions allowing for conjunctive use with uncertainty calculation methods the objective of the present study was to develop a novel analytical solution based on the advection dispersion equation with finite boundary conditions to determine bi directional water fluxes between the surface and groundwater using 222rn we utilise the newly developed models to interpret water fluxes using 222rn profiles collected from the swan estuary in western australia we also compare the estimates obtained from the new model with estimates made from an existing piston flow based model and assess their performance 2 theory existing analytical solutions used to interpret fluxes from sediment 222rn profiles are limited in their capacity to predict flow from groundwater to surface water due to their assumptions of advective transport or infinite boundary conditions numerical approaches can handle these two limitations however the boundary conditions utilised are relatively simple and can be implemented analytically allowing for a fast solution here we present two methods for simulating sediment radon concentrations the first is based on an existing piston flow technique and the second utilises the advection dispersion equation and a finite lower boundary a conceptual model of the two solutions is presented in fig 1 the governing advection dispersion equation for the one dimensional transport of 222rn is given as van genuchten and alves 1982 1 d d 2 c dz 2 v dc dz λ c γ 0 where d is the dispersion coefficient m2 day c is the 222rn concentration bq m3 v is the linear velocity m day λ is the decay constant day and γ is the 222rn production rate of sediments bq m3 day below we describe the relationship to existing residence time approaches and present solutions that can represent bi directional flows between surface water and sub surface sediments the determination of the apparent residence time from 222rn can be derived by assuming that the dispersion is neglected flow is constant and water moves through advective piston flow mccallum et al 2015 here we modify eq 1 to consider flow by advection only 2 v dc dz λ c γ 0 we can also introduce the residence time variable τ days like the kinematic age defined by varni and carrera 1998 where 3 τ z 0 dz v applying a change of variables to eq 2 we see that 4 dc d τ λ c γ 0 we can apply the boundary condition of the concentration in the surface water by setting 5 c z 0 c 0 the solution of eq 4 incorporating the surface concentration eq 5 can be solved as 6 c τ c 0 γ λ exp λ τ the residence time can then be determined by rearranging eq 6 this gives 7 τ 1 λ ln c τ γ λ c o γ λ this assumes that as τ increases the concentration approaches an equilibrium of γ λ if c τ is taken from a known depth z then the velocity can be recovered as follows 8 v z τ the darcy flux can then be determined using the following equation 9 q v θ where θ is the porosity of the sediments we note that fluxes may be determined using single measurements in the subsurface and eqs 7 and 8 but the entire profile can be fit utilising eqs 3 and 6 for a profile scale estimate the assumption of the piston flow model is that the concentration increases with distance until it reaches steady state conditions due to the nature of 222rn loss in surface water there will almost always be a gradient between the surface water and sediments whereby concentrations increase in the sediment hence the piston flow assumption will always indicate an increase in age with depth resulting in a predicted downward flux next we derive an analytical solution that considers both advection and dispersion the analytical solution can be obtained using a quadratic solution of an exponential form as 10 c z a 1 exp z 2 d v 4 d λ v 2 a 2 exp z 2 d v 4 d λ v 2 γ λ to define a1 and a2 we need a second boundary condition in addition to eq 5 often this type of boundary condition is described by a zero gradient boundary when applying a negative velocity indicating flux from groundwater to the surface water this would give negative concentrations in the solution for this reason we selected a second fixed concentration boundary for the maximum depth l e g trinchero et al 2019 trinchero and iraola 2020 11 c z l c l we can compute the a1 and a2 with eq 10 to derive 222rn concentration at depth with c0 as the surface water 222rn concentration l as the maximum depth and clas the 222rn concentration of groundwater at the maximum depth 12 a 1 c 0 a 2 γ λ 13 a 2 c l c 0 γ λ exp l 2 d v 4 d λ v 2 γ λ exp l 2 d v 4 d λ v 2 exp l 2 d v 4 d λ v 2 the velocity can be obtained by fitting a measured 222rn concentration profile whilst considering dispersion and production and then used to compute the recharge or discharge flux q implementation of positive and negative velocity is achievable with the given boundary where positive velocity indicates recharge and negative velocity indicates discharge we refer to this approach as the finite advection dispersion fad method 2 1 comparison of solutions here we compare differences between the solutions to understand how they vary the fad solution and the piston flow model can be compared when expressed as dimensionless variables as follows 14 dc dz 1 pe d 2 c d z 2 λ c γ 0 for the model with dispersion and 15 dc dz λ c γ 0 for the advection only model where z z l pe v l d λ λ l v and γ γ l v the solutions to these equations are 16 c z a 7 exp z 1 1 4 λ pe 2 pe a 8 exp z 1 1 4 λ pe 2 pe γ λ for the dispersive solution and 17 c z a 9 exp z λ γ λ for the advective solution for the coefficients implementing the same boundary conditions as the dimensional solutions we arrive at 18 a 7 c 0 a 8 γ λ 19 a 8 c 0 γ λ exp 1 1 4 λ pe 2 pe c l γ λ exp 1 1 4 λ pe 2 pe exp 1 1 4 λ pe 2 pe 20 a 9 c 0 γ λ we can compare the two dimensionless solutions for varying peclet numbers we fix the other dimensionless parameters to be balanced with transport to allow the primary difference between the models to be assessed i e dispersion we note that this comparison can only be achieved for downward flows as the advective model is unable to simulate upward flows poor agreement is observed between the solutions for the scenarios where peclet numbers are less than 10 fig 2 deviation is observed between the solutions particularly near the boundary for pe 10 we see exact agreement between the two solutions for pe 100 peclet numbers in natural groundwater systems tend to be 10 60 chmielarski et al 2022 this suggests that estimates made with the ade and pf models should show agreement particularly away from the lower boundary condition 2 2 model implementation the analytical solutions equations 3 to 13 were programmed in python using the numpy and scipy libraries jones et al 2001 oliphant 2007 calibration and uncertainty analysis were jointly conducted using a markov chain monte carlo mcmc differential evolution with self adaptive randomized subspace sampling dream algorithm after vrugt et al 2009 the mcmc determined the posterior ranges of the flux by maximising the likelihood of the model the likelihood function was defined as follows 21 ln l i k e l i h o o d c o n s t a n t n 1 n meas meas i mod i 2 2 σ i 2 this assumes that the measurement uncertainties σ are normally distributed we note that this does not include errors that may have been encountered due to the sampling methodology the prior parameter distributions are listed in table 1 the upper dirichlet boundary condition stream boundary was set based on the measured 222rn surface water activities the production γ of 222rn in the deeper sediments can be approximated using groundwater steady state concentrations multiplied by the decay rate cook et al 2006 it is likely that measurements in the profile will reflect this steady state concentration in scenarios where flow is upward or occurring downwards at a low rate conversely the equilibrium condition where c γ λ may have not been met and production rates may be underestimated where high downward flow rates are observed at the study site we have considered the maximum observed concentration from radon sediment profiles over the past 8 months to represent steady state for the dispersion coefficient we assume the relationship bear 1988 22 d v α l d where αl is the longitudinal dispersivity m and d is the effective diffusion coefficient m2 day on the scale of the bed transport here values of αl are on the order of 0 01 0 04 m gelhar et al 1992 the effective diffusion coefficient is defined as d m ϛ 2 where dm is the molecular diffusion of 222rn 6 9 10 5 m2 day and ϛ is the tortuosity assumed to be 1 7 we modified d using the predicted velocity and the range of αl the porosity of the sediments was assumed to be medium grain sand consistent with the observed material at the site kasenow 2006 morris johnson 1967 the velocity of the infiltration ranges from 0 to 10 m d 1 with positive and negative ranges to consider the downward flux and upward flux directions depth surface water 222rn concentration and maximum 222rn concentrations at depth were obtained during each sampling survey with a factor of 1 1 applied to the maximum profile depth to extend the profile beyond the deepest measurement point l 1 1zmax recharge and discharge fluxes were derived from eq 9 with the porosity ranges used in the study 3 site description and methods the analytical solution was tested at the swan river estuary in south west australia to determine the applicability of the proposed method fig 3 the swan river is a major drainage system in metropolitan perth western australia with 124 000 km2 catchment area and an average rainfall of 730 mm yr 1 bureau of meteorology 2019 major tributary that contributes to the swan river in the study areas is the canning river the swan river is an estuary environment that is influenced by the tidal water inflow from the indian ocean with marine waters reaching up to 45 km from the coastline during a low flow during the summer season smith and turner 2001 the study site is located west of the perth city centre with the pore water profile measurement point approximately 11 5 m from the north riverbank and at the outer bend of the meandering swan river 31 97774 south 115 82147 east the site was relatively close to the bank given the width of the river at this location the riverbed deposits at the survey site are composed of yellow medium sand grains the nearest borehole with lithological data within the swan river riparian zone site of groundwater level fig 3 is located 40 m from the riverbank and the profile had 3 m 0 3 m of yellow sand and 11 m of brown clay 3 14 m from the ground level dwer 2020 the alluvial aquifer in the swan river overlies the shale and sandstone osborne formation davidson 1995 previous studies suggest that groundwater discharge to swan river is highest on the outside of river meanders with a hydraulic gradient higher than the inner meander linderfelt and turner 2001 smith and turner 2001 bed sediment sampling was carried out using a mini drive point piezometer with a screen length of 5 cm at different depths in the subsurface depths were determined from the mid point of the screen samples were only collected from a single point i e spatial variability was not considered a low flow peristaltic pump was used to extract approximately 1 l of groundwater from the subsurface the surface water and groundwater samples were analysed using a durridge rad 7 durridge sheffield united kingdom with a rad 7 wat feature to determine the 222rn concentration the rad 7 protocol utilised one five minute bubbling period followed by four five minute counting periods 4 results large variability was observed between the radon profiles over the monitored one year period fig 4 radon 222 activities are generally lowest at the surface with concentrations increasing with depth and a combination of linear e g fig 4a convex downward e g fig 4g and convex upward e g 4e patterns observed in the 222rn data two further profiles fig 4h and j show low radon activities near the surface before demonstrating a step change in the deeper profile notably measurement uncertainty appeared to be greater for higher concentrations observed deeper in the profiles increasing errors also lead to some ambiguity in observable trends with depth fits to the data using all three models favour samples with a lower measurement error as these produce a higher overall likelihood eq 25 the fits of the two models show agreement with each other particularly with the shallow data in cases where linear or convex downward trends are observed e g fig 4a b g h and i rmse values in table 2 it is notable that the fit of the piston flow model covers a wider range than that of the ade and two zone models conversely fits to data where convex upward patterns are observed vary between the two models this is particularly evident in fig 4c f and for differences in the rmse values in these profiles table 2 the predicted fluxes for the advection dispersion model vary between 1 79 m day on august 7th to 2 07 m day on august 13th compared to a range of 0 03 m day august 21st to 1 72 m day on august 7th for the piston flow model table 2 fig 5 the piston flow model is unable to predict downward flows due to the boundary conditions imposed and the assumptions of the method this is particularly evident for the period between july 25th and august 7th where the ade model predicts upward flows this demonstrates the limitations of the piston method for estimating fluxes in gaining or dynamic systems the uncertainty of the predicted fluxes is similar for the two methods except for times when the advection dispersion model predicts upward flow fig 5 in three of these cases fig 5c e the piston flow model predicts a narrow range of fluxes close to zero interestingly for the sample collected on the afternoon of august 7th the three predicted fluxes show higher uncertainty but different ranges fig 5f the ade model predicts a bimodal distribution of fluxes as the dispersion is simulated proportionally to the absolute velocity eq 26 it is likely that the flow magnitude increases the fit to the profile conversely the advection model predicts a wide range of downward fluxes six of the predicted fluxes show close agreement in flux direction flux magnitude and error of the prediction between the piston flow and advection dispersion models fig 6 the most notable discrepancies between the piston flow and advection dispersion models are observed at times when the ade model predicts upward flows in three of the four cases the piston flow model predicts flows close to zero the exception to this is for the profile collected in the afternoon of august 7th here the piston flow model predicted the maximum downward flow rate all four points show discrepancies between the fits of the two models fig 4c f highlighting that the piston flow model is unable to match the convex upward shape of the profile the piston flow model demonstrated that flux estimates are sensitive to the production rate of 222rn in the sediments in addition to the two parameters directly related to the flux calculation fig 7 this contrasts with the advective dispersive model it is also of note that although only downward fluxes can be predicted the direction of the correlation changes between the two profiles this indicates that the shape of the profile plays a role in how this parameter is estimated the correlation of the model parameters shows that fluxes predicted with the ade model are sensitive to the porosity and velocity this is expected when considering eq 7 as the darcy flow is linearly proportional to the two quantities fig 7 interestingly the downward flux prediction from february 13th shows that the predicted flux is correlated to the upper boundary condition conversely the profile representative of upward flow conditions collected on august 7th shows a correlation with the lower boundary condition this is expected as the boundary in the direction flow originates will have a strong influence on the profile we observe that these quantities are also correlated to the velocity which is directly used in the flux estimate these observations are not unexpected but do highlight the need for choosing appropriate ranges for these parameters often the surface water concentration can be measured directly however care should be taken when determining the lower boundary conditions the model selection is significant for the result interpretation and flux predictions the largest variation between models in the predicted fluxes was observed in early august fig 8 this coincides with the end of winter corresponding to a time at the end of winter when groundwater levels are highest fig 8b if interpretations are made utilising the piston flow model it may be concluded that the swan estuary recharges groundwater when groundwater levels are at their highest elevation however when considering the propensity for upward flow to occur with the newly proposed ade model we observe that periods where groundwater levels are high result in predictions that groundwater discharges to the swan estuary variations due to tidal forcing were observed for the days where profiles were collected at different times in addition to the seasonal gradient on july 25th the morning profile was collected during high tide and the afternoon as the tide was falling fig 8b the tide fluctuated approximately 0 4 m during the day fig 8b both profiles recorded similar magnitudes and direction of flux conversely profiles collected on the 7th of august show large changes between the morning profile collected while the tide was rising and the afternoon collected while the tide was falling fig 8b the magnitude of the daily fluctuation was 0 6 m fig 8b the fad model demonstrated a reduction in the flux magnitude after the high tide fig 8a further results obtained on august 21st show that flows were slightly downward in the morning during a rising tide and upward in the afternoon during a falling tide corresponding to a daily fluctuation of 0 4 m fig 8b however under the low fluxes predicted the profiles on this day may not have flushed between the two measurement times these results suggest that the exchange between the surface water and groundwater is controlled both by regional groundwater levels and tidal responses 5 discussion in the present study we proposed a new advection dispersion model and compared it with a previously used piston flow model for predicting point scale exchanges between surface and groundwater using 222rn depth profiles we showed that both upward and downward fluxes can be predicted with the advection dispersion models whereas the piston flow model was only able to predict downward fluxes this was confirmed by results from our field example for profiles collected at the end of winter when groundwater levels were high where the new model predicted groundwater discharge to the estuary conversely the piston flow model showed low rates of loss from the estuary over the same period the prediction of downward fluxes was broadly consistent between the methods as suggested by the findings of cranswick et al 2014 and demonstrated in the present study based on the expected peclet numbers of natural systems however the main contribution of the proposed models is their capacity to predict upward fluxes which had not been considered previously with analytical solutions other methods used for determination of the exchange of water between sediments using 222rn have been proposed for example the radon deficit model can be utilised to assess the net exchanges of 222rn martin et al 2007 cable and martin 2008 the net exchange can be ascertained if the profile is integrated to the point at which equilibrium concentrations are reached in our examples this point was not reached and hence the flux would have been underestimated additionally this flux captures both an advective and dispersive flux given that the dispersive flux would be driven largely by the high gradients between surface and groundwaters the fluxes obtained through this modelling procedure may be limited when inferring water fluxes or fluxes of compounds with differing concentration gradients therefore this model would not be optimal in the studied case further models may consider cycling both upward and downward fluxes within sediments to understand the cycling of water salt and nutrients rather than just water fluxes cook et al 2018 however the primary objective of this method was to determine darcy fluxes between the surface and groundwater the models implemented assume that the profiles are steady state and the flow is one dimensional the hydraulic transition of the profiles is quite fast due to the short distances and the relatively small storage coefficient of the saturated sediments the solute profile will be controlled by the two dimensionless parameters γ and λ the first describes the ratio between production and flushing and the second describes the ratio between decay and flushing the primary constraint is that at low velocities the profile will be dependent on the time scales of decay or production to re establish after a hydraulic change chmielarski et al 2022 very low fluxes were observed for profiles collected in late august which may have prevented the profiles from rapid re equilibration this was reflected in the low variation in radon concentration between samples a second issue is the variation in the surface concentration in our same day profiles the 222rn activity of the estuary at the sampling point varied up to 2 bq l this variation was relatively small compared to the variation within the profile but could be considered in future studies by adding additional error to the surface concentration the one dimensional assumption would require that either flow is primarily vertical or that lateral variations in radon activity are negligible we consider this in appendix a for the case of a pool and riffle sequence our results suggest good agreement between models however this does not represent an exhaustive comparison and the applicability of the 1d assumption is likely to be site specific smith et al 2008 found that the assumption was appropriate in indian river lagoon and that vertical gradients were 5 times higher than horizontal gradients the component of vertical flow will be a function of aquifer thickness surface water body geometry and regional groundwater characteristics further investigation of the appropriateness of this assumption should be tested in future studies the implemented model also assumes uniform dispersion and production rates the variability in the production rate of radon dependents on the presence of 226ra in the sediments this is affected by the mobility of 226ra and the type of sediments peel et al 2022 demonstrated that 222rn production is increased close to the water table when measured on the scale of 10 s of meters this was also observed in lakebed sediments brenner et al 2004 conversely in estuarine settings the mobility of 226ra can be impacted by salinity differences in the water smith et al 2008 demonstrated this in a setting where 226ra activities were lower close to the sediment surface due to changes in salinity impacting the equilibrium with sediments and water changes in redox conditions may also influence the concentration of 226ra lamontagne et al 2018 further enhanced dispersion or non local exchange may occur close to the sediment surface qian et al 2008 smith et al 2008 voermans et al 2018 this would result in a higher flux of water at the surface independent of the processes considered in this model this behaviour in the profile is most evident in profiles collected on the 19th and 21st of june fig 4h j the profiles demonstrate a low activity near the surface with a step increase in radon activity at varying depths these profiles reported low groundwater fluxes which may suggest the enhanced exchange is more prominent when groundwater flows are low however it should be noted that the model will have limited efficacy when the primary processes that dictate the shape of the profile vary from those presented by the developed model the analytical method utilised in the study required approximately 1 l of water to be collected for each sample analysed for radon concentration although a low flow pump was used the volume of water removed from the sediments may have influenced the profiles a method requiring less water may would reduce the potential for profile disturbance e g direct method leaney and herczeg 2006 further we have estimated the radon emanation rates during our fitting procedure all methods showed some degree of correlation between the estimated groundwater flux and this parameter obtaining actual values of this parameter should help to constrain flow estimates we note that due to the sensitivity of 226ra sorption to redox conditions and salinity care should be taken in replicating these conditions in lab emanation studies 6 conclusion we developed a novel analytical solution based on the advection dispersion equation with finite boundary conditions for 222rn transport between surface water and groundwater which can be used to determine water recharge and discharge flux ranges the study showed the possibility of incorporating prior knowledge of parameters by implementing a markov chain monte carlo and likelihood function to assess the uncertainty of recharge estimates the flux direction derived in the analytical solution could account for bi directional flows with maximum predicted flows ranging from 1 79 m day between groundwater and surface water to 2 07 m day between surface and groundwater this was largely dependent on the seasonal groundwater changes which together with tides determined the gradient between the surface and groundwater systems estimates made with the piston flow model were broadly consistent when predicting fluxes from the surface to the groundwater however the piston flow model was unable to predict fluxes from the groundwater to the surface water this is due to the degassing of 222rn in surface water creating large gradients between the surface and groundwater which can generate misleading ages in the presence of upward flow our results show that 222rn profiles may offer insight into water fluxes in gaining losing and dynamic environments such as streams rivers lakes and estuaries credit authorship contribution statement allen june buenavista

comments of two anonymous reviewers whose feedback improved the manuscript appendix a two dimensional flow the method was validated using simulated 222rn profiles which were estimated for an analytical solution of a hyporheic flow field presented in frei et al 2019 the hyporheic flow field for a riffle pool structure fig 9 was represented using the perturbation method zlotnik et al 2015 frei et al 2019 based on measured head variation in the stream as an upper boundary condition kasahara and hill 2006 the riffle structure in total is 4 25 m long and has a homogenous isotropic saturated hydraulic conductivity of ksat 10 m d kasahara and hill 2006 and a porosity of θ 0 35 was used to represent the streambed sediments for the hyporheic flow field 222rn activities were simulated along flow path lines by accounting for advection 222rn enrichment due to emanation and radioactive decay 222rn concentration in the streambed sediments was simulated by assuming a stream 222rn activity of 100 bq m3 and a uniform endmember activity of 10 000 bq m3 at three locations 1 1 93 and 3 m vertical 222rn profiles were extracted and the corresponding vertical darcy flux components in the z direction qz at the streambed interface were estimated from the analytical flow field the three extracted profiles represent conditions for an inflow location with high vertical exchange flux x 1 m qz 0 33 m d inflow conditions with a moderate vertical exchange flux x 1 93 m qz 0 25 m d and outflow conditions with a high exchange flux x 3 m qz 0 39 m d this inversion procedure assumed an error of 10 of the base modelled value the fit to the profile is presented in fig 9b the profiles at 1 0 m and 1 96 m are fit well however the profile from 3 m favours fitting the concentration located at zero depth this honours the relative error between the measurements the vertical fluxes normal to the stream bed for the base model were 0 33 m day 0 25 m day and 0 39 m day for distances of 1 0 1 93 and 3 0 m respectively here we report the median flux value and the range between the 16th and 84th percentile the predicted values from the algorithm were 0 39 m day range 0 26 to 0 51 m day 0 37 m day 0 25 to 0 52 m day and 0 27 m day 1 18 to 0 01 m day for distances of 1 0 1 93 and 3 0 m respectively the direction of flow is predicted correctly for each of the three profiles in all cases the flux estimates fall within the predicted range between the 16th and 84th percentile 
1701,quantifying the water flux between surface water sw and groundwater gw bodies is important for determining water balances and understanding controls on surface water quality and sustainable allocation of water resources methods that quantify water exchange at point scales are highly desirable due to the heterogeneous nature of sw gw connectivity porewater radon 222 222rn profiles can be easily collected and variations of 222rn activity within the sediments below sw bodies can be used to infer water flow and residence times the current models used to interpret these profiles assume downward flows limiting their use in gaining or dynamic environments we investigate the use of a new analytical solution based on a finite solution of the advection dispersion equation to predict bi directional water fluxes using 222rn profiles in riverbed sediments we apply this solution to profiles collected from the swan estuary in western australia the estimated fluxes of water from the estuary to groundwater were up to 2 07 m day and fluxes from the groundwater to the estuary were up to 1 79 m day at various times estimates made with a previously applied piston flow model were broadly consistent when predicting fluxes from the estuary to the groundwater however the method was unable to predict fluxes from the groundwater to the estuary as degassing in the surface water meant that all profiles indicated ageing with depth and hence downward flow the reversal of fluxes was predicted for a period of seasonally high groundwater levels our results highlight that not accounting correctly for upward flows can impact predictions of groundwater exchange with surface water bodies such as estuaries this may lead to errors in water and chemical balances in stream lake and estuarine environments and sustainable allocation of freshwater resources between ecosystems and human demands keywords radon 222 analytical solution surface water groundwater interaction data

the quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater resources and understanding their interaction through recharge and discharge of groundwater systems is crucial for holistic and sustainable water management the accurate estimation of recharge and discharge fluxes poses difficulties due to spatial and temporal variability scanlon et al 2002 lowry et al 2007 king et al 2017 recharge and discharge fluxes within the interface of surface water and aquifers are influenced by factors such as the water level elevation of the two water bodies the hydraulic conductivity of bed sediments

around the drum and evapotranspiration processes rosenberry et al 2020 environmental tracers have increasingly been utilised to quantify surface water groundwater exchanges one of them is radon 222 222rn a noble radioactive gas produced by the radioactive decay of 226ra that is present in various groundwater systems cecil and green 2000 surface water has low 222rn concentrations relative to groundwater due to gas loss to the atmosphere especially during turbulent flows and to a lesser extent radioactive decay in the surface water hoehn and von gunten 1989 and high concentrations in the groundwater due to constant production from the parent radioisotope in the sediment an increase in 222rn concentrations in surface water likely indicates the discharge of groundwater close to the measurement point cook et al 2006 radon 222 has been applied to delineate recharge and discharge zones and quantify discharge flux from groundwater to surface water lamontagne and cook 2007 cardenas et al 2010 cartwright et al 2011 mccallum et al 2012 smith et al 2012 frei and gilfedder 2015 pittroff et al 2017 avery et al 2018 xie et al 2016 quantify recharge from rivers to pumping wells hoehn

2019 and estimate groundwater recharge fluxes from rivers to aquifers stellato et al 2013 several calculation methods may be utilised to quantify flux rates between the surface and groundwater using 222rn pore water profiles the residence time estimated from radon activities may be used in conjunction with the depth below the surface water and assumed 1d flow to determine the downward velocity of water hoehn and von gunten 1989 hoehn et al 1992 bertin and bourg 1994 stellato et al 2013 cranswick et al 2014 close et al 2014 the residence time approach assumes a piston flow scenario where an initial 222rn activity is observed at the origin of the flow path and 222rn activity increases along a flow path due to subsurface production before reaching equilibrium due to gas transfer between the surface water and atmosphere 222rn will have lower concentrations in surface water than groundwater liao et al 2021 therefore using the piston flow assumption always suggest exchange is occurring from the surface water to the groundwater further the piston flow assumption neglects dispersion along the flow path in the past a few analytical solutions which include dispersion but rely on the use of infinite boundary conditions have been proposed hoehn et al 1992 the choice of infinite boundary conditions also limits the applicability of the solutions to cases where flow is from the surface water to groundwater numerical models have also been implemented in determining bi directional stream bed fluxes cranswick et al 2014 xie et al 2016 but the relatively simple conditions may be solved faster using analytical solutions allowing for conjunctive use with uncertainty calculation methods the objective of the present study was to develop a novel analytical solution based on the advection dispersion equation with finite boundary conditions to determine bi directional water fluxes between the surface and groundwater using 222rn we utilise the newly developed models to interpret water fluxes using 222rn profiles collected from the swan estuary in western australia we also compare the estimates obtained from the new model with estimates made from an existing piston flow based model and assess their performance 2 theory existing analytical solutions used to interpret fluxes from sediment 222rn profiles are limited in their capacity to predict flow from groundwater to surface water due to their assumptions of advective transport or infinite boundary conditions numerical approaches can handle these two limitations however the boundary conditions utilised are relatively simple and can be implemented analytically allowing for a fast solution here we present two methods for simulating sediment radon concentrations the first is based on an existing piston flow technique and the second utilises the advection dispersion equation and a finite lower boundary a conceptual model of the two solutions is presented in fig 1 the governing advection dispersion equation for the one dimensional transport of 222rn is given as van genuchten and alves 1982 1 d d 2 c dz 2 v dc dz λ c γ 0 where d is the dispersion coefficient m2 day c is the 222rn concentration bq m3 v is the linear velocity m day λ is the decay constant day and γ is the 222rn production rate of sediments bq m3 day below we describe the relationship to existing residence time approaches and present solutions that can represent bi directional flows between surface water and sub surface sediments the determination of the apparent residence time from 222rn can be derived by assuming that the dispersion is neglected flow is constant and water moves through advective piston flow mccallum et al 2015 here we modify eq 1 to consider flow by advection only 2 v dc dz λ c γ 0 we can also introduce the residence time variable τ days like the kinematic age defined by varni and carrera 1998 where 3 τ z 0 dz v applying a change of variables to eq 2 we see that 4 dc d τ λ c γ 0 we can apply the boundary condition of the concentration in the surface water by setting 5 c z 0 c 0 the solution of eq 4 incorporating the surface concentration eq 5 can be solved as 6 c τ c 0 γ λ exp λ τ the residence time can then be determined by rearranging eq 6 this gives 7 τ 1 λ ln c τ γ λ c o γ λ this assumes that as τ increases the concentration approaches an equilibrium of γ λ if c τ is taken from a known depth z then the velocity can be recovered as follows 8 v z τ the darcy flux can then be determined using the following equation 9 q v θ where θ is the porosity of the sediments we note that fluxes may be determined using single measurements in the subsurface and eqs 7 and 8 but the entire profile can be fit utilising eqs 3 and 6 for a profile scale estimate the assumption of the piston flow model is that the concentration increases with distance until it reaches steady state conditions due to the nature of 222rn loss in surface water there will almost always be a gradient between the surface water and sediments whereby concentrations increase in the sediment hence the piston flow assumption will always indicate an increase in age with depth resulting in a predicted downward flux next we derive an analytical solution that considers both advection and dispersion the analytical solution can be obtained using a quadratic solution of an exponential form as 10 c z a 1 exp z 2 d v 4 d λ v 2 a 2 exp z 2 d v 4 d λ v 2 γ λ to define a1 and a2 we need a second boundary condition in addition to eq 5 often this type of boundary condition is described by a zero gradient boundary when applying a negative velocity indicating flux from groundwater to the surface water this would give negative concentrations in the solution for this reason we selected a second fixed concentration boundary for the maximum depth l e g trinchero et al 2019 trinchero and iraola 2020 11 c z l c l we can compute the a1 and a2 with eq 10 to derive 222rn concentration at depth with c0 as the surface water 222rn concentration l as the maximum depth and clas the 222rn concentration of groundwater at the maximum depth 12 a 1 c 0 a 2 γ λ 13 a 2 c l c 0 γ λ exp l 2 d v 4 d λ v 2 γ λ exp l 2 d v 4 d λ v 2 exp l 2 d v 4 d λ v 2 the velocity can be obtained by fitting a measured 222rn concentration profile whilst considering dispersion and production and then used to compute the recharge or discharge flux q implementation of positive and negative velocity is achievable with the given boundary where positive velocity indicates recharge and negative velocity indicates discharge we refer to this approach as the finite advection dispersion fad method 2 1 comparison of solutions here we compare differences between the solutions to understand how they vary the fad solution and the piston flow model can be compared when expressed as dimensionless variables as follows 14 dc dz 1 pe d 2 c d z 2 λ c γ 0 for the model with dispersion and 15 dc dz λ c γ 0 for the advection only model where z z l pe v l d λ λ l v and γ γ l v the solutions to these equations are 16 c z a 7 exp z 1 1 4 λ pe 2 pe a 8 exp z 1 1 4 λ pe 2 pe γ λ for the dispersive solution and 17 c z a 9 exp z λ γ λ for the advective solution for the coefficients implementing the same boundary conditions as the dimensional solutions we arrive at 18 a 7 c 0 a 8 γ λ 19 a 8 c 0 γ λ exp 1 1 4 λ pe 2 pe c l γ λ exp 1 1 4 λ pe 2 pe exp 1 1 4 λ pe 2 pe 20 a 9 c 0 γ λ we can compare the two dimensionless solutions for varying peclet numbers we fix the other dimensionless parameters to be balanced with transport to allow the primary difference between the models to be assessed i e dispersion we note that this comparison can only be achieved for downward flows as the advective model is unable to simulate upward flows poor agreement is observed between the solutions for the scenarios where peclet numbers are less than 10 fig 2 deviation is observed between the solutions particularly near the boundary for pe 10 we see exact agreement between the two solutions for pe 100 peclet numbers in natural groundwater systems tend to be 10 60 chmielarski et al 2022 this suggests that estimates made with the ade and pf models should show agreement particularly away from the lower boundary condition 2 2 model implementation the analytical solutions equations 3 to 13 were programmed in python using the numpy and scipy libraries jones et al 2001 oliphant 2007 calibration and uncertainty analysis were jointly conducted using a markov chain monte carlo mcmc differential evolution with self adaptive randomized subspace sampling dream algorithm after vrugt et al 2009 the mcmc determined the posterior ranges of the flux by maximising the likelihood of the model the likelihood function was defined as follows 21 ln l i k e l i h o o d c o n s t a n t n 1 n meas meas i mod i 2 2 σ i 2 this assumes that the measurement uncertainties σ are normally distributed we note that this does not include errors that may have been encountered due to the sampling methodology the prior parameter distributions are listed in table 1 the upper dirichlet boundary condition stream boundary was set based on the measured 222rn surface water activities the production γ of 222rn in the deeper sediments can be approximated using groundwater steady state concentrations multiplied by the decay rate cook et al 2006 it is likely that measurements in the profile will reflect this steady state concentration in scenarios where flow is upward or occurring downwards at a low rate conversely the equilibrium condition where c γ λ may have not been met and production rates may be underestimated where high downward flow rates are observed at the study site we have considered the maximum observed concentration from radon sediment profiles over the past 8 months to represent steady state for the dispersion coefficient we assume the relationship bear 1988 22 d v α l d where αl is the longitudinal dispersivity m and d is the effective diffusion coefficient m2 day on the scale of the bed transport here values of αl are on the order of 0 01 0 04 m gelhar et al 1992 the effective diffusion coefficient is defined as d m ϛ 2 where dm is the molecular diffusion of 222rn 6 9 10 5 m2 day and ϛ is the tortuosity assumed to be 1 7 we modified d using the predicted velocity and the range of αl the porosity of the sediments was assumed to be medium grain sand consistent with the observed material at the site kasenow 2006 morris johnson 1967 the velocity of the infiltration ranges from 0 to 10 m d 1 with positive and negative ranges to consider the downward flux and upward flux directions depth surface water 222rn concentration and maximum 222rn concentrations at depth were obtained during each sampling survey with a factor of 1 1 applied to the maximum profile depth to extend the profile beyond the deepest measurement point l 1 1zmax recharge and discharge fluxes were derived from eq 9 with the porosity ranges used in the study 3 site description and methods the analytical solution was tested at the swan river estuary in south west australia to determine the applicability of the proposed method fig 3 the swan river is a major drainage system in metropolitan perth western australia with 124 000 km2 catchment area and an average rainfall of 730 mm yr 1 bureau of meteorology 2019 major tributary that contributes to the swan river in the study areas is the canning river the swan river is an estuary environment that is influenced by the tidal water inflow from the indian ocean with marine waters reaching up to 45 km from the coastline during a low flow during the summer season smith and turner 2001 the study site is located west of the perth city centre with the pore water profile measurement point approximately 11 5 m from the north riverbank and at the outer bend of the meandering swan river 31 97774 south 115 82147 east the site was relatively close to the bank given the width of the river at this location the riverbed deposits at the survey site are composed of yellow medium sand grains the nearest borehole with lithological data within the swan river riparian zone site of groundwater level fig 3 is located 40 m from the riverbank and the profile had 3 m 0 3 m of yellow sand and 11 m of brown clay 3 14 m from the ground level dwer 2020 the alluvial aquifer in the swan river overlies the shale and sandstone osborne formation davidson 1995 previous studies suggest that groundwater discharge to swan river is highest on the outside of river meanders with a hydraulic gradient higher than the inner meander linderfelt and turner 2001 smith and turner 2001 bed sediment sampling was carried out using a mini drive point piezometer with a screen length of 5 cm at different depths in the subsurface depths were determined from the mid point of the screen samples were only collected from a single point i e spatial variability was not considered a low flow peristaltic pump was used to extract approximately 1 l of groundwater from the subsurface the surface water and groundwater samples were analysed using a durridge rad 7 durridge sheffield united kingdom with a rad 7 wat feature to determine the 222rn concentration the rad 7 protocol utilised one five minute bubbling period followed by four five minute counting periods 4 results large variability was observed between the radon profiles over the monitored one year period fig 4 radon 222 activities are generally lowest at the surface with concentrations increasing with depth and a combination of linear e g fig 4a convex downward e g fig 4g and convex upward e g 4e patterns observed in the 222rn data two further profiles fig 4h and j show low radon activities near the surface before demonstrating a step change in the deeper profile notably measurement uncertainty appeared to be greater for higher concentrations observed deeper in the profiles increasing errors also lead to some ambiguity in observable trends with depth fits to the data using all three models favour samples with a lower measurement error as these produce a higher overall likelihood eq 25 the fits of the two models show agreement with each other particularly with the shallow data in cases where linear or convex downward trends are observed e g fig 4a b g h and i rmse values in table 2 it is notable that the fit of the piston flow model covers a wider range than that of the ade and two zone models conversely fits to data where convex upward patterns are observed vary between the two models this is particularly evident in fig 4c f and for differences in the rmse values in these profiles table 2 the predicted fluxes for the advection dispersion model vary between 1 79 m day on august 7th to 2 07 m day on august 13th compared to a range of 0 03 m day august 21st to 1 72 m day on august 7th for the piston flow model table 2 fig 5 the piston flow model is unable to predict downward flows due to the boundary conditions imposed and the assumptions of the method this is particularly evident for the period between july 25th and august 7th where the ade model predicts upward flows this demonstrates the limitations of the piston method for estimating fluxes in gaining or dynamic systems the uncertainty of the predicted fluxes is similar for the two methods except for times when the advection dispersion model predicts upward flow fig 5 in three of these cases fig 5c e the piston flow model predicts a narrow range of fluxes close to zero interestingly for the sample collected on the afternoon of august 7th the three predicted fluxes show higher uncertainty but different ranges fig 5f the ade model predicts a bimodal distribution of fluxes as the dispersion is simulated proportionally to the absolute velocity eq 26 it is likely that the flow magnitude increases the fit to the profile conversely the advection model predicts a wide range of downward fluxes six of the predicted fluxes show close agreement in flux direction flux magnitude and error of the prediction between the piston flow and advection dispersion models fig 6 the most notable discrepancies between the piston flow and advection dispersion models are observed at times when the ade model predicts upward flows in three of the four cases the piston flow model predicts flows close to zero the exception to this is for the profile collected in the afternoon of august 7th here the piston flow model predicted the maximum downward flow rate all four points show discrepancies between the fits of the two models fig 4c f highlighting that the piston flow model is unable to match the convex upward shape of the profile the piston flow model demonstrated that flux estimates are sensitive to the production rate of 222rn in the sediments in addition to the two parameters directly related to the flux calculation fig 7 this contrasts with the advective dispersive model it is also of note that although only downward fluxes can be predicted the direction of the correlation changes between the two profiles this indicates that the shape of the profile plays a role in how this parameter is estimated the correlation of the model parameters shows that fluxes predicted with the ade model are sensitive to the porosity and velocity this is expected when considering eq 7 as the darcy flow is linearly proportional to the two quantities fig 7 interestingly the downward flux prediction from february 13th shows that the predicted flux is correlated to the upper boundary condition conversely the profile representative of upward flow conditions collected on august 7th shows a correlation with the lower boundary condition this is expected as the boundary in the direction flow originates will have a strong influence on the profile we observe that these quantities are also correlated to the velocity which is directly used in the flux estimate these observations are not unexpected but do highlight the need for choosing appropriate ranges for these parameters often the surface water concentration can be measured directly however care should be taken when determining the lower boundary conditions the model selection is significant for the result interpretation and flux predictions the largest variation between models in the predicted fluxes was observed in early august fig 8 this coincides with the end of winter corresponding to a time at the end of winter when groundwater levels are highest fig 8b if interpretations are made utilising the piston flow model it may be concluded that the swan estuary recharges groundwater when groundwater levels are at their highest elevation however when considering the propensity for upward flow to occur with the newly proposed ade model we observe that periods where groundwater levels are high result in predictions that groundwater discharges to the swan estuary variations due to tidal forcing were observed for the days where profiles were collected at different times in addition to the seasonal gradient on july 25th the morning profile was collected during high tide and the afternoon as the tide was falling fig 8b the tide fluctuated approximately 0 4 m during the day fig 8b both profiles recorded similar magnitudes and direction of flux conversely profiles collected on the 7th of august show large changes between the morning profile collected while the tide was rising and the afternoon collected while the tide was falling fig 8b the magnitude of the daily fluctuation was 0 6 m fig 8b the fad model demonstrated a reduction in the flux magnitude after the high tide fig 8a further results obtained on august 21st show that flows were slightly downward in the morning during a rising tide and upward in the afternoon during a falling tide corresponding to a daily fluctuation of 0 4 m fig 8b however under the low fluxes predicted the profiles on this day may not have flushed between the two measurement times these results suggest that the exchange between the surface water and groundwater is controlled both by regional groundwater levels and tidal responses 5 discussion in the present study we proposed a new advection dispersion model and compared it with a previously used piston flow model for predicting point scale exchanges between surface and groundwater using 222rn depth profiles we showed that both upward and downward fluxes can be predicted with the advection dispersion models whereas the piston flow model was only able to predict downward fluxes this was confirmed by results from our field example for profiles collected at the end of winter when groundwater levels were high where the new model predicted groundwater discharge to the estuary conversely the piston flow model showed low rates of loss from the estuary over the same period the prediction of downward fluxes was broadly consistent between the methods as suggested by the findings of cranswick et al 2014 and demonstrated in the present study based on the expected peclet numbers of natural systems however the main contribution of the proposed models is their capacity to predict upward fluxes which had not been considered previously with analytical solutions other methods used for determination of the exchange of water between sediments using 222rn have been proposed for example the radon deficit model can be utilised to assess the net exchanges of 222rn martin et al 2007 cable and martin 2008 the net exchange can be ascertained if the profile is integrated to the point at which equilibrium concentrations are reached in our examples this point was not reached and hence the flux would have been underestimated additionally this flux captures both an advective and dispersive flux given that the dispersive flux would be driven largely by the high gradients between surface and groundwaters the fluxes obtained through this modelling procedure may be limited when inferring water fluxes or fluxes of compounds with differing concentration gradients therefore this model would not be optimal in the studied case further models may consider cycling both upward and downward fluxes within sediments to understand the cycling of water salt and nutrients rather than just water fluxes cook et al 2018 however the primary objective of this method was to determine darcy fluxes between the surface and groundwater the models implemented assume that the profiles are steady state and the flow is one dimensional the hydraulic transition of the profiles is quite fast due to the short distances and the relatively small storage coefficient of the saturated sediments the solute profile will be controlled by the two dimensionless parameters γ and λ the first describes the ratio between production and flushing and the second describes the ratio between decay and flushing the primary constraint is that at low velocities the profile will be dependent on the time scales of decay or production to re establish after a hydraulic change chmielarski et al 2022 very low fluxes were observed for profiles collected in late august which may have prevented the profiles from rapid re equilibration this was reflected in the low variation in radon concentration between samples a second issue is the variation in the surface concentration in our same day profiles the 222rn activity of the estuary at the sampling point varied up to 2 bq l this variation was relatively small compared to the variation within the profile but could be considered in future studies by adding additional error to the surface concentration the one dimensional assumption would require that either flow is primarily vertical or that lateral variations in radon activity are negligible we consider this in appendix a for the case of a pool and riffle sequence our results suggest good agreement between models however this does not represent an exhaustive comparison and the applicability of the 1d assumption is likely to be site specific smith et al 2008 found that the assumption was appropriate in indian river lagoon and that vertical gradients were 5 times higher than horizontal gradients the component of vertical flow will be a function of aquifer thickness surface water body geometry and regional groundwater characteristics further investigation of the appropriateness of this assumption should be tested in future studies the implemented model also assumes uniform dispersion and production rates the variability in the production rate of radon dependents on the presence of 226ra in the sediments this is affected by the mobility of 226ra and the type of sediments peel et al 2022 demonstrated that 222rn production is increased close to the water table when measured on the scale of 10 s of meters this was also observed in lakebed sediments brenner et al 2004 conversely in estuarine settings the mobility of 226ra can be impacted by salinity differences in the water smith et al 2008 demonstrated this in a setting where 226ra activities were lower close to the sediment surface due to changes in salinity impacting the equilibrium with sediments and water changes in redox conditions may also influence the concentration of 226ra lamontagne et al 2018 further enhanced dispersion or non local exchange may occur close to the sediment surface qian et al 2008 smith et al 2008 voermans et al 2018 this would result in a higher flux of water at the surface independent of the processes considered in this model this behaviour in the profile is most evident in profiles collected on the 19th and 21st of june fig 4h j the profiles demonstrate a low activity near the surface with a step increase in radon activity at varying depths these profiles reported low groundwater fluxes which may suggest the enhanced exchange is more prominent when groundwater flows are low however it should be noted that the model will have limited efficacy when the primary processes that dictate the shape of the profile vary from those presented by the developed model the analytical method utilised in the study required approximately 1 l of water to be collected for each sample analysed for radon concentration although a low flow pump was used the volume of water removed from the sediments may have influenced the profiles a method requiring less water may would reduce the potential for profile disturbance e g direct method leaney and herczeg 2006 further we have estimated the radon emanation rates during our fitting procedure all methods showed some degree of correlation between the estimated groundwater flux and this parameter obtaining actual values of this parameter should help to constrain flow estimates we note that due to the sensitivity of 226ra sorption to redox conditions and salinity care should be taken in replicating these conditions in lab emanation studies 6 conclusion we developed a novel analytical solution based on the advection dispersion equation with finite boundary conditions for 222rn transport between surface water and groundwater which can be used to determine water recharge and discharge flux ranges the study showed the possibility of incorporating prior knowledge of parameters by implementing a markov chain monte carlo and likelihood function to assess the uncertainty of recharge estimates the flux direction derived in the analytical solution could account for bi directional flows with maximum predicted flows ranging from 1 79 m day between groundwater and surface water to 2 07 m day between surface and groundwater this was largely dependent on the seasonal groundwater changes which together with tides determined the gradient between the surface and groundwater systems estimates made with the piston flow model were broadly consistent when predicting fluxes from the surface to the groundwater however the piston flow model was unable to predict fluxes from the groundwater to the surface water this is due to the degassing of 222rn in surface water creating large gradients between the surface and groundwater which can generate misleading ages in the presence of upward flow our results show that 222rn profiles may offer insight into water fluxes in gaining losing and dynamic environments such as streams rivers lakes and estuaries credit authorship contribution statement allen june buenavista

comments of two anonymous reviewers whose feedback improved the manuscript appendix a two dimensional flow the method was validated using simulated 222rn profiles which were estimated for an analytical solution of a hyporheic flow field presented in frei et al 2019 the hyporheic flow field for a riffle pool structure fig 9 was represented using the perturbation method zlotnik et al 2015 frei et al 2019 based on measured head variation in the stream as an upper boundary condition kasahara and hill 2006 the riffle structure in total is 4 25 m long and has a homogenous isotropic saturated hydraulic conductivity of ksat 10 m d kasahara and hill 2006 and a porosity of θ 0 35 was used to represent the streambed sediments for the hyporheic flow field 222rn activities were simulated along flow path lines by accounting for advection 222rn enrichment due to emanation and radioactive decay 222rn concentration in the streambed sediments was simulated by assuming a stream 222rn activity of 100 bq m3 and a uniform endmember activity of 10 000 bq m3 at three locations 1 1 93 and 3 m vertical 222rn profiles were extracted and the corresponding vertical darcy flux components in the z direction qz at the streambed interface were estimated from the analytical flow field the three extracted profiles represent conditions for an inflow location with high vertical exchange flux x 1 m qz 0 33 m d inflow conditions with a moderate vertical exchange flux x 1 93 m qz 0 25 m d and outflow conditions with a high exchange flux x 3 m qz 0 39 m d this inversion procedure assumed an error of 10 of the base modelled value the fit to the profile is presented in fig 9b the profiles at 1 0 m and 1 96 m are fit well however the profile from 3 m favours fitting the concentration located at zero depth this honours the relative error between the measurements the vertical fluxes normal to the stream bed for the base model were 0 33 m day 0 25 m day and 0 39 m day for distances of 1 0 1 93 and 3 0 m respectively here we report the median flux value and the range between the 16th and 84th percentile the predicted values from the algorithm were 0 39 m day range 0 26 to 0 51 m day 0 37 m day 0 25 to 0 52 m day and 0 27 m day 1 18 to 0 01 m day for distances of 1 0 1 93 and 3 0 m respectively the direction of flow is predicted correctly for each of the three profiles in all cases the flux estimates fall within the predicted range between the 16th and 84th percentile 
1702,this paper provides an overview of the progress made in remote sensing of water resources in africa focusing on various applications such as precipitation estimation land surface temperature analysis soil moisture assessment surface water extent measurement surface runoff and streamflow analysis water quality evaluation land cover land use mapping and groundwater analysis specifically the study sheds light on the remarkable progress made in remote sensing applications showcasing scientific advancements and highlighting the challenges encountered moreover it identifies crucial knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in order to further advance this field the review s key findings indicate that the availability of sensors and observations along with analytical models has contributed to monitoring africa s water resources at various scales the availability and accessibility of hydrological data for monitoring and assessing water resources in africa have been partially improved through the adoption of satellite data and processing technologies additionally the emergence of various international remote sensing initiatives north south research collaborations and projects has contributed to the research progress prominent satellite data series such as landsat modis and grace have played significant roles in african hydrological research however the limited and malfunctioning in situ hydrological monitoring networks in africa have affected the accurate calibration and validation of remotely sensed hydrological models insufficient long term rainfall and climate data pose challenges to long term earth observation research on african water systems the lack of high resolution spatial and temporal data hampered accurate monitoring of hydrological processes at smaller scales despite the widespread use of rainfall satellite products validation attempts over africa particularly in western and southern regions have been limited furthermore the reliability of hydrological satellite datasets is affected by factors such as the number and coverage of surface stations retrieval algorithms data integration techniques and cloud cover overall this work demonstrates the importance of earth observation in understanding africa s hydrology previously hindered by the lack of in situ data nevertheless efforts are therefore needed to enhance the adoption and application of remote sensing particularly in groundwater and surface water estimation at smaller scales future research should focus on multi source data integration assimilation and big data analytics using cloud computing and machine learning to address complex hydrological research questions at various scales keywords african hydrology climate change sustainable development water resource availability water security data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction africa s hydrology exhibits high variability in both temporal and spatial dimensions due to its diverse climatic zones ranging from humid tropics to hyper arid regions hughes 2007 continuous monitoring and assessment are essential to understand subtle changes in hydrological processes intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc special report on land and climate change ipcc srcl 2019 highlights the impact of rising temperatures and variable rainfall patterns on africa s hydrology of late some regions have begun to experience extreme droughts water deficits runoff decreases and severe evapotranspiration resulting in increased aridity in some parts of the continent and vice versa research employing time series catchment and regional scale spatial analysis reveals that areas reliant on surface water as the primary freshwater source are particularly vulnerable to climate change which has profound consequences for ecosystems economies and livelihoods wilhite et al 2007 zhou et al 2017 huang et al 2018 chiloane et al 2020 severe droughts and resulting water shortages have been observed in numerous cities predominantly in sub saharan africa during the first two decades of the twenty first century zhang et al 2019 notable examples include the recent drought in south africa s western cape province from 2015 to 2018 watson et al 2022 aside from aridity variability in climate and water resources and a lack of in situ data integrated water resource management in africa s shared transboundary river basins remains complex and elusive hughes 2007 consequently the utilization of remotely sensed data products has gained prominence in water resource monitoring efforts the urgency of effective and sustainable water resource monitoring and management as well as long term water resource management wrm is paramount in gaining a comprehensive understanding of africa s hydrology in the face of climate change and variability unfortunately financial constraints and inadequate hydro meteorological infrastructure hinder many african countries from generating sufficient data on freshwater availability hughes 2007 awange et al 2016 winkler et al 2017 muthoni et al 2019 the scarcity of global meteorological stations in africa compared to other regions raises concerns about data coverage and distribution fig 1 developed countries possess a more extensive network of weather stations with extensive historical data archives crucial for calibrating and validating remotely sensed hydrological products the dense network of in situ hydrological monitoring stations combined with earth observation eo technologies plays a pivotal role in enabling more accurate wall to wall forecasting and facilitating effective wrm implementation strategies however it is worth noting that despite the limited availability of in situ data water related research continues across the continent the emergence of eo technologies with diverse spatial and temporal scales has sparked significant interest in their application for monitoring and assessing water resources particularly at catchment or sub catchment scales eo technologies have proven invaluable in providing essential hydrological data for regions in africa where hydro meteorological networks are limited or inaccessible bridging critical gaps in in situ data fernandez prieto and palazzo 2007 van dijk and renzullo 2011 sheffield et al 2018 gxokwe et al 2020 this trend has been driven by the demand for detailed and timely information on water resources encompassing variables such as rainfall runoff water quality and quantity considering the challenges posed by global climate change competing demands and the interconnectedness of food and water security this review critically examines the utilization of earth observation eo techniques for water resources assessment and monitoring in africa specifically it provides a detailed examination of the strengths weaknesses and operational scales associated with these techniques drawing insights from previous scientific studies the review highlights the development and application of remote sensing in understanding the hydrological cycle showcasing key studies that have employed eo technology in water resource management wrm furthermore it discusses the current challenges and limitations faced in utilizing remote sensing for wrm with a specific focus on data scarce regions in africa the review concludes by outlining future prospects and potential advancements in remote sensing offering promising opportunities for enhanced water resource monitoring and management across the continent 2 the hydrology of africa the african continent is divided into climatic zones which influence its hydrology and the availability of water resources conway et al 2009 the northern and southern coasts have a mediterranean climate with dry summers and long wet winters the sahara desert which borders the northern mediterranean region on the south and east gradually narrows from west to east encompassing algeria libya morocco and tunisia the sahara desert is the world s hottest desert accounting for roughly 30 of africa s total land area tucker dregne and newcomb 1991 rainfall in the sahara is extremely scarce with rare runoff that is usually of extremely short duration high levels of evaporation and thus limited surface water sources kitambo et al 2022 in the southern tip of africa the climate is predominantly mediterranean a characteristic feature of south africa s western cape province the vegetation in the mediterranean regions consists primarily of shrubs scrubs or bushes which respond differently to rainfall temperature and land use and land cover dynamics in the western cape for example the fynbos vegetation dominates the landscape mkunyana et al 2019 though currently threatened by invasive species mtengwana et al 2021 in the central parts the equatorial region is another feature of the african climatic zone this is primarily found in western central and eastern africa and is distinguished by high annual rainfall dargie et al 2017 this region includes the congo river the world s second largest hydrological basin in terms of drainage area and discharge to the ocean and the nile river the world s longest river dai et al 2009 kitambo et al 2022 in contrary west africa has few large water resources whereas central africa has the majority located in the congo basin the great lakes region and the nile s head waters united nations 1962 kitambo et al 2022 the tropical forests that cover much of central africa serve as a carbon sink and are home to a diverse range of plant and animal species the tropics are mostly semi arid with rainy summers and dry winters and are dominated by the savannah vegetation the savannah region is home to three of the world s ten largest freshwater lakes lakes malawi tanganyika and victoria kitambo et al 2022 across africa the diverse climate zones exhibit notable differences in water availability these variations encompass the amount of rainfall received the volume of water resources present and the distribution between surface water and primarily groundwater sources fig 2 a b c and d in these regions both surface water and groundwater are essential for supporting human livelihoods and driving economic development chiloane et al 2022 mpakairi et al 2022 presently the estimated total volume of groundwater in africa is approximately 0 66 million km3 macdonald et al 2012 determined based on the combined saturated thickness and effective porosity of aquifers fig 2a and b smaller water systems like streams reservoirs ponds and tanks contribute significantly to the african hydrological system serving as important sources of water aquatic life and agricultural production for rural communities in sub saharan africa kitambo et al 2022 moreover groundwater is relied upon by a majority of the sub saharan population for economic and domestic purposes xu et al 2019 hence recognizing the impact of climate variation on hydrology is vital for understanding vegetation dynamics and implementing effective strategies to address water resource management challenges 3 development of remote sensing in water resources management over the years the remote sensing of wrm have undergone significant advancements transitioning from traditional methods like aerial photography to advanced satellite systems bhaga et al 2020 these satellite systems now offer routine monitoring capabilities for various water balance components and topographic parameters affecting water catchments the availability of open data access and a wealth of new satellite resources has provided developing countries with limited in situ networks unprecedented access to freely available products for hydrological research the development of multi spectral satellite radar and drone sensors has made eo datasets more attractive for water related studies offering wider coverage diverse products higher frequencies and low to no cost manfreda et al 2018 this in turn has facilitated the advancement of modeling and forecasting techniques resulting in more accurate estimation and understanding of water resources and their dynamics at various scales the exponential increase in the number of studies utilizing freely available satellite data for surface water monitoring in data scarce regions particularly drylands highlights the growing interest and utility of these resources ozesmi and bauer 2002 chen et al 2013 powell et al 2019 to document and consolidate the hydrological research trends of the past decades this review was conducted encompassing various themes and providing key scientific findings and conclusions by analyzing a wide range of publications the review identifies knowledge gaps presents insights on african hydrology and proposes potential future research directions the selection of area specific keywords and phrases such as remote sensing water resource management sahel region africa hydrology and sustainable development was employed to identify and analyze the number of published studies in the field fig 3 the abundance of scientific works in peer reviewed journals served as the basis for compiling this comprehensive review aiming to contribute to the understanding and advancement of hydrological research 4 remote sensing for water resources management spatial water resource monitoring systems swrms are dedicated remote sensing missions that provide valuable information for wrm van dijk and renzullo 2011 swrms provides an improved spatial understanding of the hydrological processes by providing near or real time monitoring of evapotranspiration karimi and bastiaanssen 2015 precipitation toté et al 2015 soil moisture ma et al 2019 surface water revilla romero et al 2016 water quality sagan et al 2020 land cover land use chang et al 2018 groundwater liu et al 2016 as well as forecasting and early warning systems the advancements of swrms have opened new avenues for water resource monitoring in data scarce regions such as africa allowing a more in depth understanding of their water balance this has been aided by the presence of several hydrological models developed for simulating global hydrology which have been adopted or adapted for hydrological modelling of various catchments and climates throughout africa some of these studies have yielded promising results at the river basin or catchment scale it is important to note however that the majority of these models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat climatic research unit cru sood and smakhtin 2015 surface energy balance model sebs shoko et al 2017 govender et al 2022 the hec hms model and plant water use and rainfall estimation models require many parameters to be calibrated at the regional scale and in most cases these parameter variables are not easily accessible furthermore most of these hydrological models use satellite based weather input data with coarse spatial resolutions i e 250 m to 1 km pixel size or 0 5 degree gridded format making them only useful for large scale hydrological applications such as long term assessment of the impacts of climate change and impact on global water sood and smakhtin 2015 as a result refining these globally oriented hydrological models to fine scale applications to address localised water resources and societal issues is required in view of the observations highlighted beforehand in the sections that follow a detailed synthesis and discussion on the applications of eo data in precipitation land surface temperatures lst runoff and evapotranspiration et soil moisture groundwater water quality water extent as well as floods droughts in africa is provided 4 1 precipitation estimations from remotely sensed data accurate measurement of precipitation is crucial for water resource management as it is the primary driver of the hydrological cycle however in africa the existing rain gauge networks are insufficient and dwindling de coning and poolman 2011 making it challenging to obtain reliable rainfall estimate sawunyama and hughes 2008 the meteorological station coverage across the continent is severely lacking with only a few countries having adequate networks fig 1 to supplement gauge observations rainfall satellite products are widely used in africa these satellite derived estimates help overcome the limitations of in situ gauging stations many of which suffer from maintenance issues when they are available efforts are underway to improve operations by utilizing a combination of multiple satellites and merging gauge calibrated products sheffield et al 2018 this approach enables the use of satellite derived estimates to provide near real time rainfall observations with enhanced spatial distribution and higher temporal frequency makapela et al 2015 in the field of remote sensing both infrared ir and microwave imagery are still widely used for estimating precipitation stephens and kummerow 2007 various rainfall estimation products have been developed utilizing these techniques including the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm bai et al 2018 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann awange et al 2016 climate prediction center morphing cmorph xie et al 2017 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap tian et al 2010 climate hazards group infra red precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2015 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2019 as well as sm2rain precipitation products these rainfall estimation products are highly regarded due to their ability to integrate multiple satellite and ground based datasets resulting in improved accuracy and reliability the trmm mission is equipped with three on board instruments that measure rainfall and energy exchange these instruments are i trmm s microwave imager tmi quantifies water vapour cloud water and rainfall intensity the ii passive microwave pm sensor provides information on rainfall distribution type storm depth and height at which snow melts to rain and the iii visible and infrared scanner virs provides cloud top temperatures kummerow 1998 however this data only ran up to 2015 fortunately the global precipitation measurement gpm mission is the successor of the trmm providing more advanced capabilities to measure light rain falling snow and quantifying microphysical properties of precipitation skofronick jackson et al 2017 this is due to the gpm s microwave imager gmi that captures precipitation intensities and horizontal patterns as well as a dual frequency precipitation radar that provides 3 dimesional insight of the precipitation structure schwaller and robert morris 2011 despite widespread use of most of these satellite derived rainfall products few attempts on validation have been made over africa particularly in western and southern africa dinku et al 2007 furthermore most of these validation exercises have been limited to a small number of products for example monthly estimates with a spatial resolution of 2 5 x2 5 latitude longitude coupled with various rainfall products various data processing and modelling techniques have been developed and tested at various scales and these include statistical downscaling methods and blended techniques statistical downscaling methods he et al 2016 and blended techniques chappell et al 2013 have proved to be useful in producing higher resolution data required for fine scale estimation however because rain gauge stations continue to provide the most reliable rainfall datasets remotely sensed precipitation estimates rely on rain gauge calibration and africa s sparse network of rain gauge stations provides a poor baseline validation dataset to compare against eo datasets sun et al 2018 as a result when estimating precipitation in africa uncertainties are frequently high awange et al 2019 eo programs as well as other precipitation data derived from various satellite missions are summarized in figs 4 and 5 along with their specifications despite the uncertainties in remote sensing based precipitation products over africa significant progress has been made in developing techniques to provide accurate and on demand information the chirps v2 product for example combines rain gauge and satellite data to produce a spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall in areas with significant data gaps this has proven beneficial in all african ecosystems muthoni et al 2019 for example used chirps v2 to study the spatiotemporal variation of rainfall over eastern and southern africa between 1981 and 2017 the study assessed the reliability of the chirps v2 data product using a goodness of fit method adapted from the kling gupta efficiency kge a statistical method to analyse the importance of different components in a hydrological model between 2003 and 2010 awange et al 2016 compared six popular precipitation products over africa arcv2 cmorph trmm gsmap tropical applications of meteorology using satellite and ground based observations tamsat and persiann were among the products the study used a three cornered hat tch approach to analyze the uncertainties of these products and then compared the results to data from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc as well as rain gauge data from the greater horn of africa overall rain gauge merged products were found to have lower errors than satellite only products furthermore the persiann product demonstrated the lowest uncertainty over the majority of africa except for the greater horn of africa where cmorph and gsmap demonstrated the lowest uncertainty demonstrating that no single product is suitable for all locations similarly awange et al 2019 investigated the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep v2 1 product over australia and africa between 1981 and 2016 mswep v2 1 is a global rainfall product that combines satellite rain gauge and re analysis data to maximize their benefits while minimizing their drawbacks to compare mswep data the study used data from various sources fluxnet a global network of independent micrometeorological tower sites australia s bureau of meteorology bom the gpcc chirps and the agriculture climate forecast system reanalysis agcfsr were among those used mswep s accuracy in producing rainfall estimates was evaluated using a suite of statistical methods including pearson kolmogorov smirnov principal component analysis pca and tch overall mswep v2 1 agreed with bom data but did not outperform in situ observations or chirps data furthermore when compared to chirps mswep v2 1 underestimated major hydro climate extremes over west east and southern africa it can therefore be concluded that chirps v2 and other rainfall satellite products provide visibly reliable predictions of high spatial resolution rainfall data across eastern and southern africa supplementing sparse rain gauge networks however in areas with below average rainfall the performance of these products remains very poor necessitating the development of new methodologies to aid in the estimation of such areas 4 2 assessment of remotely sensed land surface temperature evapotranspiration datasets evapotranspiration et sustains precipitation by replacing water vapour lost through condensation ramoelo et al 2014 as a result quantifying et is required for climate change modelling monitoring water balances monitoring agriculture and assessing environmental stresses kustas and norman 1996 melesse et al 2006 gowda et al 2007 satellite based products such as the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis advanced space borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster and landsat s thermal infra red tir sensors have yielded a wealth of et related data anderson et al 2012 fensholt et al 2009 similarly meteosat land surface analysis lsa sa and mod16 et eo products are validated using african flux tower data ramoelo et al 2014 unfortunately currently et cannot be measured directly from space et techniques are primarily based on empirical methods that use vegetation indices to project et ground measurements to larger scales glenn et al 2007 physical models that calculate et using remotely sensed thermal infra red tir data allen et al 2007 or models that calculate et using a combination of penman monteith type equations and satellite data mu et al 2011 the modis based algorithm mu et al 2011 and multi satellite approach vinukollu et al 2011 for example combine penman monteith estimates with eo data to retrieve daily et similarly combining data from polar orbiting and geostationary satellites with on the ground observations from flux towers and meteorological stations holds great promise for wrm in africa holmes et al 2018 especially using models such as the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and sebs su 2002 these models are commonly used to estimate et using the energy balance approach gibson et al 2013 and use lst as one of the input model parameters sebal is not currently available to unaffiliated researchers but sebs is a free open source model that has been validated in several studies gibson et al 2013 shoko et al 2015 to estimate et advanced algorithms primarily based on satellite lst are used li et al 2013 fig 6 depicts the major eo programs and satellite missions used to estimate et and lst the spatial and the temporal resolutions of the datasets used to derive these products most of the techniques have spatial resolutions ranging from 250 to 1000 m allowing them to be used on a large scale with homogeneous land use and land cover this complements the limitations of direct et measurements from lysimeters tyagi et al 2000 flux towers sun et al 2012 and soil measurements hillel 1982 mbow et al 2013 all of which are point based and thus inapplicable over large areas weerasinghe et al 2020 et stations are scarce throughout africa nonetheless these algorithms have great potential jarmain et al 2009 li et al 2009 raoufi and beighley 2017 hence significant improvements since their inception near the end of the 1970s shoko et al 2015 however high spatial resolution may be required for better spatial representation of these estimates in highly heterogeneous landscapes and at localised scales despite challenges associated with the use of remote sensing based models hydrological and land surface models remain the most used to estimate large scale et of late numerous et products have been created by combining machine learning ml approaches with eddy covariance flux tower data or model outputs as training sets however prior to weerasinghe et al 2020 few studies evaluated existing et products that are solely focused on africa particularly using a water balance approach as a result the study evaluated the reliability of 9 remotely sensed derived et products over africa cmrset etmonitor gleam landflux eval mod16 fluxnet mte ssebop wapor and wecann were among the et products evaluated their results were compared to a water balance inferred et etwb value checked against the budyko curve which serves as a reference condition for the water balance and energy balance and assessed for spatial variability overall each product had benefits and drawbacks with cmrset ssebop and wapor consistently ranking highest when estimating long term average et across africa furthermore the etwb had a low overall bias indicating that it is a reliable reference condition for analyses weerasinghe et al 2020 dzikiti et al 2019 compared two et based remote sensing models to actual measured et data from three arid sites in south africa their results indicated that the performance of the models varied over space and time although promising results were found the study reported worst estimates r2 0 50 root mean square error 0 80 mm day during the prolonged dry spells in summer the physically based penman monteith approach which has recently been evaluated using a variety of satellite products particularly mod16 data has been widely used to provide accurate et estimates similarly because it requires fewer input variables nasa s priestley taylor modified jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model has received a lot of attention dzikiti et al 2019 evaluated the penman monteith mod16 et and pt jpl models by comparing them to actual et estimates from eddy covariance flux towers and a scintillometer based surface energy balance system the performance of the two models varied across the three sites both models initially underestimated daily et particularly during years with prolonged mid summer dry spells in summer rainfall areas however when the parameters were changed leaf area index lai surface conductance and radiation budget had the greatest impact on simulated et a soil water stress constraining function was added to the mod16 et model to improve it unfortunately they discovered little progress when attempting to improve the pt jpl model concluding that improved parameterization is required to increase the accuracy of pt jpl in arid and semi arid ecosystems some of these flaws are caused by model parameters such as lai normalized difference vegetation indices ndvi and fraction vegetation cover fvc all of which are estimates resulting in error propagation 4 3 soil moisture estimation using remotely sensed data in 2010 the global climate observing system gcos designated soil moisture as an essential climate variable ecv piles et al 2019 soil moisture soil water is responsible for controlling the amount and rate of precipitation infiltrating into the soil recharge into aquifers xu and beekman 2019 and enabling the identification of wet antecedent conditions that favour flooding sheffield et al 2018 topography vegetation and climate all contribute to the high spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture content crow et al 2012 the thermogravimetric method which measures the ratio of the mass of water in the soil to the mass of dry soil is the industry standard for measuring soil moisture content walker et al 2004 unfortunately the labour intensity and time consumption required to obtain these estimates have resulted in a scarcity of soil moisture data in southern africa with the majority of data coming from private sectors or research institutions piles et al 2019 soil moisture parameters are frequently thought to be better estimated from space in this regard optical thermal ir and microwave eo techniques have been investigated to estimate the spatio temporal variations of soil moisture at the top 0 15 cm of earth s surface gibson et al 2009 changes in surface soil moisture are associated with changes in surface emissivity and backscattering properties in microwave frequencies sheffield et al 2018 giving microwave techniques an advantage microwave sensors can also be used in all weather conditions day or night as well as penetrate certain vegetation covers walker et al 2004 widely used soil moisture products include national aeronautics and space administration s nasa soil moisture active passive smap satellite mission mousa and shu 2020 rahman et al 2019 european space agency s esa sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar sar sensor sheffield et al 2018 esa s soil moisture and ocean salinity smos satellite mission ma et al 2019 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national environmental satellite data and information service nesdis soil moisture operational products system smops liu et al 2016 and esa soil moisture essential climate variable smecv programme lou et al 2018 the ability to use a blended technique is what makes noaa s nesdis smops and esa s smecv programs appealing smops combines data from the following sensors aqua amsr e coriolis windsat metop ascat smos and smap yin et al 2020 whereas smecv combines data from the following sensors dmsp ssm i trmm tmi aqua amsr e and smos yin et al 2020 sensors on the other handwhereas smecv combines data from the dmsp ssm i trmm tmi aqua amsr e and smos lou et al 2018 sensors this enables the products to achieve high spatiotemporal accuracy in long term soil moisture content records likewise esa s tiger project share introduced a semi operational soil moisture monitoring service based on envisat s advanced synthetic aperture radar asar global mode sensor bartsch et al 2012 the data allows for operational soil moisture monitoring for drought and flood forecasting particularly in africa unfortunately little research has been conducted in africa using this dataset wagner et al 2007 experimented with envisat s asar data to retrieve soil moisture estimates concluding that more research is needed to develop quantitative methods for errors caused by vegetation cover figs 5 and 7 summarizes the currently available eo programs and satellite missions for estimating soil moisture as well as their spatial and temporal resolutions despite the fact that soil moisture measurements from space are still in their infancy a number of satellite retrieval missions have been able to combine long term data records to provide consistent soil moisture estimates bunting et al 2018 for example used avhrr and modis derived vegetation indices to show how temperature increases altered available soil moisture resulting in changes in landscape patterns across southern africa the study demonstrated the feasibility of estimating soil moisture without the use of dedicated soil moisture satellite missions fortunately soil moisture dedicated missions do exist and have been globally assessed for example piles et al 2019 investigated the temporal variability of surface soil moisture using smos from 2010 to 2016 comparing its accuracy to the global land data assimilation system gldas noah model european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era5 soil moisture model and remedhus ground based soil moisture monitoring networks overall smos results agreed with gldas and era5 estimates of soil moisture time series however long term soil moisture data records based solely on observational datasets are still clearly needed recent studies frequently highlight the incorporation of remote sensing data into hydrological modeling as a method of improving soil moisture spatiotemporal estimates sinclair and pegram 2010 sheffield et al 2018 regrettably this method has yet to be tested in africa furthermore there is a limitation associated with the depth of moisture that remote sensors can detect in this regard studies should consider the use of field based soil moisture measurements which can go deeper than microwave sensors to provide more accurate soil moisture estimates products such as esa s climate change initiative cci use data from 9 eo microwave sensors including the scanning multi frequency microwave radiometer smmr european remote sensing satellite ers 1 2 tmi special sensor microwave imager ssm i advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr e advanced scatterometer ascat data products windsat advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 and smos mission because of its low frequency and higher spatial resolution the amsr e instrument has the potential to outperform previous spaceborne radiometers such as the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer and special sensor microwave imager in terms of soil moisture sensing approximately 60 km at 6 9 ghz cammalleri et al 2017 assessed the suitability of the lisflood distributed hydrological rainfall runoff model lis modis lst and cci products for identifying reliable monitoring of soil moisture extreme conditions in specific regions around the world including southern africa stoffelen s 1998 assessed the cci s lis and modis lst accuracy the tch analysis demonstrated the superior performance of remote sensing data particularly the cci over dry regions such as australia and africa although the finding were associated with some inconsistencies and a lack of coverage from one or more datasets the three products were shown to be comparable over most of the globe despite these intriguing findings it is important to note that satellite based soil moisture estimates typically reflect soil moisture conditions in the top layer which may limit their usability application 4 4 measuring surface water height extent from remotely sensed datasets the primary goal of quantitative surface water measurements is to characterize the height and extent of lakes dams and wetlands using various gauges catchment and river authorities managers and different water related e g south africa s department of water and sanitation dws collects and documents daily and weekly river flows across different catchments and river basins as well as monthly volume capacities for reservoirs rivers lakes canals and pipelines makapela et al 2015 however this information is still inadequate for efficient wrm as many surface water bodies are unaccounted for various strategies have been developed using eo based data sets to estimate surface water quantity from space table 1 satellites have been extensively used for monitoring inland surface water bodies either through active radar or passive optical sensors sheffield et al 2018 radar relies on the low backscattering of water surfaces relative to surrounding land surfaces while optical sensors rely on external light sources furthermore semi automatic classification methods aid in identifying surface water extent these methods are commonly grouped into i single band threshold methods feyisa et al 2014 ii machine learning classification methods jiang et al 2014 and iii multiband water index methods rokni et al 2014 multiband methods have gained high popularity due to their ability to combine multiple spectral bands and use mathematical models to enhance water features while simultaneously restricting or eliminating surrounding features for example the normalised difference water index ndwi makes use of the green and near infrared nir bands based on the strong absorption and low radiation of surface water bodies in these spectral ranges mcfeeters 2013 the landsat series is arguably the most notable dataset as it is one of the longest running eo projects likewise modis also provides long term short revisit time data for mapping global surface water extent sentinel 1 seaton and dube 2021 and sentinel 2 seaton et al 2020 datasets however are making great strides due to their higher resolution and shorter revisit times conversely radar altimetry is used to calculate surface water height by emitting radar waves and analyzing the return signals crétaux et al 2011 with topographic data popular satellite missions include the jason series lambin et al 2010 and sentinel 3 kittel et al 2021 however the global reservoir and lake elevation database which uses near real time radar altimetry and inundation information from ssm i ers and avhrr sensors is also promising key eo products and satellite missions for monitoring surface water height and extent are summarised in fig 8 with their relevant sources as well as significant studies that utilised these datasets both in africa and globally cooley et al 2021 used nasa s cloud and land elevation satellite icesat 2 satellite laser altimeter to quantify global water level variabilities for 227 386 surface water bodies the study showed the influence of human activity on the seasonal dynamics of those water bodies this influence is likely to increase due to economic development population growth and climate change therefore baseline studies such as these are useful to track human modifications on the global hydrological cycle likewise khandelwal et al 2017 applied a modified supervised classification approach to modis multispectral data to map the global spatio temporal variations of 94 reservoirs between 2000 and 2015 the performance of modis data was compared to known altimetry measurements matching very well with the in situ height variations however this only appears to be valid on surface water bodies that showed significant surface area variations and ineffective for smaller or unchanged water bodies in a different study haas et al 2009 used the spot vegetation spot vgt instrument to assess the accuracy of mapping temporary small water bodies in sub saharan western africa s arid semi arid and sub humid regions the study demonstrated the potential of mapping temporary small water bodies in africa s arid and semi arid regions fortunately the introduction and advances of high spatial resolution satellite datasets such as landsat 8 9 sentinel 2 and worldview with improved sensing characteristics allows for the detection and monitoring of small waterbodies that are frequently masked out by coarse resolution remotely sensed products furthermore the new generation of sensors enables the detection of inherent seasonal temporal variations in water resources higher resolution instruments such as worldview allow for a better understanding of smaller bodies of water for instance herndon et al 2020 used worldview data to precisely map the spatio temporal dynamics of rainfed ephemeral ponds and lakes across the nigerien sahel however using commercial high spatial resolution datasets is difficult particularly in resource constrained african regions such datasets are mostly used for extensive and thorough projects or by the private sector which have the acquisition capacity some studies have also demonstrated the validity of eo data for surface water dynamics and their role in wrm in africa becker et al 2018 used the global inundation extent multi satellite giems technique to examine seasonal patterns of surface water dynamics in the congo river basin crb the technique combines microwave visible and nir data to provide global surface water extent and storage which has been validated against in situ measurements overall it appeared that both datasets improved fundamental understanding of the crb and wrm similarly zimba et al 2018 used modis data to analyze inundation trends in zambia s barotse floodplain with landsat and ground truthing for validation as well as pearson r to assess inundation correlations between discharge and water level strong correlations were found between inundation extent and water level r 0 86 as well as inundation extent and discharge r 0 89 demonstrating how remote sensing based approaches reduced the use of costly and time consuming field based surface water monitoring jason and topex poseidon on the other hand have primarily been used in oceanography although significant progress has been made in monitoring surface water extent in africa using satellite based technologies more work remains to be done to operationalize these techniques and contribute to the generation of meaningful information that can be used to inform water management strategies and key decision making in addition the role of drones and drone technologies must be considered in validating satellite based estimates 4 5 satellite based surface runoff streamflow estimations streamflow river discharge measurements are primarily done through river gauging stations river discharge is typically calculated at one point along a river using a mechanical current meter acoustic doppler current profiler to measure the velocity and develop a rating curve makapela et al 2015 runoff models also provide valuable information on surface flows for example the pitman model which is rainfall runoff model estimates monthly discharge using rainfall and potential et data hughes 2007 hughes et al 2014 likewise wetspass batelaan and de smedt 2001 simulates potential runoff based on vegetation soil texture slope and groundwater saturated areas unfortunately these models rely heavily on in situ measurements and discharge monitoring infrastructure in africa which is still sparse and underdeveloped sivapalan et al 2003 kapangaziwiri et al 2009 nevertheless by incorporating cutting edge eo data these models may become more accurate and fill in the gaps of unmeasured areas bjerklie et al 2005 river discharge estimates cannot currently be directly measured using remotely sensed data however because remote sensing can provide other estimates such as rainfall soil moisture and land cover land use lc lu rainfall runoff models will no longer need to rely heavily on in situ measurements hrachowitz et al 2013 similarly by combining in situ data satellite imagery and digital elevation models dems the soil conservation service curve number scs cn jacobs et al 2003 and stream ted king et al 2005 models have shown promise in predicting runoff estimates although the scs cn method has become the standard practical toolset for estimating an event based rainfall runoff response it is however limited to specific geographic regions and land use types due to its empirical origins furthermore it does not account for the spatial variability of runoff as a result its applications in african settings have been limited in favour of new spatially explicit approaches such as the stream ted s runoff erosion model king et al 2005 considerable studies have therefore utilised the use of these spatially explicit approach for run off modelling for example liebe et al 2009 developed a rainfall runoff model based on thornthwaite mather s water balance model to estimate reservoir volumes in west africa the model combined envisat asar data with srtm data and where possible reservoir gauge data overall the study reported that the model accurately reproduced observed runoff generation and could be used as a runoff gauge to better understand the landscape s hydrology similarly bjerklie et al 2005 estimated in bank river discharge using aerial photography orthophotos topographical maps dems and ers 1 sar data to extract river channel width and slope along the missouri river in california surface velocity was calculated using a jpl technique and corrected for the bragg resonant effect the bias effect on velocity estimates of wind driven waves after calibration the mean accuracy of discharge estimates was within 10 of observed discharge their study illustrated relatively accurate estimates of in bank river discharge could be measured from eo data unfortunately this approach has not yet been tested along southern african rivers but as more eo data becomes available figs 5 and 8 future studies will be able to use these methodologies in africa various methods for estimating run off have been tested and the results are detailed in the study by mushore et al 2019 who reviewed literature on the progress and challenges of rainfall runoff modelling and the contributions of remote sensing in africa the review highlighted the works by andersen et al 2002 who used precipitation estimates from meteosat and lai from noaas avhrr to improve hydrograph simulations to derive runoff characteristics hong et al 2007 and mahmoud 2014 used the curve number approach with trmm and landsat coupled dem data as inputs nonetheless the limited research on the use of remote sensing data to quantify runoff has frequently used coarse datasets that fail to capture the spatial variations that play critical roles in determining surface runoff table 2 more emphasis should be placed on using medium to fine resolution sensors to estimate surface runoff 4 6 satellite estimations of water quality african scientists have extensively monitored water quality in lakes and dams using remotely sensed data highlights from some recent studies that successfully used remotely sensed methods for water quality monitoring are summarised here abdelmalik 2018 used eo data for monitoring water quality into three types based on spatial resolution high resolution data moderate resolution data and regional global resolution data dube et al 2015 examined the use of remote sensing applications for monitoring water quality in sub saharan african lakes shekede et al 2008 and dube et al 2014a for example used landsat derived vegetation indices to map the invasive growth of hyacinth and aquatic weeds in lake chivero and lake respectively both studies showed high levels of accuracy as well as an increase in hyacinth and aquatic weeds in these lakes dlamini et al 2016 used modis to measure chlorophyll a chl a concentrations as a proxy for predicting pollution levels in zimbabwe s lake chivero a time series from 1985 to 2010 revealed that the major contributors to lake chivero s pollution levels were decreases in surrounding forestry and increases in urbanisation dlamini et al 2016 gholizadeh et al 2016 examined the progress of remote sensing in measuring water quality parameters such as chl a coloured dissolved organic matters cdom secchi disk depth sdd turbidity total suspended sediments tss water temperature wt total phosphorus tp sea surface salinity sss dissolved oxygen do biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod the review stated that airborne sensors are better suited for retrieving water quality parameters on smaller waterbodies whereas satellite sensors are better suited for larger waterbodies while also emphasizing the power of hyperspectral imagery which can record up to 200 spectral channels for detecting numerous water quality parameters abdelmalik 2018 used aster data to map the spatial distribution of temperature turbidity ph salinity tds ec total alkalinity total organic carbon toc and ortho phosphorus in egypt s qaroun lake the results revealed a significant correlation between the two datasets for all water quality parameters this study demonstrated a quick low cost and convenient method for obtaining the spatial distribution of significant water quality parameters using eo data various eo techniques for monitoring water quality by estimating optically active water parameters have been developed these are i physiochemical parameters such as electrical conductivity ph temperature salinity and total dissolved solids ii organic parameters such as bod and toc and iii microbiological parameters such as chlorophyll and phytoplankton abdelmalik 2018 recently launched satellites such as sentinel 3 also hold great promise soomets et al 2020 similarly sagan et al 2020 reviewed recent advances in remote sensing for monitoring water quality identifying current system and estimation method limitations and suggesting future improvements over 200 water quality samples were collected from 43 different locations in the united states to test for blue green algae phycocyanin bga pc chl a do specific conductivity sc fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom turbidity and pollution sediments the in situ data were compared to proximal spectral data ground based hyperspectral imagery and data from the landsat 8 and sentinel 2 satellites because of atmospheric interference and short revisit times proximal spectra data and ground based hyperspectral imagery had higher accuracy than satellite data as a result multi sensor data fusion and cloud computing may be a promising strategy for forecasting future water pollution outbreaks table 2 it is important to note that the majority of water quality research in africa have focused on mapping phytoplankton which is regarded as the greatest threat to the quality of inland water bodies matthews et al 2010 matthews et al 2012 used envisat s meris data to detect trophic status chl a cyanobacterial blooms surface scum and floating vegetation across two inland water bodies in the western cape and gauteng provinces the study demonstrated that chl a estimates from top of atmosphere meris data provided significant accuracy by utilizing fluorescence and backscatter absorption related features in the red and nir wavelengths of meris however combining landsat 8 and sentinel data improved the results fig 9 shows a summary of widely used eo programs and satellite missions for measuring water quality parameters their sources as well as temporal and spatial resolution 4 7 land cover land use classification from satellite data changes in the hydrological cycle are driven by global effects of land cover and vegetation land cover changes affect precipitation and temperature patterns whereas vegetation cover changes affect et and surface energy patterns chase et al 2000 remote sensing has emerged as the single most effective technique for better understanding the dynamics of land cover thompson 1996 for accurate monitoring of land cover change remote sensing techniques can repeatedly group various land features into clusters based on their spectral similarities fig 10 similarly vegetation dynamics can be retrieved using microwave sensors based on their spectral properties liu et al 2011 in 1996 the first south african national land cover map nlc 94 was published using landsat data the map contained 31 classes that were captured as a digital vector dataset fairbanks et al 2000 similarly in 2009 south african national biodiversity institute sanbi released an nlc map that made use of a mosaic of products as well as thematic products created by the agricultural research council arc dws and eskom schoeman et al 2013 eo products such as avhrr s global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms project gimms and modis s enhanced vegetation index provide long term time series of ndvi lai and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar evi these products have been evaluated based on their accuracy for global long term monitoring of vegetation cover change huete et al 2002 and data enhancement pinzon and tucker 2014 however advanced satellites such as sentinel 2 have also provided unprecedented information for deriving vegetation characteristics being the first sensor to include bands in the red edge spectrum making it suitable for estimating canopy chlorophyll and nitrogen content clevers and gitelson 2013 similarly nasa s ecostress provides groundbreaking data on forest canopy height vertical structure and surface elevation with research applications on carbon balance and forest structure however this data is still limited and more information is required fig 10 summarizes major eo and satellite missions for lclu and vegetation monitoring as well as the key studies that used these data for wrm chang et al 2018 state that remotely sensed land use change detection techniques are shifting from planning and management to land use change impacts and driving factors this is extremely beneficial in terms of wrm because it will aid in more efficient management strategies and the protection of water resources nonetheless attention should be paid to the accuracy of land use classification provided by eo technology fortunately databases such as globeland30 make significant contributions to the study of international lulc changes chang et al 2018 landsat and modis have also contributed a wealth of global long term lulc changes matlhodi et al 2019 used landsat data to assess lulc changes in botswana between 1984 and 2015 the study demonstrated dramatic increases in built up areas and bare land as well as significant decreases in shrub land and tree savannah similarly al hamdan et al 2017 used landsat and modis derived lulc products to monitor lulc changes and their potential environmental drivers precipitation temperature across africa as well as a two level verification process to ensure data accuracy chirps and modis were used to assess whether precipitation and temperature changes were significant drivers of lulc changes respectively all areas are experiencing significant deforestation and wetland loss as well as crop and grass expansion ultimately al hamdan et al 2017 discovered that non environmental factors such as socioeconomics and government policies were the primary drivers of lulc changes finally kamwi et al 2017 discovered no previous evidence on whether protected resources in southern africa are affected by lulc changes and attempted to fill this gap using landsat imagery across the zambezi region between 1984 and 2010 their research revealed clear patterns of lulc change by land tenure regime which has a direct impact on natural land cover resources and suggests that more tactical lulc monitoring strategies should be implemented lulc change have been extensively studied across africa using single date and multi date high to coarse resolution applications however the majority of these studies concentrated on the catchment to sub catchment scale with a few exceptions on the regional and national levels furthermore while there are numerous satellites available for land cover mapping the majority of these have spatial resolutions ranging from 1 to 50 m fig 10 however some of these are not readily available or accessible and are heavily influenced by cloud cover particularly in the tropics where clouds are often persistent causing spectral mixing in heterogeneous environment table 2 4 8 groundwater estimation wrm requires an understanding of the patterns and magnitude of ground and surface water interactions meijerink et al 2007 webb et al 2008 this is because groundwater resources are frequently unsustainable due to low recharge rates and declining water tables caused by high abstraction levels gibson et al 2009 rodell et al 2018 groundwater exploration is primarily accomplished through the measurement of groundwater levels piezometers dip meters and wells the assessment of groundwater quality isotopes carbon 14 and chloride mass balance geochemical sampling or seepage measurements liu et al 2016 temperature measurements are also a reliable indicator of groundwater surface water interaction because groundwater temperatures are relatively constant while surface water temperatures vary meijerink et al 2007 however the lack of comprehensive groundwater data across other parts of the continent has hampered its impact and effectiveness indirect methods can infer changes in water storage by measuring changes in the earth s gravity field with satellite gravimetry or surface elevation with radar interferometry gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites from nasa measure changes in the gravity field as well as changes in terrestrial water storage fig 5 changes in the two satellites distance and speed are caused by changes in the gravity field caused by terrestrial and other water storage variations tapley et al 2004 these variations can be used to explain changes in groundwater depletion the use of grace in understanding groundwater has been successful although fine scale applications remain a challenge in this regard the review concluded that grace has been widely used to assess groundwater depletion for large aquifers in various regions for example grace has been used in several studies to better understand water storage in africa hassan and jin 2016 ramjeawon et al 2022 scanlon et al 2022 these studies evaluated grace for variations in water storage in the zambezi okavango and volta basins their findings show a significant decrease in water storage particularly during drought periods implying a good agreement between grace derived estimates and rainfall variability grace was also used by scanlon et al 2022 to assess the spatial temporal variations in water storage for major african aquifers the findings revealed a high level of agreement between grace water storage estimates and human activities irrigation climate variability el nino other eo techniques involve mapping geological features that influence groundwater recharge and discharge meijerink et al 2007 mapping geological lineaments for example may indicate shallow groundwater discharge zones whereas drainage density may indicate a possible groundwater recharge zone makapela et al 2015 previous research has leveraged satellite imagery to gain insights into groundwater exploration one notable study conducted by műnch et al 2013 demonstrated the application of earth observation eo techniques in quantifying recharge through the utilization of water balance relationships the study quantified groundwater recharge and discharge zones using estimates from precipitation p and et satellite products műnch et al 2013 compared three et models which are etmodis mod16 and pitman rainfall runoff data to calculate spatial regional recharge the application of p et clearly identified potential recharge and discharge zones adding value to the conceptualization of hydrogeology along south africa s west coast similarly lekula and lubczynski 2019 used remotely sensed data to build integrated hydrological models ihms to better understand the hydrology of the central kalahari basin the model characterized spatio temporal water flux dynamics provided annual water balances and evaluated groundwater resource dynamics and replenishment using modflow nwt and remotely sensed p pet dem lulc and soil data rainfall surface morphology unsaturated zone thickness and vegetation characteristics were also discovered to be primary determinants of groundwater dynamics by although these studies provided useful insight on ground water dynamics they were not dedicated to quantifying groundwater parameters from remotely sensed datasets the grace satellites on the other hand have provided independent monthly models of the earth s gravity field and variations in these values have been widely used on a continental scale to estimate groundwater storage variations rodell et al 2018 furthermore grace has been directly related to groundwater masses where long term depletion is occurring wahr et al 2004 ramjeawon et al 2022 as well as being validated to show a close correspondence to in situ groundwater measurements famiglietti et al 2011 bonsor et al 2018 used grace and land surface models lsms to estimate changes in terrestrial water storage tws and groundwater storage gws in 12 african sedimentary aquifers between 2002 and 2016 their findings demonstrated seasonal variations in gws estimates from tws unfortunately when compared to in situ data the tws grace and lsm results were less plausible in africa s semi arid and hyper arid basins indicating that more research into in situ observations and lsms is needed 4 9 satellite remote sensing for monitoring drought floods and extreme climate events in africa droughts and floods are common in africa with severity varying by region as a result researchers and countries have been working on methods frameworks and policies to improve drought and flood mitigation and adaptation strategies in recent years timely and spatially explicit information on the effects of drought and flooding in various regions has become critical bhaga et al 2020 mushore et al 2019 various satellite datasets such as dems multispectral passive microwave observations radar and aerial photographs have since been used to map vulnerable and hotspots in africa de groeve 2010 khan et al 2011 revilla romero et al 2016 few of these studies have been conducted at regional scale for instance mushore et al 2019 reviewed the literature on surface runoff modelling in southern africa and the paper showed how the use of remotely sensed data has replaced the use of hydrological models and ground based measurements bhaga et al 2020 on the other hand investigated long term scientific advancements made in drought monitoring using remote sensing including its applicability in observing climate variability and the hydrological effects of drought on surface water resources in sub saharan africa so far different satellite datasets namely dems multispectral passive microwave observations and radar as well as aerial photographs in conjunction with in situ field observations have been used widely to map droughts and floods in africa a majority of these studies have been applied at river basin scale for instance asare kyei et al 2015 used hydrological and statistical models along with remotely sensed data to define the geographic boundaries of flood hazard zones in a number of communities in ghana burkina faso and benin the method entails estimating peak runoff concentrations at various elevations followed by the use of statistical techniques to create a flood hazard index fhi however there is a need for further research that integrates multi data sources to model floods and determine possible hotspots as well as provide early warning systems droughts in africa on the other hand have been thoroughly researched as noted in the review by bhaga et al 2020 although the studies highlighted significant scientific progress in remote sensing applications in drought monitoring issues of scale operationalization of technologies and methods for wall to wall mapping the provision of early warning systems remain critical if the impact of remote sensing in africa is to be realized 5 remote sensing initiatives and projects for water resource management 5 1 wois and the tiger initiative when esa realized that eo technology could help with wrm issues it launched the tiger initiative which supports african eo capacity for wrm by collaborating with african water authorities and utilizing eo technologies guzinski et al 2014 crestaz et al 2017 tshikeba kabantu et al 2018 tiger aimed to empower african partners to exploit and disseminate eo technology on their own for scientific research wrm programs capacity building training and information and knowledge networking numerous tiger projects have resulted in several scientific publications froehlich 2020 and over 28 eo data processing solutions for african water authorities such as basin wide characterization of land and water resources lake water quality monitoring hydrological modeling and flood forecasting in addition it has spawned other initiatives such as the eo african framework for research innovation communities and applications initiative eoafrica and tiger net since its inception froehlich 2020 the eoafrica program recently adopted a new focus on water and food security by utilizing innovative tools such as cloud computing digital learning and open access sentinel data to collect spatio temporal eo data for use in wrm tiger net was built in close collaboration with european scientists and african water authorities to aid in their decision making crestaz et al 2017 through the water observation and information system wois tiger net supports satellite based assessments and wrm wois was an open source software that uses eo data from qgis to assess water resources this enabled wois to incorporate satellite data for flood monitoring and forecasting water body mapping for irrigation and livestock lake water quality and hydrological modeling tshikeba kabantu et al 2018 used wois to assess the spatial distribution of soil loss and erosion hazards in kinshasa congo by combining remote sensing inputs and soil erosion factors despite providing valuable information indicating that the urban area of kinshasa is more prone to soil erosion wois tended to overestimate soil loss at the local level while underestimating at the regional level the study further reported that effective in situ measurement validations would improve wois outcomes similarly south africa s dws uses wois for water discharge forecasting land cover based water demand mapping and water management related land cover change mapping the dws was able to develop high and medium resolution basin characterization urban sanitation planning support hydrological monitoring and long term seasonal variation of wetlands for the city of cape town region with the aid of wois froehlich 2020 these initiatives make significant contributions to improving water resource monitoring and management in previously data limited environments across africa by integrating eo data and programming techniques 5 2 monitoring for environment and security and africa gmes and africa project since the early 2000s the research and innovation partnership between the european union and the african union has made significant progress in utilizing earth observation eo for monitoring water resources at the continental scale the application of eo data has yielded tangible outcomes in various areas including agriculture flood modeling land degradation wetlands monitoring and water security across africa becker reshef et al 2020 gxokwe et al 2020 one noteworthy collaboration is the puma project also known as the meteorological transition in africa project which has leveraged the meteosat second generation msg satellite to facilitate eo research in africa this ambitious project aimed to transform meteorological services across africa and involved 53 african countries through the puma project african countries and regional centers were equipped with satellite data receiving stations infrastructure technical and thematic training and application support for data acquisition and utilization in various domains the participating countries benefited from initiatives such as puma amesd and gmes africa which promoted the use of eo data for african sustainable development they gained access to essential research equipment to receive continuous direct satellite data software for data processing and product generation e g weather forecasts rainfall estimates fire observations sea surface temperature measurements and training to enhance data utilization the project also fostered collaboration among the countries improving their collective capabilities and providing more effective and user centric services additionally five pilot projects were implemented across the african regional economic communities exploring the operational use of msg data in sustainable development programs furthermore significant financial and research support has been provided through the gmes and africa project to harness eo for monitoring natural resources in africa resulting in a surge in scientific research in this field however despite the benefits and advancements brought about by eo science and applications in africa the continent s utilization and application of eo technology still fall below its potential due to various factors ifejika et al 2023 research surveys indicate that the majority of eo initiatives in africa are driven by external entities while country level expenditures on eo remain limited recent developments such as the african space policy and strategy along with initiatives to establish an eo community of practice in collaboration with african based organizations hold promise in addressing these identified gaps 6 set backs and limitations despite the attractiveness of eo data in wrm there are still challenges when utilizing the information the current abundance of eo data fig 5 for example can frequently make the selection process of appropriate data overwhelming and complex furthermore the specifics of the use of remotely sensed data have a significant impact on the scale and study undertaken each sensor method region and parameter investigated has its own set of limitations van dijk and renzullo 2011 satellite based datasets can be an unappealing alternative due to limitations in return periods spatial resolutions spectral ranges cloud cover instrument failures and development time sheffield et al 2018 furthermore eo data are still primarily used to supplement ground information particularly for wrm due to institutional costs a lack of skilled technicians ground truth data and data continuity eo technology in africa is still far from fully operational fernandez prieto and palazzo 2007 furthermore africa continues to have one of the lowest numbers of wrm publications gxokwe et al 2020 reviews like those by mushore et al 2019 meticulously highlight the limitations of remote sensing in contributing to rainfall runoff modeling current techniques can only map linked parameters of runoff or validate spatial models and hydrologically significant variables not directly map runoff characteristics second due to the high spatiotemporal complexity of runoff there is no obvious set of variables that are universally used to estimate runoff from eo techniques king et al 2005 third advanced remotely sensed data suitable for runoff estimation such as rapideye ikonos worldview and spot 7 are prohibitively expensive van der sande et al 2003 finally there are no comprehensive well defined validation procedures for assessing surface runoff from remotely sensed data mushore et al 2019 when it comes to utilizing eo datasets several researchers have highlighted limitations in their studies winkler et al 2017 identified droughts affecting agriculture in africa using the trmm based standardized precipitation index spi and the modis derived vegetation condition index vci despite its promise modis data only covered a brief period of time whereas trmm data included uncertainties in rainfall estimates furthermore because of ndvi s sensitivity to soil moisture atmospheric interferences and colour it was misinterpreted over sparsely vegetated areas similarly vazifedoust et al 2009 used modis data to identify lai and relative et to improve crop yield forecasts claiming that the products were inaccurate estimators for calculating crop yield likewise sun et al 2010 emphasized that advanced data products like jason 1 and 2 topex poseidon and envisat still lack high velocity measurements and only provide 1 dimensional spot water level data leaving large areas between orbits unobserved overall significant progress is still required to rely more on eo data and less on costly and time consuming in situ measurements nonetheless future projects appear to be promising 7 future research trajectories modeling capabilities are anticipated to advance as new satellites are continuously launched and longer periods of remote sensing data are collected observing systems capability analysis and review oscar a resource tool created by the wmo supports eo applications wmo 2021 all past present and future eo instruments as well as all weather water and climate related applications are covered in detail and with the most recent information by oscar according to some research certain suggestions have been made regarding particular sensor needs for wrm an ideal inland water quality sensor according to sagan et al 2020 should have an imaging spectrometer with 3 10 nm spectral resolution bands from 250 to 1000 nm a minimum of 3 shortwave infrared swir bands for atmospheric correction spatial resolution between 5 and 15 m and as high a resolution as possible similarly sheffield et al 2018 reviewed what they considered to be the most important eo missions that are currently in operation and that are planned for the future below is an explanation of these the meteosat third generation set to launch in 2022 will cover europe and africa with a life expectancy until 2038 the meteosat second generation s work of providing weather forecasts and more accurate monitoring of the atmosphere land surfaces and oceans will be carried on by this program the 2023 launch of biomass will concentrate on measuring the world s forest biomass as well as the topography of the land and glaciers an operational global polar orbiting environmental satellite system called jpss 2 is scheduled to launch in 2022 it will provide time series multispectral data for use in energy and water balance vegetation dynamics and lulc changes by providing more precise images of surface water heights the swot mission scheduled to launch in 2022 will address issues with retrievals of current altimeters biancamaria et al 2016 nasa s hyspiri set to launch in 2023 will provide enhanced monitoring capabilities for inland water applications at 30 m spatial resolution with 214 unique spectral bands in visible and swir regions sagan et al 2020 these products are also being used in new ways fusion techniques which integrate and combine various remotely sensed datasets with one another and with in situ data show great promise this has already been demonstrated in studies like those by long et al 2020 who combined in situ lst measurements with modis data to increase lst retrievals in all weather scenarios and deliver precise soil moisture and et estimates for wrm similar to this abowarda et al 2021 combined in situ measurements with modis and landsat data to improve the accuracy of soil moisture estimates the processing of eo data is also benefiting greatly from ml algorithms like artificial neural networks ann support vector machines svm minimum distance classification maximum likelihood classification mlc regression tree based algorithms isodata and k means clustering rodríguez caballero et al 2022 the analysis of eo data for wrm is made possible by these advancements in data modelling or analysis some african regions have already conducted studies using these cutting edge machine learning techniques for instance gaffoor et al 2022 modelled groundwater levels for the shire valley alluvial aquifer within the zambezi basin in southern africa using ensemble and deep learning according to their research the long short term memory neural network outperformed the gradient boosting decision tree in terms of highlighting changes in water level the performance of five new hybrid ensemble machine learning techniques was compared by ijlil et al 2022 when evaluating the level of groundwater pollution in morocco drastic random forest rf drastic svm drastic multilayer perceptron mlp drastic rf svm and drastic rf mlp were the methodologies used according to the study the rastic rf mlp performed better than the other models artificial intelligence ai petascale image processing techniques and cloud computing such as google earth engine gee open up new possibilities for the fusion and integration of multisource data mahdianpari et al 2019 using indicators of dryness moisture greenness and desertification wu et al 2022 created a remote sensing ecological index rsei model using modis data in the gee platform to assess future trends throughout the sahel region of africa ecological deterioration in the sahel is predicted to occur as precipitation decreases monerie et al 2020 and it has been suggested that the great green wall project could change the predicted values future developments are likely to build on these strategies and offer more precise and timely information which is essential for wrm 8 conclusion this work examined advancements achieved in remote sensing applications for monitoring and managing water resources in africa the paper covered a wide range of applications including precipitation estimation land surface temperature analysis soil moisture assessment surface water extent measurement surface runoff and streamflow analysis water quality evaluation land cover land use mapping and groundwater analysis the review further emphasized on the evolution of remote sensing methodologies particularly in rainfall estimation water quality assessment and groundwater and runoff modeling overall this work underscored the importance of sensor availability analytical models and observational data in facilitating water resource monitoring at various scales challenges related to in situ hydrological monitoring networks limited long term rainfall and climate data and the lack of high resolution spatial and temporal data were however found to have affected the accurate calibration validation and monitoring of hydrological processes in africa despite the scarcity of in situ data the significance of earth observation in enhancing our understanding of africa s hydrology cannot be overstated to further advance this field there is a pressing need to increase the adoption and application of remote sensing techniques particularly in the accurate estimation of various components of the hydrological cycle at varying scales future research should prioritize the integration and assimilation of data from various sources while leveraging advanced technologies like big data analytics cloud computing and machine learning this comprehensive review serves as an indispensable reference for researchers policymakers and practitioners involved in the sustainable management of water resources in africa declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we express our sincere gratitude to dr siyamthanda gxokwe the anonymous reviewers and the editor for their invaluable contributions to this paper furthermore we extend our appreciation to the global monitoring for environment and security and africa gmes and africa for their financial support which was instrumental in the successful completion of the sasscal wemast phase ii project 
1702,this paper provides an overview of the progress made in remote sensing of water resources in africa focusing on various applications such as precipitation estimation land surface temperature analysis soil moisture assessment surface water extent measurement surface runoff and streamflow analysis water quality evaluation land cover land use mapping and groundwater analysis specifically the study sheds light on the remarkable progress made in remote sensing applications showcasing scientific advancements and highlighting the challenges encountered moreover it identifies crucial knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in order to further advance this field the review s key findings indicate that the availability of sensors and observations along with analytical models has contributed to monitoring africa s water resources at various scales the availability and accessibility of hydrological data for monitoring and assessing water resources in africa have been partially improved through the adoption of satellite data and processing technologies additionally the emergence of various international remote sensing initiatives north south research collaborations and projects has contributed to the research progress prominent satellite data series such as landsat modis and grace have played significant roles in african hydrological research however the limited and malfunctioning in situ hydrological monitoring networks in africa have affected the accurate calibration and validation of remotely sensed hydrological models insufficient long term rainfall and climate data pose challenges to long term earth observation research on african water systems the lack of high resolution spatial and temporal data hampered accurate monitoring of hydrological processes at smaller scales despite the widespread use of rainfall satellite products validation attempts over africa particularly in western and southern regions have been limited furthermore the reliability of hydrological satellite datasets is affected by factors such as the number and coverage of surface stations retrieval algorithms data integration techniques and cloud cover overall this work demonstrates the importance of earth observation in understanding africa s hydrology previously hindered by the lack of in situ data nevertheless efforts are therefore needed to enhance the adoption and application of remote sensing particularly in groundwater and surface water estimation at smaller scales future research should focus on multi source data integration assimilation and big data analytics using cloud computing and machine learning to address complex hydrological research questions at various scales keywords african hydrology climate change sustainable development water resource availability water security data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction africa s hydrology exhibits high variability in both temporal and

particularly vulnerable to climate change which has profound consequences for ecosystems economies and livelihoods wilhite et al 2007 zhou et al 2017 huang et al 2018 chiloane et al 2020 severe droughts and resulting water shortages have been observed in numerous cities predominantly in sub saharan africa during the first two decades of the twenty first century zhang et al 2019 notable examples include the recent drought in south africa s western cape province from 2015 to 2018 watson et al 2022 aside from aridity variability in climate and water resources and a lack of in situ data integrated water resource management in africa s shared transboundary river basins remains complex and elusive hughes 2007 consequently the utilization of remotely sensed data products has gained prominence in water resource monitoring efforts the urgency of effective and sustainable water resource monitoring and management as well as long term water resource management wrm is paramount in gaining a comprehensive understanding of africa s hydrology in the face of climate change and variability unfortunately financial constraints and inadequate hydro meteorological infrastructure hinder many african countries from generating sufficient data on freshwater availability hughes 2007 awange et al 2016 winkler et al 2017 muthoni et al 2019 the scarcity of global meteorological stations in africa compared to other regions raises concerns about data coverage and distribution fig 1 developed countries possess a more extensive network of weather stations with extensive historical data archives crucial for calibrating and validating remotely sensed hydrological products the dense network of in situ hydrological monitoring stations combined with earth observation eo technologies plays a pivotal role in enabling more accurate wall to wall forecasting and facilitating effective wrm implementation strategies however it is worth noting that despite the limited availability of in situ data water related research continues across the continent the emergence of eo technologies with diverse spatial and temporal scales has sparked significant interest in their application for monitoring and assessing water resources particularly at catchment or sub catchment scales eo technologies have proven invaluable in providing essential hydrological data for regions in africa where hydro meteorological networks are limited or inaccessible bridging critical gaps in in situ data fernandez prieto and palazzo 2007 van dijk and renzullo 2011 sheffield et al 2018 gxokwe et al 2020 this trend has been driven by the demand for detailed and timely information on water resources encompassing variables such as rainfall runoff water quality and quantity considering the challenges posed by global climate change competing demands and the interconnectedness of food and water security this review critically examines the utilization of earth observation eo techniques for water resources assessment and monitoring in africa specifically it provides a detailed examination of the strengths weaknesses and operational scales associated with these techniques drawing insights from previous scientific studies the review highlights the development and application of remote sensing in understanding the hydrological cycle showcasing key studies that have employed eo technology in water resource management wrm furthermore it discusses the current challenges and limitations faced in utilizing remote sensing for wrm with a specific focus on data scarce regions in africa the review concludes by outlining future prospects and potential advancements in remote sensing offering promising opportunities for enhanced water resource monitoring and management across the continent 2 the hydrology of africa the african continent is divided into climatic zones which influence its hydrology and the availability of water resources conway et al 2009 the northern and southern coasts have a mediterranean climate with dry summers and long wet winters the sahara desert which borders the northern mediterranean region on the south and east gradually narrows from west to east encompassing algeria libya morocco and tunisia the sahara desert is the world s hottest desert accounting for roughly 30 of africa s total land area tucker dregne and newcomb 1991 rainfall in the sahara is extremely scarce with rare runoff that is usually of extremely short duration high levels of evaporation and thus limited surface water sources kitambo et al 2022 in the southern tip of africa the climate is predominantly mediterranean a characteristic feature of south africa s western cape province the vegetation in the mediterranean regions consists primarily of shrubs scrubs or bushes which respond differently to rainfall temperature and land use and land cover dynamics in the western cape for example the fynbos vegetation dominates the landscape mkunyana et al 2019 though currently threatened by invasive species mtengwana et al 2021 in the central parts the equatorial region is another feature of the african climatic zone this is primarily found in western central and eastern africa and is distinguished by high annual rainfall dargie et al 2017 this region includes the congo river the world s second largest hydrological basin in terms of drainage area and discharge to the ocean and the nile river the world s longest river dai et al 2009 kitambo et al 2022 in contrary west africa has few large water resources whereas central africa has the majority located in the congo basin the great lakes region and the nile s head waters united nations 1962 kitambo et al 2022 the tropical forests that cover much of central africa serve as a carbon sink and are home to a diverse range of plant and animal species the tropics are mostly semi arid with rainy summers and dry winters and are dominated by the savannah vegetation the savannah region is home to three of the world s ten largest freshwater lakes lakes malawi tanganyika and victoria kitambo et al 2022 across africa the diverse climate zones exhibit notable differences in water availability these variations encompass the amount of rainfall received the volume of water resources present and the distribution between surface water and primarily groundwater sources fig 2 a b c and d in these regions both surface water and groundwater are essential for supporting human livelihoods and driving economic development chiloane et al 2022 mpakairi et al 2022 presently the estimated total volume of groundwater in africa is approximately 0 66 million km3 macdonald et al 2012 determined based on the combined saturated thickness and effective porosity of aquifers fig 2a and b smaller water systems like streams reservoirs ponds and tanks contribute significantly to the african hydrological system serving as important sources of water aquatic life and agricultural production for rural communities in sub saharan africa kitambo et al 2022 moreover groundwater is relied upon by a majority of the sub saharan population for economic and domestic purposes xu et al 2019 hence recognizing the impact of climate variation on hydrology is vital for understanding vegetation dynamics and implementing effective strategies to address water resource management challenges 3 development of remote sensing in water resources management over the years the remote sensing of wrm have undergone significant advancements transitioning from traditional methods like aerial photography to advanced satellite systems bhaga et al 2020 these satellite systems now offer routine monitoring capabilities for various water balance components and topographic parameters affecting water catchments the availability of open data access and a wealth of new satellite resources has provided developing countries with limited in situ networks unprecedented access to freely available products for hydrological research the development of multi spectral satellite radar and drone sensors has made eo datasets more attractive for water related studies offering wider coverage diverse products higher frequencies and low to no cost manfreda et al 2018 this in turn has facilitated the advancement of modeling and forecasting techniques resulting in more accurate estimation and understanding of water resources and their dynamics at various scales the exponential increase in the number of studies utilizing freely available satellite data for surface water monitoring in data scarce regions particularly drylands highlights the growing interest and utility of these resources ozesmi and bauer 2002 chen et al 2013 powell et al 2019 to document and consolidate the hydrological research trends of the past decades this review was conducted encompassing various themes and providing key scientific findings and conclusions by analyzing a wide range of publications the review identifies knowledge gaps presents insights on african hydrology and proposes potential future research directions the selection of area specific keywords and phrases such as remote sensing water resource management sahel region africa hydrology and sustainable development was employed to identify and analyze the number of published studies in the field fig 3 the abundance of scientific works in peer reviewed journals served as the basis for compiling this comprehensive review aiming to contribute to the understanding and advancement of hydrological research 4 remote sensing for water resources management spatial water resource monitoring systems swrms are dedicated remote sensing missions that provide valuable information for wrm van dijk and renzullo 2011 swrms provides an improved spatial understanding of the hydrological processes by providing near or real time monitoring of evapotranspiration karimi and bastiaanssen 2015 precipitation toté et al 2015 soil moisture ma et al 2019 surface water revilla romero et al 2016 water quality sagan et al 2020 land cover land use chang et al 2018 groundwater liu et al 2016 as well as forecasting and early warning systems the advancements of swrms have opened new avenues for water resource monitoring in data scarce regions such as africa allowing a more in depth understanding of their water balance this has been aided by the presence of several hydrological models developed for simulating global hydrology which have been adopted or adapted for hydrological modelling of various catchments and climates throughout africa some of these studies have yielded promising results at the river basin or catchment scale it is important to note however that the majority of these models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat climatic research unit cru sood and smakhtin 2015 surface energy balance model sebs shoko et al 2017 govender et al 2022 the hec hms model and plant water use and rainfall estimation models require many parameters to be calibrated at the regional scale and in most cases these parameter variables are not easily accessible furthermore most of these hydrological models use satellite based weather input data with coarse spatial resolutions i e 250 m to 1 km pixel size or 0 5 degree gridded format making them only useful for large scale hydrological applications such as long term assessment of the impacts of climate change and impact on global water sood and smakhtin 2015 as a result refining these globally oriented hydrological models to fine scale applications to address localised water resources and societal issues is required in view of the observations highlighted beforehand in the sections that follow a detailed synthesis and discussion on the applications of eo data in precipitation land surface temperatures lst runoff and evapotranspiration et soil moisture groundwater water quality water extent as well as floods droughts in africa is provided 4 1 precipitation estimations from remotely sensed data accurate measurement of precipitation is crucial for water resource management as it is the primary driver of the hydrological cycle however in africa the existing rain gauge networks are insufficient and dwindling de coning and poolman 2011 making it challenging to obtain reliable rainfall estimate sawunyama and hughes 2008 the meteorological station coverage across the continent is severely lacking with only a few countries having adequate networks fig 1 to supplement gauge observations rainfall satellite products are widely used in africa these satellite derived estimates help overcome the limitations of in situ gauging stations many of which suffer from maintenance issues when they are available efforts are underway to improve operations by utilizing a combination of multiple satellites and merging gauge calibrated products sheffield et al 2018 this approach enables the use of satellite derived estimates to provide near real time rainfall observations with enhanced spatial distribution and higher temporal frequency makapela et al 2015 in the field of remote sensing both infrared ir and microwave imagery are still widely used for estimating precipitation stephens and kummerow 2007 various rainfall estimation products have been developed utilizing these techniques including the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm bai et al 2018 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann awange et al 2016 climate prediction center morphing cmorph xie et al 2017 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap tian et al 2010 climate hazards group infra red precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2015 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2019 as well as sm2rain precipitation products these rainfall estimation products are highly regarded due to their ability to integrate multiple satellite and ground based datasets resulting in improved accuracy and reliability the trmm mission is equipped with three on board instruments that measure rainfall and energy exchange these instruments are i trmm s microwave imager tmi quantifies water vapour cloud water and rainfall intensity the ii passive microwave pm sensor provides information on rainfall distribution type storm depth and height at which snow melts to rain and the iii visible and infrared scanner virs provides cloud top temperatures kummerow 1998 however this data only ran up to 2015 fortunately the global precipitation measurement gpm mission is the successor of the trmm providing more advanced capabilities to measure light rain falling snow and quantifying microphysical properties of precipitation skofronick jackson et al 2017 this is due to the gpm s microwave imager gmi that captures precipitation intensities and horizontal patterns as well as a dual frequency precipitation radar that provides 3 dimesional insight of the precipitation structure schwaller and robert morris 2011 despite widespread use of most of these satellite derived rainfall products few attempts on validation have been made over africa particularly in western and southern africa dinku et al 2007 furthermore most of these validation exercises have been limited to a small number of products for example monthly estimates with a spatial resolution of 2 5 x2 5 latitude longitude coupled with various rainfall products various data processing and modelling techniques have been developed and tested at various scales and these include statistical downscaling methods and blended techniques statistical downscaling methods he et al 2016 and blended techniques chappell et al 2013 have proved to be useful in producing higher resolution data required for fine scale estimation however because rain gauge stations continue to provide the most reliable rainfall datasets remotely sensed precipitation estimates rely on rain gauge calibration and africa s sparse network of rain gauge stations provides a poor baseline validation dataset to compare against eo datasets sun et al 2018 as a result when estimating precipitation in africa uncertainties are frequently high awange et al 2019 eo programs as well as other precipitation data derived from various satellite missions are summarized in figs 4 and 5 along with their specifications despite the uncertainties in remote sensing based precipitation products over africa significant progress has been made in developing techniques to provide accurate and on demand information the chirps v2 product for example combines rain gauge and satellite data to produce a spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall in areas with significant data gaps this has proven beneficial in all african ecosystems muthoni et al 2019 for example used chirps v2 to study the spatiotemporal variation of rainfall over eastern and southern africa between 1981 and 2017 the study assessed the reliability of the chirps v2 data product using a goodness of fit method adapted from the kling gupta efficiency kge a statistical method to analyse the importance of different components in a hydrological model between 2003 and 2010 awange et al 2016 compared six popular precipitation products over africa arcv2 cmorph trmm gsmap tropical applications of meteorology using satellite and ground based observations tamsat and persiann were among the products the study used a three cornered hat tch approach to analyze the uncertainties of these products and then compared the results to data from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc as well as rain gauge data from the greater horn of africa overall rain gauge merged products were found to have lower errors than satellite only products furthermore the persiann product demonstrated the lowest uncertainty over the majority of africa except for the greater horn of africa where cmorph and gsmap demonstrated the lowest uncertainty demonstrating that no single product is suitable for all locations similarly awange et al 2019 investigated the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep v2 1 product over australia and africa between 1981 and 2016 mswep v2 1 is a global rainfall product that combines satellite rain gauge and re analysis data to maximize their benefits while minimizing their drawbacks to compare mswep data the study used data from various sources fluxnet a global network of independent micrometeorological tower sites australia s bureau of meteorology bom the gpcc chirps and the agriculture climate forecast system reanalysis agcfsr were among those used mswep s accuracy in producing rainfall estimates was evaluated using a suite of statistical methods including pearson kolmogorov smirnov principal component analysis pca and tch overall mswep v2 1 agreed with bom data but did not outperform in situ observations or chirps data furthermore when compared to chirps mswep v2 1 underestimated major hydro climate extremes over west east and southern africa it can therefore be concluded that chirps v2 and other rainfall satellite products provide visibly reliable predictions of high spatial resolution rainfall data across eastern and southern africa supplementing sparse rain gauge networks however in areas with below average rainfall the performance of these products remains very poor necessitating the development of new methodologies to aid in the estimation of such areas 4 2 assessment of remotely sensed land surface temperature evapotranspiration datasets evapotranspiration et sustains precipitation by replacing water vapour lost through condensation ramoelo et al 2014 as a result quantifying et is required for climate change modelling monitoring water balances monitoring agriculture and assessing environmental stresses kustas and norman 1996 melesse et al 2006 gowda et al 2007 satellite based products such as the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis advanced space borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster and landsat s thermal infra red tir sensors have yielded a wealth of et related data anderson et al 2012 fensholt et al 2009 similarly meteosat land surface analysis lsa sa and mod16 et eo products are validated using african flux tower data ramoelo et al 2014 unfortunately currently et cannot be measured directly from space et techniques are primarily based on empirical methods that use vegetation indices to project et ground measurements to larger scales glenn et al 2007 physical models that calculate et using remotely sensed thermal infra red tir data allen et al 2007 or models that calculate et using a combination of penman monteith type equations and satellite data mu et al 2011 the modis based algorithm mu et al 2011 and multi satellite approach vinukollu et al 2011 for example combine penman monteith estimates with eo data to retrieve daily et similarly combining data from polar orbiting and geostationary satellites with on the ground observations from flux towers and meteorological stations holds great promise for wrm in africa holmes et al 2018 especially using models such as the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and sebs su 2002 these models are commonly used to estimate et using the energy balance approach gibson et al 2013 and use lst as one of the input model parameters sebal is not currently available to unaffiliated researchers but sebs is a free open source model that has been validated in several studies gibson et al 2013 shoko et al 2015 to estimate et advanced algorithms primarily based on satellite lst are used li et al 2013 fig 6 depicts the major eo programs and satellite missions used to estimate et and lst the spatial and the temporal resolutions of the datasets used to derive these products most of the techniques have spatial resolutions ranging from 250 to 1000 m allowing them to be used on a large scale with homogeneous land use and land cover this complements the limitations of direct et measurements from lysimeters tyagi et al 2000 flux towers sun et al 2012 and soil measurements hillel 1982 mbow et al 2013 all of which are point based and thus inapplicable over large areas weerasinghe et al 2020 et stations are scarce throughout africa nonetheless these algorithms have great potential jarmain et al 2009 li et al 2009 raoufi and beighley 2017 hence significant improvements since their inception near the end of the 1970s shoko et al 2015 however high spatial resolution may be required for better spatial representation of these estimates in highly heterogeneous landscapes and at localised scales despite challenges associated with the use of remote sensing based models hydrological and land surface models remain the most used to estimate large scale et of late numerous et products have been created by combining machine learning ml approaches with eddy covariance flux tower data or model outputs as training sets however prior to weerasinghe et al 2020 few studies evaluated existing et products that are solely focused on africa particularly using a water balance approach as a result the study evaluated the reliability of 9 remotely sensed derived et products over africa cmrset etmonitor gleam landflux eval mod16 fluxnet mte ssebop wapor and wecann were among the et products evaluated their results were compared to a water balance inferred et etwb value checked against the budyko curve which serves as a reference condition for the water balance and energy balance and assessed for spatial variability overall each product had benefits and drawbacks with cmrset ssebop and wapor consistently ranking highest when estimating long term average et across africa furthermore the etwb had a low overall bias indicating that it is a reliable reference condition for analyses weerasinghe et al 2020 dzikiti et al 2019 compared two et based remote sensing models to actual measured et data from three arid sites in south africa their results indicated that the performance of the models varied over space and time although promising results were found the study reported worst estimates r2 0 50 root mean square error 0 80 mm day during the prolonged dry spells in summer the physically based penman monteith approach which has recently been evaluated using a variety of satellite products particularly mod16 data has been widely used to provide accurate et estimates similarly because it requires fewer input variables nasa s priestley taylor modified jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model has received a lot of attention dzikiti et al 2019 evaluated the penman monteith mod16 et and pt jpl models by comparing them to actual et estimates from eddy covariance flux towers and a scintillometer based surface energy balance system the performance of the two models varied across the three sites both models initially underestimated daily et particularly during years with prolonged mid summer dry spells in summer rainfall areas however when the parameters were changed leaf area index lai surface conductance and radiation budget had the greatest impact on simulated et a soil water stress constraining function was added to the mod16 et model to improve it unfortunately they discovered little progress when attempting to improve the pt jpl model concluding that improved parameterization is required to increase the accuracy of pt jpl in arid and semi arid ecosystems some of these flaws are caused by model parameters such as lai normalized difference vegetation indices ndvi and fraction vegetation cover fvc all of which are estimates resulting in error propagation 4 3 soil moisture estimation using remotely sensed data in 2010 the global climate observing system gcos designated soil moisture as an essential climate variable ecv piles et al 2019 soil moisture soil water is responsible for controlling the amount and rate of precipitation infiltrating into the soil recharge into aquifers xu and beekman 2019 and enabling the identification of wet antecedent conditions that favour flooding sheffield et al 2018 topography vegetation and climate all contribute to the high spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture content crow et al 2012 the thermogravimetric method which measures the ratio of the mass of water in the soil to the mass of dry soil is the industry standard for measuring soil moisture content walker et al 2004 unfortunately the labour intensity and time consumption required to obtain these estimates have resulted in a scarcity of soil moisture data in southern africa with the majority of data coming from private sectors or research institutions piles et al 2019 soil moisture parameters are frequently thought to be better estimated from space in this regard optical thermal ir and microwave eo techniques have been investigated to estimate the spatio temporal variations of soil moisture at the top 0 15 cm of earth s surface gibson et al 2009 changes in surface soil moisture are associated with changes in surface emissivity and backscattering properties in microwave frequencies sheffield et al 2018 giving microwave techniques an advantage microwave sensors can also be used in all weather conditions day or night as well as penetrate certain vegetation covers walker et al 2004 widely used soil moisture products include national aeronautics and space administration s nasa soil moisture active passive smap satellite mission mousa and shu 2020 rahman et al 2019 european space agency s esa sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar sar sensor sheffield et al 2018 esa s soil moisture and ocean salinity smos satellite mission ma et al 2019 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national environmental satellite data and information service nesdis soil moisture operational products system smops liu et al 2016 and esa soil moisture essential climate variable smecv programme lou et al 2018 the ability to use a blended technique is what makes noaa s nesdis smops and esa s smecv programs appealing smops combines data from the following sensors aqua amsr e coriolis windsat metop ascat smos and smap yin et al 2020 whereas smecv combines data from the following sensors dmsp ssm i trmm tmi aqua amsr e and smos yin et al 2020 sensors on the other handwhereas smecv combines data from the dmsp ssm i trmm tmi aqua amsr e and smos lou et al 2018 sensors this enables the products to achieve high spatiotemporal accuracy in long term soil moisture content records likewise esa s tiger project share introduced a semi operational soil moisture monitoring service based on envisat s advanced synthetic aperture radar asar global mode sensor bartsch et al 2012 the data allows for operational soil moisture monitoring for drought and flood forecasting particularly in africa unfortunately little research has been conducted in africa using this dataset wagner et al 2007 experimented with envisat s asar data to retrieve soil moisture estimates concluding that more research is needed to develop quantitative methods for errors caused by vegetation cover figs 5 and 7 summarizes the currently available eo programs and satellite missions for estimating soil moisture as well as their spatial and temporal resolutions despite the fact that soil moisture measurements from space are still in their infancy a number of satellite retrieval missions have been able to combine long term data records to provide consistent soil moisture estimates bunting et al 2018 for example used avhrr and modis derived vegetation indices to show how temperature increases altered available soil moisture resulting in changes in landscape patterns across southern africa the study demonstrated the feasibility of estimating soil moisture without the use of dedicated soil moisture satellite missions fortunately soil moisture dedicated missions do exist and have been globally assessed for example piles et al 2019 investigated the temporal variability of surface soil moisture using smos from 2010 to 2016 comparing its accuracy to the global land data assimilation system gldas noah model european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era5 soil moisture model and remedhus ground based soil moisture monitoring networks overall smos results agreed with gldas and era5 estimates of soil moisture time series however long term soil moisture data records based solely on observational datasets are still clearly needed recent studies frequently highlight the incorporation of remote sensing data into hydrological modeling as a method of improving soil moisture spatiotemporal estimates sinclair and pegram 2010 sheffield et al 2018 regrettably this method has yet to be tested in africa furthermore there is a limitation associated with the depth of moisture that remote sensors can detect in this regard studies should consider the use of field based soil moisture measurements which can go deeper than microwave sensors to provide more accurate soil moisture estimates products such as esa s climate change initiative cci use data from 9 eo microwave sensors including the scanning multi frequency microwave radiometer smmr european remote sensing satellite ers 1 2 tmi special sensor microwave imager ssm i advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr e advanced scatterometer ascat data products windsat advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 and smos mission because of its low frequency and higher spatial resolution the amsr e instrument has the potential to outperform previous spaceborne radiometers such as the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer and special sensor microwave imager in terms of soil moisture sensing approximately 60 km at 6 9 ghz cammalleri et al 2017 assessed the suitability of the lisflood distributed hydrological rainfall runoff model lis modis lst and cci products for identifying reliable monitoring of soil moisture extreme conditions in specific regions around the world including southern africa stoffelen s 1998 assessed the cci s lis and modis lst accuracy the tch analysis demonstrated the superior performance of remote sensing data particularly the cci over dry regions such as australia and africa although the finding were associated with some inconsistencies and a lack of coverage from one or more datasets the three products were shown to be comparable over most of the globe despite these intriguing findings it is important to note that satellite based soil moisture estimates typically reflect soil moisture conditions in the top layer which may limit their usability application 4 4 measuring surface water height extent from remotely sensed datasets the primary goal of quantitative surface water measurements is to characterize the height and extent of lakes dams and wetlands using various gauges catchment and river authorities managers and different water related e g south africa s department of water and sanitation dws collects and documents daily and weekly river flows across different catchments and river basins as well as monthly volume capacities for reservoirs rivers lakes canals and pipelines makapela et al 2015 however this information is still inadequate for efficient wrm as many surface water bodies are unaccounted for various strategies have been developed using eo based data sets to estimate surface water quantity from space table 1 satellites have been extensively used for monitoring inland surface water bodies either through active radar or passive optical sensors sheffield et al 2018 radar relies on the low backscattering of water surfaces relative to surrounding land surfaces while optical sensors rely on external light sources furthermore semi automatic classification methods aid in identifying surface water extent these methods are commonly grouped into i single band threshold methods feyisa et al 2014 ii machine learning classification methods jiang et al 2014 and iii multiband water index methods rokni et al 2014 multiband methods have gained high popularity due to their ability to combine multiple spectral bands and use mathematical models to enhance water features while simultaneously restricting or eliminating surrounding features for example the normalised difference water index ndwi makes use of the green and near infrared nir bands based on the strong absorption and low radiation of surface water bodies in these spectral ranges mcfeeters 2013 the landsat series is arguably the most notable dataset as it is one of the longest running eo projects likewise modis also provides long term short revisit time data for mapping global surface water extent sentinel 1 seaton and dube 2021 and sentinel 2 seaton et al 2020 datasets however are making great strides due to their higher resolution and shorter revisit times conversely radar altimetry is used to calculate surface water height by emitting radar waves and analyzing the return signals crétaux et al 2011 with topographic data popular satellite missions include the jason series lambin et al 2010 and sentinel 3 kittel et al 2021 however the global reservoir and lake elevation database which uses near real time radar altimetry and inundation information from ssm i ers and avhrr sensors is also promising key eo products and satellite missions for monitoring surface water height and extent are summarised in fig 8 with their relevant sources as well as significant studies that utilised these datasets both in africa and globally cooley et al 2021 used nasa s cloud and land elevation satellite icesat 2 satellite laser altimeter to quantify global water level variabilities for 227 386 surface water bodies the study showed the influence of human activity on the seasonal dynamics of those water bodies this influence is likely to increase due to economic development population growth and climate change therefore baseline studies such as these are useful to track human modifications on the global hydrological cycle likewise khandelwal et al 2017 applied a modified supervised classification approach to modis multispectral data to map the global spatio temporal variations of 94 reservoirs between 2000 and 2015 the performance of modis data was compared to known altimetry measurements matching very well with the in situ height variations however this only appears to be valid on surface water bodies that showed significant surface area variations and ineffective for smaller or unchanged water bodies in a different study haas et al 2009 used the spot vegetation spot vgt instrument to assess the accuracy of mapping temporary small water bodies in sub saharan western africa s arid semi arid and sub humid regions the study demonstrated the potential of mapping temporary small water bodies in africa s arid and semi arid regions fortunately the introduction and advances of high spatial resolution satellite datasets such as landsat 8 9 sentinel 2 and worldview with improved sensing characteristics allows for the detection and monitoring of small waterbodies that are frequently masked out by coarse resolution remotely sensed products furthermore the new generation of sensors enables the detection of inherent seasonal temporal variations in water resources higher resolution instruments such as worldview allow for a better understanding of smaller bodies of water for instance herndon et al 2020 used worldview data to precisely map the spatio temporal dynamics of rainfed ephemeral ponds and lakes across the nigerien sahel however using commercial high spatial resolution datasets is difficult particularly in resource constrained african regions such datasets are mostly used for extensive and thorough projects or by the private sector which have the acquisition capacity some studies have also demonstrated the validity of eo data for surface water dynamics and their role in wrm in africa becker et al 2018 used the global inundation extent multi satellite giems technique to examine seasonal patterns of surface water dynamics in the congo river basin crb the technique combines microwave visible and nir data to provide global surface water extent and storage which has been validated against in situ measurements overall it appeared that both datasets improved fundamental understanding of the crb and wrm similarly zimba et al 2018 used modis data to analyze inundation trends in zambia s barotse floodplain with landsat and ground truthing for validation as well as pearson r to assess inundation correlations between discharge and water level strong correlations were found between inundation extent and water level r 0 86 as well as inundation extent and discharge r 0 89 demonstrating how remote sensing based approaches reduced the use of costly and time consuming field based surface water monitoring jason and topex poseidon on the other hand have primarily been used in oceanography although significant progress has been made in monitoring surface water extent in africa using satellite based technologies more work remains to be done to operationalize these techniques and contribute to the generation of meaningful information that can be used to inform water management strategies and key decision making in addition the role of drones and drone technologies must be considered in validating satellite based estimates 4 5 satellite based surface runoff streamflow estimations streamflow river discharge measurements are primarily done through river gauging stations river discharge is typically calculated at one point along a river using a mechanical current meter acoustic doppler current profiler to measure the velocity and develop a rating curve makapela et al 2015 runoff models also provide valuable information on surface flows for example the pitman model which is rainfall runoff model estimates monthly discharge using rainfall and potential et data hughes 2007 hughes et al 2014 likewise wetspass batelaan and de smedt 2001 simulates potential runoff based on vegetation soil texture slope and groundwater saturated areas unfortunately these models rely heavily on in situ measurements and discharge monitoring infrastructure in africa which is still sparse and underdeveloped sivapalan et al 2003 kapangaziwiri et al 2009 nevertheless by incorporating cutting edge eo data these models may become more accurate and fill in the gaps of unmeasured areas bjerklie et al 2005 river discharge estimates cannot currently be directly measured using remotely sensed data however because remote sensing can provide other estimates such as rainfall soil moisture and land cover land use lc lu rainfall runoff models will no longer need to rely heavily on in situ measurements hrachowitz et al 2013 similarly by combining in situ data satellite imagery and digital elevation models dems the soil conservation service curve number scs cn jacobs et al 2003 and stream ted king et al 2005 models have shown promise in predicting runoff estimates although the scs cn method has become the standard practical toolset for estimating an event based rainfall runoff response it is however limited to specific geographic regions and land use types due to its empirical origins furthermore it does not account for the spatial variability of runoff as a result its applications in african settings have been limited in favour of new spatially explicit approaches such as the stream ted s runoff erosion model king et al 2005 considerable studies have therefore utilised the use of these spatially explicit approach for run off modelling for example liebe et al 2009 developed a rainfall runoff model based on thornthwaite mather s water balance model to estimate reservoir volumes in west africa the model combined envisat asar data with srtm data and where possible reservoir gauge data overall the study reported that the model accurately reproduced observed runoff generation and could be used as a runoff gauge to better understand the landscape s hydrology similarly bjerklie et al 2005 estimated in bank river discharge using aerial photography orthophotos topographical maps dems and ers 1 sar data to extract river channel width and slope along the missouri river in california surface velocity was calculated using a jpl technique and corrected for the bragg resonant effect the bias effect on velocity estimates of wind driven waves after calibration the mean accuracy of discharge estimates was within 10 of observed discharge their study illustrated relatively accurate estimates of in bank river discharge could be measured from eo data unfortunately this approach has not yet been tested along southern african rivers but as more eo data becomes available figs 5 and 8 future studies will be able to use these methodologies in africa various methods for estimating run off have been tested and the results are detailed in the study by mushore et al 2019 who reviewed literature on the progress and challenges of rainfall runoff modelling and the contributions of remote sensing in africa the review highlighted the works by andersen et al 2002 who used precipitation estimates from meteosat and lai from noaas avhrr to improve hydrograph simulations to derive runoff characteristics hong et al 2007 and mahmoud 2014 used the curve number approach with trmm and landsat coupled dem data as inputs nonetheless the limited research on the use of remote sensing data to quantify runoff has frequently used coarse datasets that fail to capture the spatial variations that play critical roles in determining surface runoff table 2 more emphasis should be placed on using medium to fine resolution sensors to estimate surface runoff 4 6 satellite estimations of water quality african scientists have extensively monitored water quality in lakes and dams using remotely sensed data highlights from some recent studies that successfully used remotely sensed methods for water quality monitoring are summarised here abdelmalik 2018 used eo data for monitoring water quality into three types based on spatial resolution high resolution data moderate resolution data and regional global resolution data dube et al 2015 examined the use of remote sensing applications for monitoring water quality in sub saharan african lakes shekede et al 2008 and dube et al 2014a for example used landsat derived vegetation indices to map the invasive growth of hyacinth and aquatic weeds in lake chivero and lake respectively both studies showed high levels of accuracy as well as an increase in hyacinth and aquatic weeds in these lakes dlamini et al 2016 used modis to measure chlorophyll a chl a concentrations as a proxy for predicting pollution levels in zimbabwe s lake chivero a time series from 1985 to 2010 revealed that the major contributors to lake chivero s pollution levels were decreases in surrounding forestry and increases in urbanisation dlamini et al 2016 gholizadeh et al 2016 examined the progress of remote sensing in measuring water quality parameters such as chl a coloured dissolved organic matters cdom secchi disk depth sdd turbidity total suspended sediments tss water temperature wt total phosphorus tp sea surface salinity sss dissolved oxygen do biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod the review stated that airborne sensors are better suited for retrieving water quality parameters on smaller waterbodies whereas satellite sensors are better suited for larger waterbodies while also emphasizing the power of hyperspectral imagery which can record up to 200 spectral channels for detecting numerous water quality parameters abdelmalik 2018 used aster data to map the spatial distribution of temperature turbidity ph salinity tds ec total alkalinity total organic carbon toc and ortho phosphorus in egypt s qaroun lake the results revealed a significant correlation between the two datasets for all water quality parameters this study demonstrated a quick low cost and convenient method for obtaining the spatial distribution of significant water quality parameters using eo data various eo techniques for monitoring water quality by estimating optically active water parameters have been developed these are i physiochemical parameters such as electrical conductivity ph temperature salinity and total dissolved solids ii organic parameters such as bod and toc and iii microbiological parameters such as chlorophyll and phytoplankton abdelmalik 2018 recently launched satellites such as sentinel 3 also hold great promise soomets et al 2020 similarly sagan et al 2020 reviewed recent advances in remote sensing for monitoring water quality identifying current system and estimation method limitations and suggesting future improvements over 200 water quality samples were collected from 43 different locations in the united states to test for blue green algae phycocyanin bga pc chl a do specific conductivity sc fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom turbidity and pollution sediments the in situ data were compared to proximal spectral data ground based hyperspectral imagery and data from the landsat 8 and sentinel 2 satellites because of atmospheric interference and short revisit times proximal spectra data and ground based hyperspectral imagery had higher accuracy than satellite data as a result multi sensor data fusion and cloud computing may be a promising strategy for forecasting future water pollution outbreaks table 2 it is important to note that the majority of water quality research in africa have focused on mapping phytoplankton which is regarded as the greatest threat to the quality of inland water bodies matthews et al 2010 matthews et al 2012 used envisat s meris data to detect trophic status chl a cyanobacterial blooms surface scum and floating vegetation across two inland water bodies in the western cape and gauteng provinces the study demonstrated that chl a estimates from top of atmosphere meris data provided significant accuracy by utilizing fluorescence and backscatter absorption related features in the red and nir wavelengths of meris however combining landsat 8 and sentinel data improved the results fig 9 shows a summary of widely used eo programs and satellite missions for measuring water quality parameters their sources as well as temporal and spatial resolution 4 7 land cover land use classification from satellite data changes in the hydrological cycle are driven by global effects of land cover and vegetation land cover changes affect precipitation and temperature patterns whereas vegetation cover changes affect et and surface energy patterns chase et al 2000 remote sensing has emerged as the single most effective technique for better understanding the dynamics of land cover thompson 1996 for accurate monitoring of land cover change remote sensing techniques can repeatedly group various land features into clusters based on their spectral similarities fig 10 similarly vegetation dynamics can be retrieved using microwave sensors based on their spectral properties liu et al 2011 in 1996 the first south african national land cover map nlc 94 was published using landsat data the map contained 31 classes that were captured as a digital vector dataset fairbanks et al 2000 similarly in 2009 south african national biodiversity institute sanbi released an nlc map that made use of a mosaic of products as well as thematic products created by the agricultural research council arc dws and eskom schoeman et al 2013 eo products such as avhrr s global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms project gimms and modis s enhanced vegetation index provide long term time series of ndvi lai and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar evi these products have been evaluated based on their accuracy for global long term monitoring of vegetation cover change huete et al 2002 and data enhancement pinzon and tucker 2014 however advanced satellites such as sentinel 2 have also provided unprecedented information for deriving vegetation characteristics being the first sensor to include bands in the red edge spectrum making it suitable for estimating canopy chlorophyll and nitrogen content clevers and gitelson 2013 similarly nasa s ecostress provides groundbreaking data on forest canopy height vertical structure and surface elevation with research applications on carbon balance and forest structure however this data is still limited and more information is required fig 10 summarizes major eo and satellite missions for lclu and vegetation monitoring as well as the key studies that used these data for wrm chang et al 2018 state that remotely sensed land use change detection techniques are shifting from planning and management to land use change impacts and driving factors this is extremely beneficial in terms of wrm because it will aid in more efficient management strategies and the protection of water resources nonetheless attention should be paid to the accuracy of land use classification provided by eo technology fortunately databases such as globeland30 make significant contributions to the study of international lulc changes chang et al 2018 landsat and modis have also contributed a wealth of global long term lulc changes matlhodi et al 2019 used landsat data to assess lulc changes in botswana between 1984 and 2015 the study demonstrated dramatic increases in built up areas and bare land as well as significant decreases in shrub land and tree savannah similarly al hamdan et al 2017 used landsat and modis derived lulc products to monitor lulc changes and their potential environmental drivers precipitation temperature across africa as well as a two level verification process to ensure data accuracy chirps and modis were used to assess whether precipitation and temperature changes were significant drivers of lulc changes respectively all areas are experiencing significant deforestation and wetland loss as well as crop and grass expansion ultimately al hamdan et al 2017 discovered that non environmental factors such as socioeconomics and government policies were the primary drivers of lulc changes finally kamwi et al 2017 discovered no previous evidence on whether protected resources in southern africa are affected by lulc changes and attempted to fill this gap using landsat imagery across the zambezi region between 1984 and 2010 their research revealed clear patterns of lulc change by land tenure regime which has a direct impact on natural land cover resources and suggests that more tactical lulc monitoring strategies should be implemented lulc change have been extensively studied across africa using single date and multi date high to coarse resolution applications however the majority of these studies concentrated on the catchment to sub catchment scale with a few exceptions on the regional and national levels furthermore while there are numerous satellites available for land cover mapping the majority of these have spatial resolutions ranging from 1 to 50 m fig 10 however some of these are not readily available or accessible and are heavily influenced by cloud cover particularly in the tropics where clouds are often persistent causing spectral mixing in heterogeneous environment table 2 4 8 groundwater estimation wrm requires an understanding of the patterns and magnitude of ground and surface water interactions meijerink et al 2007 webb et al 2008 this is because groundwater resources are frequently unsustainable due to low recharge rates and declining water tables caused by high abstraction levels gibson et al 2009 rodell et al 2018 groundwater exploration is primarily accomplished through the measurement of groundwater levels piezometers dip meters and wells the assessment of groundwater quality isotopes carbon 14 and chloride mass balance geochemical sampling or seepage measurements liu et al 2016 temperature measurements are also a reliable indicator of groundwater surface water interaction because groundwater temperatures are relatively constant while surface water temperatures vary meijerink et al 2007 however the lack of comprehensive groundwater data across other parts of the continent has hampered its impact and effectiveness indirect methods can infer changes in water storage by measuring changes in the earth s gravity field with satellite gravimetry or surface elevation with radar interferometry gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites from nasa measure changes in the gravity field as well as changes in terrestrial water storage fig 5 changes in the two satellites distance and speed are caused by changes in the gravity field caused by terrestrial and other water storage variations tapley et al 2004 these variations can be used to explain changes in groundwater depletion the use of grace in understanding groundwater has been successful although fine scale applications remain a challenge in this regard the review concluded that grace has been widely used to assess groundwater depletion for large aquifers in various regions for example grace has been used in several studies to better understand water storage in africa hassan and jin 2016 ramjeawon et al 2022 scanlon et al 2022 these studies evaluated grace for variations in water storage in the zambezi okavango and volta basins their findings show a significant decrease in water storage particularly during drought periods implying a good agreement between grace derived estimates and rainfall variability grace was also used by scanlon et al 2022 to assess the spatial temporal variations in water storage for major african aquifers the findings revealed a high level of agreement between grace water storage estimates and human activities irrigation climate variability el nino other eo techniques involve mapping geological features that influence groundwater recharge and discharge meijerink et al 2007 mapping geological lineaments for example may indicate shallow groundwater discharge zones whereas drainage density may indicate a possible groundwater recharge zone makapela et al 2015 previous research has leveraged satellite imagery to gain insights into groundwater exploration one notable study conducted by műnch et al 2013 demonstrated the application of earth observation eo techniques in quantifying recharge through the utilization of water balance relationships the study quantified groundwater recharge and discharge zones using estimates from precipitation p and et satellite products műnch et al 2013 compared three et models which are etmodis mod16 and pitman rainfall runoff data to calculate spatial regional recharge the application of p et clearly identified potential recharge and discharge zones adding value to the conceptualization of hydrogeology along south africa s west coast similarly lekula and lubczynski 2019 used remotely sensed data to build integrated hydrological models ihms to better understand the hydrology of the central kalahari basin the model characterized spatio temporal water flux dynamics provided annual water balances and evaluated groundwater resource dynamics and replenishment using modflow nwt and remotely sensed p pet dem lulc and soil data rainfall surface morphology unsaturated zone thickness and vegetation characteristics were also discovered to be primary determinants of groundwater dynamics by although these studies provided useful insight on ground water dynamics they were not dedicated to quantifying groundwater parameters from remotely sensed datasets the grace satellites on the other hand have provided independent monthly models of the earth s gravity field and variations in these values have been widely used on a continental scale to estimate groundwater storage variations rodell et al 2018 furthermore grace has been directly related to groundwater masses where long term depletion is occurring wahr et al 2004 ramjeawon et al 2022 as well as being validated to show a close correspondence to in situ groundwater measurements famiglietti et al 2011 bonsor et al 2018 used grace and land surface models lsms to estimate changes in terrestrial water storage tws and groundwater storage gws in 12 african sedimentary aquifers between 2002 and 2016 their findings demonstrated seasonal variations in gws estimates from tws unfortunately when compared to in situ data the tws grace and lsm results were less plausible in africa s semi arid and hyper arid basins indicating that more research into in situ observations and lsms is needed 4 9 satellite remote sensing for monitoring drought floods and extreme climate events in africa droughts and floods are common in africa with severity varying by region as a result researchers and countries have been working on methods frameworks and policies to improve drought and flood mitigation and adaptation strategies in recent years timely and spatially explicit information on the effects of drought and flooding in various regions has become critical bhaga et al 2020 mushore et al 2019 various satellite datasets such as dems multispectral passive microwave observations radar and aerial photographs have since been used to map vulnerable and hotspots in africa de groeve 2010 khan et al 2011 revilla romero et al 2016 few of these studies have been conducted at regional scale for instance mushore et al 2019 reviewed the literature on surface runoff modelling in southern africa and the paper showed how the use of remotely sensed data has replaced the use of hydrological models and ground based measurements bhaga et al 2020 on the other hand investigated long term scientific advancements made in drought monitoring using remote sensing including its applicability in observing climate variability and the hydrological effects of drought on surface water resources in sub saharan africa so far different satellite datasets namely dems multispectral passive microwave observations and radar as well as aerial photographs in conjunction with in situ field observations have been used widely to map droughts and floods in africa a majority of these studies have been applied at river basin scale for instance asare kyei et al 2015 used hydrological and statistical models along with remotely sensed data to define the geographic boundaries of flood hazard zones in a number of communities in ghana burkina faso and benin the method entails estimating peak runoff concentrations at various elevations followed by the use of statistical techniques to create a flood hazard index fhi however there is a need for further research that integrates multi data sources to model floods and determine possible hotspots as well as provide early warning systems droughts in africa on the other hand have been thoroughly researched as noted in the review by bhaga et al 2020 although the studies highlighted significant scientific progress in remote sensing applications in drought monitoring issues of scale operationalization of technologies and methods for wall to wall mapping the provision of early warning systems remain critical if the impact of remote sensing in africa is to be realized 5 remote sensing initiatives and projects for water resource management 5 1 wois and the tiger initiative when esa realized that eo technology could help with wrm issues it launched the tiger initiative which supports african eo capacity for wrm by collaborating with african water authorities and utilizing eo technologies guzinski et al 2014 crestaz et al 2017 tshikeba kabantu et al 2018 tiger aimed to empower african partners to exploit and disseminate eo technology on their own for scientific research wrm programs capacity building training and information and knowledge networking numerous tiger projects have resulted in several scientific publications froehlich 2020 and over 28 eo data processing solutions for african water authorities such as basin wide characterization of land and water resources lake water quality monitoring hydrological modeling and flood forecasting in addition it has spawned other initiatives such as the eo african framework for research innovation communities and applications initiative eoafrica and tiger net since its inception froehlich 2020 the eoafrica program recently adopted a new focus on water and food security by utilizing innovative tools such as cloud computing digital learning and open access sentinel data to collect spatio temporal eo data for use in wrm tiger net was built in close collaboration with european scientists and african water authorities to aid in their decision making crestaz et al 2017 through the water observation and information system wois tiger net supports satellite based assessments and wrm wois was an open source software that uses eo data from qgis to assess water resources this enabled wois to incorporate satellite data for flood monitoring and forecasting water body mapping for irrigation and livestock lake water quality and hydrological modeling tshikeba kabantu et al 2018 used wois to assess the spatial distribution of soil loss and erosion hazards in kinshasa congo by combining remote sensing inputs and soil erosion factors despite providing valuable information indicating that the urban area of kinshasa is more prone to soil erosion wois tended to overestimate soil loss at the local level while underestimating at the regional level the study further reported that effective in situ measurement validations would improve wois outcomes similarly south africa s dws uses wois for water discharge forecasting land cover based water demand mapping and water management related land cover change mapping the dws was able to develop high and medium resolution basin characterization urban sanitation planning support hydrological monitoring and long term seasonal variation of wetlands for the city of cape town region with the aid of wois froehlich 2020 these initiatives make significant contributions to improving water resource monitoring and management in previously data limited environments across africa by integrating eo data and programming techniques 5 2 monitoring for environment and security and africa gmes and africa project since the early 2000s the research and innovation partnership between the european union and the african union has made significant progress in utilizing earth observation eo for monitoring water resources at the continental scale the application of eo data has yielded tangible outcomes in various areas including agriculture flood modeling land degradation wetlands monitoring and water security across africa becker reshef et al 2020 gxokwe et al 2020 one noteworthy collaboration is the puma project also known as the meteorological transition in africa project which has leveraged the meteosat second generation msg satellite to facilitate eo research in africa this ambitious project aimed to transform meteorological services across africa and involved 53 african countries through the puma project african countries and regional centers were equipped with satellite data receiving stations infrastructure technical and thematic training and application support for data acquisition and utilization in various domains the participating countries benefited from initiatives such as puma amesd and gmes africa which promoted the use of eo data for african sustainable development they gained access to essential research equipment to receive continuous direct satellite data software for data processing and product generation e g weather forecasts rainfall estimates fire observations sea surface temperature measurements and training to enhance data utilization the project also fostered collaboration among the countries improving their collective capabilities and providing more effective and user centric services additionally five pilot projects were implemented across the african regional economic communities exploring the operational use of msg data in sustainable development programs furthermore significant financial and research support has been provided through the gmes and africa project to harness eo for monitoring natural resources in africa resulting in a surge in scientific research in this field however despite the benefits and advancements brought about by eo science and applications in africa the continent s utilization and application of eo technology still fall below its potential due to various factors ifejika et al 2023 research surveys indicate that the majority of eo initiatives in africa are driven by external entities while country level expenditures on eo remain limited recent developments such as the african space policy and strategy along with initiatives to establish an eo community of practice in collaboration with african based organizations hold promise in addressing these identified gaps 6 set backs and limitations despite the attractiveness of eo data in wrm there are still challenges when utilizing the information the current abundance of eo data fig 5 for example can frequently make the selection process of appropriate data overwhelming and complex furthermore the specifics of the use of remotely sensed data have a significant impact on the scale and study undertaken each sensor method region and parameter investigated has its own set of limitations van dijk and renzullo 2011 satellite based datasets can be an unappealing alternative due to limitations in return periods spatial resolutions spectral ranges cloud cover instrument failures and development time sheffield et al 2018 furthermore eo data are still primarily used to supplement ground information particularly for wrm due to institutional costs a lack of skilled technicians ground truth data and data continuity eo technology in africa is still far from fully operational fernandez prieto and palazzo 2007 furthermore africa continues to have one of the lowest numbers of wrm publications gxokwe et al 2020 reviews like those by mushore et al 2019 meticulously highlight the limitations of remote sensing in contributing to rainfall runoff modeling current techniques can only map linked parameters of runoff or validate spatial models and hydrologically significant variables not directly map runoff characteristics second due to the high spatiotemporal complexity of runoff there is no obvious set of variables that are universally used to estimate runoff from eo techniques king et al 2005 third advanced remotely sensed data suitable for runoff estimation such as rapideye ikonos worldview and spot 7 are prohibitively expensive van der sande et al 2003 finally there are no comprehensive well defined validation procedures for assessing surface runoff from remotely sensed data mushore et al 2019 when it comes to utilizing eo datasets several researchers have highlighted limitations in their studies winkler et al 2017 identified droughts affecting agriculture in africa using the trmm based standardized precipitation index spi and the modis derived vegetation condition index vci despite its promise modis data only covered a brief period of time whereas trmm data included uncertainties in rainfall estimates furthermore because of ndvi s sensitivity to soil moisture atmospheric interferences and colour it was misinterpreted over sparsely vegetated areas similarly vazifedoust et al 2009 used modis data to identify lai and relative et to improve crop yield forecasts claiming that the products were inaccurate estimators for calculating crop yield likewise sun et al 2010 emphasized that advanced data products like jason 1 and 2 topex poseidon and envisat still lack high velocity measurements and only provide 1 dimensional spot water level data leaving large areas between orbits unobserved overall significant progress is still required to rely more on eo data and less on costly and time consuming in situ measurements nonetheless future projects appear to be promising 7 future research trajectories modeling capabilities are anticipated to advance as new satellites are continuously launched and longer periods of remote sensing data are collected observing systems capability analysis and review oscar a resource tool created by the wmo supports eo applications wmo 2021 all past present and future eo instruments as well as all weather water and climate related applications are covered in detail and with the most recent information by oscar according to some research certain suggestions have been made regarding particular sensor needs for wrm an ideal inland water quality sensor according to sagan et al 2020 should have an imaging spectrometer with 3 10 nm spectral resolution bands from 250 to 1000 nm a minimum of 3 shortwave infrared swir bands for atmospheric correction spatial resolution between 5 and 15 m and as high a resolution as possible similarly sheffield et al 2018 reviewed what they considered to be the most important eo missions that are currently in operation and that are planned for the future below is an explanation of these the meteosat third generation set to launch in 2022 will cover europe and africa with a life expectancy until 2038 the meteosat second generation s work of providing weather forecasts and more accurate monitoring of the atmosphere land surfaces and oceans will be carried on by this program the 2023 launch of biomass will concentrate on measuring the world s forest biomass as well as the topography of the land and glaciers an operational global polar orbiting environmental satellite system called jpss 2 is scheduled to launch in 2022 it will provide time series multispectral data for use in energy and water balance vegetation dynamics and lulc changes by providing more precise images of surface water heights the swot mission scheduled to launch in 2022 will address issues with retrievals of current altimeters biancamaria et al 2016 nasa s hyspiri set to launch in 2023 will provide enhanced monitoring capabilities for inland water applications at 30 m spatial resolution with 214 unique spectral bands in visible and swir regions sagan et al 2020 these products are also being used in new ways fusion techniques which integrate and combine various remotely sensed datasets with one another and with in situ data show great promise this has already been demonstrated in studies like those by long et al 2020 who combined in situ lst measurements with modis data to increase lst retrievals in all weather scenarios and deliver precise soil moisture and et estimates for wrm similar to this abowarda et al 2021 combined in situ measurements with modis and landsat data to improve the accuracy of soil moisture estimates the processing of eo data is also benefiting greatly from ml algorithms like artificial neural networks ann support vector machines svm minimum distance classification maximum likelihood classification mlc regression tree based algorithms isodata and k means clustering rodríguez caballero et al 2022 the analysis of eo data for wrm is made possible by these advancements in data modelling or analysis some african regions have already conducted studies using these cutting edge machine learning techniques for instance gaffoor et al 2022 modelled groundwater levels for the shire valley alluvial aquifer within the zambezi basin in southern africa using ensemble and deep learning according to their research the long short term memory neural network outperformed the gradient boosting decision tree in terms of highlighting changes in water level the performance of five new hybrid ensemble machine learning techniques was compared by ijlil et al 2022 when evaluating the level of groundwater pollution in morocco drastic random forest rf drastic svm drastic multilayer perceptron mlp drastic rf svm and drastic rf mlp were the methodologies used according to the study the rastic rf mlp performed better than the other models artificial intelligence ai petascale image processing techniques and cloud computing such as google earth engine gee open up new possibilities for the fusion and integration of multisource data mahdianpari et al 2019 using indicators of dryness moisture greenness and desertification wu et al 2022 created a remote sensing ecological index rsei model using modis data in the gee platform to assess future trends throughout the sahel region of africa ecological deterioration in the sahel is predicted to occur as precipitation decreases monerie et al 2020 and it has been suggested that the great green wall project could change the predicted values future developments are likely to build on these strategies and offer more precise and timely information which is essential for wrm 8 conclusion this work examined advancements achieved in remote sensing applications for monitoring and managing water resources in africa the paper covered a wide range of applications including precipitation estimation land surface temperature analysis soil moisture assessment surface water extent measurement surface runoff and streamflow analysis water quality evaluation land cover land use mapping and groundwater analysis the review further emphasized on the evolution of remote sensing methodologies particularly in rainfall estimation water quality assessment and groundwater and runoff modeling overall this work underscored the importance of sensor availability analytical models and observational data in facilitating water resource monitoring at various scales challenges related to in situ hydrological monitoring networks limited long term rainfall and climate data and the lack of high resolution spatial and temporal data were however found to have affected the accurate calibration validation and monitoring of hydrological processes in africa despite the scarcity of in situ data the significance of earth observation in enhancing our understanding of africa s hydrology cannot be overstated to further advance this field there is a pressing need to increase the adoption and application of remote sensing techniques particularly in the accurate estimation of various components of the hydrological cycle at varying scales future research should prioritize the integration and assimilation of data from various sources while leveraging advanced technologies like big data analytics cloud computing and machine learning this comprehensive review serves as an indispensable reference for researchers policymakers and practitioners involved in the sustainable management of water resources in africa

paper acknowledgements we express our sincere gratitude to dr siyamthanda gxokwe the anonymous reviewers and the editor for their invaluable contributions to this paper furthermore we extend our appreciation to the global monitoring for environment and security and africa gmes and africa for their financial support which was instrumental in the successful completion of the sasscal wemast phase ii project 
1703,the management of an urban drainage system uds is a complex task as it requires extensive knowledge about precipitation regime hydrological features of the catchment hydraulic characteristics of the drainage network and information about the water use by the served inhabitants complex semi distributed hydrological and physically based hydraulic models are nowadays available to summarise such information and run simulations however in many cases the uncertainty of the available hydrological information hampers the use of complex models hence simple models with few parameters and small computational effort may be preferable especially for uds management problems requiring the execution of many simulations this paper proposes a convenient approach to define effective lumped simplified models sms of udss the parameters of which can be estimated directly from cartographic information for several case studies of uds with different morphological and topological characteristics sms were built capable of reproducing the hydrographs provided by available semi distributed detailed models dms assumed as benchmark in absence of measured hydrographs to this aim the swmm simulation software was used and the sm lumped parameters were calibrated by maximising the goodness of fit between the hydrograph of the dm and of the sm the results show that sms satisfactorily predict the hydrographs for all the case studies and that robust relationships between the calibrated parameters and morphological and topological characteristics of the uds can be established this suggests that sms can be used by decision makers for preliminary design planning studies and management problems of udss as their parameters can be soundly estimated from cartographic information an example of application of sms to combined sewer overflow prediction is also presented keywords simplified hydrological modelling hydrological parameters lumped hydrological model data availability

interaction with other systems chocat et al 2001 the variability of the operation conditions over time and the numerosity of interconnected or interwoven parts sivakumar and singh 2012 thus it is very important to have one or more models of the uds to predict the behaviour of the system under different conditions butler et al 2018 and at different locations as it is difficult to fully understand the governing physics of the problem and to correctly interpret and implement them in an integrated model mitchell et al 2007 rauch et al 2002 generally udss design and management problems cover three main aspects hydrology hydraulics and water quality when modelling these aspects are synthesised with different modules as follows a hydrological module is responsible for modelling the rainfall runoff processes accounting for precipitation and temperature regimes hydrological characteristics of the catchment losses due to infiltration evaporation and other processes a hydraulic module is responsible for routing the flows through the wastewater and or stormwater convey system conduits and pipes manholes overflows outlets the storage facilities first flush detention basins online or offline storages to manage flood events and the pumping stations a water quality module is responsible for modelling the dynamics of pollutants through the system regarding the hydrological module rainfall runoff models are the standard tool devia et al 2015 granata et al 2016 one can choose among several solutions well presented by salvadore et al 2015 lumped conceptual models provide high versatility while sacrificing spatial details and physical description while semi distributed physically based models are very detailed and are supposed to be more precise but they are not as easy to handle as lumped models regarding the hydraulic module many software tools rely on the numerical solution of the saint venant equations chow 1959 for the gradually varied unsteady flow conditions as per the water quality aspects a recent review jia et al 2021 presents the most widely used modelling approaches generally both design and management of the infrastructures within an uds require an extensive knowledge about the characteristics of the urban catchment however uds preliminary design planning studies and many management activities do not require the knowledge of the flow characteristics in every conduit but rather a reliable estimation of the discharge at specific locations for example when studying combined sewer overflows csos it is important to estimate the discharge of wastewater and stormwater in the upstream conduit but it is not strictly necessary to calculate the flow in all the other conduits of the catchment upstream of the cso a similar argument may be done for storages pumping stations and other flow regulation devices european and national regulations are increasingly stringent on environmental issues regarding the udss as a result the water utilities are prompted to be engaged and act on the theme and csos are seen as a main source of pollution especially because it is very difficult to predict discharged volumes of polluted water and mass of pollutants and their behaviour shows great variability with respect to the hydrological characteristics of served urban catchments farina et al 2022 in this sense cso mitigation is often an issue addressed by modellers however the dependence of the cso behaviour from different hydrological parameters is still largely uninvestigated and one of the difficulties of conducting a cso parametric analyses lies in the over parametrization of dms using sms for cso studies could free researchers or modellers from this problem helping to advance the scientific knowledge on cso behaviour complex detailed models dms usually present both hydraulic and hydrologic modules the former involves the simulation of the flow characteristics i e flow depth and velocity in the sewer channels of the uds which requires complete information on the hydraulic and geometric characteristics and on the topographic layout of the conduits when this information is lacking expensive field surveys are needed furthermore the calibration of the large number of parameters may lack in uniqueness of the set of parameters that produce a good fit with observed flow okiria et al 2022 spear 1997 meaning that different sets of parameters can lead to similar optimal solutions equifinality thesis beven 2006 indeed in preliminary design or in management problems a lumped simplified model sm of the entire uds or of a part of it may be of help to ease the work a sm is here intended as a hierarchical surrogate model mahmoodian et al 2018 with minimal complexity where elements of the uds are deliberately neglected or heavily approximated for simplicity of use extended areas of the urban catchment are treated as single units beven 2012 and the hydraulics of the drainage network is not computed sms can be robust since they have few describing parameters in other words the benefit of using sms lies in the simplification of the numerical modelling together with the significant reduction in the number of parameters to be assigned in the literature the problem of whether using distributed models or lumped models has been tackled for large scale catchments by different authors some papers showed that lumped models offer equivalent results to distributed models e g yao et al 1998 vilaseca et al 2022 dos santos et al 2018 while others found the opposite e g paudel et al 2011 kaleris and langousis 2017 thus the choice of a highly detailed semi distributed model over a simple lumped model is not trivial and it needs to be justified okiria et al 2022 especially for smaller scale problems like udss also some studies attempted to use surrogate modelling of uds to reduce the computational cost of simulations or for optimization purposes kwon et al 2020 langeveld et al 2013 ledergerber et al 2019 seyedashraf et al 2021 thrysøe et al 2019 van daal rombouts et al 2016 however surrogate models usually mathematical black boxes are inherently case specific and cannot be easily generalised the objective of this paper is therefore to investigate the capability of sms the parameters of which could be easily assigned from cartographic information based on literature indications to reliably model the hydrograph from relevant portions of the uds clustered as one or few catchments characterized by few lumped parameters different udss case studies from the technical literature for which a detailed hydrologic hydraulic model dm was also available were simulated with the freeware and open source software swmm the parameters of the sms were initially calibrated as those allowing the best fit between the sm simulated flood hydrograph and the one provided by the dm assumed as benchmark in absence of measured hydrographs the calibrated parameters which in all cases allowed the sm to closely reproduce the hydrographs of the dm exhibited robust relationships with some morphologic and topological characteristics extracted from maps or geographic information system gis of the studied udss the obtained relationships linking lumped sm parameters with topographic information about the uds can be of use to modellers in all cases where few information are available about the uds because a reliable sm can be built directly from the cartography and the indications of technical literature among the various possible applications of the sms especially convenient in scenario analyses or extended period simulations an example of the proposed methodology is applied to cso prediction the cso volumes from the sms and the dms have been compared both at yearly scale and at event scale showing that sms succeed in correctly predicting csos 2 materials and methods the methodology described in this section aims at showing how a simplified model sm of the uds the parameters of which can be directly assigned from cartographic information and which neglects the hydraulic simulation of the flow through the network conduits provides reliable estimates of the runoff for several real udss available in the literature first the storm water management model swmm with which all the simulations are carried out is briefly introduced second the development of the sm of a uds and how to assign plausible ranges for its parameters are described for several case studies of udss from the literature for which detailed models dms had been developed the parameters of the sms are calibrated within the assigned ranges by minimising the deviation of the hydrographs from those obtained with existing dms corresponding to the same rain events assumed as benchmark in absence of direct discharge measurements finally the existence of relationships linking the calibrated sm parameters with morphologic and topologic characteristics of the udss is investigated showing that the sm parameters could be closely estimated directly from cartographic information the steps of the study are summarised in fig 1 2 1 simplified modelling approach with swmm the storm water management model swmm was chosen for the simulations as it is the most widely used software for hydrological and hydraulic modelling for urban catchments owolabi et al 2022 yuan et al 2022 swmm is flexible as it allows describing a catchment with different degrees of detail depending on the number of sub catchments used for its representation this software uses a nonlinear reservoir conceptual model chen and shubinski 1971 to estimate runoff from an idealised rectangular sub catchment this latter is divided in three sub areas an impervious area with no depression storages an impervious area with depression storages and a pervious area with depression storages owing to the short duration of the simulated rain events the modules describing evaporation infiltration and groundwater as well as the relevant model parameters were not considered in this study basically the computational scheme for the calculation of the surface runoff from each of the three areas consists in the iterative resolution of a mass balance equation coupled with the manning equation in the manning equation the surface runoff is idealised as the flow through a wide rectangular channel of cross area a x width w slope s manning coefficient n and height d d s where d is the height of the water and d s is the height of the depression storages with w d then the flow rate q is calculated as qa where q is the flow per unit surface eq 1 and a is the size of each of the relevant sub areas the mass balance equation and the manning equation are applied separately for the three kinds of surfaces that compose the schematisation of the sub catchment then the resulting runoff is the sum of the three contributes 1 q w s an d d s 5 3 a simplified modelling approach consisting in representing a part of a real uds placed upstream of a section of interest e g where specific hydraulic devices are installed such as csos tanks pumping stations through one or few lumped sub catchments is presented fig 2 since udss may include many hydraulic structures like storages sewer overflows and pumping stations the whole uds may be represented by more than a single sm each placed upstream of those infrastructures and consisting of 1 one or more lumped sub catchments depending on the number of rainfall inputs each lumped sub catchment will be attributed a rain input from one rain gauge 2 a dummy conduit conveying the modelled discharge q sm the conduit has fictitious characteristics in a way that it has a negligible influence on the hydrograph q sm thus only the hydrologic module of swmm is used since the target of the sms is the estimation of the runoff of urban catchments only the hydrologic module of swmm is used to model the discharge by means of a dummy conduit regarding the first point since the rain is the major driver of urban runoff processes it would be preferable to retain the information about the spatial distribution of the precipitation when available this can be more important for large catchments in which the spatial variability of the rain could have a big influence on the discharge the description of the uds with a small number of lumped subcatchments together with the neglection of the hydraulic simulation of the flows through the single channels entails a substantial reduction of the number of parameters of the proposed sm hence the runoff can be modelled without the recourse to time consuming and expensive survey campaigns the sm of an uds needs to be represented in swmm with appropriate values of the hydrological parameters of eq 1 so to closely reproduce the behaviour of the uds regarding a and s the sm retains respectively the area and the mean slope of the relevant sub part of the uds both easily retrieved from topographic maps through any geographic information system gis the other parameters may result extremely variable for different udss hence their ranges of variation were defined around plausible values extracted either from maps and satellite images of the uds or from the technical literature e g rossman and huber 2016 yen 2001 specifically the values for the uds were assumed as follows the width w was assumed as the ratio between the area and the length of the main drainage channel of the uds rossman and huber 2016 the percentage of the impervious surface i was evaluated from satellite images as the ratio between the covered surfaces and the area of the uds the typical values of the depression storage for the impervious surfaces and for the pervious surfaces were assumed equal to ds i 1 m m and ds p 1 m m respectively the typical values of the manning coefficient for the impervious surfaces and for the pervious surfaces were assumed equal to n i 1 60 s m 1 3 and n p 1 7 s m 1 3 respectively for the parameter n i large variations were not expected thus it was kept fixed to the typical value this simplification was also made possible by the fact that in eq 1 the effects on the runoff of w and n balance out the possible ranges of variation of the other parameters were defined by multiplying the typical value of each parameter p by the coefficient f p so that the sm parameters would be w s m f w w i s m f i i d s i s m f d s i d s i d s p s m f d s p d s p n p s m f n p n p in this way the value of the coefficient f p directly indicates how much the parameter p of the sm deviates from the value extracted from the uds maps table 1 reports the ranges of the coefficients considered for the definition of the ranges of variations of the parameters for the parameter n p the inverse of the coefficient 1 f n p was considered the coefficient ranges investigated for model calibration were conveniently limited so to obtain plausible values of the parameters avoiding those without physical relevance then ten values were assigned to each calibration coefficient f p and therefore to each calibration parameter linearly sampling them inside the relevant ranges listed in table 1 therefore the investigated solution space consisted of the cartesian product of the ranges of values of the calibration parameters with cardinality n 10 5 2 2 calibration of the sm as it will be described in section 2 4 the proposed methodology was applied to several case studies of udss retrieved from the literature for which a dm had been developed with swmm as in most cases the measured hydrographs used to develop the dm of the uds were not available the hydrograph q dm provided by the dm was assumed as benchmark a calibration process was then conducted to identify the parameters w sm i sm d s i s m d s p s m and n p s m that allowed minimising the deviation of the hydrograph q sm estimated by the simplified model from q dm for each case study a different rainfall event was selected for the calibration and an additional event was also used for the validation different objective functions can be adopted to quantify the difference between the flow q dm calculated with the dm and the flow q sm calculated with the sm in this paper the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 eq 2 to be maximized is showed since it is one of the most used metrics in hydrological applications biondi et al 2012 perin et al 2020 2 nse 1 i 1 n t q dm i q sm i 2 i 1 n t q dm i q dm 2 in eq 2 q dm i and q sm i are respectively the flow values of the dm hydrograph and of the sm hydrograph at the time i δ t where δ t is the simulation time step the number of time steps is n t t δ t where t is the simulation duration q dm is the mean value of the dm hydrograph n simulations were carried out in swmm for each case study given the number of the simulations to be run it was chosen to implement a framework in the python programming language using swmm api pichler 2022 version 0 4 21 to automate several tasks specifically this python package allows to read and manipulate swmm input files run swmm simulations and read the binary output files generated in this study the original epa swmm version 5 2 3 was used as the core engine of the computations details about the computer configuration used can be found in additional data after running all the simulations each runoff time series q sm j from the j th simulation being j 1 n was compared with the runoff time series q dm and the of was evaluated 2 3 estimating sm parameters from uds maps to assess the feasibility of developing the sm without a benchmark hydrograph available for model calibration the existence of relationships linking the parameters obtained through calibration with the major characteristics of the uds was investigated in most situations of practical interest only cartographic and topologic information and satellite images of the uds are available hence the following set of uds characteristics easily readable from maps and satellite images were considered area a average slope s width w percentage of impervious area i horton strahler order horton 1945 strahler 1952 1957 of the drainage network o drainage density d i l i a the summation is extended to the lengths l i of all the conduits of the uds the determination coefficient r 2 of either linear p κ x λ and power law p α x β functional formats equations was evaluated for any calibrated sm parameter p and uds characteristic x with reference to a set of uds with various characteristics whereas the relationship exhibits a high value of r 2 this indicates that the sm parameter could be directly estimated from the available characteristics of the uds 2 4 case studies the presented approach was tested on case studies retrieved from the scientific literature for which uds characteristics and a validated dm were available having different catchment size characteristics of the sub catchments and rain input the sketches of the uds of the case studies are represented in fig 3 the main features of the dms of the case studies together with the duration and mean intensity of the rainfall event used for the calibration are summarized in table 2 eldoret is a city in kenya with catchment area a 696 5 h a average elevation 2200 m and a subtropical highland climate koppen 1936 the uds dm was obtained from abraham metto et al 2021 luleå is a coastal city of northern sweden with average elevation 6 m and a subarctic climate koppen 1936 two case studies were obtained from the uds dm broekhuizen et al 2020 2021 of a small catchment with area a 10 2 h a bellinge is a village in odense denmark with average elevation 13 m and a temperate oceanic climate koppen 1936 six case studies were obtained from the uds dm pedersen et al 2021a 2021b of bellinge this latter having a total area a 274 h a according to the defined ranges of the calibration coefficients f p the corresponding ranges of the parameters considered for the sm calibration are reported in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the simplified models overall the performance of the simplified approach gave satisfactory results in terms of goodness of fit between the hydrographs q sm from the calibrated sms and the hydrographs q dm for the considered hyetographs the histogram of fig 4 shows the obtained optimal values of nse eq 2 for each case study and the average value of nse 0 87 with the minimum 0 77 for the case study bellinge 6 and the maximum 0 95 for the case study bellinge 3 it is worth reiterating that the maximisation of the nse allowed to identify the set of parameters that reduced the deviation of the hydrographs of the proposed simplified approach from those of the dm taken as a benchmark in fact the hydrographs q sm for all the case studies resulted close to the hydrographs q dm both for the peak discharge and the peak timing for example for bellinge 5 fig 5 with nse 0 89 the discharges of the first and the second peaks are underestimated by only 8 9 and 11 8 respectively while the first peak time is anticipated by only 1 min and the second peak time is perfectly predicted the hydrographs of all the other case studies are given in the appendix the good performance of the calibrated sms is confirmed also for rain events other than those used for calibration for example the calibrated sm of bellinge 5 was used to simulate the hydrograph of a different rain event and compared with the hydrograph predicted by the dm fig 6 the nse was 0 87 with a reduction of only 0 02 with respect to the rain event used for calibration although the main advantage of using sms instead of dms lies in the significantly reduced number of parameters to be assigned it also results in great computational advantages in terms of required simulation time larger or more complex udss would benefit the most of these advantages for example the simulation of the bellinge case studies for a period of one month with the sm would require 5 s while with the dm it would take 4200 s more details about the computational gain are given in table 4 the computational advantage of running sms is particularly useful in scenario analyses and long simulations like those for climate change effect assessment 3 2 parameters of the calibrated simplified models for each case study the best sets of calibration coefficients f p and the corresponding parameter values i e those maximizing the nse between the hydrographs q dm and q sm are listed respectively in table 5 and table 6 also the group of parameters w s n i appearing in the manning equation eq 1 was calculated it is worth noting that the optimal values of nse were very close to 1 where f p 1 represents the condition for which the parameters of the sm are deduced by the cartographic analysis while the nse value drops as soon as f p deviates from the optimal value to analyse the sensitivity of the sm performance to the different calibrated parameters for all n simulations of each case study the scatter plots of each of the coefficients f p against the nse were represented in this way it was possible to highlight the parameters with the highest importance in the calibration process for instance in fig 7 referring to bellinge 5 the nse varies between 0 14 and 0 90 throughout the entire analysed solution space with the of being most sensitive to w sm through f w and so being the most important parameter to be calibrated for that case study indeed both the maximum red line and the average blue line nse values of the space of solutions for each w sm value show the highest variability compared to the other parameters with a clear maximum of nse 0 90 for f w 0 86 corresponding to w sm 604 m furthermore the spreading of the points over a column referred to a specific value of a single parameter and thus depending on the variations of the others is smaller for the f w than for the other parameters this indicates that the solution is more sensitive to changes in w sm than to any other parameter i sm through f i results the second most important parameter for the sm of bellinge 5 with the maximum nse for f i 1 23 thus i sm 1 23 i dm however it is noteworthy that even if a percentage of imperviousness i sm i dm i e f i 1 0 were assigned the nse value would only decrease by a little thus a reliable hydrograph would be still achievable the latter consideration holds also for all the other case studies the same scatter plots of fig 7 for all the other case studies are given in the appendix for all the case studies referred to bellinge and luleå d s p s m and n p s m seem to have no influence on the output of the simulations while their influence is very small for eldoret 1 case study the width and the imperviousness were the most important parameters for calibration for all the case studies 3 3 relationships between calibrated sm parameters and uds characteristics an important aspect of the proposed approach to develop a reliable sm of the uds is the estimation of the few required parameters in this respect the achievement through calibration of a set of parameters close to those directly deducible from the cartographies and capable of providing hydrographs very close to those obtained with the dms would confirm the validity and the robustness of the proposed sms in most cases only geometric and topologic information about the uds is available hence it is not possible to rely on benchmark hydrographs to calibrate the model of the uds in this usual situation the identification of general relationships linking the parameters of the calibrated sm with easily obtainable morphologic characteristics of the uds would make possible to develop a reliable sm also in absence of measurements of rainfall and runoff to this aim the existence of linear or power law relationships between the uds characteristics described in section 2 4 summarized in table 2 for the case studies and the calibrated sm parameters table 6 was investigated the following relationships characterised by high values of the determination coefficient r 2 were found the calibrated percentage of imperviousness i sm is highly correlated with the percentage of imperviousness of the uds i retrieved from satellite images with r 2 0 96 fig 8 a the calibrated width w sm is correlated with the width w of the uds evaluated from a map with r 2 0 79 fig 8b the calibrated group of parameters w sm s n i is correlated with the width w of the uds evaluated from a map with r 2 0 75 fig 8c the calibrated group of parameters w sm s n i is also inversely correlated with the drainage density i l i a with r 2 0 81 fig 8d the observed decreasing dependence of the group w sm s n i on the drainage density i l i a fig 8d can be interpreted as follows according to eq 1 to produce a given specific discharge q with a smaller value of w s n i a higher water height d is needed this implies that udss with higher total length of conduits per unit area tend to accumulate more water which indeed can be stored in the denser upstream network 3 i sm 0 51 i 1 2 4 w sm 0 87 w 5 w sm s n i 24 28 w 0 8 6 w sm s n i 679 i l i a 5044 eqs 3 4 5 and 6 corresponding to the curves of fig 8 could be used to assign the parameters of the sm regarding the width it appears that in addition to being well correlated with the width read on a map it is also inversely correlated with the topology of the sewer channels given the high r 2 values of those relationships and given the diversity of the nine case studies it could be said that their use could be extended also to other case studies when little information about the response of the uds to precipitation is available although their validation would require the analysis of additional case studies 4 example of practical application the availability of a reliable sm can be useful for many practical applications in the management of udss in fact to study the behaviour of several hydraulic regulation devices e g tanks pumping stations combined sewer overflows the incoming hydrograph in different operating conditions or scenarios is the most important information other fields of application of the sms could be multi scenario analyses for climate change effect assessment flood risk assessment and rtc of udss arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 kirshen et al 2014 xiong et al 2019 as an example for the six case studies of bellinge for which a one year long rainfall record and information about the dry weather flow dwf were available the sm was used to estimate the volume discharged from a hypothetical cso placed at the outlet of the uds the estimated volumes were then compared with those estimated with the available dm of the same uds both at yearly scale and at event scale typically csos are designed to activate when a desired dilution coefficient c of the dwf is attained during rain events in this example the cso acts as an ideal cut off of the incoming flow with a threshold value cs o threshold depending on the choice of the dilution coefficient c 7 c cs o threshold dwf this latter depends on the enforcing regulations the type of water body in which the overflow occurs and the standards of water quality that the water utility wants to achieve so an extensive range of dilution coefficients c 3 15 was investigated the cso volume errors e e rel were defined as follows 8 e c s o sm c s o dm 9 e rel cs o sm c s o dm cs o dm starting from the values of table 2 eqs 3 and 4 were used to estimate the parameters i sm and w sm of the sms differently the parameters d s i s m d s p s m and n p s m showing little influence on the hydrographs for all the case studies were left equal to the values of table 2 for these case studies the sms predicted the cso volumes of one year namely from april 1st 2012 to april 1st 2013 fig 9 with an average e rel 6 14 ranging from 21 79 to 18 34 as reported in fig 10 therefore the yearly cso volumes estimated with the sms result acceptable compared to the great uncertainty always affecting runoff estimated by whatever model deletic et al 2012 at the event scale the inter quartile ranges iqrs of e of all the case studies fall between 0 17 mm and 0 06 mm while in the 82 of all the cso events e falls between 0 43 mm and 0 49 mm specifically 0 43 mm is the 9 percentile of bellinge 5 and 0 49 mm is the 91 percentile of bellinge 6 see boxplots in fig 11 hence also at event scale the results of the sm are acceptable hence sms can be used to carry out extensive studies on csos with the aim of mitigating their impact on the receiving water bodies like sensitivity analyses to hydrological characteristics of urban catchments or rtc strategies sms could also be paired with models of pollution from csos which is at day a crucial research field in environmental engineering such studies would be more difficult to do with dms owing to the uncertain estimation of their high number of parameters in absence of calibration and as well for the computational burden which would not be suitable for long simulations 5 conclusions this paper explored the definition and the applicability of a simplified hydrological modelling sm approach for urban drainage systems udss this approach allows synthesising parts of an uds placed upstream of specific sections of interest to assign reliable lumped model parameters when little information is available the proposed sm approach involves a considerable reduction of the required input data thanks to 1 spatial clustering of the morphometric characteristics of the urban catchment 2 waiver of hydraulic modelling of the sewer network therefore the proposed approach is extremely useful where rapid estimates of runoff are required in specific sections of udss the effectiveness of the proposed sm has been demonstrated by applying the hydrological module of the well known software swmm for which it was sufficient to estimate only five parameters for large urban basins the approach was tested on nine real udss found in literature for which complex detailed models dms were available in absence of the measured discharge the hydrographs q dm from the dms were assumed as benchmark for the hydrographs q sm calculated with the sms then a calibration workflow was developed considering the sm parameters as unknown identifying the values that minimised the deviation of q sm from q dm through the evaluation of the maximum nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the performance of the sms was satisfactorily good as witnessed by high values of the nse obtained for all the case studies robust relationships linking the calibrated sm parameters with the major morphometric characteristics of the udss were found indicating that the parameters of the sm models can be directly deduced from thematic maps and based on indications of the technical literature however the general applicability of the obtained relationships should be tested on more case studies the sms also showed a remarkable reduction of computational burden which is particularly useful when extended period simulations are carried out in this regard an example of practical application was also presented the discharged volumes from a hypothetical combined sewer overflow cso at yearly and daily scale calculated with the sms and the dms were compared for various udss considering an extensive range of cso activation threshold values defined through the dilution coefficient c in all cases the difference of discharged volumes estimated with the sms and the dms resulted quite small

1703,the management of an urban drainage system uds is a complex task as it requires extensive knowledge about precipitation regime hydrological features of the catchment hydraulic characteristics of the drainage network and information about the water use by the served inhabitants complex semi distributed hydrological and physically based hydraulic models are nowadays available to summarise such information and run simulations however in many cases the uncertainty of the available hydrological information hampers the use of complex models hence simple models with few parameters and small computational effort may be preferable especially for uds management problems requiring the execution of many simulations this paper proposes a convenient approach to define effective lumped simplified models sms of udss the parameters of which can be estimated directly from cartographic information for several case studies of uds with different morphological and topological characteristics sms were built capable of reproducing the hydrographs provided by available semi distributed detailed models dms assumed as benchmark in absence of measured hydrographs to this aim the swmm simulation software was used and the sm lumped parameters were calibrated by maximising the goodness of fit between the hydrograph of the dm and of the sm the results show that sms satisfactorily predict the hydrographs for all the case studies and that robust relationships between the calibrated parameters and morphological and topological characteristics of the uds can be established this suggests that sms can be used by decision makers for preliminary design planning studies and management problems of udss as their parameters can be soundly estimated from cartographic information an

interaction with other systems chocat et al 2001 the variability of the operation conditions over time and the numerosity of interconnected or interwoven parts sivakumar and singh 2012 thus it is very important to have one or more models of the uds to predict the behaviour of the system under different conditions butler et al 2018 and at different locations as it is difficult to fully understand the governing physics of the problem and to correctly interpret and implement them in an integrated model mitchell et al 2007 rauch et al 2002 generally udss design and management problems cover three main aspects hydrology hydraulics and water quality when modelling these aspects are synthesised with different modules as follows a hydrological module is responsible for modelling the rainfall runoff processes accounting for precipitation and temperature regimes hydrological characteristics of the catchment losses due to infiltration evaporation and other processes a hydraulic module is responsible for routing the flows through the wastewater and or stormwater convey system conduits and pipes manholes overflows outlets the storage facilities first flush detention basins online or offline storages to manage flood events and the pumping stations a water quality module is responsible for modelling the dynamics of pollutants through the system regarding the hydrological module rainfall runoff models are the standard tool devia et al 2015 granata et al 2016 one can choose among several solutions well presented by salvadore et al 2015 lumped conceptual models provide high versatility while sacrificing spatial details and physical description while semi distributed physically based models are very detailed and are supposed to be more precise but they are not as easy to handle as lumped models regarding the hydraulic module many software tools rely on the numerical solution of the saint venant equations chow 1959 for the gradually varied unsteady flow conditions as per the water quality aspects a recent review jia et al 2021 presents the most widely used modelling approaches generally both design and management of the infrastructures within an uds require an extensive knowledge about the characteristics of the urban catchment however uds preliminary design planning studies and many management activities do not require the knowledge of the flow characteristics in every conduit but rather a reliable estimation of the discharge at specific locations for example when studying combined sewer overflows csos it is important to estimate the discharge of wastewater and stormwater in the upstream conduit but it is not strictly necessary to calculate the flow in all the other conduits of the catchment upstream of the cso a similar argument may be done for storages pumping stations and other flow regulation devices european and national regulations are increasingly stringent on environmental issues regarding the udss as a result the water utilities are prompted to be engaged and act on the theme and csos are seen as a main source of pollution especially because it is very difficult to predict discharged volumes of polluted water and mass of pollutants and their behaviour shows great variability with respect to the hydrological characteristics of served urban catchments farina et al 2022 in this sense cso mitigation is often an issue addressed by modellers however the dependence of the cso behaviour from different hydrological parameters is still largely uninvestigated and one of the difficulties of conducting a cso parametric analyses lies in the over parametrization of dms using sms for cso studies could free researchers or modellers from this problem helping to advance the scientific knowledge on cso behaviour complex detailed models dms usually present both hydraulic and hydrologic modules the former involves the simulation of the flow characteristics i e flow depth and velocity in the sewer channels of the uds which requires complete information on the hydraulic and geometric characteristics and on the topographic layout of the conduits when this information is lacking expensive field surveys are needed furthermore the calibration of the large number of parameters may lack in uniqueness of the set of parameters that produce a good fit with observed flow okiria et al 2022 spear 1997 meaning that different sets of parameters can lead to similar optimal solutions equifinality thesis beven 2006 indeed in preliminary design or in management problems a lumped simplified model sm of the entire uds or of a part of it may be of help to ease the work a sm is here intended as a hierarchical surrogate model mahmoodian et al 2018 with minimal complexity where elements of the uds are deliberately neglected or heavily approximated for simplicity of use extended areas of the urban catchment are treated as single units beven 2012 and the hydraulics of the drainage network is not computed sms can be robust since they have few describing parameters in other words the benefit of using sms lies in the simplification of the numerical modelling together with the significant reduction in the number of parameters to be assigned in the literature the problem of whether using distributed models or lumped models has been tackled for large scale catchments by different authors some papers showed that lumped models offer equivalent results to distributed models e g yao et al 1998 vilaseca et al 2022 dos santos et al 2018 while others found the opposite e g paudel et al 2011 kaleris and langousis 2017 thus the choice of a highly detailed semi distributed model over a simple lumped model is not trivial and it needs to be justified okiria et al 2022 especially for smaller scale problems like udss also some studies attempted to use surrogate modelling of uds to reduce the computational cost of simulations or for optimization purposes kwon et al 2020 langeveld et al 2013 ledergerber et al 2019 seyedashraf et al 2021 thrysøe et al 2019 van daal rombouts et al 2016 however surrogate models usually mathematical black boxes are inherently case specific and cannot be easily generalised the objective of this paper is therefore to investigate the capability of sms the parameters of which could be easily assigned from cartographic information based on literature indications to reliably model the hydrograph from relevant portions of the uds clustered as one or few catchments characterized by few lumped parameters different udss case studies from the technical literature for which a detailed hydrologic hydraulic model dm was also available were simulated with the freeware and open source software swmm the parameters of the sms were initially calibrated as those allowing the best fit between the sm simulated flood hydrograph and the one provided by the dm assumed as benchmark in absence of measured hydrographs the calibrated parameters which in all cases allowed the sm to closely reproduce the hydrographs of the dm exhibited robust relationships with some morphologic and topological characteristics extracted from maps or geographic information system gis of the studied udss the obtained relationships linking lumped sm parameters with topographic information about the uds can be of use to modellers in all cases where few information are available about the uds because a reliable sm can be built directly from the cartography and the indications of technical literature among the various possible applications of the sms especially convenient in scenario analyses or extended period simulations an example of the proposed methodology is applied to cso prediction the cso volumes from the sms and the dms have been compared both at yearly scale and at event scale showing that sms succeed in correctly predicting csos 2 materials and methods the methodology described in this section aims at showing how a simplified model sm of the uds the parameters of which can be directly assigned from cartographic information and which neglects the hydraulic simulation of the flow through the network conduits provides reliable estimates of the runoff for several real udss available in the literature first the storm water management model swmm with which all the simulations are carried out is briefly introduced second the development of the sm of a uds and how to assign plausible ranges for its parameters are described for several case studies of udss from the literature for which detailed models dms had been developed the parameters of the sms are calibrated within the assigned ranges by minimising the deviation of the hydrographs from those obtained with existing dms corresponding to the same rain events assumed as benchmark in absence of direct discharge measurements finally the existence of relationships linking the calibrated sm parameters with morphologic and topologic characteristics of the udss is investigated showing that the sm parameters could be closely estimated directly from cartographic information the steps of the study are summarised in fig 1 2 1 simplified modelling approach with swmm the storm water management model swmm was chosen for the simulations as it is the most widely used software for hydrological and hydraulic modelling for urban catchments owolabi et al 2022 yuan et al 2022 swmm is flexible as it allows describing a catchment with different degrees of detail depending on the number of sub catchments used for its representation this software uses a nonlinear reservoir conceptual model chen and shubinski 1971 to estimate runoff from an idealised rectangular sub catchment this latter is divided in three sub areas an impervious area with no depression storages an impervious area with depression storages and a pervious area with depression storages owing to the short duration of the simulated rain events the modules describing evaporation infiltration and groundwater as well as the relevant model parameters were not considered in this study basically the computational scheme for the calculation of the surface runoff from each of the three areas consists in the iterative resolution of a mass balance equation coupled with the manning equation in the manning equation the surface runoff is idealised as the flow through a wide rectangular channel of cross area a x width w slope s manning coefficient n and height d d s where d is the height of the water and d s is the height of the depression storages with w d then the flow rate q is calculated as qa where q is the flow per unit surface eq 1 and a is the size of each of the relevant sub areas the mass balance equation and the manning equation are applied separately for the three kinds of surfaces that compose the schematisation of the sub catchment then the resulting runoff is the sum of the three contributes 1 q w s an d d s 5 3 a simplified modelling approach consisting in representing a part of a real uds placed upstream of a section of interest e g where specific hydraulic devices are installed such as csos tanks pumping stations through one or few lumped sub catchments is presented fig 2 since udss may include many hydraulic structures like storages sewer overflows and pumping stations the whole uds may be represented by more than a single sm each placed upstream of those infrastructures and consisting of 1 one or more lumped sub catchments depending on the number of rainfall inputs each lumped sub catchment will be attributed a rain input from one rain gauge 2 a dummy conduit conveying the modelled discharge q sm the conduit has fictitious characteristics in a way that it has a negligible influence on the hydrograph q sm thus only the hydrologic module of swmm is used since the target of the sms is the estimation of the runoff of urban catchments only the hydrologic module of swmm is used to model the discharge by means of a dummy conduit regarding the first point since the rain is the major driver of urban runoff processes it would be preferable to retain the information about the spatial distribution of the precipitation when available this can be more important for large catchments in which the spatial variability of the rain could have a big influence on the discharge the description of the uds with a small number of lumped subcatchments together with the neglection of the hydraulic simulation of the flows through the single channels entails a substantial reduction of the number of parameters of the proposed sm hence the runoff can be modelled without the recourse to time consuming and expensive survey campaigns the sm of an uds needs to be represented in swmm with appropriate values of the hydrological parameters of eq 1 so to closely reproduce the behaviour of the uds regarding a and s the sm retains respectively the area and the mean slope of the relevant sub part of the uds both easily retrieved from topographic maps through any geographic information system gis the other parameters may result extremely variable for different udss hence their ranges of variation were defined around plausible values extracted either from maps and satellite images of the uds or from the technical literature e g rossman and huber 2016 yen 2001 specifically the values for the uds were assumed as follows the width w was assumed as the ratio between the area and the length of the main drainage channel of the uds rossman and huber 2016 the percentage of the impervious surface i was evaluated from satellite images as the ratio between the covered surfaces and the area of the uds the typical values of the depression storage for the impervious surfaces and for the pervious surfaces were assumed equal to ds i 1 m m and ds p 1 m m respectively the typical values of the manning coefficient for the impervious surfaces and for the pervious surfaces were assumed equal to n i 1 60 s m 1 3 and n p 1 7 s m 1 3 respectively for the parameter n i large variations were not expected thus it was kept fixed to the typical value this simplification was also made possible by the fact that in eq 1 the effects on the runoff of w and n balance out the possible ranges of variation of the other parameters were defined by multiplying the typical value of each parameter p by the coefficient f p so that the sm parameters would be w s m f w w i s m f i i d s i s m f d s i d s i d s p s m f d s p d s p n p s m f n p n p in this way the value of the coefficient f p directly indicates how much the parameter p of the sm deviates from the value extracted from the uds maps table 1 reports the ranges of the coefficients considered for the definition of the ranges of variations of the parameters for the parameter n p the inverse of the coefficient 1 f n p was considered the coefficient ranges investigated for model calibration were conveniently limited so to obtain plausible values of the parameters avoiding those without physical relevance then ten values were assigned to each calibration coefficient f p and therefore to each calibration parameter linearly sampling them inside the relevant ranges listed in table 1 therefore the investigated solution space consisted of the cartesian product of the ranges of values of the calibration parameters with cardinality n 10 5 2 2 calibration of the sm as it will be described in section 2 4 the proposed methodology was applied to several case studies of udss retrieved from the literature for which a dm had been developed with swmm as in most cases the measured hydrographs used to develop the dm of the uds were not available the hydrograph q dm provided by the dm was assumed as benchmark a calibration process was then conducted to identify the parameters w sm i sm d s i s m d s p s m and n p s m that allowed minimising the deviation of the hydrograph q sm estimated by the simplified model from q dm for each case study a different rainfall event was selected for the calibration and an additional event was also used for the validation different objective functions can be adopted to quantify the difference between the flow q dm calculated with the dm and the flow q sm calculated with the sm in this paper the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 eq 2 to be maximized is showed since it is one of the most used metrics in hydrological applications biondi et al 2012 perin et al 2020 2 nse 1 i 1 n t q dm i q sm i 2 i 1 n t q dm i q dm 2 in eq 2 q dm i and q sm i are respectively the flow values of the dm hydrograph and of the sm hydrograph at the time i δ t where δ t is the simulation time step the number of time steps is n t t δ t where t is the simulation duration q dm is the mean value of the dm hydrograph n simulations were carried out in swmm for each case study given the number of the simulations to be run it was chosen to implement a framework in the python programming language using swmm api pichler 2022 version 0 4 21 to automate several tasks specifically this python package allows to read and manipulate swmm input files run swmm simulations and read the binary output files generated in this study the original epa swmm version 5 2 3 was used as the core engine of the computations details about the computer configuration used can be found in additional data after running all the simulations each runoff time series q sm j from the j th simulation being j 1 n was compared with the runoff time series q dm and the of was evaluated 2 3 estimating sm parameters from uds maps to assess the feasibility of developing the sm without a benchmark hydrograph available for model calibration the existence of relationships linking the parameters obtained through calibration with the major characteristics of the uds was investigated in most situations of practical interest only cartographic and topologic information and satellite images of the uds are available hence the following set of uds characteristics easily readable from maps and satellite images were considered area a average slope s width w percentage of impervious area i horton strahler order horton 1945 strahler 1952 1957 of the drainage network o drainage density d i l i a the summation is extended to the lengths l i of all the conduits of the uds the determination coefficient r 2 of either linear p κ x λ and power law p α x β functional formats equations was evaluated for any calibrated sm parameter p and uds characteristic x with reference to a set of uds with various characteristics whereas the relationship exhibits a high value of r 2 this indicates that the sm parameter could be directly estimated from the available characteristics of the uds 2 4 case studies the presented approach was tested on case studies retrieved from the scientific literature for which uds characteristics and a validated dm were available having different catchment size characteristics of the sub catchments and rain input the sketches of the uds of the case studies are represented in fig 3 the main features of the dms of the case studies together with the duration and mean intensity of the rainfall event used for the calibration are summarized in table 2 eldoret is a city in kenya with catchment area a 696 5 h a average elevation 2200 m and a subtropical highland climate koppen 1936 the uds dm was obtained from abraham metto et al 2021 luleå is a coastal city of northern sweden with average elevation 6 m and a subarctic climate koppen 1936 two case studies were obtained from the uds dm broekhuizen et al 2020 2021 of a small catchment with area a 10 2 h a bellinge is a village in odense denmark with average elevation 13 m and a temperate oceanic climate koppen 1936 six case studies were obtained from the uds dm pedersen et al 2021a 2021b of bellinge this latter having a total area a 274 h a according to the defined ranges of the calibration coefficients f p the corresponding ranges of the parameters considered for the sm calibration are reported in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the simplified models overall the performance of the simplified approach gave satisfactory results in terms of goodness of fit between the hydrographs q sm from the calibrated sms and the hydrographs q dm for the considered hyetographs the histogram of fig 4 shows the obtained optimal values of nse eq 2 for each case study and the average value of nse 0 87 with the minimum 0 77 for the case study bellinge 6 and the maximum 0 95 for the case study bellinge 3 it is worth reiterating that the maximisation of the nse allowed to identify the set of parameters that reduced the deviation of the hydrographs of the proposed simplified approach from those of the dm taken as a benchmark in fact the hydrographs q sm for all the case studies resulted close to the hydrographs q dm both for the peak discharge and the peak timing for example for bellinge 5 fig 5 with nse 0 89 the discharges of the first and the second peaks are underestimated by only 8 9 and 11 8 respectively while the first peak time is anticipated by only 1 min and the second peak time is perfectly predicted the hydrographs of all the other case studies are given in the appendix the good performance of the calibrated sms is confirmed also for rain events other than those used for calibration for example the calibrated sm of bellinge 5 was used to simulate the hydrograph of a different rain event and compared with the hydrograph predicted by the dm fig 6 the nse was 0 87 with a reduction of only 0 02 with respect to the rain event used for calibration although the main advantage of using sms instead of dms lies in the significantly reduced number of parameters to be assigned it also results in great computational advantages in terms of required simulation time larger or more complex udss would benefit the most of these advantages for example the simulation of the bellinge case studies for a period of one month with the sm would require 5 s while with the dm it would take 4200 s more details about the computational gain are given in table 4 the computational advantage of running sms is particularly useful in scenario analyses and long simulations like those for climate change effect assessment 3 2 parameters of the calibrated simplified models for each case study the best sets of calibration coefficients f p and the corresponding parameter values i e those maximizing the nse between the hydrographs q dm and q sm are listed respectively in table 5 and table 6 also the group of parameters w s n i appearing in the manning equation eq 1 was calculated it is worth noting that the optimal values of nse were very close to 1 where f p 1 represents the condition for which the parameters of the sm are deduced by the cartographic analysis while the nse value drops as soon as f p deviates from the optimal value to analyse the sensitivity of the sm performance to the different calibrated parameters for all n simulations of each case study the scatter plots of each of the coefficients f p against the nse were represented in this way it was possible to highlight the parameters with the highest importance in the calibration process for instance in fig 7 referring to bellinge 5 the nse varies between 0 14 and 0 90 throughout the entire analysed solution space with the of being most sensitive to w sm through f w and so being the most important parameter to be calibrated for that case study indeed both the maximum red line and the average blue line nse values of the space of solutions for each w sm value show the highest variability compared to the other parameters with a clear maximum of nse 0 90 for f w 0 86 corresponding to w sm 604 m furthermore the spreading of the points over a column referred to a specific value of a single parameter and thus depending on the variations of the others is smaller for the f w than for the other parameters this indicates that the solution is more sensitive to changes in w sm than to any other parameter i sm through f i results the second most important parameter for the sm of bellinge 5 with the maximum nse for f i 1 23 thus i sm 1 23 i dm however it is noteworthy that even if a percentage of imperviousness i sm i dm i e f i 1 0 were assigned the nse value would only decrease by a little thus a reliable hydrograph would be still achievable the latter consideration holds also for all the other case studies the same scatter plots of fig 7 for all the other case studies are given in the appendix for all the case studies referred to bellinge and luleå d s p s m and n p s m seem to have no influence on the output of the simulations while their influence is very small for eldoret 1 case study the width and the imperviousness were the most important parameters for calibration for all the case studies 3 3 relationships between calibrated sm parameters and uds characteristics an important aspect of the proposed approach to develop a reliable sm of the uds is the estimation of the few required parameters in this respect the achievement through calibration of a set of parameters close to those directly deducible from the cartographies and capable of providing hydrographs very close to those obtained with the dms would confirm the validity and the robustness of the proposed sms in most cases only geometric and topologic information about the uds is available hence it is not possible to rely on benchmark hydrographs to calibrate the model of the uds in this usual situation the identification of general relationships linking the parameters of the calibrated sm with easily obtainable morphologic characteristics of the uds would make possible to develop a reliable sm also in absence of measurements of rainfall and runoff to this aim the existence of linear or power law relationships between the uds characteristics described in section 2 4 summarized in table 2 for the case studies and the calibrated sm parameters table 6 was investigated the following relationships characterised by high values of the determination coefficient r 2 were found the calibrated percentage of imperviousness i sm is highly correlated with the percentage of imperviousness of the uds i retrieved from satellite images with r 2 0 96 fig 8 a the calibrated width w sm is correlated with the width w of the uds evaluated from a map with r 2 0 79 fig 8b the calibrated group of parameters w sm s n i is correlated with the width w of the uds evaluated from a map with r 2 0 75 fig 8c the calibrated group of parameters w sm s n i is also inversely correlated with the drainage density i l i a with r 2 0 81 fig 8d the observed decreasing dependence of the group w sm s n i on the drainage density i l i a fig 8d can be interpreted as follows according to eq 1 to produce a given specific discharge q with a smaller value of w s n i a higher water height d is needed this implies that udss with higher total length of conduits per unit area tend to accumulate more water which indeed can be stored in the denser upstream network 3 i sm 0 51 i 1 2 4 w sm 0 87 w 5 w sm s n i 24 28 w 0 8 6 w sm s n i 679 i l i a 5044 eqs 3 4 5 and 6 corresponding to the curves of fig 8 could be used to assign the parameters of the sm regarding the width it appears that in addition to being well correlated with the width read on a map it is also inversely correlated with the topology of the sewer channels given the high r 2 values of those relationships and given the diversity of the nine case studies it could be said that their use could be extended also to other case studies when little information about the response of the uds to precipitation is available although their validation would require the analysis of additional case studies 4 example of practical application the availability of a reliable sm can be useful for many practical applications in the management of udss in fact to study the behaviour of several hydraulic regulation devices e g tanks pumping stations combined sewer overflows the incoming hydrograph in different operating conditions or scenarios is the most important information other fields of application of the sms could be multi scenario analyses for climate change effect assessment flood risk assessment and rtc of udss arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 kirshen et al 2014 xiong et al 2019 as an example for the six case studies of bellinge for which a one year long rainfall record and information about the dry weather flow dwf were available the sm was used to estimate the volume discharged from a hypothetical cso placed at the outlet of the uds the estimated volumes were then compared with those estimated with the available dm of the same uds both at yearly scale and at event scale typically csos are designed to activate when a desired dilution coefficient c of the dwf is attained during rain events in this example the cso acts as an ideal cut off of the incoming flow with a threshold value cs o threshold depending on the choice of the dilution coefficient c 7 c cs o threshold dwf this latter depends on the enforcing regulations the type of water body in which the overflow occurs and the standards of water quality that the water utility wants to achieve so an extensive range of dilution coefficients c 3 15 was investigated the cso volume errors e e rel were defined as follows 8 e c s o sm c s o dm 9 e rel cs o sm c s o dm cs o dm starting from the values of table 2 eqs 3 and 4 were used to estimate the parameters i sm and w sm of the sms differently the parameters d s i s m d s p s m and n p s m showing little influence on the hydrographs for all the case studies were left equal to the values of table 2 for these case studies the sms predicted the cso volumes of one year namely from april 1st 2012 to april 1st 2013 fig 9 with an average e rel 6 14 ranging from 21 79 to 18 34 as reported in fig 10 therefore the yearly cso volumes estimated with the sms result acceptable compared to the great uncertainty always affecting runoff estimated by whatever model deletic et al 2012 at the event scale the inter quartile ranges iqrs of e of all the case studies fall between 0 17 mm and 0 06 mm while in the 82 of all the cso events e falls between 0 43 mm and 0 49 mm specifically 0 43 mm is the 9 percentile of bellinge 5 and 0 49 mm is the 91 percentile of bellinge 6 see boxplots in fig 11 hence also at event scale the results of the sm are acceptable hence sms can be used to carry out extensive studies on csos with the aim of mitigating their impact on the receiving water bodies like sensitivity analyses to hydrological characteristics of urban catchments or rtc strategies sms could also be paired with models of pollution from csos which is at day a crucial research field in environmental engineering such studies would be more difficult to do with dms owing to the uncertain estimation of their high number of parameters in absence of calibration and as well for the computational burden which would not be suitable for long simulations 5 conclusions this paper explored the definition and the applicability of a simplified hydrological modelling sm approach for urban drainage systems udss this approach allows synthesising parts of an uds placed upstream of specific sections of interest to assign reliable lumped model parameters when little information is available the proposed sm approach involves a considerable reduction of the required input data thanks to 1 spatial clustering of the morphometric characteristics of the urban catchment 2 waiver of hydraulic modelling of the sewer network therefore the proposed approach is extremely useful where rapid estimates of runoff are required in specific sections of udss the effectiveness of the proposed sm has been demonstrated by applying the hydrological module of the well known software swmm for which it was sufficient to estimate only five parameters for large urban basins the approach was tested on nine real udss found in literature for which complex detailed models dms were available in absence of the measured discharge the hydrographs q dm from the dms were assumed as benchmark for the hydrographs q sm calculated with the sms then a calibration workflow was developed considering the sm parameters as unknown identifying the values that minimised the deviation of q sm from q dm through the evaluation of the maximum nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the performance of the sms was satisfactorily good as witnessed by high values of the nse obtained for all the case studies robust relationships linking the calibrated sm parameters with the major morphometric characteristics of the udss were found indicating that the parameters of the sm models can be directly deduced from thematic maps and based on indications of the technical literature however the general applicability of the obtained relationships should be tested on more case studies the sms also showed a remarkable reduction of computational burden which is particularly useful when extended period simulations are carried out in this regard an example of practical application was also presented the discharged volumes from a hypothetical combined sewer overflow cso at yearly and daily scale calculated with the sms and the dms were compared for various udss considering an extensive range of cso activation threshold values defined through the dilution coefficient c in all cases the difference of discharged volumes estimated with the sms and the dms resulted quite small

1704,analysis of 35 years 1987 2022 of time lapse data derived from landsat imagery and srtm dem has revealed significant changes in planform morphology at the confluence of the river niger and river benue in lokoja west africa in the study area the niger is flanked by high elevation plateaus of ca 400 m altitude and low lying floodplains on its western bank the benue is characterized by more abundant intra channel and bank attached bars relative to the niger over the 35 year period a net downstream migration of 880 m was observed at the junction its angle decreased from ca 175 in 1987 to 50 in 2006 and to ca 16 in 2022 and showed varied segmentation patterns we establish a linkage between this decrease in confluence angle and increase in annual runoff in the study area expansion along the banks of the niger benue and post confluence channels was found to be low and non uniform suggesting varied resistance of the banks to erosion which is linked to the abundance of vegetation these

al 2016 maurice bourgoin et al 2003 and morphological transformation of landscapes can be linked to the morphological and dynamic processes occurring at these junctions the location of confluences and confluence planform of several rivers have been shown to change over time as demonstrated by the amite comite river confluence in the usa wang and xu 2020 shit and maiti 2013 also revealed small scale migration of gully confluences and linked it to sediment deposition studies such as grant et al 2013 and phillips et al 2005 have shown that sediment deposition at river junctions located downstream of dams can lead to local bed aggradation patterns that may result in lateral and longitudinal movement of the junction location these processes can be accompanied by episodic bank erosion and changes in bar formation processes at river confluence due to flooding events ettema 2008 the morphology of river confluences is heavily influenced by the ratio of the tributary discharge to that of the main river best 1988 mosley 1976 this ratio can have a major effect on scour hole morphology best 1988 mosley 1976 bar formation and migration best and rhoads 2008 boyer et al 2006 sediment load and

use and river damming grant et al 2013 hackney and carling 2011 knox 2007 furthermore the angle of the confluence can influence the formation of bars in the tributary and post confluence channels which can lead to widening of channels and subsequent changes in confluence morphology mosley 1976 it is evident that in order to understand and accurately model river confluences many factors must be taken into consideration recent studies on the morpho dynamics of river confluences have been enabled by advances in technology allowing the incorporation of satellite imagery and other techniques for

river confluences however knowledge of the extent of these changes and their controls especially in tropical rivers with low sediment loads is sparse thus there is an impetus to investigate the morpho dynamic behavior at tropical river confluences this is important as knowledge of the morpho dynamic behavior at river confluences has direct implications for the planning risk evaluation and sustainable management of aquatic resources including drinking water hydro electricity food and habitat for the society andersen et al 2005 richter et al 2003 this study therefore investigates the multidecadal morphological changes and dynamics at the confluence of two major rivers with relatively low sediment loads the rivers niger and benue in west africa the confluence of these two important rivers is an ideal location to study morpho dynamic changes in tropical rivers due to its observability on remote sensing data we analyze the planform morpho dynamics of the confluence estimate the spatial extent and mobility of its planform and describe the morphological changes in the confluent rivers further we seek to identify potential controls on the morphological changes at the confluence

30 in the dry season and increases to 70 in the wet season olivera et al 1995 this environment supports a guinea parkland savannah vegetation type with tall grasses and trees that are green during the wet season and dry during the dry season the study area including the confluence of rivers niger benue and post confluence is densely vegetated fig 3a b the western bank of river niger which is home to the city of lokoja hosts patches of vegetation along the riverbank and around buildings annual rainfall in this area typically commences in march april and ceases in october november with a brief break in august olatunde and adejoh 2017 however hydro meteorological data in this area and in nigeria in general is lacking with most key stations being inactive ekeu wei and blackburn 2018 ngene et al 2015 for instance river benue has two hydrological provinces the upper benue and the lower benue fig 2 table 1 both of which are of importance to this study of the 30 existing stations within the lower benue only 6 are currently in operation ngene et al 2015 abam 1999 and olayinka dosunmu et al 2022 have estimated the sediment yield within the upper and lower hydrological provinces to be 101 tons km2 and 98 tons km2 respectively the average annual discharge of rivers niger and benue measured at selected hydrological stations including makurdi umaisha naimey and katsina ala fig 1 display significant variability as shown in table 1 the river benue s main sediment load is sourced from both cameroon and its nigerian catchment area causing riverbank and catchment erosion olayinka dosunmu et al 2022 a post confluence sediment load of 40 million tons year is estimated for the niger river basin area of 1 143 000 million km2 milliman and syvitski 1992 river benue s pre confluence sediment load is estimated at 22 million tons year for its 338 000 million km2 catchment area 1932 1957 fig 4 a the post confluence load of the niger is considered as the combined load of both rivers with the benue contributing an estimated 50 of the discharge abrate et al 2013 nonetheless these values are lower than those of large river systems such as the ganges and amazon and higher than those of some west african rivers such as the tano and senegal fig 4a data at lokoja show an increase in annual runoff from approximately 4 200 m3 s in the late 1980 s to about 6 400 m3 s in the mid 1990 s and again to 6 400 m3 s in 2010 at the confluence fig 4b this area is subject to seasonal flooding which is triggered by water releases from the kainji and lagdo dams upstream of rivers niger and benue respectively fig 1 in addition the average annual rainfall of 1 185 mm in nigeria fao 1997 contributes to the high river flow power and discharge record floods occurred in september 2012 31 696 m3 s combined flood flow 12 84 m water level and 2020 23 459 m3 s combined flood flow 11 89 m water level during off flood periods the runoff and water level can drop to around 5 327 m3 s and 2 7 m respectively 2 2 geology stream gradient and geomorphology the stratigraphic succession of the niger basin extending from jebba to lokoja in the mid niger basin and the anambra basin ranges from ancient archean formations to recent alluvial deposits andersen et al 2005 the floodplains of river niger are composed of a mixture of quaternary to recent organic rich coarse alluvial deposits and sandy structures such as sandbars along the river channels with weathered lateritic soils present in adjoining areas adojoh and dada 2015 olatunde and adejoh 2017 these alluvial deposits extend to the benue valley and all the way to chad andersen et al 2005 the mid niger basin is composed of three distinct lithostratigraphic units belonging to the upper cretaceous and overlying the precambrian crystalline basement complex is characterized by a gentle dip abimbola 1997 these units include the basal lokoja formation the patti formation and the uppermost agbaja ironstone formation the lokoja formation unconformably overlies the basement complex and is composed of basal conglomerates and arkosic sandstones abimbola 1997 adojoh and dada 2015 the patti formation is characterized by interbedded sandstones siltstones and carbonaceous mudstone units while the agbaja formation consists of oolitic pisolitic and argillaceous ironstones abimbola 1997 the basement complex rocks which also extend to other areas of nigeria including the southwest lawal et al 2022 include migmatized gneisses metasediments like schists quartzite and marble low lying basement rock outcrops are observed along the river channels because of river incision and erosion of the cretaceous sediments in the upper reach of river niger located approximately 100 km from its confluence with the sokoto river the river flows through extensive alluvial plains with a slope ranging from 1 7 000 to 1 8 000 table 1 at around 200 km from the sokoto confluence to jebba dam the river has carved a system of narrow valleys due to the steep slopes created by the rock outcrops on both banks which range from 1 3 000 to 1 4 000 this area is the site of the kainji and jebba dams which take advantage of the high head further downstream in the middle reach from lokoja to jebba spanning 250 km the slope is gentler and ranges from 1 5 000 to 1 7 000 which promotes the formation of sandbars federal ministry of water resources and rural development 1995 river benue exhibits a steep slope 1 4 000 in its upper reaches transporting significant volumes of sediment rich material this steep slope transitions to a gentle slope 1 7 000 to 1 8 000 in its middle reaches and further transitions to a very gentle slope 1 10 000 to 1 12 000 in its lower reaches between lokoja and the niger delta table 1 the gentle slope in this area facilitates the deposition of sediment rich material resulting in the development of sandbanks the confluence of the niger and benue located in lokoja nigeria is bordered by the agbaja plateau an extensive and irregularly shaped plateau trending in a northwest southeast direction adojoh and dada 2015 omada and owadi 2009 south of this plateau lies mount patti a star shaped feature trending in the same direction adojoh and dada 2015 further south is the southern hills which trend southwest northeast the katon karfe plateau lies between the arms of rivers niger and benue located to the north of the confluence adojoh and dada 2015 according to adeleye 1973 the plateaus in this area are composed of campano maastrichtian sediments and capped and preserved by a thick bed of lateritic pisolitic and oolitic sediments of the agbaja formation dropping steeply towards the crystalline basement 3 data and research methods a digital elevation model dem of the rivers niger and benue confluence area was derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a spatial resolution of 30 m 1 arc second the dem was provided by the united state geological survey and loaded into esri s arcmap software a three dimensional representation was generated in the esri s arcscene software while cross sections were generated to understand the planform morphology of the rivers and confluence area georeferenced landsat images of 1987 2006 2013 2015 2018 and 2022 spanning a 35 year period were also analyzed to detect any planform dynamics of the confluence these images had a resolution of 30 megapixels and were generated and downloaded using the esri s landsat explorer application https livingatlas2 arcgis com landsatexplorer in nigeria rivers niger and benue have widths of several kilometers making them ideal for delineation of planform changes using landsat imagery to avoid potential issues associated with seasonal discharge variations and unavailability of data imagery from december of each year for 2011 2021 was used for our analysis except for 2022 for which imagery from january was used in addition landsat imagery with cloud cover ranging from 0 to 10 was selected to reduce visibility issues and improve the accuracy of morphological feature detection this cloud cover range also limited the availability of imagery to understand the variations in confluence or junction angle within the 35 year period the approach of hackney and carling 2011 was adopted to measure the junction angle from one year to the other the approach involved drawing centerlines within rivers niger and benue and the post confluence channel to three channel widths from the confluence and measuring the angle formed at the intersection of the centerlines of the two rivers to understand the overall changes in channel course and location of the riverbanks i e expansion or contraction between 1987 and 2022 a shapefile of 1987 planform was cautiously prepared digitized and superimposed on the 2022 image additionally shapefiles of the confluence area were made for all available years and compared with themselves to understand changes in confluence planform measurement error arising from the digitization is 5 m which is small considering the hundreds of meters scale changes observed in the area the separation between the 1987 and 2022 riverbanks was measured at specific locations to estimate how much the riverbank has changed or expanded this was complemented by using the landsat explorer s change detection tool https livingatlas2 arcgis com landsatexplorer to automatically compute the changes between the two dates i e an earlier and a later date the computed changes were rendered in geology mode to highlight all locations where changes in planform exist between the two years the geology mode is a band combination that enhances geological features on the platform subsequently the changes were computed by assigning colors say purple and green to planform features from the two different years and superimposing them to detect sites of possible changes all the images were then extracted and exported as georeferenced high resolution tiff files from landsat explorer and were imported into arcmap for further analysis analyses performed include estimating bar migration rate river channel expansion and the area of the eroded part of bars in this study the rate of bar migration explains how far a bar has migrated or moved from a reference point over a specified period while river channel expansion reveals increase in the width of a river channel at specific locations over a specified period to estimate the rate of bar migration between two dates the separation between the location of the bar in a previous year and its location in a more recent year was measured and divided by the difference of the two years the distance was measured from the center point of the bar in an earlier year to its center point in a later year in this work the area of eroded part of a bar is explained as the surface area of the missing or eroded part of a bar as determined from the comparison of the planform of the bar on an earlier date to its morphology on a later date where the area of eroded or dislodged part of a bar was estimated a polygon was created around the area and the area of this polygon was calculated in arcmap and taken as a representation of the surface area of the eroded portion of the bar 4 result 4 1 planform morphological characteristics the confluence of rivers niger and benue is characterized by a separation of up to 7 8 km in the upstream section of the rivers declining southward until the confluence and forming a post confluence channel at lokoja fig 5 the rivers and their flood plains are in low lying areas that are flanked by high elevation features such as the agbaja plateau and mount patti the agbaja plateau and mount patti rise up to 428 m above sea level and extend for more than 8 km and 3 km southward in the study area respectively the trajectory of river niger exhibits a slight bend at the location of the agbaja plateau indicating that the ridge forced the niger to adjust its pathway downstream figs 5 and 6 additionally a system of ridges is observed in the western part of the study area reaching up to 350 m high and extending several kilometers landward the ridges are dissected by the floodplains of river niger and the post confluence channel river benue is characterized by a southern hill that is approximately 50 m high and up to 350 m high further south figs 5 and 6 the floodplains of the post confluence channel along its eastern flanks reach adjoining areas at the bottom of this hill the koton karfe plateau is situated to the north and is up to 300 m high figs 5 and 6 additionally regularly to irregularly shaped bars of up to 800 m wide and 42 m high are either attached to the channel flanks or located within the channel figs 5 and 7 the width and depth of rivers niger and benue upstream of the confluence are estimated to be approximately 1 4 km and 36 m and 1 7 km and 35 m respectively figs 5 and 6 at the confluence the widths of the two rivers are approximately 1 km while the width and depth of the post confluence channel are 37 m and 1 24 1 73 km respectively 4 2 upstream downstream confluence migration and changes in confluence angle and form the images presented in fig 7 reveal southward downstream and northward upstream changes in the location of the junction of the confluence the downstream extension is observed between 1987 and 2013 no net change in the location of the junction was observed between 2013 and 2015 between 2015 and 2022 the junction location moved upstream showing that the junction has experienced upstream migration collectively this shows upstream and downstream migration of the junction within a zone that is about 2 2 km wide between 1987 and 2022 fig 7 this 2 2 km estimate is twice the widths of rivers niger and benue at the confluence ca 1 6 times the upstream width of river niger and ca 1 3 times the upstream width of river benue in this area moreover the confluence angle also changed over time from ca 175 in 1987 to ca 50 in 2006 ca 30 in 2013 ca 27 in 2015 and a ca 16 in 2018 and 2022 fig 8 the morphology of the junction changed from near flat in 1987 to semi pointed in 2006 and to a pointed and sharp edged morphology in 2022 figs 7 and 8 this change was accompanied by a limited lateral expansion of the confluence within a zone that was ca 3 5 km wide in the upstream part of the confluence fig 9 a which is ca 2 5 times the upstream width of the river niger and ca 2 16 km wide in the middle of the confluence the change is further linked to the erosion or dislodgment of parts of the confluence figs 7 9 such as at its western edge that was eroded by about 0 71 km between 1987 and 2022 fig 9a this edge was observed to extend westward and into the niger channel on the 1987 land sat image figs 7 9 it is however absent on post 1987 images suggesting that the confluence edge extension was an obstruction to flow and was eroded or dislodged from the main confluence as flow impacted on it an overall decrease in width along the confluence is noticeable from 1987 to 2022 fig 9 during this period the location of the external banks of the two rivers remained relatively fixed however changes in the order of a few tens to hundreds of meters were observed locally in areas upstream of the confluence along the two rivers fig 9a fig 9b shows a significant reduction in the width of the confluence by up to 0 4 km from 2006 to 2013 with the position of the external banks of rivers niger and benue remaining unchanged fig 9b the confluence is also characterized by its segmented nature which is more clearly seen in the post 1987 images figs 7 to 9a d two major segments are visible on the 2006 image three on the 2013 and 2015 images and two that are ca 0 24 km apart on the 2018 and 2022 images figs 7 and 8 the confluence segments are also found on the ground truth images from 2017 fig 4 at the locations where the segments changed from three to two unvegetated sediments bars joining the two segments are observed indicating recent deposition of sediments figs 7 and 8 overall there is a downstream southern extension of the junction by approximately 880 m in the study area between 1987 and 2022 fig 9d 4 3 intra channel and bank attached bars figs 7 and 9 show the presence of multiple bars upstream of rivers benue and niger and at the confluence while intra channel and flank attached bars were observed within the two rivers the latter were more common in river benue intra channel bars within the niger and confluence area were commonly vegetated while flank attached and intra channel bars within the benue were commonly unvegetated fig 7 and 9a c a reduction in the sizes of some intra channel bars upstream of the confluence over the 35 year period was observed for instance in the location marked b upstream of river niger a north south oriented and vegetated intra channel bar was identified figs 7 and 9d although the position of the bar remained relatively fixed between 1987 and 2022 there was a marked reduction in the size of the bar in 2022 relative to 1987 fig 7 and 9c d the estimated surface area of the missing portion was 5 86 km2 furthermore at the upstream portion of river benue a decrease in the separation of a bar and a reference point to its northeast yellow dot near point a was observed between 2013 and 2022 fig 7 the estimated distance between the dot and the center of the bar was 1 05 km in 2013 in 2018 the distance between the two points reduced to 0 19 km while in 2022 the bar widened and its center coincided with the location of the dot this indicates that the bar grew and migrated downstream over approximately 1 05 km between 2013 and 2022 at an average rate of approximately 120 m year 4 4 marked evidence for river channel expansion analysis of the vegetated external banks of rivers niger and benue and the post confluence channel between 1987 and 2022 revealed slight changes that are mainly along the western bank of the niger upstream of the confluence fig 9c d however local increases in channel width were observed along the channels of the rivers niger and benue and the post confluence channel at the eastern flank of the post confluence channel a local increase in width by 1 2 km was estimated due to the erosion of a bank attached bar which was accompanied by the occurrence of a smaller but linear bar on the western flank of the river upstream of the same river the 1987 western bank was observed to have shifted landward by 0 1 km indicating landward expansion of the river niger channel due to bank erosion in the area the change detection image computed for the period fig 9d confirms an expansion of the river niger and river benue in the study area the width of river niger near the confluence decreased by approximately 0 67 km promoting the expansion of the niger channel in that location fig 9c d along the eastern flank of river benue an increase in channel width was identified at its upstream intermediate and downstream parts between 1987 and 2022 fig 9c d at the downstream part the width of the channel increased due to the erosion of a ca 0 52 km wide bank attached bar that extended into the river on the 1987 image fig 9c d midway along the confluence the initial 1987 channel width has widened on the present day 2022 image due to the erosion or dislodgment of parts of the confluence upstream of the same river a localized increase in the width of the channel by ca 0 52 km is noted due to the erosion of an unvegetated bank attached bar fig 9c d no evidence of lateral migration or avulsion of the rivers was observed over the 35 year period in the study area 5 discussion 5 1 architectural changes in planform morphology from 1987 to 2022 5 1 1 drastic changes in planform morphology results of this study show that the rivers niger and benue confluence is undergoing drastic changes to its planform morphology these changes are primarily indicated by variations in confluence angle and form changes in channel widths of the niger benue and post confluence channel and bar migration over a 35 year period a 2 2 km confluence migration window was estimated in the study area fig 7 this estimate is significant when compared to a similar tropical confluence at the junction of the congo and kasai rivers democratic republic of congo that exhibited no migration between 1984 and 2014 the stationarity of the kongo kasai confluence is related to the occurrence of bedrock control which prevents lateral migration of the river channels dixon et al 2018 in terms of sediment load the niger also has 30 more load than the congo although the congo discharges seven times more water to the ocean andersen et al 2005 low sediment load has been linked to reduced confluence dynamics bilal et al 2020 in the case of the congo and kasai rivers their low sediment loads are likely to have contributed in addition to bedrock control to the stationarity of their confluence additionally the 2 2 km estimate of the niger benue confluence is less significant in comparison with the 12 14 km estimate at the confluence of the ganges and jamuna rivers in bangladesh between 1973 and 2014 these are rivers with significantly higher sediment loads sambrook smith et al 2019 in comparison to the niger and benue their high sediment load means there is more sediment to form sandbars and migrate them downstream to contribute to the morpho dynamic changes occurring at their confluence this relationship between mobility and load suggest that sediment load is a key factor dictating the extent of confluence mobility in the study area and at many river confluences on the contrary some non tropical large confluences formed by high sediment load rivers are stable this is the case at the confluence of the yarlung zangbo and niyang rivers in china where local topography i e the niyang river delta and a mountain limit mobility yuan et al 2022b confluence dynamics is associated with shifts in scour location in the direction of migration ashmore and parker 1983 sambrook smith et al 2019 based on this it is suggested that the upstream and dominant downstream extension migration of the junction allows a northward and dominant southward shift in scour location in the study area downstream confluence migration permits sediment deposition and bar formation downstream of the location of scouring best 1986 this migration pattern as observed in the study area fig 7 may promote sediment deposition or bar formation downstream of a potential scour hole and within the post confluence channel the occurrence of bars within the channel figs 5 and 7 evidences this relationship furthermore a significant decrease of over 150 in confluence angle from ca 174 in 1987 to ca 16 in 2022 is shown in the study area fig 8 these estimates above are greater and smaller than the upper and lower limits of the angles 1000 600 estimated for the orinoco meta rivers confluence 1973 2014 dixon et al 2018 where post confluence channel width 1 2 km estimate is like the present study area but with much larger load than the niger and benue according to best 1988 and mosley 1976 decreasing confluence angle corresponds to decreasing scour depth and decreasing discharge of the minor tributary relative to that of the major tributary similarly the wide confluence angle of 1987 translates to remarkable scouring downstream of the confluence as mosley 1976 reveal there is no appreciable scour up to a confluence angle of 15 and scour depth increases rapidly just above this value it is argued that present day scour in the rivers niger and benue confluence is not significant due to a low confluence angle of around 16 going by the above mentioned studies the present day confluence angle is also attributed to decreasing discharge of the benue relative to the niger however the lack of up to date and year to year discharge data for individual rivers makes it impossible to examine this claim in the current study howard 1971 reveals that wide confluence angles indicate higher slope of the tributary relative to the main river while a small confluence angle signals nearly equal slope likewise we argue that the decrease in confluence angle over 35 years in the present study area corresponds to a decrease in the relative slope of the benue compared to the niger near the confluence 5 1 2 segmentation style at the confluence multiple segments of the confluence are observed in the study area ranging from two to three segments with inter segment spacing of about 0 24 km figs 7 9 while this segmentation pattern is uncommon the observations prove multiple confluence junctions rather than one promoting complex and changing flow dynamics sediment deposition and erosion within the river channels in the study area segmentation in the study area is particularly interesting as the main confluence landmass itself is divided into several segments that are from time to time merged or bridged by unvegetated sandbars the unvegetated bars indicate recent sediment deposition the observed segmentation pattern in the study area is unlike that observed in many other confluence systems most of which are not broken into several segments an example is the junction of the non tropical lena and aldan rivers in russia dixon et al 2018 at this confluence the junction is largely unsegmented and is surrounded by numerous downstream migrating bars although bars migrate towards and contribute to the evolution of the niger benue confluence we ascribe its segmentation to the overall decadal decrease in discharge and load of the niger and benue causing a form of sediment starvation apart from the hydrological changes discussed above potential implications of the segmentation of the niger benue confluence include habitat break up making it difficult for species to interact closely and thus limiting biodiversity such break up will also impact the physical and chemical properties of the water fishing and other activities i e ecological and socioeconomic impacts as indicated by rice et al 2008 and yuan et al 2022a 5 2 development erosion and migration of bars 5 2 1 development and evolution of sandbars further downstream of the study area the development of bars has been attributed to damming or impoundment of rivers niger and benue abam 2001 dada et al 2018 this is suggested to have caused a significant drop in discharge at the confluence from 7000 m3 s in the pre dam years to 3000 m3 s in the post dam years has been reported in the current study area bars formed and are eroded over the period 1987 2022 and are emergent during low flow as seen on the landsat images figs 7 9 we attribute their occurrence to sediment supply and deposition within the rivers this is linked to waning flow velocities and low downstream sediment transport ability moreover bar development in the study area seems to be more effective in the benue than in the niger due to the abundance of bars in the former figs 7 9 this is perhaps a result of the damming of the niger at kainji and jebba dams fig 1 closer to the confluence than the benue causing fewer sediments to escape be transported downstream of the dams and thus reducing bar occurrence along river niger this interpretation is supported by average discharge values of 843 m3 s 1955 and 2014 and 3 468 m3 s 1994 and 2006 measured along river niger in niamey niger and river benue in makurdi this indicates the potential for the benue to provide more sediments for bar formation than the niger in a similar manner dam emplacement along the rhone the var the po and the ebro rivers has been linked to a 50 decline in sediment supply to the coast anthony et al 2016 also mueller and grams 2021 reveal that sandbar development along the colorado river in the grand canyon national park usa reduced significantly upon completion of the glen canyon dam the authors linked their observation to sediment trapping by the dam overall we attribute bar development in the study area to the availability of sediments combined load of 40 million tons yr at the confluence fig 4a discharge 5 643 m3 s between 1989 and 1992 table 1 and seasonal water fluxes from the rivers these factors have also been attributed to drive the formation of sand bars and islands at the junction of the meta and orinoco rivers in venezuela nordin and perez hernandez 1989 analysis conducted in this study reveal the abundance of bars especially the unvegetated bank attached types in the confluence area in the benue relative to the niger this is potentially related to a decrease in the slope of the benue relative to that of the niger and reduced flow over the years such processes will favor widespread bar growth in the benue side of the confluence as observed on the landsat images the slope bar development relationship appear realistic as a gentle to very gentle slope 1 7 000 to 1 10 000 has been revealed in the lower reach of the benue federal ministry of water resources and rural development 1995 table 1 favoring sandbar formation bar formation in this area is therefore supported by low gradient permitting low hydraulic flow and the availability of sediments our observations and analysis align with roy and sinha 2007 revelation that bar formation in the confluence area of the ganga ramganga streams is related to a decrease in the slope of the ramganga tributary relative to the ganga main the arrival of large sediments into rivers niger and benue will form new bars transport existing ones and change riverbed morphology by raising or shallowing them encouraging flooding of their channels and confluence area furthermore the occurrence of bars within the rivers particularly the many unvegetated bars within the benue predisposes them to erosion and disintegration this permitted further downstream transport of sediments formation and erosion of bars within and at the mouth of the rivers during periods of high and low sediment supply respectively and addition of materials to confluence junctions these processes underly the morphological changes identified in the area the occurrence of bars near the conference and the segmented nature of the confluence points to the possibility that the confluence formed from multiple downstream migrating bars this is further corroborated by the occurrence of unvegetated bars at conference segment junctions in the study area the occurrence of bars generally dictates channel width within the two rivers and the post confluence channel and play a significant role in influencing the direction of flow this has consequently limited efficient navigation and transportation of people and goods along major sections of the two rivers andersen et al 2005 also worth mentioning is the observed reduction in the surface area of a vegetated bar by up to 5 86 km2 in the upstream section of river niger figs 7 and 9c d this reduction probably occurred due to erosion and dislodgment of sediments segments at the western flank of the bar forcing the eroded or dislodged materials to migrate downstream towards the confluence moreover the static state of the main bar mass over the 35 year period is attributable to its vegetated nature this must have enhanced its stability and resistance to erosion revealing the positive feedback by which plant growth stabilizes landforms on earth 5 2 2 migration of sandbars the ca 120 m year migration rate estimated for a bar at the upstream part of river benue near the confluence indicates an important bar migration rate and a dynamic system of bars in the area in the study area bar migration is attributed to the appreciable sediment supply and water discharge that accompanies floods in the area as such pulses can account for the ca 120 m year bar migration rate periodic floods such as the september 2012 31 696 m3 s combined flood flow 12 84 m water level and 2020 23 459 m3 s combined flood flow 11 89 m water level floods are accompanied by high river flow power and discharge before assuming off flood values of ca 5 327 m3 s ca 2 7 m water level in december nihsa 2021 the migration of the analyzed bar was likely promoted by sediment transport and deposition in the benue during such events therefore downstream bar migration that would enhance sediment supply to the confluence and confluence erosion could explain changes in confluence morphology from a wide angle confluence in 1987 to a small angle confluence in 2022 likewise sandbar migration has been observed within tributary rivers at several confluences including at the upstream and downstream reaches of the non tropical niyang river at its confluence with the yarlung zangbo river in china yuan et al 2022b highly mobile sandbars with migration rates of up to 3 km year exist within the jamuna river best et al 2007 with important contribution of sediments to confluence dynamics 5 3 possible controls on bank processes and morphology of the confluence 5 3 1 availability of erodible materials within channels and their banks results from the study area have demonstrated landward bank expansion of up to 100 m on the western side of the river niger with limited expansion in other places the most significant channel enlargement was observed at the location of unvegetated bank attached bars along the eastern bank of the benue and post confluence channels while it was less discernible on other banks this suggests that the unvegetated bank attached bars are more vulnerable to erosion additionally the lack of bank attached bars along other banks coincides with the lower rate of channel expansion observed in those areas indicating that these banks may contain less erodible materials previous research has revealed that the banks of rivers niger and benue and their bars are mainly composed of sands these sediments are prone to erosion if not stabilized by vegetation knox 2007 thus the presence of erodible materials and the occurrence of vegetation along the banks are important controls on channel and bank expansion in the study area 5 3 2 occurrence of ridges and bedrock control the limited expansion of the niger and post confluence channels along their western banks may be attributed to the presence of large ridges or plateaus along this flank of the river however similar restrictions are observed along other banks of the river suggesting that ridge control is not a primary factor influencing bank expansion it is hypothesized that this may be due to the nature of the river channels and floodplains in the region which are predominantly composed of organic rich quaternary to recent alluvial sands with recent alluvium sandbars and ancient basement outcrops underlying eroded cretaceous sediments this suggests that the rivers could easily adjust their planforms given that the floodplains are erodible and the rivers can flow above the basement rocks elsewhere the availability of easily erodible floodplains as well as high sediment load of the arkansas and mississippi rivers and the potential lack of clay plugs promote rapid bank erosion along the arkansas river dixon et al 2018 this results in migration of meander bends and subsequently in confluence mobility no evidence of lateral migration was observed along the rivers of the study area within the 35 years studied suggesting that other factors such as reduced sediment load and discharge erosion resistant banks and outcropping basement rocks could be at play in addition the generally reduced flow capacity of the rivers over the years may have played a major role in controlling the migration of the rivers 5 3 3 discharge runoff and sediment load given the marked reduction in discharge and flow experienced in the area following the construction of dams abam 2001 dada et al 2018 we envisage that the reduced sediment flow contributed to the limited expansion experienced along the banks of the rivers and confluence planform evolution within the period under study lower water discharge and flow generally reduce river bank erosion and increase bar development in the rivers e g abam 2001 the period of enhanced runoff from late 80s to 2010 fig 4 in fact corresponds to the period in which drastic changes in confluence angle from large angle in 1987 to acute angle in 2010 began in the study area fig 10 consequently it is suggested that enhanced runoff in the confluence area is a primary factor driving morpho dynamic changes at the confluence additionally the significant change in confluence morphology between 2006 and 2013 fig 9b may be related to the 2012 flood fig 10 the impact of which has been documented further down south within the lower niger segment dada et al 2018 considering that reduced discharge and runoff at the confluence are accompanied by reduced sediment load abam 2001 dada et al 2018 we suggest the reduced sediment load must have played a key role by limiting the amount of sediments available and deposited for bar formation at the confluence while the niger typically traverse regions dominated by hard rocks which ordinarily limits sediments availability significant reduction has also been recorded in the amount of sediments reaching the confluence via the niger most of these sediments are trapped in front of the kainji dam a key sediment sink federal ministry of water resources and rural development 1995 hence limiting confluence mobility to a 2 2 km window and forcing a drastic change in its angle between 1987 and 2022 this idea is corroborated by previous researches e g dixon et al 2018 yuan et al 2021 which reveal that sediment load is an important factor influencing morpho dynamic changes at confluences for instance actively migrating confluences such as the confluence of the ganges and jamuna rivers benefit from the high sediment load and high discharge of the two rivers dixon et al 2018 discharge and sediment supply along these rivers is mainly influenced by monsoon dominated floods heightened uplift in the himalayas and continuing subsidence in the bengal foredeep goodbred et al 2003 reitz et al 2015 higher river flow power during floods has been linked to the erosion of sandbars and river banks in india s ganga river pal and pani 2019 in the present study area a similar process is suggested to be responsible for channel expansion as inferred in places within and away from the confluence area figs 7 and 9 also the yearly flood enhanced pulses of increased sediment supply would lead to the development and emergence of bars and shrinkage of floodplains when water level lowers similarly controlled floods have been used to grow sandbars in the grand canyon hazel et al 2008 mueller and grams 2021 flood enhanced sandbar formation is documented in the lower fraser river british columbia rice et al 2009 worth mentioning is the impact of discharge ratios of the two rivers on the morphology of the confluence it is reported that discharge within the two rivers is decreasing federal ministry of water resources and rural development 1995 based on the morphological changes observed at the confluence it is suggested that the reducing confluence angle from 1987 to 2022 points to an overall decadal scale decrease in the discharge ratio of the rivers e g best 1988 1986 considering the present day confluence is acute angled the present day runoff is likely to be within the 2010 range or higher however adequate and periodic discharge data of the two rivers are needed to study the impacts of their discharge ratio on morphologic and dynamic changes at the confluence 5 3 4 anthropogenic activities anthropogenic activities in the study area include dredging which was carried out along the lower segment of river niger from september 2009 to 2012 dada et al 2018 vanderburg 2010 and increased land use compelled by urbanization these activities are likely to have contributed to the limited expansion along the banks erosion disappearance and decrease in size of some of the bars within the study area thereby impacting the dynamics of the rivers and confluence planform dredging along this segment of the river has been suggested to trigger coastline erosion and subsequent shoreline recession in the niger delta region between december 2007 and april 2012 dada et al 2018 and is therefore a potential contributor to morpho dynamic changes in this area 6 conclusions this study provides detailed analyses of the morpho dynamic changes at the confluence of river niger and benue over a 35 year period we observed a net downstream migration of the confluence within a 2 2 km wide zone with a change in confluence angle from ca 154 in 1987 to ca 16 in 2022 the most significant change in confluence angle occurred between 1987 154 and 2006 50 potentially because of increase in runoff from the late 1980 s to 2010 in addition segmentation patterns of the confluence changed from two to three segments in different years potentially due to sediment starvation overall we attribute these changes to upstream erosion and downstream migration of bars which promoted sediment deposition and morpho dynamic changes at the confluence our results have wider implications for understanding the evolution of confluences in data starved tropical rivers that have low sediment load and are under anthropogenic influence on a global scale nevertheless up to date and reliable data on the sediment load discharge and other hydrological parameters of the niger and benue are needed to fully elucidate the controls on the morpho dynamics of the confluence funding this research was

1704,analysis of 35 years 1987 2022 of time lapse data derived from landsat imagery and srtm dem has revealed significant changes in planform morphology at the confluence of the river niger and river benue in lokoja west africa in the study area the niger is flanked by high elevation plateaus of ca 400 m altitude and low lying floodplains on its western bank the benue is characterized by more abundant intra channel and bank attached bars relative to the niger over the 35 year period a net downstream migration of 880 m was observed at the junction its angle decreased from ca 175 in 1987 to 50 in 2006 and to ca 16 in 2022 and showed varied segmentation patterns we establish a linkage between this decrease in confluence angle and increase in annual runoff in the study area expansion along the banks of the niger benue and post confluence channels was found to be low and non uniform suggesting varied resistance of the banks to erosion which is linked to the abundance of vegetation these decadal changes in confluence planform are important for understanding river confluence dynamics in major river systems around the world keywords river morpho dynamics sand bar migration niger benue

arcgis com landsatexplorer 1 introduction river confluences are of particular interest to geomorphologists sedimentologists and hydrogeochemists due to the complex interplay of hydrological and sedimentological processes which occur in these areas at these junctions intense incision of the substrate downstream of the confluence is common miall and jones 2003 mosley 1976 leading to the formation of scour holes and sediment bars best and rhoads 2008 these features are important for understanding the evolution of river systems yuan et al 2022a and their relevance for infrastructure environmental and sustainability planning moreover the sedimentological best 1988 sambrook smith et al 2019 ecological benda et al 2004 rice et al 2008 hydro geochemical characteristics guinoiseau et al 2016 maurice bourgoin et al 2003 and morphological transformation of landscapes can be linked to the morphological and dynamic processes occurring at these junctions the location of confluences and confluence planform of several rivers have been shown to change over time as demonstrated by the amite comite river confluence in the usa wang and xu 2020 shit and maiti 2013 also revealed small scale migration of gully confluences and linked it to sediment deposition studies such as grant et al 2013 and phillips et al 2005 have shown that sediment deposition at river junctions located downstream of dams can lead to local bed aggradation patterns that may result in lateral and longitudinal movement of the junction location these processes can be accompanied by episodic bank erosion and changes in bar formation processes at river confluence due to flooding events ettema 2008 the morphology of river confluences is heavily influenced by the ratio of the tributary discharge to that of the main river best 1988 mosley 1976 this ratio can have a major effect on scour hole morphology best 1988 mosley 1976 bar formation and migration best and rhoads 2008 boyer et al 2006 sediment load and migration rate of the channels mosley 1976 other factors that can contribute to morphological changes at the confluence include vegetation bedrock presence and anthropogenic activities such as land use and river damming grant et al 2013 hackney and carling 2011 knox 2007 furthermore the angle of the confluence can influence the formation of bars in the tributary and post confluence channels which can lead to widening of channels and subsequent changes in confluence morphology mosley 1976 it is evident that in order to understand and accurately model river confluences many factors must be taken into consideration recent studies on the morpho dynamics of river confluences have been enabled by advances in technology allowing the incorporation of satellite imagery and other techniques for a greater understanding of morphological changes and processes costard and gautier 2007 hackney and carling 2011 lewin and ashworth 2014 wang and xu 2020 these methods have enabled the reliable establishment of material transport three dimensional flow pattern riverbed and junction evolution ecological contamination and environmental components yuan et al 2022a channel dimension changes and dynamics at confluences they have also made it relatively easy and cheaper to remotely conduct land use adeoye 2012 sustainability and transport planning activities along rivers and their confluences laboratory best 1988 mosley 1976 yu et al 2020 yuan et al 2018 and field studies rice et al 2009 shit and maiti 2013 wang and xu 2020 yuan et al 2021 have provided insight into the morpho dynamics of river confluences however knowledge of the extent of these changes and their controls especially in tropical rivers with low sediment loads is sparse thus there is an impetus to investigate the morpho dynamic behavior at tropical river confluences this is important as knowledge of the morpho dynamic behavior at river confluences has direct implications for the planning risk evaluation and sustainable management of aquatic resources including drinking water hydro electricity food and habitat for the society andersen et al 2005 richter et al 2003 this study therefore investigates the multidecadal morphological changes and dynamics at the confluence of two major rivers with relatively low sediment loads the rivers niger and benue in west africa the confluence of these two important rivers is an ideal location to study morpho dynamic changes in tropical rivers due to its observability on remote sensing data we analyze the planform morpho dynamics of the confluence estimate the spatial extent and mobility of its planform and describe the morphological changes in the confluent rivers further we seek to identify potential controls on the morphological changes at the confluence over a 35 year period 1987 2022 2 geography hydro meteorological parameters and geology 2 1 geography and hydro meteorology river niger is the third longest river in africa stretching ca 4 200 km fig 1 table 1 it is a major source of livelihood for the population of the niger benue basin estimated at 100 million people across nine countries benin burkina faso cameroon chad cote d ivoire guinea mali niger and nigeria andersen et al 2005 fig 1 its source lies in the guinea highlands futa jalon mountains in southeastern guinea fig 1 abrate et al 2013 from there it travels through several countries until it reaches nigeria where it is dammed at lake kainji and jebba in western nigeria some 400 km away from lokoja the study area figs 1 and 2 the river niger in nigeria is fed by several major tributaries including the rivers sokoto kaduna and benue fig 2 river benue the largest of these tributaries has a total length of approximately 1 400 km table 1 and its source is in the adamawa plateau of cameroon fig 1 table 1 river benue is joined by several other tributaries including the rivers taraba donga and katsina ala fig 2 before it reaches its confluence with river niger in lokoja figs 1 and 3 the post confluence channel formed by the two rivers meanders downstream for about 350 km and empties into the vast niger delta which is one of the world s most prolific hydrocarbon provinces and onwards into the gulf of guinea offshore southern nigeria figs 1 and 2 lokoja nigeria has a warm continental climate with an average annual temperature of 30 7 c the relative humidity is 30 in the dry season and increases to 70 in the wet season olivera et al 1995 this environment supports a guinea parkland savannah vegetation type with tall grasses and trees that are green during the wet season and dry during the dry season the study area including the confluence of rivers niger benue and post confluence is densely vegetated fig 3a b the western bank of river niger which is home to the city of lokoja hosts patches of vegetation along the riverbank and around buildings annual rainfall in this area typically commences in march april and ceases in october november with a brief break in august olatunde and adejoh 2017 however hydro meteorological data in this area and in nigeria in general is lacking with most key stations being inactive ekeu wei and blackburn 2018 ngene et al 2015 for instance river benue has two hydrological provinces the upper benue and the lower benue fig 2 table 1 both of which are of importance to this study of the 30 existing stations within the lower benue only 6 are currently in operation ngene et al 2015 abam 1999 and olayinka dosunmu et al 2022 have estimated the sediment yield within the upper and lower hydrological provinces to be 101 tons km2 and 98 tons km2 respectively the average annual discharge of rivers niger and benue measured at selected hydrological stations including makurdi umaisha naimey and katsina ala fig 1 display significant variability as shown in table 1 the river benue s main sediment load is sourced from both cameroon and its nigerian catchment area causing riverbank and catchment erosion olayinka dosunmu et al 2022 a post confluence sediment load of 40 million tons year is estimated for the niger river basin area of 1 143 000 million km2 milliman and syvitski 1992 river benue s pre confluence sediment load is estimated at 22 million tons year for its 338 000 million km2 catchment area 1932 1957 fig 4 a the post confluence load of the niger is considered as the combined load of both rivers with the benue contributing an estimated 50 of the discharge abrate et al 2013 nonetheless these values are lower than those of large river systems such as the ganges and amazon and higher than those of some west african rivers such as the tano and senegal fig 4a data at lokoja show an increase in annual runoff from approximately 4 200 m3 s in the late 1980 s to about 6 400 m3 s in the mid 1990 s and again to 6 400 m3 s in 2010 at the confluence fig 4b this area is subject to seasonal flooding which is triggered by water releases from the kainji and lagdo dams upstream of rivers niger and benue respectively fig 1 in addition the average annual rainfall of 1 185 mm in nigeria fao 1997 contributes to the high river flow power and discharge record floods occurred in september 2012 31 696 m3 s combined flood flow 12 84 m water level and 2020 23 459 m3 s combined flood flow 11 89 m water level during off flood periods the runoff and water level can drop to around 5 327 m3 s and 2 7 m respectively 2 2 geology stream gradient and geomorphology the stratigraphic succession of the niger basin extending from jebba to lokoja in the mid niger basin and the anambra basin ranges from ancient archean formations to recent alluvial deposits andersen et al 2005 the floodplains of river niger are composed of a mixture of quaternary to recent organic rich coarse alluvial deposits and sandy structures such as sandbars along the river channels with weathered lateritic soils present in adjoining areas adojoh and dada 2015 olatunde and adejoh 2017 these alluvial deposits extend to the benue valley and all the way to chad andersen et al 2005 the mid niger basin is composed of three distinct lithostratigraphic units belonging to the upper cretaceous and overlying the precambrian crystalline basement complex is characterized by a gentle dip abimbola 1997 these units include the basal lokoja formation the patti formation and the uppermost agbaja ironstone formation the lokoja formation unconformably overlies the basement complex and is composed of basal conglomerates and arkosic sandstones abimbola 1997 adojoh and dada 2015 the patti formation is characterized by interbedded sandstones siltstones and carbonaceous mudstone units while the agbaja formation consists of oolitic pisolitic and argillaceous ironstones abimbola 1997 the basement complex rocks which also extend to other areas of nigeria including the southwest lawal et al 2022 include migmatized gneisses metasediments like schists quartzite and marble low lying basement rock outcrops are observed along the river channels because of river incision and erosion of the cretaceous sediments in the upper reach of river niger located approximately 100 km from its confluence with the sokoto river the river flows through extensive alluvial plains with a slope ranging from 1 7 000 to 1 8 000 table 1 at around 200 km from the sokoto confluence to jebba dam the river has carved a system of narrow valleys due to the steep slopes created by the rock outcrops on both banks which range from 1 3 000 to 1 4 000 this area is the site of the kainji and jebba dams which take advantage of the high head further downstream in the middle reach from lokoja to jebba spanning 250 km the slope is gentler and ranges from 1 5 000 to 1 7 000 which promotes the formation of sandbars federal ministry of water resources and rural development 1995 river benue exhibits a steep slope 1 4 000 in its upper reaches transporting significant volumes of sediment rich material this steep slope transitions to a gentle slope 1 7 000 to 1 8 000 in its middle reaches and further transitions to a very gentle slope 1 10 000 to 1 12 000 in its lower reaches between lokoja and the niger delta table 1 the gentle slope in this area facilitates the deposition of sediment rich material resulting in the development of sandbanks the confluence of the niger and benue located in lokoja nigeria is bordered by the agbaja plateau an extensive and irregularly shaped plateau trending in a northwest southeast direction adojoh and dada 2015 omada and owadi 2009 south of this plateau lies mount patti a star shaped feature trending in the same direction adojoh and dada 2015 further south is the southern hills which trend southwest northeast the katon karfe plateau lies between the arms of rivers niger and benue located to the north of the confluence adojoh and dada 2015 according to adeleye 1973 the plateaus in this area are composed of campano maastrichtian sediments and capped and preserved by a thick bed of lateritic pisolitic and oolitic sediments of the agbaja formation dropping steeply towards the crystalline basement 3 data and research methods a digital elevation model dem of the rivers niger and benue confluence area was derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a spatial resolution of 30 m 1 arc second the dem was provided by the united state geological survey and loaded into esri s arcmap software a three dimensional representation was generated in the esri s arcscene software while cross sections were generated to understand the planform morphology of the rivers and confluence area georeferenced landsat images of 1987 2006 2013 2015 2018 and 2022 spanning a 35 year period were also analyzed to detect any planform dynamics of the confluence these images had a resolution of 30 megapixels and were generated and downloaded using the esri s landsat explorer application https livingatlas2 arcgis com landsatexplorer in nigeria rivers niger and benue have widths of several kilometers making them ideal for delineation of planform changes using landsat imagery to avoid potential issues associated with seasonal discharge variations and unavailability of data imagery from december of each year for 2011 2021 was used for our analysis except for 2022 for which imagery from january was used in addition landsat imagery with cloud cover ranging from 0 to 10 was selected to reduce visibility issues and improve the accuracy of morphological feature detection this cloud cover range also limited the availability of imagery to understand the variations in confluence or junction angle within the 35 year period the approach of hackney and carling 2011 was adopted to measure the junction angle from one year to the other the approach involved drawing centerlines within rivers niger and benue and the post confluence channel to three channel widths from the confluence and measuring the angle formed at the intersection of the centerlines of the two rivers to understand the overall changes in channel course and location of the riverbanks i e expansion or contraction between 1987 and 2022 a shapefile of 1987 planform was cautiously prepared digitized and superimposed on the 2022 image additionally shapefiles of the confluence area were made for all available years and compared with themselves to understand changes in confluence planform measurement error arising from the digitization is 5 m which is small considering the hundreds of meters scale changes observed in the area the separation between the 1987 and 2022 riverbanks was measured at specific locations to estimate how much the riverbank has changed or expanded this was complemented by using the landsat explorer s change detection tool https livingatlas2 arcgis com landsatexplorer to automatically compute the changes between the two dates i e an earlier and a later date the computed changes were rendered in geology mode to highlight all locations where changes in planform exist between the two years the geology mode is a band combination that enhances geological features on the platform subsequently the changes were computed by assigning colors say purple and green to planform features from the two different years and superimposing them to detect sites of possible changes all the images were then extracted and exported as georeferenced high resolution tiff files from landsat explorer and were imported into arcmap for further analysis analyses performed include estimating bar migration rate river channel expansion and the area of the eroded part of bars in this study the rate of bar migration explains how far a bar has migrated or moved from a reference point over a specified period while river channel expansion reveals increase in the width of a river channel at specific locations over a specified period to estimate the rate of bar migration between two dates the separation between the location of the bar in a previous year and its location in a more recent year was measured and divided by the difference of the two years the distance was measured from the center point of the bar in an earlier year to its center point in a later year in this work the area of eroded part of a bar is explained as the surface area of the missing or eroded part of a bar as determined from the comparison of the planform of the bar on an earlier date to its morphology on a later date where the area of eroded or dislodged part of a bar was estimated a polygon was created around the area and the area of this polygon was calculated in arcmap and taken as a representation of the surface area of the eroded portion of the bar 4 result 4 1 planform morphological characteristics the confluence of rivers niger and benue is characterized by a separation of up to 7 8 km in the upstream section of the rivers declining southward until the confluence and forming a post confluence channel at lokoja fig 5 the rivers and their flood plains are in low lying areas that are flanked by high elevation features such as the agbaja plateau and mount patti the agbaja plateau and mount patti rise up to 428 m above sea level and extend for more than 8 km and 3 km southward in the study area respectively the trajectory of river niger exhibits a slight bend at the location of the agbaja plateau indicating that the ridge forced the niger to adjust its pathway downstream figs 5 and 6 additionally a system of ridges is observed in the western part of the study area reaching up to 350 m high and extending several kilometers landward the ridges are dissected by the floodplains of river niger and the post confluence channel river benue is characterized by a southern hill that is approximately 50 m high and up to 350 m high further south figs 5 and 6 the floodplains of the post confluence channel along its eastern flanks reach adjoining areas at the bottom of this hill the koton karfe plateau is situated to the north and is up to 300 m high figs 5 and 6 additionally regularly to irregularly shaped bars of up to 800 m wide and 42 m high are either attached to the channel flanks or located within the channel figs 5 and 7 the width and depth of rivers niger and benue upstream of the confluence are estimated to be approximately 1 4 km and 36 m and 1 7 km and 35 m respectively figs 5 and 6 at the confluence the widths of the two rivers are approximately 1 km while the width and depth of the post confluence channel are 37 m and 1 24 1 73 km respectively 4 2 upstream downstream confluence migration and changes in confluence angle and form the images presented in fig 7 reveal southward downstream and northward upstream changes in the location of the junction of the confluence the downstream extension is observed between 1987 and 2013 no net change in the location of the junction was observed between 2013 and 2015 between 2015 and 2022 the junction location moved upstream showing that the junction has experienced upstream migration collectively this shows upstream and downstream migration of the junction within a zone that is about 2 2 km wide between 1987 and 2022 fig 7 this 2 2 km estimate is twice the widths of rivers niger and benue at the confluence ca 1 6 times the upstream width of river niger and ca 1 3 times the upstream width of river benue in this area moreover the confluence angle also changed over time from ca 175 in 1987 to ca 50 in 2006 ca 30 in 2013 ca 27 in 2015 and a ca 16 in 2018 and 2022 fig 8 the morphology of the junction changed from near flat in 1987 to semi pointed in 2006 and to a pointed and sharp edged morphology in 2022 figs 7 and 8 this change was accompanied by a limited lateral expansion of the confluence within a zone that was ca 3 5 km wide in the upstream part of the confluence fig 9 a which is ca 2 5 times the upstream width of the river niger and ca 2 16 km wide in the middle of the confluence the change is further linked to the erosion or dislodgment of parts of the confluence figs 7 9 such as at its western edge that was eroded by about 0 71 km between 1987 and 2022 fig 9a this edge was observed to extend westward and into the niger channel on the 1987 land sat image figs 7 9 it is however absent on post 1987 images suggesting that the confluence edge extension was an obstruction to flow and was eroded or dislodged from the main confluence as flow impacted on it an overall decrease in width along the confluence is noticeable from 1987 to 2022 fig 9 during this period the location of the external banks of the two rivers remained relatively fixed however changes in the order of a few tens to hundreds of meters were observed locally in areas upstream of the confluence along the two rivers fig 9a fig 9b shows a significant reduction in the width of the confluence by up to 0 4 km from 2006 to 2013 with the position of the external banks of rivers niger and benue remaining unchanged fig 9b the confluence is also characterized by its segmented nature which is more clearly seen in the post 1987 images figs 7 to 9a d two major segments are visible on the 2006 image three on the 2013 and 2015 images and two that are ca 0 24 km apart on the 2018 and 2022 images figs 7 and 8 the confluence segments are also found on the ground truth images from 2017 fig 4 at the locations where the segments changed from three to two unvegetated sediments bars joining the two segments are observed indicating recent deposition of sediments figs 7 and 8 overall there is a downstream southern extension of the junction by approximately 880 m in the study area between 1987 and 2022 fig 9d 4 3 intra channel and bank attached bars figs 7 and 9 show the presence of multiple bars upstream of rivers benue and niger and at the confluence while intra channel and flank attached bars were observed within the two rivers the latter were more common in river benue intra channel bars within the niger and confluence area were commonly vegetated while flank attached and intra channel bars within the benue were commonly unvegetated fig 7 and 9a c a reduction in the sizes of some intra channel bars upstream of the confluence over the 35 year period was observed for instance in the location marked b upstream of river niger a north south oriented and vegetated intra channel bar was identified figs 7 and 9d although the position of the bar remained relatively fixed between 1987 and 2022 there was a marked reduction in the size of the bar in 2022 relative to 1987 fig 7 and 9c d the estimated surface area of the missing portion was 5 86 km2 furthermore at the upstream portion of river benue a decrease in the separation of a bar and a reference point to its northeast yellow dot near point a was observed between 2013 and 2022 fig 7 the estimated distance between the dot and the center of the bar was 1 05 km in 2013 in 2018 the distance between the two points reduced to 0 19 km while in 2022 the bar widened and its center coincided with the location of the dot this indicates that the bar grew and migrated downstream over approximately 1 05 km between 2013 and 2022 at an average rate of approximately 120 m year 4 4 marked evidence for river channel expansion analysis of the vegetated external banks of rivers niger and benue and the post confluence channel between 1987 and 2022 revealed slight changes that are mainly along the western bank of the niger upstream of the confluence fig 9c d however local increases in channel width were observed along the channels of the rivers niger and benue and the post confluence channel at the eastern flank of the post confluence channel a local increase in width by 1 2 km was estimated due to the erosion of a bank attached bar which was accompanied by the occurrence of a smaller but linear bar on the western flank of the river upstream of the same river the 1987 western bank was observed to have shifted landward by 0 1 km indicating landward expansion of the river niger channel due to bank erosion in the area the change detection image computed for the period fig 9d confirms an expansion of the river niger and river benue in the study area the width of river niger near the confluence decreased by approximately 0 67 km promoting the expansion of the niger channel in that location fig 9c d along the eastern flank of river benue an increase in channel width was identified at its upstream intermediate and downstream parts between 1987 and 2022 fig 9c d at the downstream part the width of the channel increased due to the erosion of a ca 0 52 km wide bank attached bar that extended into the river on the 1987 image fig 9c d midway along the confluence the initial 1987 channel width has widened on the present day 2022 image due to the erosion or dislodgment of parts of the confluence upstream of the same river a localized increase in the width of the channel by ca 0 52 km is noted due to the erosion of an unvegetated bank attached bar fig 9c d no evidence of lateral migration or avulsion of the rivers was observed over the 35 year period in the study area 5 discussion 5 1 architectural changes in planform morphology from 1987 to 2022 5 1 1 drastic changes in planform morphology results of this study show that the rivers niger and benue confluence is undergoing drastic changes to its planform morphology these changes are primarily indicated by variations in confluence angle and form changes in channel widths of the niger benue and post confluence channel and bar migration over a 35 year period a 2 2 km confluence migration window was estimated in the study area fig 7 this estimate is significant when compared to a similar tropical confluence at the junction of the congo and kasai rivers democratic republic of congo that exhibited no migration between 1984 and 2014 the stationarity of the kongo kasai confluence is related to the occurrence of bedrock control which prevents lateral migration of the river channels dixon et al 2018 in terms of sediment load the niger also has 30 more load than the congo although the congo discharges seven times more water to the ocean andersen et al 2005 low sediment load has been linked to reduced confluence dynamics bilal et al 2020 in the case of the congo and kasai rivers their low sediment loads are likely to have contributed in addition to bedrock control to the stationarity of their confluence additionally the 2 2 km estimate of the niger benue confluence is less significant in comparison with the 12 14 km estimate at the confluence of the ganges and jamuna rivers in bangladesh between 1973 and 2014 these are rivers with significantly higher sediment loads sambrook smith et al 2019 in comparison to the niger and benue their high sediment load means there is more sediment to form sandbars and migrate them downstream to contribute to the morpho dynamic changes occurring at their confluence this relationship between mobility and load suggest that sediment load is a key factor dictating the extent of confluence mobility in the study area and at many river confluences on the contrary some non tropical large confluences formed by high sediment load rivers are stable this is the case at the confluence of the yarlung zangbo and niyang rivers in china where local topography i e the niyang river delta and a mountain limit mobility yuan et al 2022b confluence dynamics is associated with shifts in scour location in the direction of migration ashmore and parker 1983 sambrook smith et al 2019 based on this it is suggested that the upstream and dominant downstream extension migration of the junction allows a northward and dominant southward shift in scour location in the study area downstream confluence migration permits sediment deposition and bar formation downstream of the location of scouring best 1986 this migration pattern as observed in the study area fig 7 may promote sediment deposition or bar formation downstream of a potential scour hole and within the post confluence channel the occurrence of bars within the channel figs 5 and 7 evidences this relationship furthermore a significant decrease of over 150 in confluence angle from ca 174 in 1987 to ca 16 in 2022 is shown in the study area fig 8 these estimates above are greater and smaller than the upper and lower limits of the angles 1000 600 estimated for the orinoco meta rivers confluence 1973 2014 dixon et al 2018 where post confluence channel width 1 2 km estimate is like the present study area but with much larger load than the niger and benue according to best 1988 and mosley 1976 decreasing confluence angle corresponds to decreasing scour depth and decreasing discharge of the minor tributary relative to that of the major tributary similarly the wide confluence angle of 1987 translates to remarkable scouring downstream of the confluence as mosley 1976 reveal there is no appreciable scour up to a confluence angle of 15 and scour depth increases rapidly just above this value it is argued that present day scour in the rivers niger and benue confluence is not significant due to a low confluence angle of around 16 going by the above mentioned studies the present day confluence angle is also attributed to decreasing discharge of the benue relative to the niger however the lack of up to date and year to year discharge data for individual rivers makes it impossible to examine this claim in the current study howard 1971 reveals that wide confluence angles indicate higher slope of the tributary relative to the main river while a small confluence angle signals nearly equal slope likewise we argue that the decrease in confluence angle over 35 years in the present study area corresponds to a decrease in the relative slope of the benue compared to the niger near the confluence 5 1 2 segmentation style at the confluence multiple segments of the confluence are observed in the study area ranging from two to three segments with inter segment spacing of about 0 24 km figs 7 9 while this segmentation pattern is uncommon the observations prove multiple confluence junctions rather than one promoting complex and changing flow dynamics sediment deposition and erosion within the river channels in the study area segmentation in the study area is particularly interesting as the main confluence landmass itself is divided into several segments that are from time to time merged or bridged by unvegetated sandbars the unvegetated bars indicate recent sediment deposition the observed segmentation pattern in the study area is unlike that observed in many other confluence systems most of which are not broken into several segments an example is the junction of the non tropical lena and aldan rivers in russia dixon et al 2018 at this confluence the junction is largely unsegmented and is surrounded by numerous downstream migrating bars although bars migrate towards and contribute to the evolution of the niger benue confluence we ascribe its segmentation to the overall decadal decrease in discharge and load of the niger and benue causing a form of sediment starvation apart from the hydrological changes discussed above potential implications of the segmentation of the niger benue confluence include habitat break up making it difficult for species to interact closely and thus limiting biodiversity such break up will also impact the physical and chemical properties of the water fishing and other activities i e ecological and socioeconomic impacts as indicated by rice et al 2008 and yuan et al 2022a 5 2 development erosion and migration of bars 5 2 1 development and evolution of sandbars further downstream of the study area the development of bars has been attributed to damming or impoundment of rivers niger and benue abam 2001 dada et al 2018 this is suggested to have caused a significant drop in discharge at the confluence from 7000 m3 s in the pre dam years to 3000 m3 s in the post dam years has been reported in the current study area bars formed and are eroded over the period 1987 2022 and are emergent during low flow as seen on the landsat images figs 7 9 we attribute their occurrence to sediment supply and deposition within the rivers this is linked to waning flow velocities and low downstream sediment transport ability moreover bar development in the study area seems to be more effective in the benue than in the niger due to the abundance of bars in the former figs 7 9 this is perhaps a result of the damming of the niger at kainji and jebba dams fig 1 closer to the confluence than the benue causing fewer sediments to escape be transported downstream of the dams and thus reducing bar occurrence along river niger this interpretation is supported by average discharge values of 843 m3 s 1955 and 2014 and 3 468 m3 s 1994 and 2006 measured along river niger in niamey niger and river benue in makurdi this indicates the potential for the benue to provide more sediments for bar formation than the niger in a similar manner dam emplacement along the rhone the var the po and the ebro rivers has been linked to a 50 decline in sediment supply to the coast anthony et al 2016 also mueller and grams 2021 reveal that sandbar development along the colorado river in the grand canyon national park usa reduced significantly upon completion of the glen canyon dam the authors linked their observation to sediment trapping by the dam overall we attribute bar development in the study area to the availability of sediments combined load of 40 million tons yr at the confluence fig 4a discharge 5 643 m3 s between 1989 and 1992 table 1 and seasonal water fluxes from the rivers these factors have also been attributed to drive the formation of sand bars and islands at the junction of the meta and orinoco rivers in venezuela nordin and perez hernandez 1989 analysis conducted in this study reveal the abundance of bars especially the unvegetated bank attached types in the confluence area in the benue relative to the niger this is potentially related to a decrease in the slope of the benue relative to that of the niger and reduced flow over the years such processes will favor widespread bar growth in the benue side of the confluence as observed on the landsat images the slope bar development relationship appear realistic as a gentle to very gentle slope 1 7 000 to 1 10 000 has been revealed in the lower reach of the benue federal ministry of water resources and rural development 1995 table 1 favoring sandbar formation bar formation in this area is therefore supported by low gradient permitting low hydraulic flow and the availability of sediments our observations and analysis align with roy and sinha 2007 revelation that bar formation in the confluence area of the ganga ramganga streams is related to a decrease in the slope of the ramganga tributary relative to the ganga main the arrival of large sediments into rivers niger and benue will form new bars transport existing ones and change riverbed morphology by raising or shallowing them encouraging flooding of their channels and confluence area furthermore the occurrence of bars within the rivers particularly the many unvegetated bars within the benue predisposes them to erosion and disintegration this permitted further downstream transport of sediments formation and erosion of bars within and at the mouth of the rivers during periods of high and low sediment supply respectively and addition of materials to confluence junctions these processes underly the morphological changes identified in the area the occurrence of bars near the conference and the segmented nature of the confluence points to the possibility that the confluence formed from multiple downstream migrating bars this is further corroborated by the occurrence of unvegetated bars at conference segment junctions in the study area the occurrence of bars generally dictates channel width within the two rivers and the post confluence channel and play a significant role in influencing the direction of flow this has consequently limited efficient navigation and transportation of people and goods along major sections of the two rivers andersen et al 2005 also worth mentioning is the observed reduction in the surface area of a vegetated bar by up to 5 86 km2 in the upstream section of river niger figs 7 and 9c d this reduction probably occurred due to erosion and dislodgment of sediments segments at the western flank of the bar forcing the eroded or dislodged materials to migrate downstream towards the confluence moreover the static state of the main bar mass over the 35 year period is attributable to its vegetated nature this must have enhanced its stability and resistance to erosion revealing the positive feedback by which plant growth stabilizes landforms on earth 5 2 2 migration of sandbars the ca 120 m year migration rate estimated for a bar at the upstream part of river benue near the confluence indicates an important bar migration rate and a dynamic system of bars in the area in the study area bar migration is attributed to the appreciable sediment supply and water discharge that accompanies floods in the area as such pulses can account for the ca 120 m year bar migration rate periodic floods such as the september 2012 31 696 m3 s combined flood flow 12 84 m water level and 2020 23 459 m3 s combined flood flow 11 89 m water level floods are accompanied by high river flow power and discharge before assuming off flood values of ca 5 327 m3 s ca 2 7 m water level in december nihsa 2021 the migration of the analyzed bar was likely promoted by sediment transport and deposition in the benue during such events therefore downstream bar migration that would enhance sediment supply to the confluence and confluence erosion could explain changes in confluence morphology from a wide angle confluence in 1987 to a small angle confluence in 2022 likewise sandbar migration has been observed within tributary rivers at several confluences including at the upstream and downstream reaches of the non tropical niyang river at its confluence with the yarlung zangbo river in china yuan et al 2022b highly mobile sandbars with migration rates of up to 3 km year exist within the jamuna river best et al 2007 with important contribution of sediments to confluence dynamics 5 3 possible controls on bank processes and morphology of the confluence 5 3 1 availability of erodible materials within channels and their banks results from the study area have demonstrated landward bank expansion of up to 100 m on the western side of the river niger with limited expansion in other places the most significant channel enlargement was observed at the location of unvegetated bank attached bars along the eastern bank of the benue and post confluence channels while it was less discernible on other banks this suggests that the unvegetated bank attached bars are more vulnerable to erosion additionally the lack of bank attached bars along other banks coincides with the lower rate of channel expansion observed in those areas indicating that these banks may contain less erodible materials previous research has revealed that the banks of rivers niger and benue and their bars are mainly composed of sands these sediments are prone to erosion if not stabilized by vegetation knox 2007 thus the presence of erodible materials and the occurrence of vegetation along the banks are important controls on channel and bank expansion in the study area 5 3 2 occurrence of ridges and bedrock control the limited expansion of the niger and post confluence channels along their western banks may be attributed to the presence of large ridges or plateaus along this flank of the river however similar restrictions are observed along other banks of the river suggesting that ridge control is not a primary factor influencing bank expansion it is hypothesized that this may be due to the nature of the river channels and floodplains in the region which are predominantly composed of organic rich quaternary to recent alluvial sands with recent alluvium sandbars and ancient basement outcrops underlying eroded cretaceous sediments this suggests that the rivers could easily adjust their planforms given that the floodplains are erodible and the rivers can flow above the basement rocks elsewhere the availability of easily erodible floodplains as well as high sediment load of the arkansas and mississippi rivers and the potential lack of clay plugs promote rapid bank erosion along the arkansas river dixon et al 2018 this results in migration of meander bends and subsequently in confluence mobility no evidence of lateral migration was observed along the rivers of the study area within the 35 years studied suggesting that other factors such as reduced sediment load and discharge erosion resistant banks and outcropping basement rocks could be at play in addition the generally reduced flow capacity of the rivers over the years may have played a major role in controlling the migration of the rivers 5 3 3 discharge runoff and sediment load given the marked reduction in discharge and flow experienced in the area following the construction of dams abam 2001 dada et al 2018 we envisage that the reduced sediment flow contributed to the limited expansion experienced along the banks of the rivers and confluence planform evolution within the period under study lower water discharge and flow generally reduce river bank erosion and increase bar development in the rivers e g abam 2001 the period of enhanced runoff from late 80s to 2010 fig 4 in fact corresponds to the period in which drastic changes in confluence angle from large angle in 1987 to acute angle in 2010 began in the study area fig 10 consequently it is suggested that enhanced runoff in the confluence area is a primary factor driving morpho dynamic changes at the confluence additionally the significant change in confluence morphology between 2006 and 2013 fig 9b may be related to the 2012 flood fig 10 the impact of which has been documented further down south within the lower niger segment dada et al 2018 considering that reduced discharge and runoff at the confluence are accompanied by reduced sediment load abam 2001 dada et al 2018 we suggest the reduced sediment load must have played a key role by limiting the amount of sediments available and deposited for bar formation at the confluence while the niger typically traverse regions dominated by hard rocks which ordinarily limits sediments availability significant reduction has also been recorded in the amount of sediments reaching the confluence via the niger most of these sediments are trapped in front of the kainji dam a key sediment sink federal ministry of water resources and rural development 1995 hence limiting confluence mobility to a 2 2 km window and forcing a drastic change in its angle between 1987 and 2022 this idea is corroborated by previous researches e g dixon et al 2018 yuan et al 2021 which reveal that sediment load is an important factor influencing morpho dynamic changes at confluences for instance actively migrating confluences such as the confluence of the ganges and jamuna rivers benefit from the high sediment load and high discharge of the two rivers dixon et al 2018 discharge and sediment supply along these rivers is mainly influenced by monsoon dominated floods heightened uplift in the himalayas and continuing subsidence in the bengal foredeep goodbred et al 2003 reitz et al 2015 higher river flow power during floods has been linked to the erosion of sandbars and river banks in india s ganga river pal and pani 2019 in the present study area a similar process is suggested to be responsible for channel expansion as inferred in places within and away from the confluence area figs 7 and 9 also the yearly flood enhanced pulses of increased sediment supply would lead to the development and emergence of bars and shrinkage of floodplains when water level lowers similarly controlled floods have been used to grow sandbars in the grand canyon hazel et al 2008 mueller and grams 2021 flood enhanced sandbar formation is documented in the lower fraser river british columbia rice et al 2009 worth mentioning is the impact of discharge ratios of the two rivers on the morphology of the confluence it is reported that discharge within the two rivers is decreasing federal ministry of water resources and rural development 1995 based on the morphological changes observed at the confluence it is suggested that the reducing confluence angle from 1987 to 2022 points to an overall decadal scale decrease in the discharge ratio of the rivers e g best 1988 1986 considering the present day confluence is acute angled the present day runoff is likely to be within the 2010 range or higher however adequate and periodic discharge data of the two rivers are needed to study the impacts of their discharge ratio on morphologic and dynamic changes at the confluence 5 3 4 anthropogenic activities anthropogenic activities in the study area include dredging which was carried out along the lower segment of river niger from september 2009 to 2012 dada et al 2018 vanderburg 2010 and increased land use compelled by urbanization these activities are likely to have contributed to the limited expansion along the banks erosion disappearance and decrease in size of some of the bars within the study area thereby impacting the dynamics of the rivers and confluence planform dredging along this segment of the river has been suggested to trigger coastline erosion and subsequent shoreline recession in the niger delta region between december 2007 and april 2012 dada et al 2018 and is therefore a potential contributor to morpho dynamic changes in this area 6 conclusions this study provides detailed analyses of the morpho dynamic changes at the confluence of river niger and benue over a 35 year period we observed a net downstream migration of the confluence within a 2 2 km wide zone with a change in confluence angle from ca 154 in 1987 to ca 16 in 2022 the most significant change in confluence angle occurred between 1987 154 and 2006 50 potentially because of increase in runoff from the late 1980 s to 2010 in addition segmentation patterns of the confluence changed from two to three segments in different years potentially due to sediment starvation overall we attribute these changes to upstream erosion and downstream migration of bars which promoted sediment deposition and morpho dynamic changes at the confluence our results have wider implications for understanding the evolution of confluences in data starved tropical rivers that have low sediment load and are under anthropogenic influence on a global scale nevertheless up to date and reliable data on the sediment load discharge and other hydrological parameters of the niger and benue are needed to fully elucidate the controls on the morpho dynamics of the confluence funding this research was
