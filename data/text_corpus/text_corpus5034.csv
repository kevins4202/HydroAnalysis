25170,transferability of species distribution models sdms is key to predicting invasion patterns and can be challenged if niche shift occurs in the invaded range when using native occurrences to estimate potential invasions with presence only modeling methods it is important to constrain the pseudo absence pa sampling to the species native range however some studies including highly cited ones do not follow this approach to selecting pa samples in this research we addressed two questions using an invasive species in the united states u s kudzu bug megacopta cribraria 1 is model transferability challenged by a non adaptive niche shift and 2 is model performance affected by use of pa samples from outside the native range of the species kudzu bug is native to asia with recently observed non adaptive niche shift in the u s to answer the first question we quantified the environmental space anisotropy and non adaptive niche change and then evaluated the performances of seven sdms to answer the second question we further compared the interpolation and transferability of seven sdms trained with pas from the native range and from both native and invaded ranges we confirmed that the environmental space anisotropy p 0 01 and non adaptive niche change p 0 01 are both statistically significant of the seven sdms used four models had transferability indices higher than 0 9 boosted regression tree and random forests both had good interpolation and transferability auc 0 80 and kappa 0 60 whereas three other models showed good interpolation and fair transferability auc 0 70 and kappa 0 40 inclusion of pseudo absences from the invaded range significantly increased the interpolation p 0 001 but decreased the transferability p 0 01 of almost all models our findings suggest that sdms can show good transferability with non adaptive niche shift thus native occurrence information should be used in similar situation we confirmed that it is crucial to constrain the pas to the same spatial range as presences to accurately model potential invasions keywords ensemble models ecological niche modeling kudzu bug megacopta cribraria invasive species non adaptive niche shift 1 introduction species distribution models sdms or ecological niche models have been commonly used to predict the potential distribution of species for various purposes including biological conservation invasion prediction paleobiology spatial epidemiology and impacts of climate change on biodiversity franklin 2013 guisan and thuiller 2005 mainali et al 2015 svenning et al 2011 sdms identify relationships between observed occurrences and environmental variables by using statistical models or theoretically derived response curves guisan and thuiller 2005 elith and franklin 2013 the ecological niche more specifically the fundamental niche fn or a subset of it has been increasingly used to estimate species geographic extent guisan and zimmermann 2000 peterson and soberón 2012 the ecological niche is described as a multi dimensional space including both abiotic and biotic factors that permits positive growth of a given species whereas the fn delineates only the abiotic environmental conditions hutchinson 1957 pearson and dawson 2003 estimating the potential distribution of a species across different spatial and temporal scales has become an increasing practical use of sdms elith and leathwick 2009 mainali et al 2015 in this practice sdms are usually trained with occurrence information and environmental predictors from one spatio temporal range and then projected to a different range to identify potential distributional areas of a given species peterson 2003 verbruggen et al 2013 one underlying assumption of this practice is that the given species conserves its niche across different spatial and temporal scales wiens and graham 2005 another assumption is that the given species is in equilibrium with the environment in the spatial range from where the occurrence information is extracted for model training elith and leathwick 2009 gallien et al 2012 estimating potential biological invasions has become an important tool to manage non native species to predict the potential invasion pattern of a given species in a new range native occurrence information is generally used in sdms thus successfully predicting invasion patterns closely relies on the transferability of models which is defined as the ability of sdms to predict occurrence in a largely unsampled spatial range or time period heikkinen et al 2012 randin et al 2006 however several researchers have suggested that species could shift their niche in new spatial ranges broennimann et al 2007 early and sax 2014 gallagher et al 2010 medley 2010 parravicini et al 2015 which challenges the transferability of sdms as the same species may survive under different environmental conditions in the invaded ranges broennimann et al 2007 early and sax 2014 parravicini et al 2015 as a result the use of only native occurrence information to model potential invasion is debatable broennimann and guisan 2008 and jiménez valverde et al 2011 suggested that sdms for estimating potential invasions could be developed using occurrence information from both native and invaded ranges however the drawback of using occurrence information from both ranges is that the equilibrium assumption is likely violated if the invasion is still ongoing early and sax 2014 elith and leathwick 2009 jiménez valverde et al 2011 a study of 50 terrestrial plant invaders however suggested that substantial niche shifts are rare petitpierre et al 2012 while the same conclusion was also made for birds and other taxa peterson 2011 strubbe et al 2013 soberón and peterson 2011 suggested that in some cases the niche shift is more likely a result of differences in environmental conditions or environmental space anisotropy between two spatial ranges than a true adaptive niche shift of species the concern that the non adaptive niche shift would affect the transferability of sdms has not been fully addressed specifically it is unclear whether both native and invaded range occurrence datasets are needed to estimate invasion patterns when a non adaptive niche shift exists given the drawback of invaded range data violating the equilibrium assumption underlying sdms when estimating potential invasion patterns with presence only data the spatial range from which pseudo absences pas also called background data are extracted certainly impacts the transferability of sdms phillips 2008 barbet massin et al 2012 for studies that use only occurrences from the native range of a species to train models the pas also should be restricted to the native range peterson 2003 phillips 2008 however in several highly cited studies the pas were extracted from both the native and invaded ranges when only native occurrences were used to construct the sdms broennimann and guisan 2008 de meyer et al 2010 gallardo et al 2013 verbruggen et al 2013 additionally in some studies the methods used to extract the pas were not mentioned fitzpatrick et al 2007 loo et al 2007 mau crimmins et al 2006 evaluation of the impact of pa data on model performance is not rare anderson and raza 2010 barbet massin et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 however to the best of our knowledge what is missing is a systematic and quantitative assessment of the impact of selecting pas from both native and invaded ranges while only native occurrences are used on both interpolations and transferability of multiple commonly used models this information is important to consider especially when niche shift is observed between the two ranges our study had two objectives 1 evaluate the interpolative accuracy and more importantly transferability also called extrapolative accuracy of sdms obtained with seven commonly used techniques under non adaptive niche shift between native and invaded ranges and 2 examine how inclusion of pas from the invaded range when only native occurrences are used for model training impacts model interpolation and transferability we conducted our research with kudzu bug megacopta cribraria hemiptera plataspidae for several reasons first kudzu bug is a newly invasive species in the united states u s but is a well studied species in asia its native range kudzu bug spread fast such that it had been reported in more than 650 counties in the u s by the end of 2017 ensuring enough occurrence data in the invaded range for sdms additionally a non adaptive niche shift was observed between native and invaded populations of kudzu bug in the u s liang et al 2018 modeling the potential distribution of kudzu bug is also important for practical applications results of this research can provide valuable information for management of kudzu bug as it has become a pest in both agricultural and urban areas eger et al 2010 to fulfill the first objective we quantified the differences of both available and occupied environmental spaces between native and invaded ranges of kudzu bug as empirical research these findings can be used to guide selection of sdms when a non adaptive niche shift is observed and to select pas for accurate modeling of species distribution 2 methodology 2 1 presence and pseudo absence data 2 1 1 presence to compare the interpolation and transferability of different models we collected point presence data of kudzu bug in both native and invaded ranges readers are referred to liang et al 2018 and zhu et al 2012 for detailed information on data acquisition we deleted redundant observations to ensure only one observation per 1000 m grid in total we generated three datasets dataset i included 164 presence records in the native range asia dataset ii contained 152 presence records in invaded range of kudzu bug u s and dataset iii combined occurrences from both the native and invaded ranges and therefore had 316 presence records fig 1 all occurrence data are available to readers upon request 2 1 2 pseudo absence pa to address the lack of absence data we generated 10 000 pa for model training and intrinsic evaluation to quantify and compare the accuracy of model interpolation and transferability we extracted pas in the same spatial range as the presences used for model training however to fulfill the second objective we generated dataset iv which included the presences from asia but 10 000 pa extracted from both asian and u s ranges 2 2 environmental variables to characterize the environmental space in both ranges native and invaded we used an elevation variable from the hydro 1k digital elevation model dataset usgs 1996 and nine climatic variables from the worldclim dataset hijmans et al 2005 instead of using all 19 climatic variables available in worldclim we selected only nine variables that were not highly correlated r 0 8 based on the climatic conditions of 10 000 randomly selected points the nine climatic variables are mean diurnal temperature range bio2 maximum temperature of the warmest month bio5 mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio8 mean temperature of the coldest quarter bio11 annual mean precipitation bio12 precipitation seasonality bio15 precipitation of the driest quarter bio17 precipitation of the warmest quarter bio18 and precipitation of the coldest quarter bio19 all 10 variables elevation and climate used had a resolution of 30 arc seconds approximately 1 km 2 3 quantifying available and occupied environmental space change to represent the available environmental space in both native and invaded ranges we extracted the values of the 10 environmental variables at 1000 randomly selected points from each range 2000 points total the 10 environmental features of the presence datasets in the two ranges were considered to represent the occupied environmental space principal component analysis pca was run separately on the available and occupied environmental spaces of the two ranges to quantify the change in both occupied and available environmental space between two ranges we conducted a between class analysis on the pca results of occurrences and background data broennimann et al 2007 soberón and peterson 2011 we then used monte carlo simulation to test the significance of the between class inertia between class analysis dolédec and chessel 1994 measures the difference between groups of individuals while the inertia quantifies how much variance of the data is caused by group difference however to visualize the occupied and available environmental space on the principal components pcs we conducted pca on the environmental variables of all background and occurrence data in the two ranges 2 4 model development 2 4 1 training and testing dataset the flow chart of distribution modeling is shown in fig 1 to generate the models we randomly split the data into 70 for training and 30 for extrinsic testing of the models we replicated this step 20 times for each model run the 70 training data was further split into 70 for model construction and 30 for intrinsic model evaluation 2 4 2 modeling techniques we included seven widely used algorithms for species distribution modeling artificial neural network hereafter ann hecht nielsen 1988 boosted regression tree hereafter brt friedman 2001 genetic algorithm for rule set production hereafter garp stockwell 1999 generalized additive model hereafter gam hastie and tibshirani 1990 multiple adaptive regression splines hereafter mars friedman 1991 maximum entropy hereafter maxent phillips et al 2006 and random forest hereafter rf breiman 2001 although only garp and maxent were developed for presence only species data other studies have successfully used the other five presence absence models on presence only data broennimann and guisan 2008 elith et al 2006 and thus were included here among the seven algorithms ann brt maxent and rf are four machine learning methods gam and mars are two additive models and brt and rf are decision tree based methods maxent is based on maximum entropy principle while garp is a genetic algorithm details of these seven models were well documented by elith et al 2006 lek and guégan 1999 phillips et al 2006 and stockwell 1999 thus they are not described here to run the models we used maxent version 3 3 3 and garp programs and the biomod2 package in r for the remaining five modeling methods thuiller et al 2016 2 5 model evaluation and comparison two metrics area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic and maximum kappa were used to evaluate the models auc is a threshold independent measurement of model performance fielding and bell 1997 the value of auc varies from 0 to 1 representing the possibility that a randomly selected prediction from the presence group has a higher probability of presence than a randomly selected prediction from the absence group fielding and bell 1997 a value of 0 5 implies the model prediction is no better than a random guess while a value in the range of 0 5 0 6 0 6 0 7 0 7 0 8 0 8 0 9 and 0 9 1 0 suggests fail poor fair good and excellent performance of models respectively swets 1988 the kappa statistic cohen 1960 is a threshold dependent measure of model performance and the maximum kappa was used as the model measure in this research the value of kappa statistic varies from 1 to 1 the kappa k values were interpreted as representing poor models k 0 4 good 0 4 k 0 75 and excellent models 0 75 k 1 landis and koch 1977 auc and kappa were calculated using rocr package sing et al 2005 and ecospat package broennimann et al 2016 respectively in the r program for the ensemble model which will be described in section 2 6 we used omission rate to assess their performance in both asia and the u s to evaluate model interpolation we randomly extracted the same number of pas as the corresponding extrinsic testing presences for the first three datasets the extrinsic pas were extracted in the same spatial range as the presences while for dataset iv the extrinsic pas were extracted from both ranges native and invaded to assess the transferability of algorithms we only used models trained with dataset i and dataset iv presences from the native range pas from native and native plus invaded range respectively and evaluated them with all invaded range presences and the extrinsic pas extracted from invaded range to decrease the uncertainty we generated 100 sets of extrinsic pa data for each model evaluation each model output was evaluated 100 times with the corresponding testing data and 100 sets of extrinsic pas and the mean value was calculated as the final measurement of each model when extracting extrinsic pas we avoided the pixels that had been chosen for model construction for each algorithm and dataset the evaluation was conducted on all 20 replicate runs to compare the transferability of each algorithm we calculated a transferability index ti for both auc and kappa as follow t i a u c a u c e x t r a p o l a t i o n a u c i n t e r p o l a t i o n a n d t i k a p p a k a p p a e x t r a p o l a t i o n k a p p a i n t e r p o l a t i o n tukey s hsd honest significant difference test was used to conduct multiple comparisons on auc and kappa of the seven algorithms the paired one tail wilcoxon signed rank test was used to conduct pairwise comparisons 2 6 model visualization to visualize the potential distributions estimated by the models constructed with the first three datasets datasets i ii and iii we derived an ensemble model by averaging the best four models selected from 20 replicate runs the ensemble model was further evaluated with all occurrences from the same range as the occurrences used for model construction although this evaluation approach was based on data that had been used during model construction we applied this analysis only to find a possible threshold which maximizes the kappa to better visualize the potential distribution as estimated by the ensemble model 3 results 3 1 quantifying changes in occupied and available environmental spaces the pca on the environmental features of occurrence data indicated that the first two pcs explained 64 3 of the total variance the between class inertia ratio was 0 335 indicating that 33 5 of the variable inertia can be explained by the differences in spatial location of occurrence points the monte carlo simulation on between class inertia ratio p 0 01 suggested a substantial difference of occupied environmental conditions between native and invaded ranges the results of between class inertia analysis on the available environmental space are consistent with the observations by liang et al 2018 that environmental space anisotropy exists between native and invaded ranges the first and second pcs explained 41 4 and 21 5 of the total variance of variables respectively the between class inertia on the available environmental space was 6 07 and the difference of environmental space between the two ranges was significant p 0 01 based on the first two pcs fig 2 a the majority of presences in both native and invaded ranges were distributed in the environmental space that was available in both ranges however based on pc1 and pc3 presences in asia and the u s were mostly distributed in environmental spaces which are not available in the other ranges fig 2b the environmental space anisotropy mainly occurred along the pc2 and pc3 explaining 35 of the variance the shift of centroids of available and occupied environmental spaces between two ranges mainly occurred in the same dimension brown arrows in fig 2 whereas along pc1 which explained the most variance of variables 42 no discrepancy was observed between two ranges however it is clear that along pc1 both the available and occupied environmental spaces in asia included wider ranges than those in the u s fig 2 3 2 model interpolation and transferability 3 2 1 model interpolation the mean auc and kappa of all models were higher than 0 8 and 0 45 respectively except for the garp model trained with the native presences auc 0 78 kappa 0 57 this result suggested nearly all models had good interpolations models trained with dataset ii had constantly higher auc and kappa than the ones trained with dataset i and dataset iii while models trained with dataset i constantly showed the lowest performances among the three datasets both measurements indicated that maxent brt mars and rf were the highest performing four models for all datasets auc 0 89 kappa 0 65 whereas the first three models were ranked in the highest level of interpolation five out of six times fig 3 3 2 2 model transferability the ranking based on model transferability suggested rf brt maxent and ann were the highest performing models fig 4 rf and brt both had good transferability auc 0 8 while maxent ann and garp all had fair transferability auc 0 7 based on kappa the first five models had good transferability kappa 0 4 however from the highest to lowest the two evaluation measurements had the same rank of transferability index rf brt ann garp maxent mars and gam the two models with highest transferability brt and rf were both tree based algorithms while the two models with lowest transferability mars and gam were both regression based algorithm although the auc and kappa on model transferability were significantly lower than the ones on model interpolation four models had transferability indices higher than 0 9 based on auc 3 2 3 visual interpretation the ensemble model used to estimate the potential distribution of the kudzu bug was derived from brt mars maxent and rf fig 5 a f for dataset i the ensemble model derived from the best four models dataset i derived ensemble model successfully predicted high probability of presence 50 in southern asia where occurrence data were distributed fig 5a however in the u s the high values were only predicted narrowly in the south fig 5b rather than the southeastern region where most of the occurrences were observed and reported similarly the dataset ii derived ensemble model successfully predicted high values for the southeastern u s fig 5d but low values for the vast range of asia fig 5c compared with datasets i and ii dataset iii derived ensemble model predicted high values for both south asia and southeastern u s fig 5e and f the ensemble model of the four models with highest transferability was derived from rf brt maxent and ann fig 5g and h the ensemble models obtained using the maximum kappa as the cut off threshold selection predicted the largest areas of potential distribution for both native and invaded ranges table 1 fig 5g and h while the dataset iii derived ensemble model predicted moderate potential distribution areas for both ranges table 1 fig 5e and f 3 3 impact of spatial range of pseudo absences on model interpolation and transferability as auc and kappa indicated similar results we presented only auc in this section all models which were trained with native occurrences but with pas from both native and invaded ranges hereafter asia all had significantly higher aucs on interpolation than models p 0 001 for all which were trained with native occurrences and pas from native range hereafter asia asia fig 6 however except for garp p 0 999 the aucs on transferability of all models trained with asia all were much lower than models trained with asia asia p 0 01 for all fig 6 meanwhile all transferability indices tis of models trained with asia asia were significantly higher than those trained with asia all except garp table 2 4 discussion 4 1 model interpolation and transferability predictive sdms are important to provide information on management of invasive species and conservation of endangered species our case study identified that brt mars maxent and rf were the highest ranked models of interpolation for all datasets used although the performance of a given sdm varies according to the species studied elith and graham 2009 maxent brt and mars frequently perform better than most methods as shown from research on multiple species elith and graham 2009 elith et al 2006 guisan et al 2007 heikkinen et al 2012 wisz et al 2008 this good performance indicates that these three models generally have better capability of modeling the relationships between species and selected environmental features the low performance of garp is also frequently observed guisan et al 2007 elith and graham 2009 heikkinen et al 2012 wisz et al 2008 elith and graham 2009 found that the garp model failed to model the relations of a simulated species to all environmental features considered while other four models all correctly modeled the relationships to some extent this failure of recognizing the relationship of species to environment may lead to the low performance of garp models interpolation and transferability are equally important when the smds are aimed to predict the potential distribution of species in largely unsampled regions or time periods thus models that have both high interpolation and transferability are desirable our case study identified that brt and rf were among the highest ranked models of both interpolation and transferability although in most cases there is a trade off between model precision here as interpolation and generality here as transferability guisan and zimmermann 2000 our case study confirmed that the achievement of both precision and generality of sdms is possible mi et al 2017 also found that rf showed the best performance in terms of interpolation and transferability with a research on three crane species the result that tree based algorithms brt and rf showed good transferability is consistent with the research by prasad et al 2006 and mi et al 2017 the low transferability of regression based algorithms mars and gam is consistent with the result of prasad et al 2006 on both models and heikkinen et al 2012 on mars but contrary to the observation on gam by heikkinen et al 2012 however the high transferability of rf in our research is contrary to the result from breiner et al 2018 where they observed low transferability of rf comparing to models like mars maxent gam and gbm the inconsistency of model rankings on transferability in different research suggest that there is not a single best transferable model for all cases breiner et al 2018 mainali et al 2015 although a significant shift was observed between both the available and occupied environmental spaces in the native asia and invaded u s ranges of kudzu bug five of the seven models showed fair transferability while at least two of the models showed good transferability our findings are comparable with the study by heikkinen et al 2012 in which ann garp brt rf and maxent were classified as complex models and the transferability index mean 0 900 based on auc was similar to our calculations mean 0 905 however with the non adaptive niche shift high transferability of models was not expected we speculate that the good and fair transferability of our sdms results from the fact that the shift of occupied environmental space is caused by a non adaptive niche shift rather than an adaptive niche shift although researchers found that the environmental difference between two ranges decreased transferability of sdms qiao et al 2018 yates et al 2018 our study suggests that even with significant changes of environment between two ranges sdms trained with native only occurrences can still show good transferability thus unlike suggestions by broennimann and guisan 2008 and jiménez valverde et al 2011 when niche shift is observed using occurrence information from both native and invaded ranges would not always be preferred especially when the equilibrium in the invaded range is not reached before deciding what occurrence information should be used for predicting potential invasion patterns we suggest one should first determine the type of niche shift adaptive or non adaptive as well as the environmental space anisotropy between native and invaded ranges in some cases non adaptive niche shift does not challenge the transferability of sdms thus we suggest the use of native only occurrence information for the niche shift caused by niche expansion or environmental space anisotropy which would seriously challenge the transferability of sdms one could run the sdms including occurrence data in new ranges where the invasive species have already established gallagher et al 2010 4 2 impact of spatial range of pseudo absences on model interpolation and transferability research on the impact of the spatial range of pas on model performances is not rare barbet massin et al 2012 stokland et al 2011 vanderwal et al 2009 however such research only considered model interpolation our systematic evaluation of the impact of the spatial range of pas on model transferability has general implications on the selection of pas for estimating potential distributions of non native species we found that model transferability can also be significantly impacted by the spatial range of pas thus confirming the importance of constraining pas to the same spatial range as occurrences the inclusion of pas from the invaded range when only native occurrences are used can significantly increase model interpolation but decrease model transferability if environmental space anisotropy exists between native and invaded ranges as the available environmental features in the invaded range are significantly different from those in the native range the pas from the invaded range increased the ability of models to discriminate the presence from the pseudo absence thus including pas from the invaded range significantly improved model interpolation for all seven algorithms used here however as some pas from the invaded range were actually extracted from the suitable range of the invasive species this inclusion decreased the ability of models to recognize the potential distribution area in the new range resulting in underestimation of model transferability anderson and raza 2010 and zhu et al 2014 also found that constraining the pas into a properly small region improved model transferability and can be explained as the overfitting of models with pas from larger spatial extent factors other than pas such as environmental features used for model construction also can impact model transferability verbruggen et al 2013 yates et al 2018 using only native occurrences but pas from both ranges increases model accuracy at the expense of decreasing model generality broennimann and guisan 2008 concluded that occurrence information from both native and invaded ranges should be used by comparing the interpolation and transferability of sdms trained with occurrence information in the native range only and in both native and invaded ranges however in their research broennimann and guisan 2008 used the same pas extracted from the study area for all models including models trained only with native occurrences the original description of their method of extracting pas is a corresponding number of pseudo absences were sampled randomly across both native and invaded ranges broennimann and guisan 2008 several other research also used pas from spatial ranges where presence data were not used to develop distribution models de meyer et al 2010 gallardo et al 2013 verbruggen et al 2013 based on which the transferability was assessed as suggested by our study pas from the spatial range where presences were not used for model training can significantly decrease model transferability especially when the environmental space anisotropy exists between two ranges we therefore suggest it is important to constrain the pas to the same spatial range as the presence data to determine the best dataset used for development of sdms 5 conclusions in this study we addressed two questions on distribution modeling of invasive species with non adaptive niche shifts between native and invaded ranges we first evaluated the interpolation and transferability of seven commonly used models and then systematically assessed the impact of spatial range where the pas are extracted on models interpolation and transferability we found that five models rf brt maxent ann and garp showed good or fair transferability auc 0 7 transferability index 0 8 fig 4 indicating the non adaptive niche shift does necessarily challenge the transferability of sdms thus different from the suggestion from broennimann and guisan 2008 that both native and invaded occurrences should be used for invasion modeling when niche shift is observed we suggest one should first determine the type of niche shift adaptive or non adaptive non adaptive niche shift in some cases does not challenge model transferability thus occurrence data in native range should be used especially when the equilibrium in the invaded range is not reached we also found that the spatial range where pas are extracted can significantly impact both interpolation and transferability of sdms when environmental space anisotropy exists between two ranges in our case extracting pas from both the native and invaded ranges while only native presences were used for model construction significantly overestimates interpolations of all models p 0 001 for all fig 5 but underestimates transferability of all models table 2 the challenge of the environmental space anisotropy on model transferability can be largely avoided or reduced by constraining the pas to the same spatial range as the presences we therefore suggest constraining the pas to the same spatial range as presences used for model construction to retain interpolation and transferability for the classical approach of modeling potential invasions with native occurrences the pas should only be extracted from the native range to avoid misestimates of model performances based on the potential distribution maps kudzu bug may further spread north and west of the u s into major soybean growing areas including kentucky indiana ohio illinois missouri iowa kansas oklahoma and texas fig 5h given the serious economic damage of kudzu bug on soybean seiter et al 2012 more

25170,transferability of species distribution models sdms is key to predicting invasion patterns and can be challenged if niche shift occurs in the invaded range when using native occurrences to estimate potential invasions with presence only modeling methods it is important to constrain the pseudo absence pa sampling to the species native range however some studies including highly cited ones do not follow this approach to selecting pa samples in this research we addressed two questions using an invasive species in the united states u s kudzu bug megacopta cribraria 1 is model transferability challenged by a non adaptive niche shift and 2 is model performance affected by use of pa samples from outside the native range of the species kudzu bug is native to asia with recently observed non adaptive niche shift in the u s to answer the first question we quantified the environmental space anisotropy and non adaptive niche change and then evaluated the performances of seven sdms to answer the second question we further compared the interpolation and transferability of seven sdms trained with pas from the native range and from both native and invaded ranges we confirmed that the environmental space anisotropy p 0 01 and non adaptive niche change p 0 01 are both statistically significant of the seven sdms used four models had transferability indices higher than 0 9 boosted regression tree and random forests both had good interpolation and transferability auc 0 80 and kappa 0 60 whereas three other models showed good interpolation and fair transferability auc 0 70 and kappa 0 40 inclusion of pseudo absences from the invaded range significantly increased the interpolation p 0 001 but decreased the transferability p 0 01 of almost all models our findings suggest that sdms can show good transferability with non adaptive niche shift thus native occurrence information should be used in similar situation we confirmed that it is crucial to constrain the pas to the same spatial range as presences to accurately model potential invasions keywords ensemble models ecological niche modeling kudzu bug megacopta cribraria invasive species non adaptive niche shift 1 introduction species distribution models sdms or ecological niche models have been commonly used to predict the potential distribution of species for various purposes including biological conservation invasion prediction paleobiology spatial epidemiology and impacts of climate change on biodiversity franklin 2013 guisan and thuiller 2005 mainali et al 2015 svenning et al 2011 sdms identify relationships between observed occurrences and environmental variables by using statistical models or theoretically derived response curves guisan and thuiller 2005 elith and franklin 2013 the ecological niche more specifically the fundamental niche fn or a subset of it has been increasingly used to estimate species geographic extent guisan and zimmermann 2000 peterson and soberón 2012 the ecological niche is described as a multi dimensional space including both abiotic and biotic factors that permits positive growth of a given species whereas the fn delineates only the abiotic environmental conditions hutchinson 1957 pearson and dawson 2003 estimating the potential distribution of a species across different spatial and temporal scales has become an increasing practical use of sdms elith and leathwick 2009 mainali et al 2015 in this practice sdms are usually trained with occurrence information and environmental predictors from one spatio temporal range and then projected to a different range to identify potential distributional areas of a given species peterson 2003 verbruggen et al 2013 one underlying assumption of this practice is that the given species conserves its niche across different spatial and temporal scales wiens and graham 2005 another assumption is that the given species is in equilibrium with the environment in the spatial range from where the occurrence information is extracted for model training elith and leathwick 2009 gallien et al 2012 estimating potential biological invasions has become an important tool to manage non native species to predict the potential invasion pattern of a given species in a new range native occurrence information is generally used in sdms thus successfully predicting invasion patterns closely relies on the transferability of models which is defined as the ability of sdms to predict occurrence in a largely unsampled spatial range or time period heikkinen et al 2012 randin et al 2006 however several researchers have suggested that species could shift their niche in new spatial ranges broennimann et al 2007 early and sax 2014 gallagher et al 2010 medley 2010 parravicini et al 2015 which challenges the transferability of sdms as the same species may survive under different environmental conditions in the invaded ranges broennimann et al 2007 early and sax 2014 parravicini et al 2015 as a result the use of only native occurrence information to model potential invasion is debatable broennimann and guisan 2008 and jiménez valverde et al 2011 suggested that sdms for estimating potential invasions could be developed using occurrence information from both native and invaded ranges however the drawback of using occurrence information from both ranges is that the equilibrium assumption is likely violated if the invasion is still ongoing early and sax 2014 elith and leathwick 2009 jiménez valverde et al 2011 a study of 50 terrestrial plant invaders however suggested that substantial niche shifts are rare petitpierre et al 2012 while the same conclusion was also made for birds and other taxa peterson 2011 strubbe et al 2013 soberón and peterson 2011 suggested that in some cases the niche shift is more likely a result of differences in environmental conditions or environmental space anisotropy between two spatial ranges than a true adaptive niche shift of species the concern that the non adaptive niche shift would affect the transferability of sdms has not been fully addressed specifically it is unclear whether both native and invaded range occurrence datasets are needed to estimate invasion patterns when a non adaptive niche shift exists given the drawback of invaded range data violating the equilibrium assumption underlying sdms when estimating potential invasion patterns with presence only data the spatial range from which pseudo absences pas also called background data are extracted certainly impacts the transferability of sdms phillips 2008 barbet massin et al 2012 for studies that use only occurrences from the native range of a species to train models the pas also should be restricted to the native range peterson 2003 phillips 2008 however in several highly cited studies the pas were extracted from both the native and invaded ranges when only native occurrences were used to construct the sdms broennimann and guisan 2008 de meyer et al 2010 gallardo et al 2013 verbruggen et al 2013 additionally in some studies the methods used to extract the pas were not mentioned fitzpatrick et al 2007 loo et al 2007 mau crimmins et al 2006 evaluation of the impact of pa data on model performance is not rare anderson and raza 2010 barbet massin et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 however to the best of our knowledge what is missing is a systematic and quantitative assessment of the impact of selecting pas from both native and invaded ranges while only native occurrences are used on both interpolations and transferability of multiple commonly used models this information is important to consider especially when niche shift is observed between the two ranges our study had two objectives 1 evaluate the interpolative accuracy and more importantly transferability also called extrapolative accuracy of sdms obtained with seven commonly used techniques under non adaptive niche shift between native and invaded ranges and 2 examine how inclusion of pas from the invaded range when only native occurrences are used for model training impacts model interpolation and transferability we conducted our research with kudzu bug megacopta cribraria hemiptera plataspidae for several reasons first kudzu bug is a newly invasive species in the united states u s but is a well studied species in asia its native range kudzu bug spread fast such that it had been reported in more than 650 counties in the u s by the end of 2017 ensuring enough occurrence data in the invaded range for sdms additionally a non adaptive niche shift was observed between native and invaded populations of kudzu bug in the u s liang et al 2018 modeling the potential distribution of kudzu bug is also important for practical applications results of this research can provide valuable information for management of kudzu bug as it has become a pest in both agricultural and urban areas eger et al 2010 to fulfill the first objective we quantified the differences of both available and occupied environmental spaces between native and invaded ranges of kudzu bug as empirical research these findings can be used to guide selection of sdms when a non adaptive niche shift is observed and to select pas for accurate modeling of species distribution 2 methodology 2 1 presence and pseudo absence data 2 1 1 presence to compare the interpolation and transferability of different models we collected point presence data of kudzu bug in both native and invaded ranges readers are referred to liang et al 2018 and zhu et al 2012 for detailed information on data acquisition we deleted redundant observations to ensure only one observation per 1000 m grid in total we generated three datasets dataset i included 164 presence records in the native range asia dataset ii contained 152 presence records in invaded range of kudzu bug u s and dataset iii combined occurrences from both the native and invaded ranges and therefore had 316 presence records fig 1 all occurrence data are available to readers upon request 2 1 2 pseudo absence pa to address the lack of absence data we generated 10 000 pa for model training and intrinsic evaluation to quantify and compare the accuracy of model interpolation and transferability we extracted pas in the same spatial range as the presences used for model training however to fulfill the second objective we generated dataset iv which included the presences from asia but 10 000 pa extracted from both asian and u s ranges 2 2 environmental variables to characterize the environmental space in both ranges native and invaded we used an elevation variable from the hydro 1k digital elevation model dataset usgs 1996 and nine climatic variables from the worldclim dataset hijmans et al 2005 instead of using all 19 climatic variables available in worldclim we selected only nine variables that were not highly correlated r 0 8 based on the climatic conditions of 10 000 randomly selected points the nine climatic variables are mean diurnal temperature range bio2 maximum temperature of the warmest month bio5 mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio8 mean temperature of the coldest quarter bio11 annual mean precipitation bio12 precipitation seasonality bio15 precipitation of the driest quarter bio17 precipitation of the warmest quarter bio18 and precipitation of the coldest quarter bio19 all 10 variables elevation and climate used had a resolution of 30 arc seconds approximately 1 km 2 3 quantifying available and occupied environmental space change to represent the available environmental space in both native and invaded ranges we extracted the values of the 10 environmental variables at 1000 randomly selected points from each range 2000 points total the 10 environmental features of the presence datasets in the two ranges were considered to represent the occupied environmental space principal component analysis pca was run separately on the available and occupied environmental spaces of the two ranges to quantify the change in both occupied and available environmental space between two ranges we conducted a between class analysis on the pca results of occurrences and background data broennimann et al 2007 soberón and peterson 2011 we then used monte carlo simulation to test the significance of the between class inertia between class analysis dolédec and chessel 1994 measures the difference between groups of individuals while the inertia quantifies how much variance of the data is caused by group difference however to visualize the occupied and available environmental space on the principal components pcs we conducted pca on the environmental variables of all background and occurrence data in the two ranges 2 4 model development 2 4 1 training and testing dataset the flow chart of distribution modeling is shown in fig 1 to generate the models we randomly split the data into 70 for training and 30 for extrinsic testing of the models we replicated this step 20 times for each model run the 70 training data was further split into 70 for model construction and 30 for intrinsic model evaluation 2 4 2 modeling techniques we included seven widely used algorithms for species distribution modeling artificial neural network hereafter ann hecht nielsen 1988 boosted regression tree hereafter brt friedman 2001 genetic algorithm for rule set production hereafter garp stockwell 1999 generalized additive model hereafter gam hastie and tibshirani 1990 multiple adaptive regression splines hereafter mars friedman 1991 maximum entropy hereafter maxent phillips et al 2006 and random forest hereafter rf breiman 2001 although only garp and maxent were developed for presence only species data other studies have successfully used the other five presence absence models on presence only data broennimann and guisan 2008 elith et al 2006 and thus were included here among the seven algorithms ann brt maxent and rf are four machine learning methods gam and mars are two additive models and brt and rf are decision tree based methods maxent is based on maximum entropy principle while garp is a genetic algorithm details of these seven models were well documented by elith et al 2006 lek and guégan 1999 phillips et al 2006 and stockwell 1999 thus they are not described here to run the models we used maxent version 3 3 3 and garp programs and the biomod2 package in r for the remaining five modeling methods thuiller et al 2016 2 5 model evaluation and comparison two metrics area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic and maximum kappa were used to evaluate the models auc is a threshold independent measurement of model performance fielding and bell 1997 the value of auc varies from 0 to 1 representing the possibility that a randomly selected prediction from the presence group has a higher probability of presence than a randomly selected prediction from the absence group fielding and bell 1997 a value of 0 5 implies the model prediction is no better than a random guess while a value in the range of 0 5 0 6 0 6 0 7 0 7 0 8 0 8 0 9 and 0 9 1 0 suggests fail poor fair good and excellent performance of models respectively swets 1988 the kappa statistic cohen 1960 is a threshold dependent measure of model performance and the maximum kappa was used as the model measure in this research the value of kappa statistic varies from 1 to 1 the kappa k values were interpreted as representing poor models k 0 4 good 0 4 k 0 75 and excellent models 0 75 k 1 landis and koch 1977 auc and kappa were calculated using rocr package sing et al 2005 and ecospat package broennimann et al 2016 respectively in the r program for the ensemble model which will be described in section 2 6 we used omission rate to assess their performance in both asia and the u s to evaluate model interpolation we randomly extracted the same number of pas as the corresponding extrinsic testing presences for the first three datasets the extrinsic pas were extracted in the same spatial range as the presences while for dataset iv the extrinsic pas were extracted from both ranges native and invaded to assess the transferability of algorithms we only used models trained with dataset i and dataset iv presences from the native range pas from native and native plus invaded range respectively and evaluated them with all invaded range presences and the extrinsic pas extracted from invaded range to decrease the uncertainty we generated 100 sets of extrinsic pa data for each model evaluation each model output was evaluated 100 times with the corresponding testing data and 100 sets of extrinsic pas and the mean value was calculated as the final measurement of each model when extracting extrinsic pas we avoided the pixels that had been chosen for model construction for each algorithm and dataset the evaluation was conducted on all 20 replicate runs to compare the transferability of each algorithm we calculated a transferability index ti for both auc and kappa as follow t i a u c a u c e x t r a p o l a t i o n a u c i n t e r p o l a t i o n a n d t i k a p p a k a p p a e x t r a p o l a t i o n k a p p a i n t e r p o l a t i o n tukey s hsd honest significant difference test was used to conduct multiple comparisons on auc and kappa of the seven algorithms the paired one tail wilcoxon signed rank test was used to conduct pairwise comparisons 2 6 model visualization to visualize the potential distributions estimated by the models constructed with the first three datasets datasets i ii and iii we derived an ensemble model by averaging the best four models selected from 20 replicate runs the ensemble model was further evaluated with all occurrences from the same range as the occurrences used for model construction although this evaluation approach was based on data that had been used during model construction we applied this analysis only to find a possible threshold which maximizes the kappa to better visualize the potential distribution as estimated by the ensemble model 3 results 3 1 quantifying changes in occupied and available environmental spaces the pca on the environmental features of occurrence data indicated that the first two pcs explained 64 3 of the total variance the between class inertia ratio was 0 335 indicating that 33 5 of the variable inertia can be explained by the differences in spatial location of occurrence points the monte carlo simulation on between class inertia ratio p 0 01 suggested a substantial difference of occupied environmental conditions between native and invaded ranges the results of between class inertia analysis on the available environmental space are consistent with the observations by liang et al 2018 that environmental space anisotropy exists between native and invaded ranges the first and second pcs explained 41 4 and 21 5 of the total variance of variables respectively the between class inertia on the available environmental space was 6 07 and the difference of environmental space between the two ranges was significant p 0 01 based on the first two pcs fig 2 a the majority of presences in both native and invaded ranges were distributed in the environmental space that was available in both ranges however based on pc1 and pc3 presences in asia and the u s were mostly distributed in environmental spaces which are not available in the other ranges fig 2b the environmental space anisotropy mainly occurred along the pc2 and pc3 explaining 35 of the variance the shift of centroids of available and occupied environmental spaces between two ranges mainly occurred in the same dimension brown arrows in fig 2 whereas along pc1 which explained the most variance of variables 42 no discrepancy was observed between two ranges however it is clear that along pc1 both the available and occupied environmental spaces in asia included wider ranges than those in the u s fig 2 3 2 model interpolation and transferability 3 2 1 model interpolation the mean auc and kappa of all models were higher than 0 8 and 0 45 respectively except for the garp model trained with the native presences auc 0 78 kappa 0 57 this result suggested nearly all models had good interpolations models trained with dataset ii had constantly higher auc and kappa than the ones trained with dataset i and dataset iii while models trained with dataset i constantly showed the lowest performances among the three datasets both measurements indicated that maxent brt mars and rf were the highest performing four models for all datasets auc 0 89 kappa 0 65 whereas the first three models were ranked in the highest level of interpolation five out of six times fig 3 3 2 2 model transferability the ranking based on model transferability suggested rf brt maxent and ann were the highest performing models fig 4 rf and brt both had good transferability auc 0 8 while maxent ann and garp all had fair transferability auc 0 7 based on kappa the first five models had good transferability kappa 0 4 however from the highest to lowest the two evaluation measurements had the same rank of transferability index rf brt ann garp maxent mars and gam the two models with highest transferability brt and rf were both tree based algorithms while the two models with lowest transferability mars and gam were both regression based algorithm although the auc and kappa on model transferability were significantly lower than the ones on model interpolation four models had transferability indices higher than 0 9 based on auc 3 2 3 visual interpretation the ensemble model used to estimate the potential distribution of the kudzu bug was derived from brt mars maxent and rf fig 5 a f for dataset i the ensemble model derived from the best four models dataset i derived ensemble model successfully predicted high probability of presence 50 in southern asia where occurrence data were distributed fig 5a however in the u s the high values were only predicted narrowly in the south fig 5b rather than the southeastern region where most of the occurrences were observed and reported similarly the dataset ii derived ensemble model successfully predicted high values for the southeastern u s fig 5d but low values for the vast range of asia fig 5c compared with datasets i and ii dataset iii derived ensemble model predicted high values for both south asia and southeastern u s fig 5e and f the ensemble model of the four models with highest transferability was derived from rf brt maxent and ann fig 5g and h the ensemble models obtained using the maximum kappa as the cut off threshold selection predicted the largest areas of potential distribution for both native and invaded ranges table 1 fig 5g and h while the dataset iii derived ensemble model predicted moderate potential distribution areas for both ranges table 1 fig 5e and f 3 3 impact of spatial range of pseudo absences on model interpolation and transferability as auc and kappa indicated similar results we presented only auc in this section all models which were trained with native occurrences but with pas from both native and invaded ranges hereafter asia all had significantly higher aucs on interpolation than models p 0 001 for all which were trained with native occurrences and pas from native range hereafter asia asia fig 6 however except for garp p 0 999 the aucs on transferability of all models trained with asia all were much lower than models trained with asia asia p 0 01 for all fig 6 meanwhile all transferability indices tis of models trained with asia asia were significantly higher than those trained with asia all except garp table 2 4 discussion 4 1 model interpolation and transferability predictive sdms are important to provide information on management of invasive species and conservation of endangered species our case study identified that brt mars maxent and rf were the highest ranked models of interpolation for all datasets used although the performance of a given sdm varies according to the species studied elith and graham 2009 maxent brt and mars frequently perform better than most methods as shown from research on multiple species elith and graham 2009 elith et al 2006 guisan et al 2007 heikkinen et al 2012 wisz et al 2008 this good performance indicates that these three models generally have better capability of modeling the relationships between species and selected environmental features the low performance of garp is also frequently observed guisan et al 2007 elith and graham 2009 heikkinen et al 2012 wisz et al 2008 elith and graham 2009 found that the garp model failed to model the relations of a simulated species to all environmental features considered while other four models all correctly modeled the relationships to some extent this failure of recognizing the relationship of species to environment may lead to the low performance of garp models interpolation and transferability are equally important when the smds are aimed to predict the potential distribution of species in largely unsampled regions or time periods thus models that have both high interpolation and transferability are desirable our case study identified that brt and rf were among the highest ranked models of both interpolation and transferability although in most cases there is a trade off between model precision here as interpolation and generality here as transferability guisan and zimmermann 2000 our case study confirmed that the achievement of both precision and generality of sdms is possible mi et al 2017 also found that rf showed the best performance in terms of interpolation and transferability with a research on three crane species the result that tree based algorithms brt and rf showed good transferability is consistent with the research by prasad et al 2006 and mi et al 2017 the low transferability of regression based algorithms mars and gam is consistent with the result of prasad et al 2006 on both models and heikkinen et al 2012 on mars but contrary to the observation on gam by heikkinen et al 2012 however the high transferability of rf in our research is contrary to the result from breiner et al 2018 where they observed low transferability of rf comparing to models like mars maxent gam and gbm the inconsistency of model rankings on transferability in different research suggest that there is not a single best transferable model for all cases breiner et al 2018 mainali et al 2015 although a significant shift was observed between both the available and occupied environmental spaces in the native asia and invaded u s ranges of kudzu bug five of the seven models showed fair transferability while at least two of the models showed good transferability our findings are comparable with the study by heikkinen et al 2012 in which ann garp brt rf and maxent were classified as complex models and the transferability index mean 0 900 based on auc was similar to our calculations mean 0 905 however with the non adaptive niche shift high transferability of models was not expected we speculate that the good and fair transferability of our sdms results from the fact that the shift of occupied environmental space is caused by a non adaptive niche shift rather than an adaptive niche shift although researchers found that the environmental difference between two ranges decreased transferability of sdms qiao et al 2018 yates et al 2018 our study suggests that even with significant changes of environment between two ranges sdms trained with native only occurrences can still show good transferability thus unlike suggestions by broennimann and guisan 2008 and jiménez valverde et al 2011 when niche shift is observed using occurrence information from both native and invaded ranges would not always be preferred especially when the equilibrium in the invaded range is not reached before deciding what occurrence information should be used for predicting potential invasion patterns we suggest one should first determine the type of niche shift adaptive or non adaptive as well as the environmental space anisotropy between native and invaded ranges in some cases non adaptive niche shift does not challenge the transferability of sdms thus we suggest the use of native only occurrence information for the niche shift caused by niche expansion or environmental space anisotropy which would seriously challenge the transferability of sdms one could run the sdms including occurrence data in new ranges where the invasive species have already established gallagher et al 2010 4 2 impact of spatial range of pseudo absences on model interpolation and transferability research on the impact of the spatial range of pas on model performances is not rare barbet massin et al 2012 stokland et al 2011 vanderwal et al 2009 however such research only considered model interpolation our systematic evaluation of the impact of the spatial range of pas on model transferability has general implications on the selection of pas for estimating potential distributions of non native species we found that model transferability can also be significantly impacted by the spatial range of pas thus confirming the importance of constraining pas to the same spatial range as occurrences the inclusion of pas from the invaded range when only native occurrences are used can significantly increase model interpolation but decrease model transferability if environmental space anisotropy exists between native and invaded ranges as the available environmental features in the invaded range are significantly different from those in the native range the pas from the invaded range increased the ability of models to discriminate the presence from the pseudo absence thus including pas from the invaded range significantly improved model interpolation for all seven algorithms used here however as some pas from the invaded range were actually extracted from the suitable range of the invasive species this inclusion decreased the ability of models to recognize the potential distribution area in the new range resulting in underestimation of model transferability anderson and raza 2010 and zhu et al 2014 also found that constraining the pas into a properly small region improved model transferability and can be explained as the overfitting of models with pas from larger spatial extent factors other than pas such as environmental features used for model construction also can impact model transferability verbruggen et al 2013 yates et al 2018 using only native occurrences but pas from both ranges increases model accuracy at the expense of decreasing model generality broennimann and guisan 2008 concluded that occurrence information from both native and invaded ranges should be used by comparing the interpolation and transferability of sdms trained with occurrence information in the native range only and in both native and invaded ranges however in their research broennimann and guisan 2008 used the same pas extracted from the study area for all models including models trained only with native occurrences the original description of their method of extracting pas is a corresponding number of pseudo absences were sampled randomly across both native and invaded ranges broennimann and guisan 2008 several other research also used pas from spatial ranges where presence data were not used to develop distribution models de meyer et al 2010 gallardo et al 2013 verbruggen et al 2013 based on which the transferability was assessed as suggested by our study pas from the spatial range where presences were not used for model training can significantly decrease model transferability especially when the environmental space anisotropy exists between two ranges we therefore suggest it is important to constrain the pas to the same spatial range as the presence data to determine the best dataset used for development of sdms 5 conclusions in this study we addressed two questions on distribution modeling of invasive species with non adaptive niche shifts between native and invaded ranges we first evaluated the interpolation and transferability of seven commonly used models and then systematically assessed the impact of spatial range where the pas are extracted on models interpolation and transferability we found that five models rf brt maxent ann and garp showed good or fair transferability auc 0 7 transferability index 0 8 fig 4 indicating the non adaptive niche shift does necessarily challenge the transferability of sdms thus different from the suggestion from broennimann and guisan 2008 that both native and invaded occurrences should be used for invasion modeling when niche shift is observed we suggest one should first determine the type of niche shift adaptive or non adaptive non adaptive niche shift in some cases does not challenge model transferability thus occurrence data in native range should be used especially when the equilibrium in the invaded range is not reached we also found that the spatial range where pas are extracted can significantly impact both interpolation and transferability of sdms when environmental space anisotropy exists between two ranges in our case extracting pas from both the native and invaded ranges while only native presences were used for model construction significantly overestimates interpolations of all models p 0 001 for all fig 5 but underestimates transferability of all models table 2 the challenge of the environmental space anisotropy on model transferability can be largely avoided or reduced by constraining the pas to the same spatial range as the presences we therefore suggest constraining the pas to the same spatial range as presences used for model construction to retain interpolation and transferability for the classical approach of modeling potential invasions with native occurrences the pas should only be extracted from the native range to avoid misestimates of model performances based on the potential distribution maps kudzu bug may further spread north and west of the u s into

25171,we have in this study analysed bird communities across norway with a heterogeneous species abundance model where dynamical parameters can vary among species similarity in community composition over time used as a measure of temporal β diversity or the turnover rate was then estimated when we account for heterogeneity in dynamical parameters among species it will affect how we estimate environmental stochasticity and subsequently how the temporal dynamics is modelled in addition spatial variation in species abundance within a sampling area can obscure the temporal dynamics of communities by inadvertently including small scale spatial variation within sampling areas in the sample noise term it will be difficult to correctly detect changes in community structure or species abundance similarity in time using norwegian bird communities as a case study we have shown how to interpret the sample correlation of the bivariate poisson lognormal distribution fitted to pairs of transects and why separation of the transects into spatially similar subgroups can be beneficial this approach also makes us able to account for sampling error and over dispersion relative to poisson sampling the partitioning of the variance of the species abundance distributions showed that heterogeneity among species in temporal dynamics accounted for roughly 75 of the variation close to estimates for other taxa high temporal similarity can be interpreted as a low baseline turnover rate which is important when studying changes to ecosystems due to e g anthropogenic effects furthermore the environmental stochasticity was more realistically estimated in this heterogeneous model this is essential for predicting the dynamics of species abundances forward in time keywords β diversity environmental stochasticity heterogeneous species abundance models over dispersion temporal community dynamics 1 introduction understanding how human activities affect biodiversity is a key issue in community ecology however even without human interference fluctuations in species abundance extinctions and speciations change biodiversity naturally and this baseline turnover rate needs to be accounted for when analysing species communities and how they change magurran 2016 one measure for the turnover rate in communities is the similarity in species abundances over time communities where species change considerably in relative abundance from one year to the next will have a high turnover rate while if the species have almost the same relative abundance over time the turnover rate will be low this difference in community dynamics can be described by introducing the concept of community heterogeneity if species in a community have different temporal dynamics this heterogeneity can be modelled by letting population dynamical parameters vary among species engen and lande 1996 solbu et al 2016 conversely in a homogeneous community the parameters describing the dynamics are assumed to be equal for all species here community heterogeneity is defined as the variation in carrying capacity among species engen et al 2002 introduced in the model by assuming that the species growth rates are a sample from some distribution the proportion of the total variation in the observed species abundance distribution that can be attributed to heterogeneity will then be a measure of the community s temporal turnover rate if heterogeneity accounts for a large part of the variation in species abundances the turnover rate will be low whereas a community with low levels of heterogeneity will have a high turnover rate in addition to a baseline turnover rate the plethora of different measures of biodiversity and different spatial resolutions breed conflicting results in terms of consequences of human induced changes mcgill et al 2015 several considerations regarding sampling design should be made before samples to analyse species diversity and abundance are collected bonar et al 2011 one important issue to consider when conducting biodiversity analysis is the choice of sampling unit a common sampling unit is counting individuals along line transects ideally these transects should be randomly distributed within the area where the community of interest is analysed however it is often not physically possible to randomly distribute transects due to the topography of the area e g steep hills thick vegetation or rivers and instead the transects follow trails already in the landscape or the sampling may have been designed to study spatial structures in species diversity as well as temporal dynamics thereby distributing sampling units along gradients the analysis presented here illustrates how spatial variation between sampling units intentional or not can affect the estimation of temporal heterogeneity in bird communities the proportion of variation in the species abundance distribution that can be attributed to community heterogeneity is estimated by the correlation between sampling units over time if species abundances from sampling units within an area the same year are dissimilar i e a species having high abundance in one transect can have low abundance in the other transect this spatial dissimilarity will obscure analyses of temporal dynamics it is then crucial to know how to separate the effect of spatial variation from temporal heterogeneity in spatiotemporal species abundance data sets we show how within year comparison of correlation between transects can be used to estimate spatial variation that needs to be under control when studying temporal dynamics and community heterogeneity the choice of species to include in the samples i e our prior definition of the community will affect a similarity analysis although some species may not have a large influence on the estimated community dynamics individuals could for instance belong to species that are not endemic to the area and can therefore introduce variation in the species abundance distribution that is not necessarily true for the assessment of the local community dynamics thereby also affecting the estimated turnover rate as an illustration we will compare the analysis of a community including all registered bird species with a community including only passerine birds and discuss how the difference in community limitation may affect the estimated spatial variation and temporal heterogeneity of the community our approach is to fit a bivariate poisson lognormal species abundance distribution to all pairs of transects within an area and estimate the correlation among transects within the same year and then study how the correlation changes with increasing time difference between transects the use of the lognormal distribution has a long history in community ecology preston 1948 and the poisson sampling of this distribution is well known bulmer 1974 a species abundance distribution described by a poisson lognormal distribution can be modelled by a continuous time dynamic population model with a gompertz type of density regulation which can also account for different temporal dynamics among species engen and lande 1996 the difference in temporal dynamics in this model i e the degree of community heterogeneity can be attributed to variation in the carrying capacity among species some species fluctuate at high abundances while others remain at low abundances over time species having different carrying capacities can be generated by niche segregation hutchinson 1957 macarthur 1960 but we do not attempt to test this theory formally here however heterogeneity among species does deviate from the assumptions in the neutral theory of community dynamics where species are assumed to have the same dynamics and population fluctuations are caused by demographic stochasticity only hubbell 2001 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling design the data we analyse have been collected since the early 1990s to document long term changes in norwegian wildlife seven different areas were selected across norway to cover a wide range of climatic variation fig 1 a areas in the southern part of norway have historically been more exposed to pollution and while there is farming in some of the areas they are otherwise considered undisturbed habitats although data have been collected for a wide range of plant and mammal species we will here limit the community to consist of bird species only within each area several sampling points along transects have been used to count the abundance of each species by listening for bird song there are ten transects within each area except for møsvatn which has eight each transect has usually 20 observation points with 200 300 m distance but this number can vary in some areas due to landscape constraints for example in solhomfjell fig 1c we use the transect as sampling unit because the observer conducting the census along a transect corrected for observations of the same individuals made at adjacent points and we illustrate the applicability of the method to data where the researcher only has information at the transect level an alternative design is to aggregate the points with respect to some covariate such as elevation or vegetation but we show that even with such potential underlying differences in spatial composition informative results can be obtained 2 2 spatial variation as the locations of the areas cover the entire span of norway there is considerable spatial variation both within and between areas in terms of sampling area size fig 1b and c elevation fig 2 and vegetation fig 3 the transects in dividalen cover an area of roughly 250 km2 fig 1b while the area covered in solhomfjell is roughly 20 km2 fig 1c the difference in the area covered by the transects in dividalen and solhomfjell could indicate a greater variation in the species found among the transects in dividalen compared to those found in solhomfjell the elevation of each sampling point varies both within and between areas fig 2 while the overall mean elevation in dividalen and solhomfjell is roughly the same circa 500 m the difference between the lowest and highest points the range within the areas is twice as large in dividalen compared to solhomfjell lund has an overall mean elevation and range similar to solhomfjell børgefjell and gutulia differ in their overall mean elevation but have the same range while åmotsdalen and møsvatn have the same overall mean but differ in range each sampling point has been classified to a vegetation category so aggregating the proportion of each vegetation class within transects can illustrate the spatial variation within a sampling area comparing the distribution of vegetation classes between dividalen and solhomfjell reveals some interesting features of the sampling areas fig 3 first the individual transects in dividalen have little variation they have roughly five classes each while the transects in solhomfjell have around ten classes each part of the reason for the greater variation within transects in solhomfjell is the number of observation points but the number of classes is almost constant for each transect even though the number of points varies second the difference between the measured characteristics is greater in dividalen than solhomfjell for instance transects one to six in dividalen have more forest vegetation in common such as conifers lichens and birches while the four other transects have more open vegetation consisting of graminoid ridges heather and grasses in solhomfjell on the other hand all transects consist of some type of coniferous or birch forest in addition to some areas of bryophyte knowing the spatial variation in each area is essential when we estimate the temporal autocorrelation of the community which in turn gives us an estimate of the heterogeneity among species in dynamical parameters when there is spatial variation among sampling units either due to suboptimal sampling designs or if sampling is designed with an intention to study spatial diversity it will obscure temporal autocorrelation among samples over time if not handled appropriately the available spatial information will be used as guidance when determining how to analyse the transects to minimize the effect of spatial variation on temporal estimates and predictions we first look at the spatial variation in species abundances for the censuses from the areas dividalen and solhomfjell before doing the temporal analyses in the next section the species abundance distribution in the first census year in dividalen fig 4 a is characterized by a variation like that found in the elevation and vegetation descriptions starting from the transect with the lowest mean elevation 300 m there are five species that are most abundant carduelis flammea fringilla montifringilla phoenicurus phoenicurus phylloscopus trochilus and turdus illacus but as the mean elevation increases their presence in addition to many of the less abundant species decreases or ceases completely from 650 m and up except one species carduelis flammea instead two other species become more abundant anthus pratensis and pluvialis apricaria in addition to several other less abundant species not found at the lower altitudes the species abundances in the first census year in solhomfjell fig 4b have a different development among transects the abundances in each transect are more similar with three species anthus trivalis fringilla coelebs and phylloscopus trochilus dominating across all transects and the less abundant species do not vary much in their presence between transects the community of study can be defined in many ways both with respect to spatial and taxonomic limitations and this may affect the results of the analyses for example will a community limited to bird species from one taxonomic order give different dynamic models than if all bird species are studied simultaneously when different community definitions severely change relative abundances in the sample model results will of course be affected but limiting the community to closely related species competing for the same resources may give a more focused analysis of the degree of heterogeneity the more abundant species in both study areas are all from the passeriformes order so analysing a community where low abundance non passerine species are removed names marked with a star fig 4 can serve as an illustration of the sensitivity of this modelling approach to community limitation and handling of species that are rare in the sample 2 3 temporal analyses since one goal is to identify the temporal covariation of species abundance the spatial variation in species abundance like the one observed in dividalen will be an issue if the pattern persists over time if all the transects within an area are compared a large habitat variation among transects will decrease the estimated temporal correlation if species occupy specific habitats time series of the species abundances within each transect over all census years up to 2013 in dividalen fig 5 a and solhomfjell fig 5b show that the species that were the most abundant in the first years of the census continue their dominance over time the total abundance is higher among the transects at low altitudes in dividalen transects 1 6 fig 5a compared to those at higher elevations the temporal heterogeneity in species abundance dynamics in solhomfjell is slightly more obscured but the most abundant species persist over time and there is no variation among the transects in terms of which species are most dominant but there is considerable variation in total abundance the difference in total abundance among transects in solhomfjell can be explained by the number of observation points within each transect for example transect 3 has 10 points compared to transect 10 which has 28 points 2 4 model here we apply the dynamic model of engen and lande 1996 assuming that the log abundance of species i follows an ornstein uhlenbeck process karlin and taylor 1981 1 d x i r i δ x i d t σ s d b i t σ c d b c t where d b i t and d b c t are independent increments of standard brownian motions with zero means and variances d t the total environmental variance is accordingly σ e 2 σ s 2 σ c 2 where σ s 2 and σ c 2 express the species specific and common environmental noise respectively the intrinsic growth rates r i are assumed to be a sample from a normal distribution with mean r 0 and variance σ r 2 and δ describes the strength of the density regulation the log of the carrying capacity of species i is then r i δ so that the log carrying capacity among species has mean e ln k r 0 δ and variance σ r 2 δ 2 the log abundances of species at time zero and t 0 will then follow a bivariate normal distribution among species under poisson sampling the corresponding counts of individuals will then follow a bivariate poisson lognormal distribution engen et al 2011a a simple way of accounting for possible over dispersion relative to the poisson is then to assume that the sampling is described by a poisson lognormal distribution rather than a poisson with an over dispersion parameter θ 2 which is zero under poisson sampling engen et al 2011a showed that the counts still follow a bivariate poisson lognormal distribution with variance parameter 2 σ t o t a l 2 σ s 2 2 δ σ r 2 δ 2 θ 2 this is then the variance parameter in the observed species abundance distribution which we write on the form σ t o t a l 2 σ s t o c h 2 σ h e t e r 2 θ 2 thus decomposing the variance into three terms expressing the effect of species specific environmental noise the heterogeneity among species and the over dispersion in the sampling respectively the common environmental noise σ c 2 only affects the sample sizes with no effect on the parameters of the distribution engen and lande 1996 the bivariate poisson lognormal also has a correlation parameter which is the correlation between two actual log abundances not the observed ones of the same species at time difference t which can be expressed on the form 3 ρ t ρ 0 ρ e δ t ρ where ρ 0 σ s 2 2 δ σ r 2 δ 2 σ t o t a l 2 and ρ σ r 2 δ 2 σ t o t a l 2 by fitting the bivariate poisson lognormal distribution to all pairs of samples at different time intervals using the poilog package in r grøtan and engen 2008 r core team 2016 the common total variance as well as the ρ t for a large number of time differences can be estimated by maximising the likelihood function the estimates of the ρ t can finally be smoothed to obtain estimates of ρ 0 ρ and δ finally these estimates yield estimates of the three additive components of the total variance by the relations σ h e t e r 2 ρ σ t o t a l 2 θ 2 1 ρ 0 σ t o t a l 2 and σ s t o c h 2 ρ 0 ρ σ t o t a l 2 2 5 estimation within each area we estimated the temporal autocorrelation by fitting the bivariate poisson lognormal distribution to each possible combination of pairs of samples for all time differences from all the estimated correlations from transects taken at the same time we estimated ρ 0 as the mean ρ ˆ 0 σ t 0 ρ t n t 0 and the standard error as the sample standard deviation se ρ ˆ 0 t 0 ρ t ρ ˆ 0 n t 0 1 the strength of density regulation δ can be estimated by fitting the autocorrelation function eq 3 to the estimated sample correlations by minimizing the sum of squares between each sample correlation and ρ t assuming that ρ ˆ 0 is known we imposed the boundary condition that ρ 0 ρ 0 for a density regulated population the return time to equilibrium is defined as the expected time required for a deviation from equilibrium to reach a fraction 1 e of its original value in the corresponding deterministic model solbu et al 2013 and depends on life history characteristics like survival rates age at maturity and clutch sizes from the estimated strength of density regulation δ ˆ we can obtain an estimate of the mean return time to equilibrium t ˆ r 1 δ ˆ that can be used to set the threshold for time differences used to estimate ρ specifically we took the smallest integer strictly greater than twice the mean return time to equilibrium for all sample correlations with a time difference greater or equal to this threshold we estimated the correlation in the limit as the sample mean ρ ˆ t 2 t ˆ r ρ t n t 2 t ˆ r and the standard error se ρ ˆ t 2 t ˆ r ρ t ρ ˆ n t 2 t ˆ r 1 this method of estimating ρ can give estimates of δ that are very small which in turn yield unrealistically long return times to equilibrium low estimates of δ can be due to the observed correlations decreasing very slowly if at all with increasing time difference meaning that the species abundance distribution and the ranking of species abundances are almost identical over long time differences an alternative approach to estimating ρ is then to determine a lower bound of δ or conversely an upper bound of t r that is reasonable based on other studies of the temporal dynamics of the species see e g table 2 in sæther and engen 2002 for sample estimates of strength of density regulation in different bird species giving estimates of return time to equilibrium of 3 years or less if the estimated δ is less than 0 2 we will set the mean return time to equilibrium to five years and use sample correlations with a time difference of ten or more years for calculating ρ if we set the threshold for δ too high we may end up with an unrealistically large proportion of variance attributed to heterogeneity and consequently a too low turnover rate at the same time we need large enough samples to estimate ρ by not having the threshold too low there may be areas and sampling designs with large over dispersion estimates that could conceal species heterogeneity within a subset of samples in an area to see if species heterogeneity was concealed by over dispersion we estimated the over dispersion for all possible partitionings of an area into two subgroups where each group had two or more transects and found the two groups that minimize the average over dispersion i e min ρ 0 ρ 0 l o w ρ 0 h i g h 2 we wanted to highlight how the subsequent analysis of the temporal autocorrelation was affected by this division the total variance σ t o t a l 2 for each area was estimated by fitting a univariate poisson lognormal distribution to all samples in each area and taking the sample mean of the estimated variances 3 results we have in this study focused on the results from dividalen and solhomfjell as these areas represent the extremes of difference in habitat variation within an area and are best suited for highlighting the important capabilities of our model the other areas børgefjell åmotsdalen gutulia møsvatn and lund fall within the range of these two and will therefore not be commented on in detail although a summary of results is provided in table 1 and at the end of the results section when we analysed all the transects in dividalen fig 6 a a total of 21 730 pairwise correlations the estimated correlation between transects within the same year was ρ ˆ 0 0 471 with a standard error 0 016 n t 0 936 the estimated proportion of variance due to over dispersion was then 0 529 generated by spatial variation habitat differences and demographic stochasticity variation in individual reproduction or survival furthermore the estimated strength of density dependence was δ ˆ 0 11 giving a mean return time to equilibrium of nine years suggesting that we should use estimated correlations with time differences equal to or greater than 18 years to be confident that the autocorrelation function is close to ρ however for the species we are studying such a mean return time to equilibrium seemed unrealistic therefore assuming a return time of five years we used the sample correlations with time differences greater or equal to ten to estimate the correlation in the limit giving ρ ˆ 0 468 se 0 0058 n t 10 6548 which equals the proportion of variance due to temporal heterogeneity among species using time difference greater or equal to 18 gave ρ ˆ 0 459 indicating that the assumed species strength of density regulation does not seem to influence our estimate of heterogeneity significantly a small proportion ρ 0 ρ 0 0032 of the total variance σ ˆ t o t a l 2 3 42 was due to environmental stochasticity σ ˆ s t o c h 2 0 011 compared to the variance due to heterogeneity σ ˆ h e t e r 2 1 6 to investigate what was causing the large over dispersion within the dividalen area we looked at the two sample correlations within the same year fig 6b and found high correlations among transects from the same group either 1 6 or 7 10 while there was a low or negative correlation among transects from each of the groups 1 6 and 7 10 if we estimated ρ 0 for all possible ways of grouping the transects in dividalen in two it transpired that by grouping 1 6 and 7 10 we obtained the largest mean estimates of ρ 0 within the two subgroups i e minimized the spatial variation component of the over dispersion the most compared to the initial joint estimate of all transects from our initial inspection of the data this subdivision seemed reasonable as there were considerable differences in elevation fig 2 and vegetation characteristics fig 3 between the two groups so we called these subgroups low and high altitudes respectively performing the variance partitioning within the two subgroups we got rather different results than our initial analysis indicated fig 6c and d first the estimated proportion of variance due to over dispersion was much smaller with 1 ρ ˆ 0 0 0916 and 0 176 for the low and high groups respectively second the low group had a much shorter return time to equilibrium t r 3 5 while the high group had a much longer return time compared to the initial estimate t r 14 we therefore used sample correlations with a time difference seven years or greater to estimate ρ within the low transects while we used ten or more years for the high transects the estimated proportion of variance due to heterogeneity among species was ρ ˆ 0 859 for low σ ˆ h e t e r 2 3 2 and 0 774 for high σ ˆ h e t e r 2 2 3 which was a large increase compared to what the initial analysis indicated finally the proportion of variance attributed to environmental stochasticity was similar in the two subgroups with ρ ˆ 0 ρ ˆ 0 0489 and 0 0497 of their total variance σ ˆ t o t a l 2 3 72 and 2 97 respectively this gave environmental variance component estimates of σ ˆ s t o c h 2 0 182 within low and σ ˆ s t o c h 2 0 147 within high transects estimating the temporal autocorrelation for the community in solhomfjell fig 7 a we found that spatial variation or demographic stochasticity only accounted for a small proportion 1 ρ ˆ 0 0 0789 of the total variation σ ˆ t o t a l 2 2 57 the strength of density regulation was 0 12 so we used sample correlations with time difference ten years or greater when estimating ρ as we did in dividalen when we considered all the transects together but in solhomfjell heterogeneity accounted for a large proportion ρ ˆ 0 816 of the total variance corresponding to σ ˆ h e t e r 2 2 09 the proportion of variance due to environmental stochasticity was then ρ ˆ 0 ρ ˆ 0 106 i e σ ˆ s t o c h 2 0 271 the over dispersion estimate did not indicate any large spatial differences among the transects a result supported by the sample correlations within the same year fig 7b where no apparent patterns of correlation between the transects emerged the small over dispersion estimate was also as expected from the preliminary inspection of the spatial data of elevation fig 2 and vegetation fig 3 where no systematic difference between the transects was observed when we performed the subdivision of transects the two subgroups that minimized the mean estimated over dispersion were transects 1 7 9 low and 8 10 high the correlation between transects 8 and 9 fig 7b was high but slightly lower between transect 9 and 10 therefore the 9th transect was excluded from the high group according to our simple grouping rule the variance decomposition for the two subgroups showed that while the over dispersion was reduced for the high group it did not change our conclusions regarding heterogeneity environmental stochasticity or strength of density regulation fig 7c and d table 1 compared to the joint analysis of all the transects when we only used passerine species in the analysis of bird communities the results changed slightly in dividalen while they were practically the same in solhomfjell table 1 when analysing passerine species for all transects in dividalen we got a small decrease in over dispersion and a similar increase in heterogeneity the over dispersion however was still of such a magnitude that dividing the transects into two subgroups was reasonable while the results in the low group in dividalen was the same for passerine species compared to all species there was a small decrease in heterogeneity for the high group the non passerine species removed from the analysis fig 4 were mainly species that were only found in the high transects the removal of species exclusive to high transects could explain the decrease in over dispersion when analysing all transects together since restricting the analysis to passerine species made high and low transects more similar when analysing high transects separately the reduction in heterogeneity among passerine species could be due to there being fewer species at a low or intermediate abundance for the other areas børgefjell åmotsdalen gutulia møsvatn and lund the estimated strength of density regulation was so small that the estimated mean return time to equilibrium t ˆ r was greater than our observed maximum time difference we therefore used the correlations with time differences of ten years or greater to estimate ρ and the variance due to heterogeneity among species as a simple approximation in the absence of a reasonable estimate of δ the estimated ρ 0 table 1 showed that there was more over dispersion when considering all transects together in børgefjell åmotsdalen and gutulia compared to møsvatn and lund comparing the analysis for all the areas available fig 8 heterogeneity among species accounted for roughly three quarters of the variation in species abundance for areas where over dispersion was more than a quarter of the variance when considering all transects together dividalen børgefjell åmotsdalen and gutulia it was beneficial to partition the transects into two subgroups as this reduced the over dispersion in both subgroups which was not the case for the other areas møsvatn solhomfjell and lund the absolute values of the variance component estimates table 1 ranged from 0 11 to 0 34 for environmental noise σ s t o c h 2 if we considered high and low subgroups in dividalen børgefjell åmotsdalen and gutulia and all transects together in møsvatn solhomfjell and lund there were no apparent trends in σ s t o c h 2 in terms of high or low groups or the geographical location of the different areas the optimal subdivision of the transects showed that for dividalen børgefjell åmotsdalen gutulia and møsvatn the partitioning followed the mean elevation gradient one of the subgroups in møsvatn only included two transects which seemed to reduce the over dispersion very little in the remaining subgroup the small reduction in over dispersion for one of the subgroups was also the case for solhomfjell and lund where the division did not follow the mean elevation gradient not surprising considering that the elevation range was limited compared to the other areas fig 2 due to the lack of overall reduction in over dispersion we would suggest keeping the analysis made with all the transects considered jointly in areas with spatial variation similar to that in møsvatn solhomfjell and lund 4 discussion to monitor and understand community dynamics typically wanting to distinguish natural from human induced changes in species assemblages is a challenging task in community ecology the concept of β diversity introduced by whittaker 1972 described the difference in diversity between local communities and populations over larger geographical areas this approach has also been extended to the temporal scale defined as the metric describing changes in community composition over time using some similarity measure to find how fast similarity changes species turnover mcgill et al 2015 here natural temporal species turnover has been modelled by letting population model parameters vary among species so called community heterogeneity engen et al 2011b describing each species population dynamics put great demands on data sets and model parameterization but by modelling species specific growth rates by a distribution leading to variation in carrying capacities among species we do not need to specify the dynamics of each species in detail the community can thereby be described by a parsimonious model that still captures the important properties of the dynamics without this assumption of heterogeneity the estimated environmental variance would have to be extremely large to generate the variation seen in species abundance distributions and the model would still not describe the species turnover correctly solbu et al 2016 trying to predict population dynamics with an overestimated environmental variance would also result in an unrealistic short time to extinction sæther et al 2005 with the modelling approach presented here it is also possible to sort out potential spatial variation in species abundances among sampling units that otherwise would obscure the analysis of community dynamics long time series of community data are usually hard to come by they can be designed for other purposes even studying spatial structures or some physical constraints may limit our freedom to design sampling optimally the validity of this approach has been illustrated by linking the spatial variation in species abundances to elevation and vegetation but habitat data can often be unavailable and is not required to fit the model even with suboptimal sampling designs of time series data it is possible to obtain reliable parameter estimates and predictions for the dynamics of a heterogeneous community our model development was started by revisiting the theory of dynamic species abundance models engen and lande 1996 to estimate the different sources of variation in species abundance distributions which in turn can be used to quantify the community similarity over time the method has several attractive features as it accounts for sampling error provides approximately unbiased estimates and enables us to decompose the total variance to variation due to species temporal heterogeneity species specific environmental stochasticity and over dispersion which in turn can uncover spatial variation in habitat heterogeneity among species is the underlying assumption applied in the modelling which also gave us a measure of the temporal similarity we applied this method to local communities of birds throughout norway which have not undergone any dramatic changes in habitat during the observation period other studies such as on bird communities in north america have shown that diversity increased for some decades pre 2000s before starting to decline in recent years jarzyna and jetz 2017 across many taxa communities have generally been found to decrease in similarity over time while maintaining a stable species richness dornelas et al 2014 our results show that a large proportion of the variation in species abundance was due to heterogeneity among species from which we can conclude the following first the community composition was very similar over the whole 20 year period observed with abundant species remaining abundant while less abundant species maintaining a low abundance the high degree of similarity gives a small temporal β diversity with a low turnover rate see fig 1 in mcgill et al 2015 as the areas studied are rather undisturbed the low turnover rate can be interpreted as a baseline if the turnover rate increases it could be an indication of species invasions or climate change that would have to be addressed by conservation managers magurran 2016 second the large proportion of variation due to heterogeneity gave estimates of environmental variance that seems reasonable compared to studies of both butterfly and aquatic insect communities engen et al 2002 2011b the low estimate for the strength of density regulation could be due to strong temporal correlation between transects as indicated by the data a small δ makes it hard to estimate the proportion of variance due to heterogeneity ρ eq 3 the strategy of setting a lower bound for the strength of density dependence to determine the time difference used to estimate the proportion of variance due to heterogeneity ρ was based on earlier studies of temporal dynamics of bird species sæther and engen 2002 an alternative non parametric approach for estimating the correlation in the limit ρ is to use the quantiles of the sample correlations to determine the threshold engen et al 2011b using prior or expert knowledge about the strength of density regulation is reasonable in cases where good estimates are difficult to obtain solbu et al 2015 the results from the different methods used to determine the threshold for ρ were roughly the same as the sample correlations were high over the whole period figs 6c and d and 7a furthermore the analysis is robust with respect to the assumption of a normal distributed log abundance engen et al 2011a with the plethora of indices ecologists have available for studying biodiversity using the bivariate poisson lognormal distribution to estimate similarity between samples is a favourable alternative as it accounts for many modelling challenges and allows for robust analysis even though data may be collected within spatially varying areas using this knowledge to separate spatial from temporal variation reveals community dynamics that to a large extent is governed

25171,we have in this study analysed bird communities across norway with a heterogeneous species abundance model where dynamical parameters can vary among species similarity in community composition over time used as a measure of temporal β diversity or the turnover rate was then estimated when we account for heterogeneity in dynamical parameters among species it will affect how we estimate environmental stochasticity and subsequently how the temporal dynamics is modelled in addition spatial variation in species abundance within a sampling area can obscure the temporal dynamics of communities by inadvertently including small scale spatial variation within sampling areas in the sample noise term it will be difficult to correctly detect changes in community structure or species abundance similarity in time using norwegian bird communities as a case study we have shown how to interpret the sample correlation of the bivariate poisson lognormal distribution fitted to pairs of transects and why separation of the transects into spatially similar subgroups can be beneficial this approach also makes us able to account for sampling error and over dispersion relative to poisson sampling the partitioning of the variance of the species abundance distributions showed that heterogeneity among species in temporal dynamics accounted for roughly 75 of the variation close to estimates for other taxa high temporal similarity can be interpreted as a low baseline turnover rate which is important when studying changes to ecosystems due to e g anthropogenic effects furthermore the environmental stochasticity was more realistically estimated in this heterogeneous model this is essential for predicting the dynamics of species abundances forward in time keywords β diversity environmental stochasticity heterogeneous species abundance models over dispersion temporal community dynamics 1 introduction understanding how human activities affect biodiversity is a key issue in community ecology however even without human interference fluctuations in species abundance extinctions and speciations change biodiversity naturally and this baseline turnover rate needs to be accounted for when analysing species communities and how they change magurran 2016 one measure for the turnover rate in communities is the similarity in species abundances over time communities where species change considerably in relative abundance from one year to the next will have a high turnover rate while if the species have almost the same relative abundance over time the turnover rate will be low this difference in community dynamics can be described by introducing the concept of community heterogeneity if species in a community have different temporal dynamics this heterogeneity can be modelled by letting population dynamical parameters vary among species engen and lande 1996 solbu et al 2016 conversely in a homogeneous community the parameters describing the dynamics are assumed to be equal for all species here community heterogeneity is defined as the variation in carrying capacity among species engen et al 2002 introduced in the model by assuming that the species growth rates are a sample from some distribution the proportion of the total variation in the observed species abundance distribution that can be attributed to heterogeneity will then be a measure of the community s temporal turnover rate if heterogeneity accounts for a large part of the variation in species abundances the turnover rate will be low whereas a community with low levels of heterogeneity will have a high turnover rate in addition to a baseline turnover rate the plethora of different measures of biodiversity and different spatial resolutions breed conflicting results in terms of consequences of human induced changes mcgill et al 2015 several considerations regarding sampling design should be made before samples to analyse species diversity and abundance are collected bonar et al 2011 one important issue to consider when conducting biodiversity analysis is the choice of sampling unit a common sampling unit is counting individuals along line transects ideally these transects should be randomly distributed within the area where the community of interest is analysed however it is often not physically possible to randomly distribute transects due to the topography of the area e g steep hills thick vegetation or rivers and instead the transects follow trails already in the landscape or the sampling may have been designed to study spatial structures in species diversity as well as temporal dynamics thereby distributing sampling units along gradients the analysis presented here illustrates how spatial variation between sampling units intentional or not can affect the estimation of temporal heterogeneity in bird communities the proportion of variation in the species abundance distribution that can be attributed to community heterogeneity is estimated by the correlation between sampling units over time if species abundances from sampling units within an area the same year are dissimilar i e a species having high abundance in one transect can have low abundance in the other transect this spatial dissimilarity will obscure analyses of temporal dynamics it is then crucial to know how to separate the effect of spatial variation from temporal heterogeneity in spatiotemporal species abundance data sets we show how within year comparison of correlation between transects can be used to estimate spatial variation that needs to be under control when studying temporal dynamics and community heterogeneity the choice of species to include in the samples i e our prior definition of the community will affect a similarity analysis although some species may not have a large influence on the estimated community dynamics individuals could for instance belong to species that are not endemic to the area and can therefore introduce variation in the species abundance distribution that is not necessarily true for the assessment of the local community dynamics thereby also affecting the estimated turnover rate as an illustration we will compare the analysis of a community including all registered bird species with a community including only passerine birds and discuss how the difference in community limitation may affect the estimated spatial variation and temporal heterogeneity of the community our approach is to fit a bivariate poisson lognormal species abundance distribution to all pairs of transects within an area and estimate the correlation among transects within the same year and then study how the correlation changes with increasing time difference between transects the use of the lognormal distribution has a long history in community ecology preston 1948 and the poisson sampling of this distribution is well known bulmer 1974 a species abundance distribution described by a poisson lognormal distribution can be modelled by a continuous time dynamic population model with a gompertz type of density regulation which can also account for different temporal dynamics among species engen and lande 1996 the difference in temporal dynamics in this model i e the degree of community heterogeneity can be attributed to variation in the carrying capacity among species some species fluctuate at high abundances while others remain at low abundances over time species having different carrying capacities can be generated by niche segregation hutchinson 1957 macarthur 1960 but we do not attempt to test this theory formally here however heterogeneity among species does deviate from the assumptions in the neutral theory of community dynamics where species are assumed to have the same dynamics and population fluctuations are caused by demographic stochasticity only hubbell 2001 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling design the data we analyse have been collected since the early 1990s to document long term changes in norwegian wildlife seven different areas were selected across norway to cover a wide range of climatic variation fig 1 a areas in the southern part of norway have historically been more exposed to pollution and while there is farming in some of the areas they are otherwise considered undisturbed habitats although data have been collected for a wide range of plant and mammal species we will here limit the community to consist of bird species only within each area several sampling points along transects have been used to count the abundance of each species by listening for bird song there are ten transects within each area except for møsvatn which has eight each transect has usually 20 observation points with 200 300 m distance but this number can vary in some areas due to landscape constraints for example in solhomfjell fig 1c we use the transect as sampling unit because the observer conducting the census along a transect corrected for observations of the same individuals made at adjacent points and we illustrate the applicability of the method to data where the researcher only has information at the transect level an alternative design is to aggregate the points with respect to some covariate such as elevation or vegetation but we show that even with such potential underlying differences in spatial composition informative results can be obtained 2 2 spatial variation as the locations of the areas cover the entire span of norway there is considerable spatial variation both within and between areas in terms of sampling area size fig 1b and c elevation fig 2 and vegetation fig 3 the transects in dividalen cover an area of roughly 250 km2 fig 1b while the area covered in solhomfjell is roughly 20 km2 fig 1c the difference in the area covered by the transects in dividalen and solhomfjell could indicate a greater variation in the species found among the transects in dividalen compared to those found in solhomfjell the elevation of each sampling point varies both within and between areas fig 2 while the overall mean elevation in dividalen and solhomfjell is roughly the same circa 500 m the difference between the lowest and highest points the range within the areas is twice as large in dividalen compared to solhomfjell lund has an overall mean elevation and range similar to solhomfjell børgefjell and gutulia differ in their overall mean elevation but have the same range while åmotsdalen and møsvatn have the same overall mean but differ in range each sampling point has been classified to a vegetation category so aggregating the proportion of each vegetation class within transects can illustrate the spatial variation within a sampling area comparing the distribution of vegetation classes between dividalen and solhomfjell reveals some interesting features of the sampling areas fig 3 first the individual transects in dividalen have little variation they have roughly five classes each while the transects in solhomfjell have around ten classes each part of the reason for the greater variation within transects in solhomfjell is the number of observation points but the number of classes is almost constant for each transect even though the number of points varies second the difference between the measured characteristics is greater in dividalen than solhomfjell for instance transects one to six in dividalen have more forest vegetation in common such as conifers lichens and birches while the four other transects have more open vegetation consisting of graminoid ridges heather and grasses in solhomfjell on the other hand all transects consist of some type of coniferous or birch forest in addition to some areas of bryophyte knowing the spatial variation in each area is essential when we estimate the temporal autocorrelation of the community which in turn gives us an estimate of the heterogeneity among species in dynamical parameters when there is spatial variation among sampling units either due to suboptimal sampling designs or if sampling is designed with an intention to study spatial diversity it will obscure temporal autocorrelation among samples over time if not handled appropriately the available spatial information will be used as guidance when determining how to analyse the transects to minimize the effect of spatial variation on temporal estimates and predictions we first look at the spatial variation in species abundances for the censuses from the areas dividalen and solhomfjell before doing the temporal analyses in the next section the species abundance distribution in the first census year in dividalen fig 4 a is characterized by a variation like that found in the elevation and vegetation descriptions starting from the transect with the lowest mean elevation 300 m there are five species that are most abundant carduelis flammea fringilla montifringilla phoenicurus phoenicurus phylloscopus trochilus and turdus illacus but as the mean elevation increases their presence in addition to many of the less abundant species decreases or ceases completely from 650 m and up except one species carduelis flammea instead two other species become more abundant anthus pratensis and pluvialis apricaria in addition to several other less abundant species not found at the lower altitudes the species abundances in the first census year in solhomfjell fig 4b have a different development among transects the abundances in each transect are more similar with three species anthus trivalis fringilla coelebs and phylloscopus trochilus dominating across all transects and the less abundant species do not vary much in their presence between transects the community of study can be defined in many ways both with respect to spatial and taxonomic limitations and this may affect the results of the analyses for example will a community limited to bird species from one taxonomic order give different dynamic models than if all bird species are studied simultaneously when different community definitions severely change relative abundances in the sample model results will of course be affected but limiting the community to closely related species competing for the same resources may give a more focused analysis of the degree of heterogeneity the more abundant species in both study areas are all from the passeriformes order so analysing a community where low abundance non passerine species are removed names marked with a star fig 4 can serve as an illustration of the sensitivity of this modelling approach to community limitation and handling of species that are rare in the sample 2 3 temporal analyses since one goal is to identify the temporal covariation of species abundance the spatial variation in species abundance like the one observed in dividalen will be an issue if the pattern persists over time if all the transects within an area are compared a large habitat variation among transects will decrease the estimated temporal correlation if species occupy specific habitats time series of the species abundances within each transect over all census years up to 2013 in dividalen fig 5 a and solhomfjell fig 5b show that the species that were the most abundant in the first years of the census continue their dominance over time the total abundance is higher among the transects at low altitudes in dividalen transects 1 6 fig 5a compared to those at higher elevations the temporal heterogeneity in species abundance dynamics in solhomfjell is slightly more obscured but the most abundant species persist over time and there is no variation among the transects in terms of which species are most dominant but there is considerable variation in total abundance the difference in total abundance among transects in solhomfjell can be explained by the number of observation points within each transect for example transect 3 has 10 points compared to transect 10 which has 28 points 2 4 model here we apply the dynamic model of engen and lande 1996 assuming that the log abundance of species i follows an ornstein uhlenbeck process karlin and taylor 1981 1 d x i r i δ x i d t σ s d b i t σ c d b c t where d b i t and d b c t are independent increments of standard brownian motions with zero means and variances d t the total environmental variance is accordingly σ e 2 σ s 2 σ c 2 where σ s 2 and σ c 2 express the species specific and common environmental noise respectively the intrinsic growth rates r i are assumed to be a sample from a normal distribution with mean r 0 and variance σ r 2 and δ describes the strength of the density regulation the log of the carrying capacity of species i is then r i δ so that the log carrying capacity among species has mean e ln k r 0 δ and variance σ r 2 δ 2 the log abundances of species at time zero and t 0 will then follow a bivariate normal distribution among species under poisson sampling the corresponding counts of individuals will then follow a bivariate poisson lognormal distribution engen et al 2011a a simple way of accounting for possible over dispersion relative to the poisson is then to assume that the sampling is described by a poisson lognormal distribution rather than a poisson with an over dispersion parameter θ 2 which is zero under poisson sampling engen et al 2011a showed that the counts still follow a bivariate poisson lognormal distribution with variance parameter 2 σ t o t a l 2 σ s 2 2 δ σ r 2 δ 2 θ 2 this is then the variance parameter in the observed species abundance distribution which we write on the form σ t o t a l 2 σ s t o c h 2 σ h e t e r 2 θ 2 thus decomposing the variance into three terms expressing the effect of species specific environmental noise the heterogeneity among species and the over dispersion in the sampling respectively the common environmental noise σ c 2 only affects the sample sizes with no effect on the parameters of the distribution engen and lande 1996 the bivariate poisson lognormal also has a correlation parameter which is the correlation between two actual log abundances not the observed ones of the same species at time difference t which can be expressed on the form 3 ρ t ρ 0 ρ e δ t ρ where ρ 0 σ s 2 2 δ σ r 2 δ 2 σ t o t a l 2 and ρ σ r 2 δ 2 σ t o t a l 2 by fitting the bivariate poisson lognormal distribution to all pairs of samples at different time intervals using the poilog package in r grøtan and engen 2008 r core team 2016 the common total variance as well as the ρ t for a large number of time differences can be estimated by maximising the likelihood function the estimates of the ρ t can finally be smoothed to obtain estimates of ρ 0 ρ and δ finally these estimates yield estimates of the three additive components of the total variance by the relations σ h e t e r 2 ρ σ t o t a l 2 θ 2 1 ρ 0 σ t o t a l 2 and σ s t o c h 2 ρ 0 ρ σ t o t a l 2 2 5 estimation within each area we estimated the temporal autocorrelation by fitting the bivariate poisson lognormal distribution to each possible combination of pairs of samples for all time differences from all the estimated correlations from transects taken at the same time we estimated ρ 0 as the mean ρ ˆ 0 σ t 0 ρ t n t 0 and the standard error as the sample standard deviation se ρ ˆ 0 t 0 ρ t ρ ˆ 0 n t 0 1 the strength of density regulation δ can be estimated by fitting the autocorrelation function eq 3 to the estimated sample correlations by minimizing the sum of squares between each sample correlation and ρ t assuming that ρ ˆ 0 is known we imposed the boundary condition that ρ 0 ρ 0 for a density regulated population the return time to equilibrium is defined as the expected time required for a deviation from equilibrium to reach a fraction 1 e of its original value in the corresponding deterministic model solbu et al 2013 and depends on life history characteristics like survival rates age at maturity and clutch sizes from the estimated strength of density regulation δ ˆ we can obtain an estimate of the mean return time to equilibrium t ˆ r 1 δ ˆ that can be used to set the threshold for time differences used to estimate ρ specifically we took the smallest integer strictly greater than twice the mean return time to equilibrium for all sample correlations with a time difference greater or equal to this threshold we estimated the correlation in the limit as the sample mean ρ ˆ t 2 t ˆ r ρ t n t 2 t ˆ r and the standard error se ρ ˆ t 2 t ˆ r ρ t ρ ˆ n t 2 t ˆ r 1 this method of estimating ρ can give estimates of δ that are very small which in turn yield unrealistically long return times to equilibrium low estimates of δ can be due to the observed correlations decreasing very slowly if at all with increasing time difference meaning that the species abundance distribution and the ranking of species abundances are almost identical over long time differences an alternative approach to estimating ρ is then to determine a lower bound of δ or conversely an upper bound of t r that is reasonable based on other studies of the temporal dynamics of the species see e g table 2 in sæther and engen 2002 for sample estimates of strength of density regulation in different bird species giving estimates of return time to equilibrium of 3 years or less if the estimated δ is less than 0 2 we will set the mean return time to equilibrium to five years and use sample correlations with a time difference of ten or more years for calculating ρ if we set the threshold for δ too high we may end up with an unrealistically large proportion of variance attributed to heterogeneity and consequently a too low turnover rate at the same time we need large enough samples to estimate ρ by not having the threshold too low there may be areas and sampling designs with large over dispersion estimates that could conceal species heterogeneity within a subset of samples in an area to see if species heterogeneity was concealed by over dispersion we estimated the over dispersion for all possible partitionings of an area into two subgroups where each group had two or more transects and found the two groups that minimize the average over dispersion i e min ρ 0 ρ 0 l o w ρ 0 h i g h 2 we wanted to highlight how the subsequent analysis of the temporal autocorrelation was affected by this division the total variance σ t o t a l 2 for each area was estimated by fitting a univariate poisson lognormal distribution to all samples in each area and taking the sample mean of the estimated variances 3 results we have in this study focused on the results from dividalen and solhomfjell as these areas represent the extremes of difference in habitat variation within an area and are best suited for highlighting the important capabilities of our model the other areas børgefjell åmotsdalen gutulia møsvatn and lund fall within the range of these two and will therefore not be commented on in detail although a summary of results is provided in table 1 and at the end of the results section when we analysed all the transects in dividalen fig 6 a a total of 21 730 pairwise correlations the estimated correlation between transects within the same year was ρ ˆ 0 0 471 with a standard error 0 016 n t 0 936 the estimated proportion of variance due to over dispersion was then 0 529 generated by spatial variation habitat differences and demographic stochasticity variation in individual reproduction or survival furthermore the estimated strength of density dependence was δ ˆ 0 11 giving a mean return time to equilibrium of nine years suggesting that we should use estimated correlations with time differences equal to or greater than 18 years to be confident that the autocorrelation function is close to ρ however for the species we are studying such a mean return time to equilibrium seemed unrealistic therefore assuming a return time of five years we used the sample correlations with time differences greater or equal to ten to estimate the correlation in the limit giving ρ ˆ 0 468 se 0 0058 n t 10 6548 which equals the proportion of variance due to temporal heterogeneity among species using time difference greater or equal to 18 gave ρ ˆ 0 459 indicating that the assumed species strength of density regulation does not seem to influence our estimate of heterogeneity significantly a small proportion ρ 0 ρ 0 0032 of the total variance σ ˆ t o t a l 2 3 42 was due to environmental stochasticity σ ˆ s t o c h 2 0 011 compared to the variance due to heterogeneity σ ˆ h e t e r 2 1 6 to investigate what was causing the large over dispersion within the dividalen area we looked at the two sample correlations within the same year fig 6b and found high correlations among transects from the same group either 1 6 or 7 10 while there was a low or negative correlation among transects from each of the groups 1 6 and 7 10 if we estimated ρ 0 for all possible ways of grouping the transects in dividalen in two it transpired that by grouping 1 6 and 7 10 we obtained the largest mean estimates of ρ 0 within the two subgroups i e minimized the spatial variation component of the over dispersion the most compared to the initial joint estimate of all transects from our initial inspection of the data this subdivision seemed reasonable as there were considerable differences in elevation fig 2 and vegetation characteristics fig 3 between the two groups so we called these subgroups low and high altitudes respectively performing the variance partitioning within the two subgroups we got rather different results than our initial analysis indicated fig 6c and d first the estimated proportion of variance due to over dispersion was much smaller with 1 ρ ˆ 0 0 0916 and 0 176 for the low and high groups respectively second the low group had a much shorter return time to equilibrium t r 3 5 while the high group had a much longer return time compared to the initial estimate t r 14 we therefore used sample correlations with a time difference seven years or greater to estimate ρ within the low transects while we used ten or more years for the high transects the estimated proportion of variance due to heterogeneity among species was ρ ˆ 0 859 for low σ ˆ h e t e r 2 3 2 and 0 774 for high σ ˆ h e t e r 2 2 3 which was a large increase compared to what the initial analysis indicated finally the proportion of variance attributed to environmental stochasticity was similar in the two subgroups with ρ ˆ 0 ρ ˆ 0 0489 and 0 0497 of their total variance σ ˆ t o t a l 2 3 72 and 2 97 respectively this gave environmental variance component estimates of σ ˆ s t o c h 2 0 182 within low and σ ˆ s t o c h 2 0 147 within high transects estimating the temporal autocorrelation for the community in solhomfjell fig 7 a we found that spatial variation or demographic stochasticity only accounted for a small proportion 1 ρ ˆ 0 0 0789 of the total variation σ ˆ t o t a l 2 2 57 the strength of density regulation was 0 12 so we used sample correlations with time difference ten years or greater when estimating ρ as we did in dividalen when we considered all the transects together but in solhomfjell heterogeneity accounted for a large proportion ρ ˆ 0 816 of the total variance corresponding to σ ˆ h e t e r 2 2 09 the proportion of variance due to environmental stochasticity was then ρ ˆ 0 ρ ˆ 0 106 i e σ ˆ s t o c h 2 0 271 the over dispersion estimate did not indicate any large spatial differences among the transects a result supported by the sample correlations within the same year fig 7b where no apparent patterns of correlation between the transects emerged the small over dispersion estimate was also as expected from the preliminary inspection of the spatial data of elevation fig 2 and vegetation fig 3 where no systematic difference between the transects was observed when we performed the subdivision of transects the two subgroups that minimized the mean estimated over dispersion were transects 1 7 9 low and 8 10 high the correlation between transects 8 and 9 fig 7b was high but slightly lower between transect 9 and 10 therefore the 9th transect was excluded from the high group according to our simple grouping rule the variance decomposition for the two subgroups showed that while the over dispersion was reduced for the high group it did not change our conclusions regarding heterogeneity environmental stochasticity or strength of density regulation fig 7c and d table 1 compared to the joint analysis of all the transects when we only used passerine species in the analysis of bird communities the results changed slightly in dividalen while they were practically the same in solhomfjell table 1 when analysing passerine species for all transects in dividalen we got a small decrease in over dispersion and a similar increase in heterogeneity the over dispersion however was still of such a magnitude that dividing the transects into two subgroups was reasonable while the results in the low group in dividalen was the same for passerine species compared to all species there was a small decrease in heterogeneity for the high group the non passerine species removed from the analysis fig 4 were mainly species that were only found in the high transects the removal of species exclusive to high transects could explain the decrease in over dispersion when analysing all transects together since restricting the analysis to passerine species made high and low transects more similar when analysing high transects separately the reduction in heterogeneity among passerine species could be due to there being fewer species at a low or intermediate abundance for the other areas børgefjell åmotsdalen gutulia møsvatn and lund the estimated strength of density regulation was so small that the estimated mean return time to equilibrium t ˆ r was greater than our observed maximum time difference we therefore used the correlations with time differences of ten years or greater to estimate ρ and the variance due to heterogeneity among species as a simple approximation in the absence of a reasonable estimate of δ the estimated ρ 0 table 1 showed that there was more over dispersion when considering all transects together in børgefjell åmotsdalen and gutulia compared to møsvatn and lund comparing the analysis for all the areas available fig 8 heterogeneity among species accounted for roughly three quarters of the variation in species abundance for areas where over dispersion was more than a quarter of the variance when considering all transects together dividalen børgefjell åmotsdalen and gutulia it was beneficial to partition the transects into two subgroups as this reduced the over dispersion in both subgroups which was not the case for the other areas møsvatn solhomfjell and lund the absolute values of the variance component estimates table 1 ranged from 0 11 to 0 34 for environmental noise σ s t o c h 2 if we considered high and low subgroups in dividalen børgefjell åmotsdalen and gutulia and all transects together in møsvatn solhomfjell and lund there were no apparent trends in σ s t o c h 2 in terms of high or low groups or the geographical location of the different areas the optimal subdivision of the transects showed that for dividalen børgefjell åmotsdalen gutulia and møsvatn the partitioning followed the mean elevation gradient one of the subgroups in møsvatn only included two transects which seemed to reduce the over dispersion very little in the remaining subgroup the small reduction in over dispersion for one of the subgroups was also the case for solhomfjell and lund where the division did not follow the mean elevation gradient not surprising considering that the elevation range was limited compared to the other areas fig 2 due to the lack of overall reduction in over dispersion we would suggest keeping the analysis made with all the transects considered jointly in areas with spatial variation similar to that in møsvatn solhomfjell and lund 4 discussion to monitor and understand community dynamics typically wanting to distinguish natural from human induced changes in species assemblages is a challenging task in community ecology the concept of β diversity introduced by whittaker 1972 described the difference in diversity between local communities and populations over larger geographical areas this approach has also been extended to the temporal scale defined as the metric describing changes in community composition over time using some similarity measure to find how fast similarity changes species turnover mcgill et al 2015 here natural temporal species turnover has been modelled by letting population model parameters vary among species so called community heterogeneity engen et al 2011b describing each species population dynamics put great demands on data sets and model parameterization but by modelling species specific growth rates by a distribution leading to variation in carrying capacities among species we do not need to specify the dynamics of each species in detail the community can thereby be described by a parsimonious model that still captures the important properties of the dynamics without this assumption of heterogeneity the estimated environmental variance would have to be extremely large to generate the variation seen in species abundance distributions and the model would still not describe the species turnover correctly solbu et al 2016 trying to predict population dynamics with an overestimated environmental variance would also result in an unrealistic short time to extinction sæther et al 2005 with the modelling approach presented here it is also possible to sort out potential spatial variation in species abundances among sampling units that otherwise would obscure the analysis of community dynamics long time series of community data are usually hard to come by they can be designed for other purposes even studying spatial structures or some physical constraints may limit our freedom to design sampling optimally the validity of this approach has been illustrated by linking the spatial variation in species abundances to elevation and vegetation but habitat data can often be unavailable and is not required to fit the model even with suboptimal sampling designs of time series data it is possible to obtain reliable parameter estimates and predictions for the dynamics of a heterogeneous community our model development was started by revisiting the theory of dynamic species abundance models engen and lande 1996 to estimate the different sources of variation in species abundance distributions which in turn can be used to quantify the community similarity over time the method has several attractive features as it accounts for sampling error provides approximately unbiased estimates and enables us to decompose the total variance to variation due to species temporal heterogeneity species specific environmental stochasticity and over dispersion which in turn can uncover spatial variation in habitat heterogeneity among species is the underlying assumption applied in the modelling which also gave us a measure of the temporal similarity we applied this method to local communities of birds throughout norway which have not undergone any dramatic changes in habitat during the observation period other studies such as on bird communities in north america have shown that diversity increased for some decades pre 2000s before starting to decline in recent years jarzyna and jetz 2017 across many taxa communities have generally been found to decrease in similarity over time while maintaining a stable species richness dornelas et al 2014 our results show that a large proportion of the variation in species abundance was due to heterogeneity among species from which we can conclude the following first the community composition was very similar over the whole 20 year period observed with abundant species remaining abundant while less abundant species maintaining a low abundance the high degree of similarity gives a small temporal β diversity with a low turnover rate see fig 1 in mcgill et al 2015 as the areas studied are rather undisturbed the low turnover rate can be interpreted as a baseline if the turnover rate increases it could be an indication of species invasions or climate change that would have to be addressed by conservation managers magurran 2016 second the large proportion of variation due to heterogeneity gave estimates of environmental variance that seems reasonable compared to studies of both butterfly and aquatic insect communities engen et al 2002 2011b the low estimate for the strength of density regulation could be due to strong temporal correlation between transects as indicated by the data a small δ makes it hard to estimate the proportion of variance due to heterogeneity ρ eq 3 the strategy of setting a lower bound for the strength of density dependence to determine the time difference used to estimate the proportion of variance due to heterogeneity ρ was based on earlier studies of temporal dynamics of bird species sæther and engen 2002 an alternative non parametric approach for estimating the correlation in the limit ρ is to use the quantiles of the sample correlations to determine the threshold engen et al 2011b using prior or expert knowledge about the strength of density regulation is reasonable in cases where good estimates are difficult to obtain solbu et al 2015 the results from the different methods used to determine the threshold for ρ were roughly the same as the sample correlations were high over the whole period figs 6c and d and 7a furthermore the analysis is robust with respect to the assumption of a normal distributed log abundance engen et al 2011a with the plethora of indices ecologists have available for studying biodiversity using the bivariate poisson lognormal distribution to estimate similarity between samples is a favourable alternative as it accounts for many modelling challenges and allows for robust analysis even though data may be collected within spatially varying areas using this knowledge to separate spatial from temporal variation reveals community dynamics that to a large extent is governed

25172,roads negatively affect many vertebrate species whereas edge effect may favor some generalist species this study aims to 1 present a new way to calculate line integral effects represented by lie and avlie through new computer software making this concept accessible to a broad audience of researchers interested in the study of road ecology and tropical forest ecology and 2 test the performance of lie and avlie indices applied to road effect lie road and avlie road and to edge effect lie edge and avlie edge other road effect indices and forest area using a data set on small mammal abundance in a human modified landscape in the brazilian atlantic forest road and edge effects were represented by new metrics line integral effect lie and average integral effect avlie calculated using line integral from differential calculus of several variables through new free software developed by the second author lie road and lie edge measure the total sum of the effect of roads represented by lines and edges polygons respectively in relation to the forest fragment point avlie road and avlie edge measure the average of road and edge effect respectively in relation to the same sampling point we used generalized linear regression models to explore the relationships between the abundance of the two groups of small mammals forest specialists and habitat generalists and the independent variables representing road edge and forest effects for forest specialists the best model included avlie road negatively associated with abundance and avlie edge negatively associated while for habitat generalists the best model included avlie road negatively associated and lie edge positively associated thus there are more small mammals where road effect is lower forest fragments with higher edge effect showed more habitat generalists and less forest specialists lie and avlie could be useful metrics to explore edge effect separately to road effect on wildlife in forest fragments keywords differential calculus edge effect new software road ecology tropical forest wildlife 1 introduction line integral effect has been used in freitas et al 2012 and malcolm 1994 to study road effect laurance et al 2009 and edge effect murcia 1995 respectively it is defined as c g s p dl where c is a curve in ℝ 2 that can model a road or edge of region and g ℝ 4 ℝ is a function so that g s p measures the effect of a point s c over a fixed point p in the studied region roughly speaking lie p is approximated by a sum of these effects multiplied by the length of parts of c the challenge in using a line integral effects index in a systematic way is the issue of how to best integrate along so many curves that appear to naturally model roads and edges in freitas et al 2012 these issues were approached through a simple numerical process that would allow us to approximate the desired integral by a finite sum this numerical process that has a controllable numerical error requires some work from the user more precisely users must chose which curves they want to integrate and which would make less sense from a biologist point of view they also have to collect length of roads in different discs buffers using gis making some calculations all these steps in the numerical process require some time of the user and some understanding of the process itself and therefore the user could make mistakes and introduce errors during the calculations it was clearly desirable to have an automatic way to calculate this index with the least work as possible and demanding less mathematical knowledge from the user than the previous procedure freitas et al 2012 in this paper we have not only achieved these goals with this new method to calculate lie and avlie we have also attained better performance compared not only to other road effect indices but to the previous methods used to calculate them in freitas et al 2012 in addition we included the edge effect in models that were relevant to explain small mammal abundance this software follows a more sophisticated approach by programming with python it calculates the desired integrals instead to give an approximation also using visibility polygons a concept of computational geometry de berg et al 2008 the software chooses for the user the appropriate curves to be integrated in summary the new software called reeffects provides indices with a better performance saves time for users in calculating these indices and provides a sensible systematic method to calculate them the aim of this work is twofold first we present a new way to calculate line integral effects represented by lie and avlie through new free computer software developed by the second author making this concept accessible to a broad audience of researchers interested in studying road ecology and tropical forest ecology second we test the performance of these two new indices lie and avlie applied to road effect lie road and avlie road and to edge effect lie edge and avlie edge compared to other road effect indices and forest area using a data set on small mammal abundance in a human modified landscape in the brazilian atlantic forest 2 materials methods and calculations 2 1 a model of road effect 2 1 1 line integral effect lie and average integral effect avlie in this section we review the concept of the function line integral effect presented and discussed in freitas et al 2012 lie is defined using a line integral of a function g p the function g p will be defined using function h as pointed out at the end of this section function h that we consider in this work and in freitas et al 2012 is defined with a forest function f regarding data from our region let c be a combination of connected curves c i that models the roads or edge in the studied area consider p p 1 p 2 ℝ 2 a point in the forest in what follows we will define line integral effect of c at point p as the line integral of a function g p along c let g ℝ 2 x ℝ 2 ℝ be a function so that g p s measures the effect of point s s 1 s 2 c on the fixed point p for example it could measure how point s on the road affects the forest density at point p we will denote g p s as g p s g p s and this function will be called the infinitesimal effect we want to sum the effect of different points s c on p let us start by considering a simple case assume that c is a union of curves c i such that function g p is constant in each curve c i i e that all point s in c i have the same infinitesimal effect in this case we can define lie p as the finite sum g p s i l i where s i is some point in the curve c i and l i is the length of c i now we consider the general case where g p is not constant in pieces of c we know from differential calculus that the line integral of g p along a curve c is a number that can be approximated by finite sums g p s i l i when we consider an appropriate partition of c by small pieces c i for more details about line integral see stewart 2000 chapter 13 section 13 2 line integral for a visual representation of line integral see also see section 2 1 1 in freitas et al 2012 therefore the previous discussion motivates us to define the function line integral effect lie u ℝ 2 ℝ as the next line integral 1 lie p c g p dl where 2 g p s h p 1 s 1 2 p 2 s 2 2 if s is contained in the disk d of center p and a fixed maximal radius r max e g r max 1 000 m because up to 1 km road effect is more relevant to wildlife forman et al 2003 also note that the domain u of the integral road effect lie does not contain points of c that is p c now that we have the function lie we can define avlie as the average value of a function g p along a curve c avlie p lie p l c i e as where l c is the length of c see section 2 1 3 in freitas et al 2012 for a discussion of the meaning of average value and integral lines once we have defined lie as line integral it is natural to ask how to calculate this integral recall that if c is a curve that is an image of a smooth parameterization α a b ℝ 2 defined as α t x t y t then the line integral can be calculated in fact defined as below see stewart 2000 chapter 13 section 13 2 line integral c g p dl a b g p x t y t dx dt 2 dy dt 2 dt in freitas et al 2012 we calculate the integral above using a numerical algorithm that gives a fair approximation of the integral with an estimated error here in this paper we follow a completely different approach roughly speaking we do not use the output of gis length of the curves radius of discs etc to start to deal with the integration instead the roads and edges c are read as a union of large numbers of straight lines c i then by programming with python the integral is explicitly calculated in each straight line segment c i also using a visibility polygon a concept of computational geometry de berg et al 2008 the new software chose the appropriate curves to be integrated providing standardization in the calculations in the next section we briefly explain how the software called reeffects works in several steps we conclude this section with a brief review of the function h as explained in freitas et al 2012 we assume that there is more forest far from roads and thus we calculate a linear regression using forest and road data from são paulo state sousa et al 2009 resulting in a linear equation called forest function with constants a and b in particular the values of a and b depend on the studied region see section 2 1 4 of freitas et al 2012 for more details about f and how one can calculate the constants a and b using the r software hornik 2017 through a linear regression with gaussian distribution thus we have a forest function f ℝ ℝ defined as f r ar b for a 0 057 and b 16 12 function f measures how the density of forest in the region increases when the distance from roads increases using the assumption that lie is inverse to f we inferred that h r k 2πr f r see section 2 1 2 in freitas et al 2012 for explanations about this model in our case we set the constant k as k 100 in order to avoid very small integrals which are usually poorly processed by numerical programs 2 1 2 the reeffects software in this section we briefly explain how the new free software developed by the second author works to calculate lie and avlie more details how to install and use reeffects software can be found in appendix a the reeffects software is available at http professor ufabc edu br simone freitas step 1 in the first step the user has to write in the script using as example below and a text software such as note pad the path to two shape files compatible with arcgis software one containing the information about the lines forest fragments or roads that model edges or roads respectively and the other file containing the points p j j 1 to n which represent in that study case sites where small mammals were studied the constants a and b of the forest function h are also defined in the script and hence can be changed by the user once the user has edited the script they can run the software for more details see the manual the shape files are read by the gdal library http gdal org when reading edges this library converts polygons in lines to afterwards calculate the line integral see below an example of a script to be run in the reeffects software to calculate lie and avlie for roads of our study area caucaia a 0 057 b 16 12 k 10 000 rmax 1000 output dir out caucaia road output prefix caucaia road input lines file data caucaia road shp input

chooses which parts of the curves that model edges or roads fulfill the condition of visibility a point is s c called visible from p j if the segment of line that connects p j to s does not meet any other point of c the assumption in our model is that these are the points that can have some influence on point p j see fig 1 algorithms for visibility polygons or lines are known in computational geometry de berg et al 2008 and details about the implementation can be found in the cgal 4 11 library 2d visibility https doc cgal org latest visibility 2 index html chapter 2d visibility computation step 3 once the segments that model the edges or roads have been chosen for point p j the software integrates the function g pj as follows each curve c is a union of line c i q i q i 1 segments then using python libraries numpy http www numpy org and scipy https www scipy org our software integrates over each segment c i i e it calculates the integral i i 0 1 g pj α t q i 1 q i dt where α t q i t q i 1 q i fort 0 1 then lie p j c g pj s dl i i i once the integral lie p j has been calculated the avlie is calculated as avlie p j lie p j l c where l c is the length of the curve c step 4 finally after the software has calculated lie p j and avlie p j for all points p j it produces a file as output with the extension csv which can be opened using a text software such as note pad or a spreadsheet software such as excel where lie p j and avlie p j are present in a sheet for more details see manual if the input data were roads the output if the script was right see step 1 will be lie road and avlie road for each site p similarly if the input data was forest fragments the output will be lie edge and avlie edge for each site p 2 2 testing the performance of road effect indices 2 2 1 study area to test the performance of the new indices of edge effect lie edge and avlie edge and the updated indices of road effects described above lie road and avlie road we used the same data set used in the previous work freitas et al 2012 the study area was a 10 000 ha human modified landscape with 30 of forest cover 23 41 s 23 47 s 47 02 w 47 07 w situated in the plateau of ibiúna in the district of caucaia do alto 50 km from the city of são paulo in southeastern brazil the weather in this area is warm and humid with a mean monthly temperature varying between 11 and 27 c the annual precipitation is about 1300 1400 mm and is seasonally variable with the driest and coldest months between april and august the vegetation is classified as lower montane atlantic rain forest being a transition between the coastal atlantic rain forest and atlantic semi deciduous forest oliveira filho and fontes 2000 teixeira et al 2009 provides more details on climate relief and vegetation of this study area the plateau of ibiúna has only secondary roads some paved but most unimproved dirt roads used mostly for local traffic and transport of agricultural products in recent decades the road density has increased affecting forest dynamics and land use changes including an urbanization trend with a replacement of small farms by country houses and condominiums freitas et al 2010 2 2 2 sampling design and data sources twenty forest fragments sample site p were sampled to collect small mammals using a 100 m transect with 11 pitfall traps 10 m from each other connected by a 50 cm high plastic fence pardini et al 2005 the capture period was 16 days with 176 trap nights in each site during the summer of 2001 2002 pardini et al 2005 animals were marked with numbered tags at first capture pardini et al 2005 we calculated the total abundance of two groups of small mammals in the 20 forest fragments forest specialists brucepattersonius soricinus delomys sublineatus euryoryzomys russatus gracilinanus microtarsus juliomys pictipes j ossitenuis marmosops incanus monodelphis scalops m americana monodelphis sorex oxymycterus dasytrichus phyllomys nigrispinus sooretamys angouya thaptomys nigrita and habitat generalists akodon montensis bibimys labiosus calomys tener nectomys squamipes oligoryzomys nigripes following the definition in pardini et al 2010 the classification of small mammals in this study was the same as freitas et al 2012 allowing comparison to road effect indices ire and avire between both studies maps of roads and land cover were done based on aerial photographs from 2000 1 10 000 teixeira et al 2009 the forest cover up to 1 km from the sample site forest cover and the forest fragment size fragment size were calculated using the land cover map in addition to the new edge effect indices proposed lie edge and avlie edge and the updated road effect indices lie road and avlie road we also calculated the three most commonly used road indices for each of the 20 sites distance of the nearest road from the sample site road density inside a 1 km circle centered in the sample site and effective mesh size calculated using the effective mesh size arcgis tool girvetz 2008 considering the map unit as the 1 km buffer around the sample site and the barrier layer as the roads 1 m buffer united to a 2 km buffer around the sample site thus all road effect indices used the same 1 km buffer around each of the 20 sites avlie values were multiplied by 1000 in order to reduce decimals we also used ire and avire as calculated in freitas et al 2012 to compare their performance to explain the relation between small mammal abundance and roads 2 2 3 testing the performance of road effect and edge effect indices we used generalized linear regression models with poisson errors pinheiro and bates 2004 to explore the relationships between the abundance of the two groups of small mammals forest specialists and habitat generalists and the independent variables representing road and forest effects for the abundance of each group separately we considered a set of candidate models containing seven simple regression models m1 models road effects including each of the updated road effect indices lie road and avlie road and each of the five other road effect indices nearest road distance mesh size road density ire and avire four simple regression models m2 models forest effects including each of the new edge effect indices lie edge and avlie edge and each of the two other forest effect indices fragment size and forest cover 28 multiple regression models m3 model road effects forest effects including each of the seven road effect indices and four forest effect indices and one reference model which did not contain the road effect indices neither forest effect indices but only the intercept called m0 for multiple regression models independent variables showing a correlation higher than 0 70 were not included in the same model a correlation test was done between variables using r software version 3 3 2 hornik 2017 models were run using generalized linear models glm in r software version 3 3 2 hornik 2017 and model selection was based on the akaike s information criterion burnham and anderson 2002 with correction for small samples aicc to sort the best models and evaluate their performance we used the aic weight wi and evidence wi max wi i burnham and anderson 2002 3 results the road effect indices that showed high correlation higher than 0 70 were ire and lie road 0 917 distance to the nearest road and lie road 0 855 ire and avlie road 0 849 ire and avlie road 0 827 road density and ire 0 803 road density and lie road 0 795 distance to the nearest road and ire 0 750 and distance to the nearest road and avlie road 0 702 table 1 avire did not significantly correlate with any independent variables table 1 the forest effect indices with high correlation were lie edge and avlie edge 0 891 and fragment size and forest cover 0 782 table 1 despite each other lie edge and avlie edge showed low correlation lower than 0 70 to all other variables with the highest correlation 0 672 being between lie edge and fragment size table 1 for the abundance of both forest specialist and habitat generalist small mammals the best model in the candidate set was the one containing a road effect index and a forest effect index models m3 in tables 2 and 3 for forest specialists the best model included avlie road and avlie edge table 2 while for habitat generalists the best model included avlie road and lie edge table 3 avlie road was negatively associated with abundance of both groups tables 2 and 3 for forest specialists avlie edge was negatively associated with abundance table 2 whereas for habitat generalists lie edge was positively associated with abundance table 3 between the models containing only road effect indices models m1 the best was that with avlie road with negative association and much higher evidence for both small mammal groups tables 2 and 3 forest effect models m2 performed the worst being represented by avlie edge with negative association for forest specialist small mammals table 2 and forest cover with positive association for habitat generalist small mammals table 3 lie road and avlie road showed high correlation to ire positive distance to the nearest road negative and road density positive indicating that all represent the road effect however avlie road best represents the relation to small mammal abundance in forest fragments avlie road represents the average road effect of all visible roads from the sample site perspective and not the road effect of only one point as represented by the distance to the nearest road or the length of all roads including the non visible ones 1 km around the sample site divided to 1 km circle area as represented by road density thus we recommend evaluating the performance of avlie road for other native vegetation remnants and other wildlife species 4 discussion the updated road effect index avlie road and the new edge effect indices avlie edge and lie edge showed the best performance to explain the abundance of both small mammal groups indicating that road and edge effects are more relevant to understand small mammal abundance in forest fragments than forest area high average road effect avlie road represents a low abundance of both small mammal groups for forest specialist species high average of edge effect avlie edge also represents low abundance whereas high total edge effect lie edge represents a high abundance of forest generalist species in our previous publication freitas et al 2012 avire in combination with forest cover was the best model to explain small mammal abundance in the present study avlie and lie performed much better than ire avire and forest cover using the same data set indicating that these new metrics may be more sensitive to detect road and edge effects for small mammals in forest fragments lie edge and avlie edge were not highly correlated with other road effect variables indicating their independence which means measuring edge effect separately from road effect roads could be a kind of edge particularly in forest fragments laurance et al 2009 usually it is difficult to separate road and edge effects fuentes montemayor et al 2009 thus lie and avlie could be useful metrics to explore edge effect separately from road effect on wildlife on forest fragments for small mammals in forest fragments edge effect could be more relevant to changes in community structure than forest patch size pardini 2004 some small mammal species showed an increase in abundance in the edges pardini 2004 or in less hostile matrix types such as native vegetation in initial stage of regeneration or eucalyptus plantations umetsu and pardini 2007 usually these species occur in forest and open vegetation habitats called habitat generalist species two endemic rodent species of cozumel island mexico showed differences in distribution of age and sex groups in their population comparing sites near and far edges created by secondary roads with low traffic fuentes montemayor et al 2009 a generalist rodent species akodon montensis crossed more frequently in roadless edges than roaded edges indicating lower permeability caused by roads and a potential increase of population isolation ascensão et al 2017 mcgregor et al 2008 showed no significant effects of traffic amount on movement of peromyscus leucopus and tamias striatus after translocations indicating that these species avoid the road itself and not noise from traffic these two species were considered with positive or neutral effect of roads on their abundance fahrig and rytwinski 2009 thus these species with positive or neutral effect of roads rytwinski and fahrig 2015 even in roads with higher traffic volume could be positively affected by forest edges more than negatively affected by roads as we found for habitat generalist species in the present study resulting in a positive effect lie edge showed a positive effect on habitat generalist species more relevant than avlie edge which means that the sum of the effects lie increase their abundance analogous to drug administration this means that the total quantity lie of the drug causes greater effects than the intensity of each effect distributed in a number of doses avlie in contrast forest specialist species are more susceptible to habitat changes pardini et al 2010 for these species of greater concern to conservationists an average of edge effect avlie edge was relevant to reduce their abundance even more relevant than forest cover in combination with road effect this means that for this group of species the intensity of each effect avlie can be more important than the total sum of the effects lie using again the drug administration analogy when administering even a small number of concentrated doses of a medication can have a greater effect than the total quantity thus we recommend the use of these metrics to evaluate road and edge effects separately to see how these species respond particularly considered positively or neutrally affected by roads in general arboreal and mid sized species are negatively affected whereas terrestrial and small sized species are positive or neutrally affected by roads rytwinski and fahrig 2015 rosa et al 2018 showed generalist ground dwelling species were attracted to road edges or matrix edges whereas generalist arboreal species were found in more abundance far from road matrix edges some species are affected by the road surface mcgregor et al 2008 whereas other species are susceptible even to unpaved roads rico et al 2007 these species negatively affected by roads may avoid crossing roads causing a barrier effect which reduces genetic exchange between populations on opposite sides of the road and thus increasing local extinction probability ascensão et al 2015 the barrier effect can reduce animal movement affecting ecosystem functioning worldwide tucker et al 2018 holderegger and di giulio 2010 found a weak genetic subdivision of small mammal populations caused by the road similarly to that found by ascensão et al 2016 for the wood mouse apodemus sylvaticus moreover there is a particular issue about road kill monitoring for small animals that should be discussed here small size animals result in low detectability santos et al 2011 and rapid removal by scavengers antworth et al 2005 which reduces road kill estimates of small mammals teixeira et al 2013 road kill monitoring done on foot and more frequently e g daily may reduce this underestimation teixeira et al 2013 road kill and avoidance in small mammals and how each affects this wildlife group should be investigated particularly in the tropics where it is poorly understood rosa et al 2018 in the present study because of the low traffic in the secondary roads around forest fragments we believe that a barrier effect is the main road effect associated with small mammal abundance fences could be a useful mitigation measure to avoid road kill but if the main effect is avoidance it could even increase the barrier effect road borders may attract small mammals near the road and increase road kill rates of these mammals and their predators such as owls ascensão et al 2012 bellamy et al 2000 grilo et al 2012 sabino marques and mira 2011 road effect mitigation measures such as fences and crossing structures could be used to reduce road kill and reduce the barrier effect if the behavior of small mammals in relation to roads is known grilo et al 2018 mcdonald and st clair 2004 van der grift et al 2013 the proportion of remnant native vegetation cover in the landscape has an influence on richness and abundance of small mammal communities estavillo et al 2013 pardini et al 2010 our study area has 30 forest cover which is considered a threshold for richness and abundance particularly for forest specialist species pardini et al 2010 landscapes with forest cover below 30 showed an abrupt decline of forest specialist abundance and richness whereas landscapes above 30 showed an increase of them estavillo et al 2013 this means that high levels of forest loss represent a rapid increase of extinction rates for forest specialist species particularly in landscapes with forest cover lower than 30 estavillo et al 2013 pardini et al 2010 thus we recommend further studies on how road and edge effect influences small mammal communities considering landscapes with different proportions of remnant native vegetation cover usually these studies do not consider road and edge effects but only forest cover 5 conclusion lie and avlie calculated using line integral by the new software reeffects performed better compared to other road effect indices to explain abundance of small mammals in forest fragments a high average of road effect avlie road represents a low abundance of forest specialist and generalist species for forest specialist species high average of edge effect avlie edge also represents a low abundance whereas high total edge effect lie edge represents a high abundance of forest generalist species thus there are more small mammals where road effect is lower forest fragments with higher edge effect showed more habitat generalists and less forest specialists road and edge effects were more relevant to explain abundance of small mammals than forest area lie and avlie could be useful metrics to explore edge effects

25172,roads negatively affect many vertebrate species whereas edge effect may favor some generalist species this study aims to 1 present a new way to calculate line integral effects represented by lie and avlie through new computer software making this concept accessible to a broad audience of researchers interested in the study of road ecology and tropical forest ecology and 2 test the performance of lie and avlie indices applied to road effect lie road and avlie road and to edge effect lie edge and avlie edge other road effect indices and forest area using a data set on small mammal abundance in a human modified landscape in the brazilian atlantic forest road and edge effects were represented by new metrics line integral effect lie and average integral effect avlie calculated using line integral from differential calculus of several variables through new free software developed by the second author lie road and lie edge measure the total sum of the effect of roads represented by lines and edges polygons respectively in relation to the forest fragment point avlie road and avlie edge measure the average of road and edge effect respectively in relation to the same sampling point we used generalized linear regression models to explore the relationships between the abundance of the two groups of small mammals forest specialists and habitat generalists and the independent variables representing road edge and forest effects for forest specialists the best model included avlie road negatively associated with abundance and avlie edge negatively associated while for habitat generalists the best model included avlie road negatively associated and lie edge positively associated thus there are more small mammals where road effect is lower forest fragments with higher edge effect showed more habitat generalists and less forest specialists lie and avlie could be useful metrics to explore edge effect separately to road effect on wildlife in forest fragments keywords differential calculus edge effect new software road ecology tropical forest wildlife 1 introduction line integral effect has been used in freitas et al 2012 and malcolm 1994 to study road effect laurance et al 2009 and edge effect murcia 1995 respectively it is defined as c g s p dl where c is a curve in ℝ 2 that can model a road or edge of region and g ℝ 4 ℝ is a function so that g s p measures the effect of a point s c over a fixed point p in the studied region roughly speaking lie p is approximated by a sum of these effects multiplied by the length of parts of c the challenge in using a line integral effects index in a systematic way is the issue of how to best integrate along so many curves that appear to naturally model roads and edges in freitas et al 2012 these issues were approached through a simple numerical process that would allow us to approximate the desired integral by a finite sum this numerical process that has a controllable numerical error requires some work from the user more precisely users must chose which curves they want to integrate and which would make less sense from a biologist point of view they also have to collect length of roads in different discs buffers using gis making some calculations all these steps in the numerical process require some time of the user and some understanding of the process itself and therefore the user could make mistakes and introduce errors during the calculations it was clearly desirable to have an automatic way to calculate this index with the least work as possible and demanding less mathematical knowledge from the user than the previous procedure freitas et al 2012 in this paper we have not only achieved these goals with this new method to calculate lie and avlie we have also attained better performance compared not only to other road effect indices but to the previous methods used to calculate them in freitas et al 2012 in addition we included the edge effect in models that were relevant to explain small mammal abundance this software follows a more sophisticated approach by programming with python it calculates the desired integrals instead to give an approximation also using visibility polygons a concept of computational geometry de berg et al 2008 the software chooses for the user the appropriate curves to be integrated in summary the new software called reeffects provides indices with a better performance saves time for users in calculating these indices and provides a sensible systematic method to calculate them the aim of this work is twofold first we present a new way to calculate line integral effects represented by lie and avlie through new free computer software developed by the second author making this concept accessible to a broad audience of researchers interested in studying road ecology and tropical forest ecology second we test the performance of these two new indices lie and avlie applied to road effect lie road and avlie road and to edge effect lie edge and avlie edge compared to other road effect indices and forest area using a data set on small mammal abundance in a human modified landscape in the brazilian atlantic forest 2 materials methods and calculations 2 1 a model of road effect 2 1 1 line integral effect lie and average integral effect avlie in this section we review the concept of the function line integral effect presented and discussed in freitas et al 2012 lie is defined using a line integral of a function g p the function g p will be defined using function h as pointed out at the end of this section function h that we consider in this work and in freitas et al 2012 is defined with a forest function f regarding data from our region let c be a combination of connected curves c i that models the roads or edge in the studied area consider p p 1 p 2 ℝ 2 a point in the forest in what follows we will define line integral effect of c at point p as the line integral of a function g p along c let g ℝ 2 x ℝ 2 ℝ be a function so that g p s measures the effect of point s s 1 s 2 c on the fixed point p for example it could measure how point s on the road affects the forest density at point p we will denote g p s as g p s g p s and this function will be called the infinitesimal effect we want to sum the effect of different points s c on p let us start by considering a simple case assume that c is a union of curves c i such that function g p is constant in each curve c i i e that all point s in c i have the same infinitesimal effect in this case we can define lie p as the finite sum g p s i l i where s i is some point in the curve c i and l i is the length of c i now we consider the general case where g p is not constant in pieces of c we know from differential calculus that the line integral of g p along a curve c is a number that can be approximated by finite sums g p s i l i when we consider an appropriate partition of c by small pieces c i for more details about line integral see stewart 2000 chapter 13 section 13 2 line integral for a visual representation of line integral see also see section 2 1 1 in freitas et al 2012 therefore the previous discussion motivates us to define the function line integral effect lie u ℝ 2 ℝ as the next line integral 1 lie p c g p dl where 2 g p s h p 1 s 1 2 p 2 s 2 2 if s is contained in the disk d of center p and a fixed maximal radius r max e g r max 1 000 m because up to 1 km road effect is more relevant to wildlife forman et al 2003 also note that the domain u of the integral road effect lie does not contain points of c that is p c now that we have the function lie we can define avlie as the average value of a function g p along a curve c avlie p lie p l c i e as where l c is the length of c see section 2 1 3 in freitas et al 2012 for a discussion of the meaning of average value and integral lines once we have defined lie as line integral it is natural to ask how to calculate this integral recall that if c is a curve that is an image of a smooth parameterization α a b ℝ 2 defined as α t x t y t then the line integral can be calculated in fact defined as below see stewart 2000 chapter 13 section 13 2 line integral c g p dl a b g p x t y t dx dt 2 dy dt 2 dt in freitas et al 2012 we calculate the integral above using a numerical algorithm that gives a fair approximation of the integral with an estimated error here in this paper we follow a completely different approach roughly speaking we do not use the output of gis length of the curves radius of discs etc to start to deal with the integration instead the roads and edges c are read as a union of large numbers of straight lines c i then by programming with python the integral is explicitly calculated in each straight line segment c i also using a visibility polygon a concept of computational geometry de berg et al 2008 the new software chose the appropriate curves to be integrated providing standardization in the calculations in the next section we briefly explain how the software called reeffects works in several steps we conclude this section with a brief review of the function h as explained in freitas et al 2012 we assume that there is more forest far from roads and thus we calculate a linear regression using forest and road data from são paulo state sousa et al 2009 resulting in a linear equation called forest function with constants a and b in particular the values of a and b depend on the studied region see section 2 1 4 of freitas et al 2012 for more details about f and how one can calculate the constants a and b using the r software hornik 2017 through a linear regression with gaussian distribution thus we have a forest function f ℝ ℝ defined as f r ar b for a 0 057 and b 16 12 function f measures how the density of forest in the region increases when the distance from roads increases using the assumption that lie is inverse to f we inferred that h r k 2πr f r see section 2 1 2 in freitas et al 2012 for explanations about this model in our case we set the constant k as k 100 in order to avoid very small integrals which are usually poorly processed by numerical programs 2 1 2 the reeffects software in this section we briefly explain how the new free software developed by the second author works to calculate lie and avlie more details how to install and use reeffects software can be found in appendix a the reeffects software is available at http professor ufabc edu br simone freitas step 1 in the first step the user has to write in the script using as example below and a text software such as note pad the path to two shape files compatible with arcgis software one containing the information about the lines forest fragments or roads that model edges or roads respectively and the other file containing the points p j j 1 to n which represent in that study case sites where small mammals were studied the constants a and b of the forest function h are also defined in the script and hence can be changed by the user once the user has edited the script they can run the software for more details see the manual the shape files are read by the gdal library http gdal org when reading edges this library converts polygons in lines to afterwards calculate the line integral see below an example of a script to be run in the reeffects software to

chooses which parts of the curves that model edges or roads fulfill the condition of visibility a point is s c called visible from p j if the segment of line that connects p j to s does not meet any other point of c the assumption in our model is that these are the points that can have some influence on point p j see fig 1 algorithms for visibility polygons or lines are known in computational geometry de berg et al 2008 and details about the implementation can be found in the cgal 4 11 library 2d visibility https doc cgal org latest visibility 2 index html chapter 2d visibility computation step 3 once the segments that model the edges or roads have been chosen for point p j the software integrates the function g pj as follows each curve c is a union of line c i q i q i 1 segments then using python libraries numpy http www numpy org and scipy https www scipy org our software integrates over each segment c i i e it calculates the integral i i 0 1 g pj α t q i 1 q i dt where α t q i t q i 1 q i fort 0 1 then lie p j c g pj s dl i i i once the integral lie p j has been calculated the avlie is calculated as avlie p j lie p j l c where l c is the length of the curve c step 4 finally after the software has calculated lie p j and avlie p j for all points p j it produces a file as output with the extension csv which can be opened using a text software such as note pad or a spreadsheet software such as excel where lie p j and avlie p j are present in a sheet for more details see manual if the input data were roads the output if the script was right see step 1 will be lie road and avlie road for each site p similarly if the input data was forest fragments the output will be lie edge and avlie edge for each site p 2 2 testing the performance of road effect indices 2 2 1 study area to test the performance of the new indices of edge effect lie edge and avlie edge and the updated indices of road effects described above lie road and avlie road we used the same data set used in the previous work freitas et al 2012 the study area was a 10 000 ha human modified landscape with 30 of forest cover 23 41 s 23 47 s 47 02 w 47 07 w situated in the plateau of ibiúna in the district of caucaia do alto 50 km from the city of são paulo in southeastern brazil the weather in this area is warm and humid with a mean monthly temperature varying between 11 and 27 c the annual precipitation is about 1300 1400 mm and is seasonally variable with the driest and coldest months between april and august the vegetation is classified as lower montane atlantic rain forest being a transition between the coastal atlantic rain forest and atlantic semi deciduous forest oliveira filho and fontes 2000 teixeira et al 2009 provides more details on climate relief and vegetation of this study area the plateau of ibiúna has only secondary roads some paved but most unimproved dirt roads used mostly for local traffic and transport of agricultural products in recent decades the road density has increased affecting forest dynamics and land use changes including an urbanization trend with a replacement of small farms by country houses and condominiums freitas et al 2010 2 2 2 sampling design and data sources twenty forest fragments sample site p were sampled to collect small mammals using a 100 m transect with 11 pitfall traps 10 m from each other connected by a 50 cm high plastic fence pardini et al 2005 the capture period was 16 days with 176 trap nights in each site during the summer of 2001 2002 pardini et al 2005 animals were marked with numbered tags at first capture pardini et al 2005 we calculated the total abundance of two groups of small mammals in the 20 forest fragments forest specialists brucepattersonius soricinus delomys sublineatus euryoryzomys russatus gracilinanus microtarsus juliomys pictipes j ossitenuis marmosops incanus monodelphis scalops m americana monodelphis sorex oxymycterus dasytrichus phyllomys nigrispinus sooretamys angouya thaptomys nigrita and habitat generalists akodon montensis bibimys labiosus calomys tener nectomys squamipes oligoryzomys nigripes following the definition in pardini et al 2010 the classification of small mammals in this study was the same as freitas et al 2012 allowing comparison to road effect indices ire and avire between both studies maps of roads and land cover were done based on aerial photographs from 2000 1 10 000 teixeira et al 2009 the forest cover up to 1 km from the sample site forest cover and the forest fragment size fragment size were calculated using the land cover map in addition to the new edge effect indices proposed lie edge and avlie edge and the updated road effect indices lie road and avlie road we also calculated the three most commonly used road indices for each of the 20 sites distance of the nearest road from the sample site road density inside a 1 km circle centered in the sample site and effective mesh size calculated using the effective mesh size arcgis tool girvetz 2008 considering the map unit as the 1 km buffer around the sample site and the barrier layer as the roads 1 m buffer united to a 2 km buffer around the sample site thus all road effect indices used the same 1 km buffer around each of the 20 sites avlie values were multiplied by 1000 in order to reduce decimals we also used ire and avire as calculated in freitas et al 2012 to compare their performance to explain the relation between small mammal abundance and roads 2 2 3 testing the performance of road effect and edge effect indices we used generalized linear regression models with poisson errors pinheiro and bates 2004 to explore the relationships between the abundance of the two groups of small mammals forest specialists and habitat generalists and the independent variables representing road and forest effects for the abundance of each group separately we considered a set of candidate models containing seven simple regression models m1 models road effects including each of the updated road effect indices lie road and avlie road and each of the five other road effect indices nearest road distance mesh size road density ire and avire four simple regression models m2 models forest effects including each of the new edge effect indices lie edge and avlie edge and each of the two other forest effect indices fragment size and forest cover 28 multiple regression models m3 model road effects forest effects including each of the seven road effect indices and four forest effect indices and one reference model which did not contain the road effect indices neither forest effect indices but only the intercept called m0 for multiple regression models independent variables showing a correlation higher than 0 70 were not included in the same model a correlation test was done between variables using r software version 3 3 2 hornik 2017 models were run using generalized linear models glm in r software version 3 3 2 hornik 2017 and model selection was based on the akaike s information criterion burnham and anderson 2002 with correction for small samples aicc to sort the best models and evaluate their performance we used the aic weight wi and evidence wi max wi i burnham and anderson 2002 3 results the road effect indices that showed high correlation higher than 0 70 were ire and lie road 0 917 distance to the nearest road and lie road 0 855 ire and avlie road 0 849 ire and avlie road 0 827 road density and ire 0 803 road density and lie road 0 795 distance to the nearest road and ire 0 750 and distance to the nearest road and avlie road 0 702 table 1 avire did not significantly correlate with any independent variables table 1 the forest effect indices with high correlation were lie edge and avlie edge 0 891 and fragment size and forest cover 0 782 table 1 despite each other lie edge and avlie edge showed low correlation lower than 0 70 to all other variables with the highest correlation 0 672 being between lie edge and fragment size table 1 for the abundance of both forest specialist and habitat generalist small mammals the best model in the candidate set was the one containing a road effect index and a forest effect index models m3 in tables 2 and 3 for forest specialists the best model included avlie road and avlie edge table 2 while for habitat generalists the best model included avlie road and lie edge table 3 avlie road was negatively associated with abundance of both groups tables 2 and 3 for forest specialists avlie edge was negatively associated with abundance table 2 whereas for habitat generalists lie edge was positively associated with abundance table 3 between the models containing only road effect indices models m1 the best was that with avlie road with negative association and much higher evidence for both small mammal groups tables 2 and 3 forest effect models m2 performed the worst being represented by avlie edge with negative association for forest specialist small mammals table 2 and forest cover with positive association for habitat generalist small mammals table 3 lie road and avlie road showed high correlation to ire positive distance to the nearest road negative and road density positive indicating that all represent the road effect however avlie road best represents the relation to small mammal abundance in forest fragments avlie road represents the average road effect of all visible roads from the sample site perspective and not the road effect of only one point as represented by the distance to the nearest road or the length of all roads including the non visible ones 1 km around the sample site divided to 1 km circle area as represented by road density thus we recommend evaluating the performance of avlie road for other native vegetation remnants and other wildlife species 4 discussion the updated road effect index avlie road and the new edge effect indices avlie edge and lie edge showed the best performance to explain the abundance of both small mammal groups indicating that road and edge effects are more relevant to understand small mammal abundance in forest fragments than forest area high average road effect avlie road represents a low abundance of both small mammal groups for forest specialist species high average of edge effect avlie edge also represents low abundance whereas high total edge effect lie edge represents a high abundance of forest generalist species in our previous publication freitas et al 2012 avire in combination with forest cover was the best model to explain small mammal abundance in the present study avlie and lie performed much better than ire avire and forest cover using the same data set indicating that these new metrics may be more sensitive to detect road and edge effects for small mammals in forest fragments lie edge and avlie edge were not highly correlated with other road effect variables indicating their independence which means measuring edge effect separately from road effect roads could be a kind of edge particularly in forest fragments laurance et al 2009 usually it is difficult to separate road and edge effects fuentes montemayor et al 2009 thus lie and avlie could be useful metrics to explore edge effect separately from road effect on wildlife on forest fragments for small mammals in forest fragments edge effect could be more relevant to changes in community structure than forest patch size pardini 2004 some small mammal species showed an increase in abundance in the edges pardini 2004 or in less hostile matrix types such as native vegetation in initial stage of regeneration or eucalyptus plantations umetsu and pardini 2007 usually these species occur in forest and open vegetation habitats called habitat generalist species two endemic rodent species of cozumel island mexico showed differences in distribution of age and sex groups in their population comparing sites near and far edges created by secondary roads with low traffic fuentes montemayor et al 2009 a generalist rodent species akodon montensis crossed more frequently in roadless edges than roaded edges indicating lower permeability caused by roads and a potential increase of population isolation ascensão et al 2017 mcgregor et al 2008 showed no significant effects of traffic amount on movement of peromyscus leucopus and tamias striatus after translocations indicating that these species avoid the road itself and not noise from traffic these two species were considered with positive or neutral effect of roads on their abundance fahrig and rytwinski 2009 thus these species with positive or neutral effect of roads rytwinski and fahrig 2015 even in roads with higher traffic volume could be positively affected by forest edges more than negatively affected by roads as we found for habitat generalist species in the present study resulting in a positive effect lie edge showed a positive effect on habitat generalist species more relevant than avlie edge which means that the sum of the effects lie increase their abundance analogous to drug administration this means that the total quantity lie of the drug causes greater effects than the intensity of each effect distributed in a number of doses avlie in contrast forest specialist species are more susceptible to habitat changes pardini et al 2010 for these species of greater concern to conservationists an average of edge effect avlie edge was relevant to reduce their abundance even more relevant than forest cover in combination with road effect this means that for this group of species the intensity of each effect avlie can be more important than the total sum of the effects lie using again the drug administration analogy when administering even a small number of concentrated doses of a medication can have a greater effect than the total quantity thus we recommend the use of these metrics to evaluate road and edge effects separately to see how these species respond particularly considered positively or neutrally affected by roads in general arboreal and mid sized species are negatively affected whereas terrestrial and small sized species are positive or neutrally affected by roads rytwinski and fahrig 2015 rosa et al 2018 showed generalist ground dwelling species were attracted to road edges or matrix edges whereas generalist arboreal species were found in more abundance far from road matrix edges some species are affected by the road surface mcgregor et al 2008 whereas other species are susceptible even to unpaved roads rico et al 2007 these species negatively affected by roads may avoid crossing roads causing a barrier effect which reduces genetic exchange between populations on opposite sides of the road and thus increasing local extinction probability ascensão et al 2015 the barrier effect can reduce animal movement affecting ecosystem functioning worldwide tucker et al 2018 holderegger and di giulio 2010 found a weak genetic subdivision of small mammal populations caused by the road similarly to that found by ascensão et al 2016 for the wood mouse apodemus sylvaticus moreover there is a particular issue about road kill monitoring for small animals that should be discussed here small size animals result in low detectability santos et al 2011 and rapid removal by scavengers antworth et al 2005 which reduces road kill estimates of small mammals teixeira et al 2013 road kill monitoring done on foot and more frequently e g daily may reduce this underestimation teixeira et al 2013 road kill and avoidance in small mammals and how each affects this wildlife group should be investigated particularly in the tropics where it is poorly understood rosa et al 2018 in the present study because of the low traffic in the secondary roads around forest fragments we believe that a barrier effect is the main road effect associated with small mammal abundance fences could be a useful mitigation measure to avoid road kill but if the main effect is avoidance it could even increase the barrier effect road borders may attract small mammals near the road and increase road kill rates of these mammals and their predators such as owls ascensão et al 2012 bellamy et al 2000 grilo et al 2012 sabino marques and mira 2011 road effect mitigation measures such as fences and crossing structures could be used to reduce road kill and reduce the barrier effect if the behavior of small mammals in relation to roads is known grilo et al 2018 mcdonald and st clair 2004 van der grift et al 2013 the proportion of remnant native vegetation cover in the landscape has an influence on richness and abundance of small mammal communities estavillo et al 2013 pardini et al 2010 our study area has 30 forest cover which is considered a threshold for richness and abundance particularly for forest specialist species pardini et al 2010 landscapes with forest cover below 30 showed an abrupt decline of forest specialist abundance and richness whereas landscapes above 30 showed an increase of them estavillo et al 2013 this means that high levels of forest loss represent a rapid increase of extinction rates for forest specialist species particularly in landscapes with forest cover lower than 30 estavillo et al 2013 pardini et al 2010 thus we recommend further studies on how road and edge effect influences small mammal communities considering landscapes with different proportions of remnant native vegetation cover usually these studies do not consider road and edge effects but only forest cover 5 conclusion lie and avlie calculated using line integral by the new software reeffects performed better compared to other road effect indices to explain abundance of small mammals in forest fragments a high average of road effect avlie road represents a low abundance of forest specialist and generalist species for forest specialist species high average of edge effect avlie edge also represents a low abundance whereas high total edge effect lie edge represents a high abundance of forest generalist species thus there are more small mammals where road effect is lower forest fragments with higher edge effect showed more habitat generalists and less forest specialists road and edge effects were more relevant to explain abundance of small mammals than forest area lie and avlie could be useful metrics to explore edge effects

25173,to evaluate the direct toxic effects and indirect ecological effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in a plateau eutrophication lake ecosystem we built aquatox model that focus on the interaction among phytoplankton zooplankton macrobenthos and fish populations the aquatox model was first implemented using 12 pelagic benthic populations came from monitoring data obtained in 20 sampling sites at dianchi lake between april 2015 and january 2016 at the meantime pahs concentration was simultaneously investigated in surface water according to the characteristics of trophic state all of sampling sites can be subdivided into four areas 1 area i algae dense area 2 area ii aquatic organism protection area 3 area iii littoral zone damaged area 4 and area iv ecosystem recovery area the result of sensitivity analysis showed that most of populations were very sensitive to optimal temperature and respiration rate through calibration and validation analysis the value of rb is range from 0 142 to 0 331 and the value of f is range from 0 116 to 0 300 which indicated that the model can describe the seasonal variation of 12 dominant populations in dianchi lake risk assessment showed that rotifer and chironomidae populations showed more sensitive for pahs pollution for the rotifer and copepoda the loss of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area ii followed by area iii area i and area iv for the temporal variation rotifer and copepoda were showed the highest difference values in winter in additional the risk can change according to the temporal variation for dianchi lake more attention should be pay in winter for the pollutants management the model was effective in estimating the indirect ecological effects of competition prey predatory biomass dilution or other effects passed through the foodweb therefore our study showed that the importance of ecosystem level studies to predict the ecological risk of pollutants keywords aquatox model indirect ecological effects polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs eutrophication dianchi lake 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a group of persistent organic pollutants that are aromatic hydrocarbons with two or more fused benzene rings haritash and kaushik 2009 pahs are colorless white pale yellow solids with low solubility in water high melting and boiling points and low vapour pressure clar 1964 the common sources of pahs in environment can be subdivided into natural process and anthropogenic activities haritash and kaushik 2006 at present sixteen pahs compounds have been recommended as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency usepa hu et al 2017 thereinto according to the international agency for research on cancer seven of them which include benz a anthrance chrysene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene indo 1 2 2 cd pyrene and dibenzo a h anthracene are potentially carcinogenic to humans zheng et al 2016 in addition owing to their low solubility and hydrophobic nature pahs tend to be associated with fine particles are introduced into lakes and seas by runoff and atmospheric fallout liu et al 2007 mouhri et al 2008 then seas or lakes often act as a trap for pahs das et al 2008 jiao et al 2009 pietzsch et al 2010 therefore it is very important to certain the pollution level and evaluate the ecological risk assessment of pahs in lakes or seas due to it can provide important information on environmental management meyer et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 zheng et al 2016 traditional ecological risk assessment era based on chemical analysis and biological toxicity tests in a single species to toxicant exposure clements and kiffney 1994 lei et al 2008 namely risk quotient rq method the approach is logical transparent and easily applied but it unfortunately lacks ecological realism for example it does not consider the actual populations composition of ecosystems it is based on the ecotoxicological studies performed in the laboratory under standard constant conditions that have little in common with natural habitats lombardo et al 2015 in additional the extrapolation of standard toxicity tests to assess ecological risk results in an assessment endpoint at the level of individual organisms while only simplistic assessment factors account for the large uncertainties associated with population community and ecosystem level dynamics lombardo et al 2015 and the method was failure to incorporate the indirect effects into risk assessment although the indirect effects of chemicals may be a significant factor influencing the effects in which community or ecosystem level respond to chemicals many experiments show that indirect effects can be greater than direct effects at the community level lampert et al 1989 prosnier et al 2015 at present indirect effects in ecological communities complex relationships involving three or more species recently have been pay more and more attention preston 2002 liebig et al 2008 prosnier et al 2015 although ecotoxicologists have long recognized the potential importance of indirect effects of chemicals these effects have remained understudied and not thoroughly incorporated into ecological risk assessment clements and rohr 2009 at present community ecology theory has been proposed as a framework for predicting indirect effects of contaminants to facilitate their integration into ecological risk assessment rohr et al 2006 except the indirect effects the eu scientific committees for risk assessments affirmed that current risk assessment methods give poor predictions of impact on the structure and function of ecosystems scenihr 2012 therefore there is a need for new tools to be developed and applied which account for the complexity of communities and ecosystems to address different aspects of ecological realism ecological models can be applied at the individual population community and ecosystem level park et al 2008 such as the littoral ecosystem risk assessment model leram hanratty and liber 1996 casm suwa naito et al 2002 and aquatox park and clough 2004 thereinto the aquatox is the most comprehensive of the general ecological risk models presently available it is not only considering the direct toxic effects of chemicals but also containing the indirect effects of pollutants passed through foodwebs zhang et al 2013 the model has been widely applied by researchers in streams ponds lakes estuaries reservoirs and experimental enclosures rashleigh 2003 park et al 2005 rashleigh 2007 sourisseau et al 2008 mcknight et al 2010 wang et al 2012a b however the aquatox model has not been applied to assess the ecological risk of chemicals in the plateau eutrophication lakes before dianchi lake is the largest plateau lake also as one of the three most hypereutrophic lakes in china it is characterized by extremely high concentrations of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp in the water column and annual algae blooms wu et al 2017 previous studies showed pahs were detected in the sediments and pelagic and benthic organisms for dianchi lake fan et al 2017 considering the direct and indirect effects of pahs may pose an unacceptable risk to aquatic organisms wildlife and humans zheng et al 2016 it is need to assess the direct and indirect effects of pahs in the plateau eutrophication lakes until now the comprehensive ecological risk of pahs in the dianchi lake has not previously been considered in additional the trophic state can change the ecological risk of chemicals by the variation of food web in eutrophication lake ecosystem wang et al 2012a b therefore the aims of this study were to 1 develop aquatox dianchi based on field data from dianchi lake 2 determine a parameter data set suitable to monitor the biomass seasonal variation of dominant populations while identifying model output sensitivity to parameter values 3 calculate the spatial and temporal variation of ecological risks relating to pahs contamination in natural hypereutrophic lake ecosystem as far as it can be determined this study was the first published account of an aquatox application in an algae dominated hypereutrophic plateau lake the model not only contained the direct toxic effects but also contained the indirect ecological effects of pahs and eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 the analysis procedure of the study the procedure of the ecological risk assessment for pahs by aquatox model can be subdivided into seven steps fig 1 1 conduct the field sampling including biological sampling and water sampling 2 establish the foodweb conceptual model of the dianchi lake 3 establish the aquatox dianchi lake model 4 aquatox model sensitivity analysis 5 model calibration and validation 6 compare the biomass change of dominate populations on control situation and perturb situation 7 calculate the ecological risk of pahs 2 2 the physical chemical and biological characteristics of the dianchi lake 2 2 1 the physical chemical characteristics dianchi lake lat 24 29 n to 25 28 n long 102 29 e to 103 01 e is the largest plateau lake covers an area of approximately 309 km2 locates in yunnan province southwestern china the altitude of the lake is about 1886 m the average depth is 4 40 m and the maximum depth is 8 00 m therefore the dianchi lake belongs to plateau shallow lake the total length of the lake is about 41 20 km the average width of the lake is about 7 56 km and the water volume is about 15 93 108 m3 during the past several decades due to the rapid population growth and economic development in the dianchi basin this region suffered from highly anthropogenic disturbances the water quality of the lake has deteriorated since late 1970s especially in the 1990s since 2010s although the nutrients have been under control eutrophication was still the main problem twenty sampling sites were included in this study fig 2 according to the characteristics of trophic state all of sampling sites can be subdivided into four areas supplementary material table s1 1 area i algae dense area 2 area ii aquatic organism protection area 3 area iii littoral zone damaged area and 4 area iv ecosystem recovery area sampling dates were selected depending on seasonal change water samplings were collected in april 2015 july 2015 october 2015 and january 2016 as shown in supplementary material table s1 dianchi lake has been designated hypereutrophic 2 2 2 the biological characteristics for the dominant populations through field sampling the dianchi lake ecosystem can be divided into 12 populations including diatoms greens blue greens myriophyllum hydrilla rotifer copepoda chironomidae shrimp asian mud snail carp and catfish populations the sample collection methods for biological populations were provided by zhang and liu 2014 2 3 aquatox model and parameterization 2 3 1 the conceptual model for aquatox model aquatox simulates the transfer of biomass and chemicals from one compartment of the ecosystem to another it does this by simultaneously computing important chemical and biological processes over time aquatox simulates multiple environmental stressors including nutrients organic loadings sediments toxic chemicals and temperature and their effects on the algal macrophyte invertebrate and fish communities aquatox can help identify and understand the cause and effect relationships between chemical water quality the physical environment and aquatic life fig 3 the basic equations used in aquatox to simulate the change of daily biomass in each population are briefly described in supplementary material table s2 detailed descriptions of the equations used in the model can be found at the following web link http water epa gov scitech datait models aquatox data cfm 2 3 2 the food web model for aquatox model the original version of aquatox rel 3 1 was adapted to the food web structure and the environmental conditions of dianchi lake the benthic pelagic coupling food web structure of aquatox dianchi was provided in fig 4 each box or circle represents one model population or nonliving ecosystem component and arrows denote the flow of energy or biomass 2 3 3 the parameters for aquatox model the dianchi lake foodweb includes three phytoplanktons two macrophytes two zooplanktons one benthic insect two benthic invertebrates and two fish populations the initial biomass of modeled organisms was obtained from observed data the physical and chemical parameters of aquatox have been listed in table 1 the main parameters of the model have been surveyed for primary producers and consumers in the table 2 2 3 4 the concentration of pahs based on our previous studies fan et al 2017 samples were collected at the meantime the locations of the sampling sites were shown in fig 2 and analyzed the concentrations of the pahs in water samples including acenaphthylene any acenaphene ane fluorene fle phenanthrene phe anthracene ant fluoranthene fla pyrene pyr chrysene chr benzo a anthracene baa benzo b fluoranthene bbf benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo a pyrene bap indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene ipy benzo g hi perylene bpe and dibenzo a h anthracene dba fig 5 in order to assess the ecological risk of pahs the toxic equivalency factors tefs approach proposed by nisbet and lagoy 1992 was used the concentrations of individual pahs were expressed as equivalents of benzo a pyrene bapeq and these values were added together to yield the toxicity equivalent concentration teq ibapeqi of total pahs supplemantary material table s3 supplemantary material tables s4 and s5 list the main physicochemical properties and single species toxicity data for bap respectively u s epa 2004a 2004b 2004c us epa 2006 2 4 determining pahs water contamination in organisms the teq of total pahs was modeled for this study this measure is the most useful modeling endpoint from a management perspective the teq of total pahs varied from 7 97 ng l to 201 04 ng l in water aquatox assumes pahs found in sediment are associated with detritus which is modeled in aquatox as organic matter 2 4 1 the uptake and elimination rate for macrophyte as gobas et al 1993 have shown submerged aquatic macrophytes take up and release organic chemicals over a measurable period of time at rates related to the octanol water partition coefficient uptake and elimination rates are modeled assuming that the chemical is transported through both aqueous and lipid phases in the plant with rate constants using empirical equations fit to observed data the uptake rates for macrophytes were calculated based on gobas et al 1993 the detail equation and explanation listed in supplementary material 2 4 1 2 4 2 the uptake and elimination rate for algae the combination of lipid content surface area and growth rate results in species differences in bioaccumulation factors among algae wood et al 1997 uptake of toxicants is a function of the uptake rate constant and the concentration of toxicant truly dissolved in the water and is constrained by competitive uptake by other compartments also because it is fast it is limited as it approaches equilibrium similar to sorption to detritus the uptake rates for alga were calculated based on wood et al 1997 the detail equation and explanation listed in supplementary material 2 4 2 2 4 3 the uptake and elimination rate for animals animals can absorb toxic organic chemicals directly from the water through their gills and from contaminated food through their guts when performing bioaccumulation calculations the default behavior of the aquatox model is to allow the user to enter elimination rate constants k2 for all plants and animals for a particular organic chemical k2 values may also be estimated based on the log kow of the chemical uptake in plants is a function of log kow while gill uptake in animals is a function of respiration and chemical uptake efficiency the aquatox default model works well for a wide variety of bioaccumulative organic chemicals the detail equation and explanation listed in supplementary material 2 4 3 2 5 sensitivity analysis when interpreting results of a nominal range uncertainty analysis a sensitivity statistic may be calculated such that when a 20 change in the parameter results in a 20 change in the model result the sensitivity it is calculated as 100 usepa 2004b 1 s e n s i t i v i t y r e s u l t p o s r e s u l t b a s e l i n e r e s u l t n e g r e s u l t b a s e l i n e 2 r e s u l t b a s e l i

resultneg is the averaged aquatox result for a given endpoint given a negative change in the input parameter resultbaseline is the averaged aquatox result for a given endpoint given a no change in the input parameter baseline pctchanged is the percent that the input parameter is modified in the positive and negative directions 2 6 model calibration and validation calibration of the model was performed with an experimental data set obtained under control conditions without toxicant during the one year survey period in phytoplankton and macrophyte biomass values biomass values measured on april 2015 were used as initial values for the biomass of the 12 populations time series of light intensity wind speed water temperature and ph were also used as inputs the model was run using these initial best estimates the paper also employed quantitative measures to evaluate the adequacy of the calibration and model performance two measures help answer the question how much overlap is there between data and model distributions first relative bias is a robust measure of how well central tendencies of predicted and observed results correspond a value of zero indicates that the means are the same bartell et al 1992 2 r b p r e d b a r o b s b a r s o b s where rb is the relative bias standard deviation units pred bar is the mean predicted value obs bar is the mean observed value and sobs is the standard deviation of observations second the f test is the ratio between the variance of the model output and the variance of the data a value of unity indicates that the variances are the same 3 f v a r p r e d v a r o b s where var pred is the variance of predictions var obs is the variance of observations 2 7 risk estimation particular interest to risk assessors is the biomass risk graph with comparison of biomass under control simulation without toxic which plots the probability that biomass will be reduced or increased by the perturbed simulation with toxic mauriello and park 2002 any number of organisms can be plotted simultaneously on the risk graph so that the responses of both tolerant and intolerant organisms can be analyzed if an organism increases in biomass the difference is shown as negative values in practice aquatox compares the perturbed value with the control condition for each state variable expressing the result as a percent difference mauriello and park 2002 4 d i f f e r e n c e 1 p e r t u r b e d v a l c o n t r o l v a l 100 where difference is the percent variation in biomass for a given state variable perturbedval is the value at the perturbed simulation for a given state variable units depend on state variable controlval is the value at the control simulation for given state variable 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss 16 0 to classify sampling points according to their physical chemical conditions the hierarchically agglomerative cluster method based on a minimum variance strategy using the squared euclidian distance as a dissimilarity index was chosen jongman et al 1995 differences in trophic state between sampling sites were statistically assessed using analysis of variation anova 3 results 3 1 the main biological parameters of producers and consumers in dianchi lake the biomass of each dominant population is determined by environmental conditions supplementary material table s6 population biomass and the specific physiological parameters of each population tables 3 and 4 the relevant physiological parameters were either taken from the original aquatox model 3 2 model calibration and validation the example of an established aquatox dianchi lake control simulation was provided in fig 3 the biomass for phytoplankton showed the first peaks in spring due to the observed blue greens and greens algae sharply growth in spring in spring blue greens algae rapidly increased due to their with higher optimum water temperatures and light intensity in late summer due to the diatoms with lesser requirement for optimum temperatures and the light limitation was decreased so the biomass of diatoms was increased from summer to autumn fig 6 a the increase in phytoplankton biomass led to an sharply increase in zooplankton biomass in spring then due to the dominant population was blue greens which belongs to the unedible algae so the zooplankton biomass decreased after algae bloom fig 6c the biomass for myriophyllum showed the first peak in summer due to its with higher optimum temperature while hydrilla showed the peak in autumn due to its with relatively lower optimum temperature fig 6b benthic insect biomass peaked in autumn winter fig 6d while benthic macroinvertebrate and fish biomass showed the peak in summer fig 6e and f due to the observed values of phytoplankton and macrophyte populations were obtained the monitored values for these populations were compared with the model values the results showed that the model can show the actual annual variation fig 7 therefore the aquatox dianchi model can be used in modeling the biomass annual variation of biological population the corresponding values of the indices used to estimate the quality of the outputs of the calibrated model are summarized in table 5 the value of rb is range from 0 142 to 0 331 and the value of f is range from 0 116 to 0 300 3 3 the temporal and spatial variation of pahs risk for the phytoplankton although the teq for pahs exposure concentration was varied from 7 97 to 201 04 ng l the change of biomass caused by pahs pollution without significant spatial variation moving from area i to area iv for the temporal variation diatoms and blue greens were showed the highest difference values in winter while the greens showed the highest value in summer fig 8 for one thing this can be explained by the direct toxic effect of pahs can be reduced by a sharply decrease in predatory pressure from consumers especially for the zooplankton populations for another thing this can be explained by the lake trophic state can influence air water exchange fluxes of pops berrojalbiz et al 2011 several studies carried out in lacustrine eutrophic systems revealed that pops concentration in plankton decreased with increasing biomass taylor et al 1991 berrojalbiz et al 2011 in addition the highest loss of biomass appeared in winter this was consistent with the annual biomass variation of phytoplankton which with the lowest biomass values in the winter for the myriophyllum and hydrilla for the temporal variation myriophyllum and hydrilla were showed the highest difference values in winter this can be explained by the loss of phytoplankton biomass after summer caused the light limitation was decreased especially in area i for the spatial variation myriophyllum and hydrilla were showed the highest difference values in area i fig 8 for the rotifer and copepoda the loss of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area ii followed by area iii area i and area iv for the temporal variation rotifer and copepoda were showed the highest difference values in winter the results showed that rotifer with relatively more sensitive to the pahs pollution level for rotifer the difference varied from 290 to 410 the result was showed relatively higher risk for the rotifer population fig 8 while for the chironomidae the increase of biomass caused by pahs pollution without significant change moving from area i to area iv and the highest value was appeared in winter the difference up to 100 fig 8 this can be explained by the sharply decrease of zooplankton biomass in winter caused more phytoplankton sinking into the detritus and added the food source in addition reasons for higher reduction risk difference in consumers are associated with the direct toxic effects of pahs as well as the biomagnification effect for the shrimp the loss of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area ii the difference was 0 15 followed by area iii the difference was 0 14 area i the difference was 0 12 and area iv the difference was 0 12 in autumn fig 8 this phenomenon can be explained by the direct effects of pahs play more important role in shrimp population while for the asian mud snail the increase of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area i the difference was 0 12 followed by area ii the difference was 0 092 area iii the difference was 0 082 and area iv the difference was 0 81 in autumn this phenomenon can be explained by the effects of eutrophication play more important role in asian mud snail for the carp and catfish the increase of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area ii differencecarp 9 6 followed by area iii differencecarp 4 6 and the highest difference values appeared in spring fig 8 this phenomenon can be explained by the direct effects of pahs play more important role in fish populations with the increase of phytoplankton biomass in spring the biomass dilution effect also plays an important role for the fish populations risk assessment showed that rotifer and chironomidae populations showed more sensitive for pahs pollution for rotifer the loss of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area ii followed by area iii area i and area iv for the temporal variation it was showed the highest difference values in winter due to the loss of biomass for rotifer while the biomass of chironomidae was increased and the highest difference appeared in winter the difference up to 100 the model was effective in estimating the indirect ecological effects of competition prey predatory or other effects passed through the foodweb in additional the risk can change according to the temporal variation for dianchi lake more attention should be pay in winter for the pollutants management 4 discussion 4 1 the extrapolation to other eutrophication lakes over the last several decades the widespread impacts from industrialization and urbanization that caused lakes eutrophication have been increasingly recognized as a global challenge swallow et al 2009 in particular rapid socioeconomic development in china has transformed many clear lakes into eutrophic lakes wu et al 2012 according to the 2016 china environmental status bulletin nearly 90 of monitored lakes were showed in trophic conditions ministry of environment protection of the people s republic of china mep 2016 for example yilong lake hulun lake xingyun lake and dianchi lake were belonged to the hypereutrophic lake in additional pahs have been extensively investigated in china s lake ecosystem according to the study of liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 and other studies the highest concentration of pahs in surface water was found in taihu lake from 238 to 7422 ng l zhang et al 2011 followed by dianchi lake from 1711 89 ng l to 3455 36 ng l this study baiyangdian lake from 145 10 to 1311 59 ng l liu et al 2010 and chaohu lake 170 7 70 8 ng l qin et al 2014 these findings are not surprising because these lakes located in southeastern north and eastern china are adjacent to large cities and receiving significant local inputs of urban runoff and sewage discharge in additional the major source for the pahs is the domestic combustion of coal and biomass therefore the aquatox model can be extrapolated to the other highly impacted lake ecosystems in china 4 2 sensitivity analysis for producers diatoms and greens annual biomass production was primarily affected by its sedimentation rate sr values srdiatoms 26 5 and srgreens 5 24 while the blue greens was mainly influenced by mortality coefficient mc values mcblue greens 0 153 myriophyllum population annual biomass production was primarily affected by its optimum temperature otmyriophyllum 14 6 and mc mcmyriophyllum 4 02 values hydrilla population was primarily affected by its ot othydrilla 151 00 and maximum temperature mt mthydrilla 9 99 values supplementary material table s7 for consumers rotifer and copepoda production was primarily affected by its ot otrotifer 32 9 otcopepod 1 34 respiration rate rr rrrotifer 22 60 rrcopepod 0 787 and mt mtrotifer 2 08 mtcopepod 0 104 values results obtained for the zooplankton population suggest that the rotifer was more sensitive to the environmental change chironomidae population annual production was affected by its rr rrchironomidae 3 9 ot otchironomidae 3 12 and rotifer ot otrotifer 0 746 values shrimp and asian mud snail were primarily affected by shrimp ot otshrimp 2 11 and asian mud snail rr rasian mud snail 1 02 respectively carp and catfish annual production was primarily affected by them ot otcarp 0 369 otcatfish 1 16 values supplementary material table s7 thus results obtained for the biological populations suggest that most of the populations were very sensitive to parameters related to temperature and respiration rate except the phytoplankton populations in additional within this report the top 10 most sensitive variables out of all variables tested in a simulation are shown in each tornado diagram the diagrams suggest that both direct and indirect components can influence the annual production for example chironomidae carp and catfish annual production were influenced by rotifer ot copepod min adaptation temperature and so on supplementary material table s7 compared with the former studies temperature and respiration rate are the sensitive factors for example an aquatox model was developed for landscape lake in tianjin through the result of sensitivity analysis indicated that the model is highly sensitive to the optimal temperature maximum photosynthetic rate and respiration rate niu et al 2016 for another study the aquatox model has been applied in the artificial streams which located in the pilot rivers facilities of total petrochemicals company lacq france the sensitivity analysis showed that the model was highly sensitive to the parameters related to the temperature limitation maximum rate of photosynthesis of producers and consumption by consumers sourisseau et al 2008 therefore it is very consistent with the result of our study 4 3 rotifer as ecological indicator in eutrophication lake for zooplankton as the primary consumer which is plays an important role in energy transfer between phytoplankton and higher trophic levels sipaúba tavares and rocha 2003 while in human disturbance ecosystem the abundance of cladocera rotifera and cyclopoida is increase among zooplankton rotifer is usually as a kind of useful indicator in water quality biomonitoring gannon and stemberger 1978 sládecek 1983 kuczynski 1987 marneffe et al 1997 1998 duggan et al 2001 thereinto trophic state is related to the distribution of rotifer communities kaushik and saksena 1995 for example costa et al 2016 verified that the rotifer filinia opoliensis as a possible bioindicator of environmental quality in the pará river brazil indeed the rapid turnover rate of rotifer populations allows them to contribute significantly to nutrient recycling in aquatic ecosystems sládecek 1983 in additional rotifer strongly compete with microcrustacean zooplankters for food gilbert 1985 and serve as prey for other rotifers gilbert and stemberger 1985 cyclopoid and calanoid copepods williamson 1983 insect larvae moore and gilbert 1987 and fish o brien 1979 this is consistent with the result of our study under pahs pollution simulation the biomass of rotifer and copepoda were showed rapidly decrease in winter while the biomass of chironomidae with rapidly increase in winter and the rotifer showed the most sensitive to pahs pollution level so in further study the rotifer can be applied in the biomonitoring of pahs pollution 4 4 compared the traditional method with model method for ecological risk assessment of pahs according to the study of zhao et al 2014 the toxic equivalency factor tef method has been applied to evaluate the potential toxicity of pahs in the sediment of dianchi lake the results was indicated that the mean σpahs in sediment was below the effect range low erl value suggesting that adverse biological toxicity effects would occur rarely in most area the other study conducted by li et al 2013 applied hazard ratio method to assess the ecological risk for pahs the results showed that the potential ecological risk may be existed in dianchi lake while for the results of our study it was showed high risk for some populations the explanation may be that the traditional ecological risk assessment method only considering the direct toxicity effects but the indirect ecological effects without included in assessment process while the aquatox model can incorporate ecotoxicology effects due to chemical exposure at the individual level to predict the impact at an ecosystem level including the direct toxicity effects and indirect ecological effects pass through the foodweb the different scenarios highlighted that the toxic effects of chemicals on ecosystem communities cannot be predicted from conventional method namely rq method the toxic effects of chemicals can also be moderated by compensating ecological processes some populations can benefit from the increasing of exposure level in the lake ecological processes such as competition predator prey interactions and diet changes can lead to unexpected response of communities to the input of chemicals lombardo et al 2015 for example in area ⅱ primary producer population benefit from a reduction in grazing pressure following the decline of some predators despite the exposure level increased fig 7 indirect effects can both exacerbate or compensate for direct toxicity lombardo et al 2015 according to the lombardo et al 2015 studies the result also showed that the indirect effects due to competition for food sources and predation can lead to responses in biomass density of the same magnitude as those caused by direct toxicity in additional compared the concentration of area ⅱ with area ⅳ although the exposure concentration decrease the difference of a 20 reduction in diatoms and greens without significant variation this is can be explained by the top down control in dianchi lake the importance of top down control and bottom up control in structuring lake ecosystems and the complexity of the resulting food web dynamics is well known by ecologists ulanowicz 2010 it has also been established that indirect ecological interactions that can profoundly alter aquatic ecosystems can be trigged by human activities pace et al 1999 such as nutrient enrichment folke et al 2004 therefore individual level effects derived from laboratory studies for most sensitive species e g 5 of a species sensitivity distribution cannot be translated to concentrations at which only 5 species are affected in a natural community lombardo et al 2015 through the results we can conclude that in eutrophication lake ecosystem pahs risk estimate results need to contain the indirect ecological effects which passed through foodweb our study was showed that with the increase in pahs concentration and eutrophication level the ecosystem triggers both direct negative effect on the biomass of model compartments as well as complex indirect effects due to competition or predator prey interactions fig 7 such indirect effects sometimes counter intuitively outweigh the negative effect due to the present of a toxic chemical for example the biomass of phytoplankton increase due to a release from grazing pressure and zooplankton increase due to the higher abundance of its phytoplankton prey lombardo et al 2015 5 conclusions the paper performed field sampling sensitivity analysis calibration and validation analysis and risk assessment for 15 kinds of pahs in the dianchi lake based on the measured data from the different area in dianchi lake we analyzed the characteristics of the 12 biological populations and 15 kinds of pahs the endpoint from a management perspective of pahs in the dianchi lake was assessed according to the teq method and the ecological risk assessment was assessed with the aquatox model the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 1 the teq for pahs exposure concentration in water was varied from 7 97 to 201 04 ng l the highest teq was showed in area ii followed by area iii area i and area iv 2 sensitivity analysis results suggest that most of the populations were very sensitive to parameters related to temperature and respiration rate except the phytoplankton populations and both direct and indirect components can influence the annual production of biological populations 3 calibration and validation analysis results showed that the model performance showed it could portray the effects of ecological interactions reproducing complex seasonal biomass behavior that reasonably represented reported general seasonal patterns in dianchi lake and the value of rb is range from 0 142 to 0 331 and the value of f is range from 0 116 to 0 300 4 risk assessment showed that rotifer and chironomidae populations showed more sensitive for pahs pollution for rotifer the loss of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area ii followed by area iii area i and area iv for the temporal variation it was showed the highest difference values in winter due to the loss of biomass for rotifer while the biomass of chironomidae was increased and the highest difference appeared in winter the difference up to 100 5 the model was effective in estimating the indirect ecological effects of competition prey predatory or other effects passed through the foodweb acknowledgements this study was

25173,to evaluate the direct toxic effects and indirect ecological effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in a plateau eutrophication lake ecosystem we built aquatox model that focus on the interaction among phytoplankton zooplankton macrobenthos and fish populations the aquatox model was first implemented using 12 pelagic benthic populations came from monitoring data obtained in 20 sampling sites at dianchi lake between april 2015 and january 2016 at the meantime pahs concentration was simultaneously investigated in surface water according to the characteristics of trophic state all of sampling sites can be subdivided into four areas 1 area i algae dense area 2 area ii aquatic organism protection area 3 area iii littoral zone damaged area 4 and area iv ecosystem recovery area the result of sensitivity analysis showed that most of populations were very sensitive to optimal temperature and respiration rate through calibration and validation analysis the value of rb is range from 0 142 to 0 331 and the value of f is range from 0 116 to 0 300 which indicated that the model can describe the seasonal variation of 12 dominant populations in dianchi lake risk assessment showed that rotifer and chironomidae populations showed more sensitive for pahs pollution for the rotifer and copepoda the loss of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area ii followed by area iii area i and area iv for the temporal variation rotifer and copepoda were showed the highest difference values in winter in additional the risk can change according to the temporal variation for dianchi lake more attention should be pay in winter for the pollutants management the model was effective in estimating the indirect ecological effects of competition prey predatory biomass dilution or other effects passed through the foodweb therefore our study showed that the importance of ecosystem level studies to predict the ecological risk of pollutants keywords aquatox model indirect ecological effects polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs eutrophication dianchi lake 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a group of persistent organic pollutants that are aromatic hydrocarbons with two or more fused benzene rings haritash and kaushik 2009 pahs are colorless white pale yellow solids with low solubility in water high melting and boiling points and low vapour pressure clar 1964 the common sources of pahs in environment can be subdivided into natural process and anthropogenic activities haritash and kaushik 2006 at present sixteen pahs compounds have been recommended as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency usepa hu et al 2017 thereinto according to the international agency for research on cancer seven of them which include benz a anthrance chrysene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene indo 1 2 2 cd pyrene and dibenzo a h anthracene are potentially carcinogenic to humans zheng et al 2016 in addition owing to their low solubility and hydrophobic nature pahs tend to be associated with fine particles are introduced into lakes and seas by runoff and atmospheric fallout liu et al 2007 mouhri et al 2008 then seas or lakes often act as a trap for pahs das et al 2008 jiao et al 2009 pietzsch et al 2010 therefore it is very important to certain the pollution level and evaluate the ecological risk assessment of pahs in lakes or seas due to it can provide important information on environmental management meyer et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 zheng et al 2016 traditional ecological risk assessment era based on chemical analysis and biological toxicity tests in a single species to toxicant exposure clements and kiffney 1994 lei et al 2008 namely risk quotient rq method the approach is logical transparent and easily applied but it unfortunately lacks ecological realism for example it does not consider the actual populations composition of ecosystems it is based on the ecotoxicological studies performed in the laboratory under standard constant conditions that have little in common with natural habitats lombardo et al 2015 in additional the extrapolation of standard toxicity tests to assess ecological risk results in an assessment endpoint at the level of individual organisms while only simplistic assessment factors account for the large uncertainties associated with population community and ecosystem level dynamics lombardo et al 2015 and the method was failure to incorporate the indirect effects into risk assessment although the indirect effects of chemicals may be a significant factor influencing the effects in which community or ecosystem level respond to chemicals many experiments show that indirect effects can be greater than direct effects at the community level lampert et al 1989 prosnier et al 2015 at present indirect effects in ecological communities complex relationships involving three or more species recently have been pay more and more attention preston 2002 liebig et al 2008 prosnier et al 2015 although ecotoxicologists have long recognized the potential importance of indirect effects of chemicals these effects have remained understudied and not thoroughly incorporated into ecological risk assessment clements and rohr 2009 at present community ecology theory has been proposed as a framework for predicting indirect effects of contaminants to facilitate their integration into ecological risk assessment rohr et al 2006 except the indirect effects the eu scientific committees for risk assessments affirmed that current risk assessment methods give poor predictions of impact on the structure and function of ecosystems scenihr 2012 therefore there is a need for new tools to be developed and applied which account for the complexity of communities and ecosystems to address different aspects of ecological realism ecological models can be applied at the individual population community and ecosystem level park et al 2008 such as the littoral ecosystem risk assessment model leram hanratty and liber 1996 casm suwa naito et al 2002 and aquatox park and clough 2004 thereinto the aquatox is the most comprehensive of the general ecological risk models presently available it is not only considering the direct toxic effects of chemicals but also containing the indirect effects of pollutants passed through foodwebs zhang et al 2013 the model has been widely applied by researchers in streams ponds lakes estuaries reservoirs and experimental enclosures rashleigh 2003 park et al 2005 rashleigh 2007 sourisseau et al 2008 mcknight et al 2010 wang et al 2012a b however the aquatox model has not been applied to assess the ecological risk of chemicals in the plateau eutrophication lakes before dianchi lake is the largest plateau lake also as one of the three most hypereutrophic lakes in china it is characterized by extremely high concentrations of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp in the water column and annual algae blooms wu et al 2017 previous studies showed pahs were detected in the sediments and pelagic and benthic organisms for dianchi lake fan et al 2017 considering the direct and indirect effects of pahs may pose an unacceptable risk to aquatic organisms wildlife and humans zheng et al 2016 it is need to assess the direct and indirect effects of pahs in the plateau eutrophication lakes until now the comprehensive ecological risk of pahs in the dianchi lake has not previously been considered in additional the trophic state can change the ecological risk of chemicals by the variation of food web in eutrophication lake ecosystem wang et al 2012a b therefore the aims of this study were to 1 develop aquatox dianchi based on field data from dianchi lake 2 determine a parameter data set suitable to monitor the biomass seasonal variation of dominant populations while identifying model output sensitivity to parameter values 3 calculate the spatial and temporal variation of ecological risks relating to pahs contamination in natural hypereutrophic lake ecosystem as far as it can be determined this study was the first published account of an aquatox application in an algae dominated hypereutrophic plateau lake the model not only contained the direct toxic effects but also contained the indirect ecological effects of pahs and eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 the analysis procedure of the study the procedure of the ecological risk assessment for pahs by aquatox model can be subdivided into seven steps fig 1 1 conduct the field sampling including biological sampling and water sampling 2 establish the foodweb conceptual model of the dianchi lake 3 establish the aquatox dianchi lake model 4 aquatox model sensitivity analysis 5 model calibration and validation 6 compare the biomass change of dominate populations on control situation and perturb situation 7 calculate the ecological risk of pahs 2 2 the physical chemical and biological characteristics of the dianchi lake 2 2 1 the physical chemical characteristics dianchi lake lat 24 29 n to 25 28 n long 102 29 e to 103 01 e is the largest plateau lake covers an area of approximately 309 km2 locates in yunnan province southwestern china the altitude of the lake is about 1886 m the average depth is 4 40 m and the maximum depth is 8 00 m therefore the dianchi lake belongs to plateau shallow lake the total length of the lake is about 41 20 km the average width of the lake is about 7 56 km and the water volume is about 15 93 108 m3 during the past several decades due to the rapid population growth and economic development in the dianchi basin this region suffered from highly anthropogenic disturbances the water quality of the lake has deteriorated since late 1970s especially in the 1990s since 2010s although the nutrients have been under control eutrophication was still the main problem twenty sampling sites were included in this study fig 2 according to the characteristics of trophic state all of sampling sites can be subdivided into four areas supplementary material table s1 1 area i algae dense area 2 area ii aquatic organism protection area 3 area iii littoral zone damaged area and 4 area iv ecosystem recovery area sampling dates were selected depending on seasonal change water samplings were collected in april 2015 july 2015 october 2015 and january 2016 as shown in supplementary material table s1 dianchi lake has been designated hypereutrophic 2 2 2 the biological characteristics for the dominant populations through field sampling the dianchi lake ecosystem can be divided into 12 populations including diatoms greens blue greens myriophyllum hydrilla rotifer copepoda chironomidae shrimp asian mud snail carp and catfish populations the sample collection methods for biological populations were provided by zhang and liu 2014 2 3 aquatox model and parameterization 2 3 1 the conceptual model for aquatox model aquatox simulates the transfer of biomass and chemicals from one compartment of the ecosystem to another it does this by simultaneously computing important chemical and biological processes over time aquatox simulates multiple environmental stressors including nutrients organic loadings sediments toxic chemicals and temperature and their effects on the algal macrophyte invertebrate and fish communities aquatox can help identify and understand the cause and effect relationships between chemical water quality the physical environment and aquatic life fig 3 the basic equations used in aquatox to simulate the change of daily biomass in each population are briefly described in supplementary material table s2 detailed descriptions of the equations used in the model can be found at the following web link http water epa gov scitech datait models aquatox data cfm 2 3 2 the food web model for aquatox model the original version of aquatox rel 3 1 was adapted to the food web structure and the environmental conditions of dianchi lake the benthic pelagic coupling food web structure of aquatox dianchi was provided in fig 4 each box or circle represents one model population or nonliving ecosystem component and arrows denote the flow of energy or biomass 2 3 3 the parameters for aquatox model the dianchi lake foodweb includes three phytoplanktons two macrophytes two zooplanktons one benthic insect two benthic invertebrates and two fish populations the initial biomass of modeled organisms was obtained from observed data the physical and chemical parameters of aquatox have been listed in table 1 the main parameters of the model have been surveyed for primary producers and consumers in the table 2 2 3 4 the concentration of pahs based on our previous studies fan et al 2017 samples were collected at the meantime the locations of the sampling sites were shown in fig 2 and analyzed the concentrations of the pahs in water samples including acenaphthylene any acenaphene ane fluorene fle phenanthrene phe anthracene ant fluoranthene fla pyrene pyr chrysene chr benzo a anthracene baa benzo b fluoranthene bbf benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo a pyrene bap indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene ipy benzo g hi perylene bpe and dibenzo a h anthracene dba fig 5 in order to assess the ecological risk of pahs the toxic equivalency factors tefs approach proposed by nisbet and lagoy 1992 was used the concentrations of individual pahs were expressed as equivalents of benzo a pyrene bapeq and these values were added together to yield the toxicity equivalent concentration teq ibapeqi of total pahs supplemantary material table s3 supplemantary material tables s4 and s5 list the main physicochemical properties and single species toxicity data for bap respectively u s epa 2004a 2004b 2004c us epa 2006 2 4 determining pahs water contamination in organisms the teq of total pahs was modeled for this study this measure is the most useful modeling endpoint from a management perspective the teq of total pahs varied from 7 97 ng l to 201 04 ng l in water aquatox assumes pahs found in sediment are associated with detritus which is modeled in aquatox as organic matter 2 4 1 the uptake and elimination rate for macrophyte as gobas et al 1993 have shown submerged aquatic macrophytes take up and release organic chemicals over a measurable period of time at rates related to the octanol water partition coefficient uptake and elimination rates are modeled assuming that the chemical is transported through both aqueous and lipid phases in the plant with rate constants using empirical equations fit to observed data the uptake rates for macrophytes were calculated based on gobas et al 1993 the detail equation and explanation listed in supplementary material 2 4 1 2 4 2 the uptake and elimination rate for algae the combination of lipid content surface area and growth rate results in species differences in bioaccumulation factors among algae wood et al 1997 uptake of toxicants is a function of the uptake rate constant and the concentration of toxicant truly dissolved in the water and is constrained by competitive uptake by other compartments also because it is fast it is limited as it approaches equilibrium similar to sorption to detritus the uptake rates for alga were calculated based on wood et al 1997 the detail equation and explanation listed in supplementary material 2 4 2 2 4 3 the uptake and elimination rate for animals animals can absorb toxic organic chemicals directly from the water through their gills and from contaminated food through their guts when performing bioaccumulation calculations the default behavior of the aquatox model is to allow the user to enter elimination rate constants k2 for all plants and animals for a particular organic chemical k2 values may also be estimated based on the log kow of the chemical uptake in plants is a function of log kow while gill uptake in animals is a function of respiration and chemical uptake efficiency the aquatox default model works well for a wide variety of bioaccumulative organic chemicals the detail equation and explanation listed in supplementary material 2 4 3 2 5 sensitivity analysis when interpreting results of a nominal range uncertainty analysis a sensitivity statistic may be calculated such that when a 20 change in the parameter results in a 20 change in the model result the sensitivity it is calculated as 100 usepa 2004b 1 s e n s i t i v i t y r e s u l t p o s r e s u l t b a s e l i n e r e s u l t n e g r e s u l t b a s e l i n e 2 r e s u l t b a s e l i

resultneg is the averaged aquatox result for a given endpoint given a negative change in the input parameter resultbaseline is the averaged aquatox result for a given endpoint given a no change in the input parameter baseline pctchanged is the percent that the input parameter is modified in the positive and negative directions 2 6 model calibration and validation calibration of the model was performed with an experimental data set obtained under control conditions without toxicant during the one year survey period in phytoplankton and macrophyte biomass values biomass values measured on april 2015 were used as initial values for the biomass of the 12 populations time series of light intensity wind speed water temperature and ph were also used as inputs the model was run using these initial best estimates the paper also employed quantitative measures to evaluate the adequacy of the calibration and model performance two measures help answer the question how much overlap is there between data and model distributions first relative bias is a robust measure of how well central tendencies of predicted and observed results correspond a value of zero indicates that the means are the same bartell et al 1992 2 r b p r e d b a r o b s b a r s o b s where rb is the relative bias standard deviation units pred bar is the mean predicted value obs bar is the mean observed value and sobs is the standard deviation of observations second the f test is the ratio between the variance of the model output and the variance of the data a value of unity indicates that the variances are the same 3 f v a r p r e d v a r o b s where var pred is the variance of predictions var obs is the variance of observations 2 7 risk estimation particular interest to risk assessors is the biomass risk graph with comparison of biomass under control simulation without toxic which plots the probability that biomass will be reduced or increased by the perturbed simulation with toxic mauriello and park 2002 any number of organisms can be plotted simultaneously on the risk graph so that the responses of both tolerant and intolerant organisms can be analyzed if an organism increases in biomass the difference is shown as negative values in practice aquatox compares the perturbed value with the control condition for each state variable expressing the result as a percent difference mauriello

was performed using spss 16 0 to classify sampling points according to their physical chemical conditions the hierarchically agglomerative cluster method based on a minimum variance strategy using the squared euclidian distance as a dissimilarity index was chosen jongman et al 1995 differences in trophic state between sampling sites were statistically assessed using analysis of variation anova 3 results 3 1 the main biological parameters of producers and consumers in dianchi lake the biomass of each dominant population is determined by environmental conditions supplementary material table s6 population biomass and the specific physiological parameters of each population tables 3 and 4 the relevant physiological parameters were either taken from the original aquatox model 3 2 model calibration and validation the example of an established aquatox dianchi lake control simulation was provided in fig 3 the biomass for phytoplankton showed the first peaks in spring due to the observed blue greens and greens algae sharply growth in spring in spring blue greens algae rapidly increased due to their with higher optimum water temperatures and light intensity in late summer due to the diatoms with lesser requirement for optimum temperatures and the light limitation was decreased so the biomass of diatoms was increased from summer to autumn fig 6 a the increase in phytoplankton biomass led to an sharply increase in zooplankton biomass in spring then due to the dominant population was blue greens which belongs to the unedible algae so the zooplankton biomass decreased after algae bloom fig 6c the biomass for myriophyllum showed the first peak in summer due to its with higher optimum temperature while hydrilla showed the peak in autumn due to its with relatively lower optimum temperature fig 6b benthic insect biomass peaked in autumn winter fig 6d while benthic macroinvertebrate and fish biomass showed the peak in summer fig 6e and f due to the observed values of phytoplankton and macrophyte populations were obtained the monitored values for these populations were compared with the model values the results showed that the model can show the actual annual variation fig 7 therefore the aquatox dianchi model can be used in modeling the biomass annual variation of biological population the corresponding values of the indices used to estimate the quality of the outputs of the calibrated model are summarized in table 5 the value of rb is range from 0 142 to 0 331 and the value of f is range from 0 116 to 0 300 3 3 the temporal and spatial variation of pahs risk for the phytoplankton although the teq for pahs exposure concentration was varied from 7 97 to 201 04 ng l the change of biomass caused by pahs pollution without significant spatial variation moving from area i to area iv for the temporal variation diatoms and blue greens were showed the highest difference values in winter while the greens showed the highest value in summer fig 8 for one thing this can be explained by the direct toxic effect of pahs can be reduced by a sharply decrease in predatory pressure from consumers especially for the zooplankton populations for another thing this can be explained by the lake trophic state can influence air water exchange fluxes of pops berrojalbiz et al 2011 several studies carried out in lacustrine eutrophic systems revealed that pops concentration in plankton decreased with increasing biomass taylor et al 1991 berrojalbiz et al 2011 in addition the highest loss of biomass appeared in winter this was consistent with the annual biomass variation of phytoplankton which with the lowest biomass values in the winter for the myriophyllum and hydrilla for the temporal variation myriophyllum and hydrilla were showed the highest difference values in winter this can be explained by the loss of phytoplankton biomass after summer caused the light limitation was decreased especially in area i for the spatial variation myriophyllum and hydrilla were showed the highest difference values in area i fig 8 for the rotifer and copepoda the loss of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area ii followed by area iii area i and area iv for the temporal variation rotifer and copepoda were showed the highest difference values in winter the results showed that rotifer with relatively more sensitive to the pahs pollution level for rotifer the difference varied from 290 to 410 the result was showed relatively higher risk for the rotifer population fig 8 while for the chironomidae the increase of biomass caused by pahs pollution without significant change moving from area i to area iv and the highest value was appeared in winter the difference up to 100 fig 8 this can be explained by the sharply decrease of zooplankton biomass in winter caused more phytoplankton sinking into the detritus and added the food source in addition reasons for higher reduction risk difference in consumers are associated with the direct toxic effects of pahs as well as the biomagnification effect for the shrimp the loss of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area ii the difference was 0 15 followed by area iii the difference was 0 14 area i the difference was 0 12 and area iv the difference was 0 12 in autumn fig 8 this phenomenon can be explained by the direct effects of pahs play more important role in shrimp population while for the asian mud snail the increase of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area i the difference was 0 12 followed by area ii the difference was 0 092 area iii the difference was 0 082 and area iv the difference was 0 81 in autumn this phenomenon can be explained by the effects of eutrophication play more important role in asian mud snail for the carp and catfish the increase of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area ii differencecarp 9 6 followed by area iii differencecarp 4 6 and the highest difference values appeared in spring fig 8 this phenomenon can be explained by the direct effects of pahs play more important role in fish populations with the increase of phytoplankton biomass in spring the biomass dilution effect also plays an important role for the fish populations risk assessment showed that rotifer and chironomidae populations showed more sensitive for pahs pollution for rotifer the loss of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area ii followed by area iii area i and area iv for the temporal variation it was showed the highest difference values in winter due to the loss of biomass for rotifer while the biomass of chironomidae was increased and the highest difference appeared in winter the difference up to 100 the model was effective in estimating the indirect ecological effects of competition prey predatory or other effects passed through the foodweb in additional the risk can change according to the temporal variation for dianchi lake more attention should be pay in winter for the pollutants management 4 discussion 4 1 the extrapolation to other eutrophication lakes over the last several decades the widespread impacts from industrialization and urbanization that caused lakes eutrophication have been increasingly recognized as a global challenge swallow et al 2009 in particular rapid socioeconomic development in china has transformed many clear lakes into eutrophic lakes wu et al 2012 according to the 2016 china environmental status bulletin nearly 90 of monitored lakes were showed in trophic conditions ministry of environment protection of the people s republic of china mep 2016 for example yilong lake hulun lake xingyun lake and dianchi lake were belonged to the hypereutrophic lake in additional pahs have been extensively investigated in china s lake ecosystem according to the study of liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 and other studies the highest concentration of pahs in surface water was found in taihu lake from 238 to 7422 ng l zhang et al 2011 followed by dianchi lake from 1711 89 ng l to 3455 36 ng l this study baiyangdian lake from 145 10 to 1311 59 ng l liu et al 2010 and chaohu lake 170 7 70 8 ng l qin et al 2014 these findings are not surprising because these lakes located in southeastern north and eastern china are adjacent to large cities and receiving significant local inputs of urban runoff and sewage discharge in additional the major source for the pahs is the domestic combustion of coal and biomass therefore the aquatox model can be extrapolated to the other highly impacted lake ecosystems in china 4 2 sensitivity analysis for producers diatoms and greens annual biomass production was primarily affected by its sedimentation rate sr values srdiatoms 26 5 and srgreens 5 24 while the blue greens was mainly influenced by mortality coefficient mc values mcblue greens 0 153 myriophyllum population annual biomass production was primarily affected by its optimum temperature otmyriophyllum 14 6 and mc mcmyriophyllum 4 02 values hydrilla population was primarily affected by its ot othydrilla 151 00 and maximum temperature mt mthydrilla 9 99 values supplementary material table s7 for consumers rotifer and copepoda production was primarily affected by its ot otrotifer 32 9 otcopepod 1 34 respiration rate rr rrrotifer 22 60 rrcopepod 0 787 and mt mtrotifer 2 08 mtcopepod 0 104 values results obtained for the zooplankton population suggest that the rotifer was more sensitive to the environmental change chironomidae population annual production was affected by its rr rrchironomidae 3 9 ot otchironomidae 3 12 and rotifer ot otrotifer 0 746 values shrimp and asian mud snail were primarily affected by shrimp ot otshrimp 2 11 and asian mud snail rr rasian mud snail 1 02 respectively carp and catfish annual production was primarily affected by them ot otcarp 0 369 otcatfish 1 16 values supplementary material table s7 thus results obtained for the biological populations suggest that most of the populations were very sensitive to parameters related to temperature and respiration rate except the phytoplankton populations in additional within this report the top 10 most sensitive variables out of all variables tested in a simulation are shown in each tornado diagram the diagrams suggest that both direct and indirect components can influence the annual production for example chironomidae carp and catfish annual production were influenced by rotifer ot copepod min adaptation temperature and so on supplementary material table s7 compared with the former studies temperature and respiration rate are the sensitive factors for example an aquatox model was developed for landscape lake in tianjin through the result of sensitivity analysis indicated that the model is highly sensitive to the optimal temperature maximum photosynthetic rate and respiration rate niu et al 2016 for another study the aquatox model has been applied in the artificial streams which located in the pilot rivers facilities of total petrochemicals company lacq france the sensitivity analysis showed that the model was highly sensitive to the parameters related to the temperature limitation maximum rate of photosynthesis of producers and consumption by consumers sourisseau et al 2008 therefore it is very consistent with the result of our study 4 3 rotifer as ecological indicator in eutrophication lake for zooplankton as the primary consumer which is plays an important role in energy transfer between phytoplankton and higher trophic levels sipaúba tavares and rocha 2003 while in human disturbance ecosystem the abundance of cladocera rotifera and cyclopoida is increase among zooplankton rotifer is usually as a kind of useful indicator in water quality biomonitoring gannon and stemberger 1978 sládecek 1983 kuczynski 1987 marneffe et al 1997 1998 duggan et al 2001 thereinto trophic state is related to the distribution of rotifer communities kaushik and saksena 1995 for example costa et al 2016 verified that the rotifer filinia opoliensis as a possible bioindicator of environmental quality in the pará river brazil indeed the rapid turnover rate of rotifer populations allows them to contribute significantly to nutrient recycling in aquatic ecosystems sládecek 1983 in additional rotifer strongly compete with microcrustacean zooplankters for food gilbert 1985 and serve as prey for other rotifers gilbert and stemberger 1985 cyclopoid and calanoid copepods williamson 1983 insect larvae moore and gilbert 1987 and fish o brien 1979 this is consistent with the result of our study under pahs pollution simulation the biomass of rotifer and copepoda were showed rapidly decrease in winter while the biomass of chironomidae with rapidly increase in winter and the rotifer showed the most sensitive to pahs pollution level so in further study the rotifer can be applied in the biomonitoring of pahs pollution 4 4 compared the traditional method with model method for ecological risk assessment of pahs according to the study of zhao et al 2014 the toxic equivalency factor tef method has been applied to evaluate the potential toxicity of pahs in the sediment of dianchi lake the results was indicated that the mean σpahs in sediment was below the effect range low erl value suggesting that adverse biological toxicity effects would occur rarely in most area the other study conducted by li et al 2013 applied hazard ratio method to assess the ecological risk for pahs the results showed that the potential ecological risk may be existed in dianchi lake while for the results of our study it was showed high risk for some populations the explanation may be that the traditional ecological risk assessment method only considering the direct toxicity effects but the indirect ecological effects without included in assessment process while the aquatox model can incorporate ecotoxicology effects due to chemical exposure at the individual level to predict the impact at an ecosystem level including the direct toxicity effects and indirect ecological effects pass through the foodweb the different scenarios highlighted that the toxic effects of chemicals on ecosystem communities cannot be predicted from conventional method namely rq method the toxic effects of chemicals can also be moderated by compensating ecological processes some populations can benefit from the increasing of exposure level in the lake ecological processes such as competition predator prey interactions and diet changes can lead to unexpected response of communities to the input of chemicals lombardo et al 2015 for example in area ⅱ primary producer population benefit from a reduction in grazing pressure following the decline of some predators despite the exposure level increased fig 7 indirect effects can both exacerbate or compensate for direct toxicity lombardo et al 2015 according to the lombardo et al 2015 studies the result also showed that the indirect effects due to competition for food sources and predation can lead to responses in biomass density of the same magnitude as those caused by direct toxicity in additional compared the concentration of area ⅱ with area ⅳ although the exposure concentration decrease the difference of a 20 reduction in diatoms and greens without significant variation this is can be explained by the top down control in dianchi lake the importance of top down control and bottom up control in structuring lake ecosystems and the complexity of the resulting food web dynamics is well known by ecologists ulanowicz 2010 it has also been established that indirect ecological interactions that can profoundly alter aquatic ecosystems can be trigged by human activities pace et al 1999 such as nutrient enrichment folke et al 2004 therefore individual level effects derived from laboratory studies for most sensitive species e g 5 of a species sensitivity distribution cannot be translated to concentrations at which only 5 species are affected in a natural community lombardo et al 2015 through the results we can conclude that in eutrophication lake ecosystem pahs risk estimate results need to contain the indirect ecological effects which passed through foodweb our study was showed that with the increase in pahs concentration and eutrophication level the ecosystem triggers both direct negative effect on the biomass of model compartments as well as complex indirect effects due to competition or predator prey interactions fig 7 such indirect effects sometimes counter intuitively outweigh the negative effect due to the present of a toxic chemical for example the biomass of phytoplankton increase due to a release from grazing pressure and zooplankton increase due to the higher abundance of its phytoplankton prey lombardo et al 2015 5 conclusions the paper performed field sampling sensitivity analysis calibration and validation analysis and risk assessment for 15 kinds of pahs in the dianchi lake based on the measured data from the different area in dianchi lake we analyzed the characteristics of the 12 biological populations and 15 kinds of pahs the endpoint from a management perspective of pahs in the dianchi lake was assessed according to the teq method and the ecological risk assessment was assessed with the aquatox model the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 1 the teq for pahs exposure concentration in water was varied from 7 97 to 201 04 ng l the highest teq was showed in area ii followed by area iii area i and area iv 2 sensitivity analysis results suggest that most of the populations were very sensitive to parameters related to temperature and respiration rate except the phytoplankton populations and both direct and indirect components can influence the annual production of biological populations 3 calibration and validation analysis results showed that the model performance showed it could portray the effects of ecological interactions reproducing complex seasonal biomass behavior that reasonably represented reported general seasonal patterns in dianchi lake and the value of rb is range from 0 142 to 0 331 and the value of f is range from 0 116 to 0 300 4 risk assessment showed that rotifer and chironomidae populations showed more sensitive for pahs pollution for rotifer the loss of biomass caused by pahs pollution was showed the highest value in area ii followed by area iii area i and area iv for the temporal variation it was showed the highest difference values in winter due to the loss of biomass for rotifer while the biomass of chironomidae was increased and the highest difference appeared in winter the difference up to 100 5 the model was effective in estimating the indirect ecological effects of competition prey predatory or other effects passed through the foodweb acknowledgements this study was

25174,microalgal biomass is currently recognized as a promising sustainable source for biofuel production and carbon dioxide co2 sequestration utilization of biophysical models are emerging to access the real time feasibility of microalgal technology in this present work a comprehensive mathematical model based on the site specific meteorological variables is formulated using matlab ode 45 s solver to estimate the microalgal productivity the predictive model framework utilized material balance equations with basic laws of physics known constants and conservative assumptions to evaluate the water temperature that influences the microalgal viability the dynamic behaviour of algal ponds considering the operating variables like light intensity including the effects of photoinhibition water temperature and design criteria like pond depth microalgal concentration was used to estimate the performance of t pseudonana in open ponds maximum growth was projected in september accounting to the biomass and lipid productivity of 170 28 kg dry mass ha 1 d 1 and 39 42 l ha 1 d 1 respectively with a co2 capture potential of 224 77 kg co2 ha 1 d 1 based on the influence of water temperature optimal pond depth and operational conditions to achieve the desired productivity for the specific site were estimated the maximum annual areal productivity dropped by 19 from 62 18 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 due to photoinhibition the simulated biophysical model as a tool could be used to evaluate the biokinetic processes affecting the algal pond performance for further facilitation of effective decision making on scaling up of microalgae cultivation keywords mathematical modeling microalgae biomass productivity carbon sequestration feasibility analysis photoinhibition 1 introduction the rapid industrialization along with depleting oil reserves and increasing fuel prices in the past few decades has led to the search for alternative renewable energy sources the rising issues of pollution and global climate change have also resulted in profound interest towards carbon neutral renewable third generation algal biofuels microalgae due to its superiority over other energy crops regarding ease of cultivation and the presence of substantial quantity of lipids up to 60 of total biomass have attracted the attention of global researchers recently chisti 2007 behera et al 2018 additionally the concepts of integrated microalgal based industrial wastewater treatment utilizing the flue gasses to grow algae that can be processed into biodiesel could sort out the increasing demands of fuel as well tackle the issues related to environmental pollution and global climate change rangabhashiyam et al 2017 regardless of the portrayed advantages of microalgae the realistic biomass productivity and carbon dioxide co2 sequestration potential at a particular location during scale up are still questionable economic challenges due to the lack of appropriate data with most of the studies confined under controlled lab scale conditions hinder translating the same at the field scale site specific studies with biophysical predictive mathematical models as a preliminary resource can provide a comprehensive knowledge about the practical problems witnessed at the field scale such studies not only evaluate the economic feasibility of the process but also provide an opportunity to the researchers and policy makers to analyze the influence of a range of vital parameters on microalgal productivity microalgal growth depends on several influencing factors with solar radiation light intensity in specific being the most important behera et al 2018 several researchers have evaluated the effects of daily solar irradiation on microalgal productivity and co2 capture capacity weyer et al 2010 wigmosta et al 2011 sudhakar et al 2012 and asmare et al 2013 predicted the microalgal production potential using simple emperical equations for the different parts of india and ethiopia respectively sudhakar and premalatha 2012 estimated the microalgal productivity in open ponds for six global sites based on the received solar insolation at study area sudhakar et al 2014 predicted the microalgal biomass and oil productivity in chennai and una of india using the local climatic parameters like the solar insolation received and the air temperature slegers et al 2011 2013 developed a mathematical model to evaluate the spatiotemporal climatologic effects in closed photobioreactors and open ponds with p tricornutum and t pseudonana as the model organism in netherland france and algeria marsullo et al 2015 used a dynamic mathematical model for open pond reactor and predicted the areal biomass productivity in sevilla spain and petrolina brazil béchet et al 2017 developed the viability model using the temperature function for predicting the growth rate of microalgae at different locations in the mediterranean regions banerjee and ramaswamy 2017 estimated the microalgal biomass productivities based on the year round geospatial characteristics very recently darvehei et al 2017 separately modelled the growth of microalage as a function of daily light exposure and temperature fluctuations most of the above studies were restricted towards the prediction of algal growth rate and biomass productivities based on the ideal light conditions without taking into account the effect of light attenuation and photoinhibition aly et al 2017 have recently modelled the performance of microalgae in the fixed and trackable photobioreactors based on the amount of solar insolation received including the photoinhibition effects aly and balasubramanian 2016 2017 evaluated the effect of changes in microalgal productivities in open ponds of nit rourkela india and ten other locations in equator tropic of cancer and tropic of capricorn including the effects of photoinhibition most of the predictive models reported so far are based only on the effect of a single influencing variable which is either the light intensity or temperature however at outdoor locations different physiological variables like solar insolation water temperature and the reactor design parameters like pond geometry particularly the depth in the absence of mixing and algal concentration can be tuned together to provide more reliable estimates the present study aims to integrate the site specific physiological climatologic conditions and the reactor design with the operating variables to formulate a comprehensive biophysical model for performance simulation of open algal ponds the primary aim is to use the solar irradiance data along with other influencing metereological variables to evaluate the water temperature in order to theoretically predict the average microalgal growth rate biomass productivity which was thereby used to evaluate the lipid productivity and co2 sequestration potential further design criteria like the pond depth and microalgal concentration on overall productivity has also been taken into account the model also includes the realistic light attenuation and photoinhibition effects over the annual areal biomass productivity providing more holistic estimates advantages of the proposed study could be highlighted from the fact that a simple yet comprehensive mathematical model has been formulated to analyze the biokinetic processes in the open algal ponds as the parameters used in the biophysical model are measurable characteristics of algae the model could be easily extended for any other locations as well translated for different algal species the outcome of the study could act as a benchmark for policymakers seeking to implement the large scale cultivation of algae at realistic proportions 2 methodology 2 1 site selection national institute of technology nit rourkela 22 25 n and 84 92 e is located in sundergarh district of odisha india with 219 m above the mean sea level the solar radiation and the temperature of the campus are quite variable with a huge range of temperature difference between summer and winter season this site was chosen as the study location since it harbors 7 7 ha of an open pond and receives the secondary treated wastewater from the institute supplementary fig 1 which could assist the policymakers to realize the wastewater treatment and co2 sequestration potential in view of environmental protection through microalgal biomass production as the source of the third generation biofuel 2 2 model definition and description the metabolic rate and viability of microalgae are being affected by several physiochemical factors with most critical ones being light intensity and water temperature slegers et al 2013 photosynthetically active radiation par as a part of solar energy plays an essential role in several applications like influencing the algal pond temperature and thereby the algal productivity sudhakar et al 2013a for instance the net incident solar radiation in the form of light energy is partly absorbed apart from being reflected and refracted due to the scattering effect of algal broth the absorbed solar insolation increases the heat energy that fluctuates the water temperature in open ponds béchet et al 2017 these two interrelated factors governed by multiple sets of complex empirical equations affects the overall biomass productivities especially in open pond systems where the reactor geometry particularly the depth in the absence of proper mixing plays an essential role since the par is dependent on the location the time of the year and the atmospheric conditions sudhakar et al 2013a the topographic and spatial information of the specified location were used to retrieve the meteorological data sets solar insolation data air dew and soil temperature from nasa databases stackhouse 2015 these datasets were used as inputs for the dynamic water energy balance model to quantify the net effect of the input and output energy fluxes via evaluation of net light absorption evaporation conduction convection radiation and condensation processes that influences the water temperature this model was further used to calculate the microalgal growth rate biomass productivities that in turn influences lipid productivities and co2 sequestration the overall methodology has been depicted as flowchart in fig 1 the shading effect of solar radiation due to nearby objects has not been taken into account the volume of water in the open pond is assumed to be constant due to continuous inflow and outflow of water not affecting the energy balance the details of the dynamic model have been described in the subsequent sections 2 2 1 solar energy balance model the amount of sunlight incident on the horizontal pond surface is given

which could be calculated using stefan boltzmann constant by taking into account the sky temperature duffie and beckman 1991 as in eq 6 5 q r a d i a t i o n a w ε w σ t w 273 15 4 t s k y ˆ 4 where εw dimensionless is the emissivity of water in the infra red wavelength σ is stefan boltzmann constant expressed in w m 2 k 4 tw c denotes the water temperature and tsky k represents the sky

balance has been done to find out the dynamic water temperature in the pond that correlates directly with the overall growth rate and microalgal productivity 2 2 2 evaluation of water temperature using mass and energy balance model water temperature is a function of various measured variables like air temperature and velocity dew point temperature saturation and ambient air pressure as well as the area and volume of the pond processes like evaporation conduction convection and radiation are to be considered while evaluating the net change in water temperature apart from the heat energy gained from the solar irradiance after subtracting the reflections and refractions from the water surface evaporation rate of water is often influenced by variations in air temperature t a and localized changes in air pressure as well as air velocity sartori 2000 the rate of evaporation q e v a p o r a t i o n w is given by eq 7 7 q e v a p o r a t i o n a w h e v a p p s s p a a hevap w m

velocity of an area 10 h e v a p 3 6 2 5 ν 10 2 where ν is the wind velocity expressed in m s 1 another essential factor influencing the water temperature is convection that denotes the heat loss due to heat flow between liquid and liquid as well as between gasses and liquid over the upper layers of water due to the variation in air liquid temperatures it is considered zero deep inside the pond and is often associated with the evaporation rate bowen s equation eq 11 is used to determine the heat exchange between air and water by convection q c o n v e c t i o n w woolley et al 2011 11 q c o

conduction deals with the exchange of heat energy between water and soil fourier s law is used to estimate heat generated inside soil because of soil temperature at a specific location conductive heat

the pond all energy input and losses were taken into consideration to estimate the dynamic water temperature of the pond by using energy balance equation the dynamic water temperature taking all the previously explained equations is given in eq 13 13 v w c p w ρ w d t w d t q i r r a d i a n c e q a l g a e g r o w t h q r a d i a t i o n q e v a p o r a t i o n q c o n v e c t i o n q c o n d u

processes has been assumed to be compensated by the makeup water added at a constant dilution rate over the specified volume of culture in the reactor to maintain a precise microalgal concentration under the steady state condition the conservation of energy for a particular system includes the flow of heat into the system by inflow along with the work done by the system as coupling the material and energy balance equations is often complicated and also with the unavailability of sufficient literature data related to the above mentioned aspects to keep the process simple the entire reactor content has been taken as a volume unit for a particular residence time and the heat generated due to the flow has been neglected 2 2 3 growth kinetic model for estimating microalgal productivity daily average biomass and lipid productivity as well as co2 sequestration potential of microalgae taking into account the incident solar insolation has been calculated as per the equations used by sudhakar et al 2012 as well as aly and balasubramanian 2016 growth rate and productivity are not only influenced by the energy of photons but also the water temperature and reactor geometry in open pond systems these parameters at optimal levels result in maximum microalgal productivity the equations used by slegers et al 2013 and geider et al 1996 were used to estimate the growth rate of microalgae and the areal productivity under balanced growth conditions the night time respiration loss has been considered significantly less and has been neglected geider et al 1996 optimum temperature and photon flux density are unique for the majority of microalgae a non linear temperature effect model is used to comprehend the effect of temperature on microalgae growth as denoted by temperature factor ft that varies between 0 and 1 the overall viability of the microalgae is represented with the effect of temperature as shown in eq 14 blanchard et al 1996 highest value denotes negligible inhibition 14 f t t l e t t w t l e t t o p t β t e x p β t t l e t t w t l e t t o p t 1 tlet c is the lethal temperature for algae topt c denotes the optimum temperature at which the productivity is maximum βt dimensionless represents the curve modelling constant which is species specific maximum carbon specific photosynthesis rate pmc s 1 influenced by temperature depends on the maximum specific growth rate and the maintenance coefficient as given in eq 15 15 p m c μ m a x f t r m where μ max s 1 is the maximum specific growth rate of microalgae in the pond rm s 1 denotes the metabolic maintenance coefficient chlorophyll a chl a to carbon ratio of microalgae at a particular position in pond varies with the pond depth and incident light at a given time geider et al 1996 moreover this ratio is represented as θ a z t and calculated by using eq 16 16 θ a z t θ max 1 1 θ max α i p f d z t 2 p m c θ m a x g of chl a per g of carbon content is the maximum chl a to carbon ratio pmc s 1 is the maximum carbon specific photosynthetic rate α is the functional cross section of the photosynthetic apparatus often regarded as a constant which is also considered specific for particular algae ipfd z t is the incident photon flux density that represents the photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd it includes a total number of photons in the range of photosynthetically active radiation par between 400 700 nm falling on earth ipfd z t is often estimated using beer lambert s law based on microalgae concentration c a l g a e at a particular depth chisti 2012 using eq 17 17 i p f d z t p p f d t exp δ c a l g a e z where δ m2 kg 1 denotes normal absorption spectrum of light by microalgae z m denotes the pond depth and ppfd t μmol m 2 s 1 is the photosynthetic photon flux density since the model is based on energy balance equation and ppfd denotes the number of photons rather than energy the ppfd could be written in the form of a function of par dimensionless as in eq 18 18 p p f d t f u l l s p e c t r u m p a r e p h o t o n ephoton denotes the energy of photons the full spectrum of light is expressed in terms of energy j m 2 s 1 the energy of a photon is directly proportional to the planck s constant j s 1 and the velocity of the light m s 1 so the energy of a photon is represented by eq 19 19 e p h o t o n h c λ where h dimensionless is the planck s constant c is the velocity of light m s 1 and λ is the wavelength m the maximum growth rate is a function of time and pond depth which depends on maximum carbon specific photosynthetic rate i e maximum chlorophyll a content per carbon content functional cross section and photon flux density the microalgal growth rate is based on the substrate concentration in liquid media and influenced according to different models such as droop equation monod equation etc modifications of growth equation based on temperature photon energy chlorophyll content and the maximum specific growth rate of microalgae have been suggested by many researchers slegers et al 2013 banerjee and ramaswamy 2017 the microalgal growth equation geider et al 1996 has been modified after considering the above said factors as in eq 20 20 μ g r o w t h z t p m c 1 e x p θ a z t α i p f d z t p m c most of the previous researchers have evaluated the growth rate of microalgae only under the optimal condition of light and temperature without taking into consideration the photoinhibition effects photoinhibition is based on the high intensity of sunlight that inhibits growth via photooxidative damage it is based on saturation effect of light or maximum absorptive capacity of microalgae the model took into consideration the photoinhibitory effect of light in growth equation slegers et al 2013 as shown in eq 21 21 μ g r o w t h p i n h z t μ g r o w t h z t f p i n h i p i n h i p f d z t i p i n h it is noteworthy to mention that the present model is based on the steady state assumptions and thus the cell concentration inside the reactor remains always constant the concentration of biomass in the reactor is independent of the time and flow rate of media as the cell concentration remains constant d c x d t equals zero at this state dilution rate is the same as the effective growth rate as given in eq 22 22 d c x z t d t μ g r o w t h z t r m d t c x z t 0 where d t s 1 is the dilution rate in the pond the annual areal productivity y a r e a l tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 is the sum of the normal daily biomass productivity under a specific composition it depends on the pond geometry and time and the part of the pond containing water the annual areal productivity y a r e a l is given in eq 23 23 y a r e a l η l a s o i l 0 d μ g r o w t h z t r m c x z t d z where η l is the fraction of the reactor area occupied by water dimensionless the photosynthetic efficiency pe of microalgae slegers et al 2013 is calculated taking the surface area a as 1 ha using eq 24 24 p e h c o m b y a r e a l t d t a i s u r f a c e t d t 100 several parameters employed during the model are constant and specific for the algae thalassiosira pseudonana taken into consideration the biomass empirical formula has been assumed to be c1h1 99o0 681n0 151p0 093 with a molecular weight of 31 8 picardo et al 2013 the lipid content has been assumed to be 20 mata et al 2010 density of lipid has been taken as 0 85 kg l 1 sudhakar et al 2012 biochemical composition of microalgae carbohydrate lipid protein has been assumed to be 14 20 33 slegers et al 2011 energy content of carbohydrate lipids and proteins has been assumed as 15 7 kj g 1 37 6 kj g 1 and 16 7 kj g 1 respectively asmare et al 2013 due to the lack of sufficient data the lipid content has been assumed to be constant with the variation in temperature however since the effect of temperature has already been considered while computing the biomass productivity it is expected to also have certain effect on overall lipid productivity because of the unavailability of sufficient literature data the effect of variation in nutrient concentration has not been accounted it has been assumed that the microalgal growth rate is not limited by ph and nutrient concentration however since microalgae are photoautotrophic the major source of nutrient is carbon thus the study therefore takes into account the amount of co2 sequestered in order to be incorporated into the biomass the constant values specific for this algae obtained after experimental study of the biomass under laboratory condition by different studies are given in table 1 the model may also be extrapolated for other algal species via implementation of various strain specific factors 2 3 matlab code for model formulation the lack of sufficient and readily accessible meteorological data at specific study location limits the applicability of mathematical modelling the present study utilized 21 years meteorological data as the baseline information retrieved on a daily basis from the usa nasa databases for the specified location stackhouse 2015 mathematical approach used relied on physics based water energy balance modelling integrated with the meteorological and topographic data to generate temporal datasets in terms of water and energy fluxes all these equations were solved by our own code written in matlab r2015b using ode45 s solver that implements runge kutta method with a variable time for prompt computation 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of solar radiation on water temperature obtained from energy and mass balance model water temperature not only varies with the incident solar radiation but is also affected by the rate of evaporation conduction and convection as well as the relative humidity which in turn varies with the air and dew temperature hindersin et al 2013 the variation in meteorological conditions like the air dew and soil temperature along with the relative humidity is discussed in supplementary data section supplementary fig 2 the average daily solar insolation received has been averaged over last 21 years to comprehend the influence on water temperature as evident from fig 2 solar radiation received was found to be at its peak during the summer season especially from march june as the solar radiation received increases the amount of infrared radiation absorbed by water also increases and thus the water temperature rises the fluctuations in water temperature with solar radiation though dependent but are never directly proportional due to the presence of several other meteorological and hydrodynamic functions maximum average solar insolation received is 6 88 kw h m 2 d 1 in the month of april that results in water temperature of 30 06 c the incident solar radiation decreases over the month of july till february fig 2 the corresponding water temperature is also found to exhibit a similar trend it is due to decline in the duration of daylight hours the revolution of earth and other factors like cloud cover similar results were corroborated in earlier studies by béchet et al 2011 banerjee and ramaswamy 2017 which projected the fluctuation in water temperature due to the location specific seasonal variations sudhakar et al 2012 reported an average solar insolation of 4 7 kw h m 2 d 1 being received by most of the parts of india is considered suitable for algal cultivation hence the selected location with solar insolation varying from 3 11 to 6 88 kw h m 2 d 1 has substantial potential to act as a suitable site for algal cultivation furthermore predicting and maintaining an optimal temperature is of vital importance for achieving the desired microalgal growth rate several researchers such as wen et al 2016 and schreiber et al 2017 achieved the desired microalgal productivity by keeping the algal culture media temperature in optimal range since most microalgal strains grows best at 10 35 c béchet et al 2017 the chosen site with monthly temperature ranging from 16 50 to 32 76 c was found to be feasible for establishing large scale algal ponds as 10 c rise in temperature doubles the algal growth rate huesemann et al 2016 an error of 5 c in prediction of water temperature could result in inaccurate estimation of algal productivity by 40 béchet et al 2011 it signifies the essentiality of a simple clear mathematical model as proposed in the study to establish the relation between different physiological factors to predict the accurate algal growth at a specific site 3 2 biomass lipid productivity and co2 sequestration potential of algae as a function of incident radiation and water temperature the mathematical model and the equations described previously have been used to predict the average growth rate and biomass productivities in the unmixed hypothetical ponds considering the maximum specific growth rate of 3 81 10 5 s 1 the biomass productivities reported are based on a constant biomass concentration of 0 3 kg m 3 and dilution rate of 0 3 d 1 fig 3 a shows the variations of average growth rate with the influence of water temperature over a period of year growth rate varied with changes in incident solar radiation and dynamic water temperature with the maximum being recorded in the month of september corresponding to a value of 3 34 10 5 s 1 as evident from fig 3a with the increase in solar insolation there is a subsequent increase in water temperature beyond 30 c in the months of april july that results in a decline in growth rate as the algae taken into consideration bears an optimal tolerance temperature of 10 35 c béchet et al 2017 average daily biomass and lipid productivities also show a very similar profile as that of the growth rate the range of average biomass and lipid productivity varies from 43 68 to 170 28 kg dry mass ha 1 d 1 and 10 11 39 42 l ha 1 d 1 respectively with the maximum being achieved in september for the unmixed hypothetical open algal ponds results presented in fig 3b showing the seasonal variation in algal biomass and lipid productivity throughout a year further helps in identifying the potential hotspots or months seasons with lower productivity where optimal conditions has to be maintained to obtain the desired yield on contrary to the present study rammuni et al 2018 have reported maximal algal productivity in the summer months compared to the winter in spain asmare et al 2013 also reported variation in maximal algal biomass and lipid productivity over different seasons of ethiopia sudhakar et al 2014 predicted the maximum biomass productivity of 94 g m 2 d 1 with oil productivity of 44 ml m 2 d 1 in chennai india for the month of april it signifies that location and climatic conditions have a vital influence over microalgal productivity the growth as well as the biomass productivity profile obtained for the chosen location clearly depicts the potential of the specified site for algal cultivation fig 3b sudhakar et al 2012 reported an average biomass dry productivity of 75 g m 2 d 1 for open ponds in most parts of india using simple emperical equations with only solar insolation sudhakar and premalatha 2012 predicted a theoretical biomass producytivity of 151 g m 2 d 1 in chennai at a photosynthetic efficiency of 11 42 average biomass dry productivity of 80 7 g m 2 d 1 was also reported by asmare et al 2013 in various parts of ethiopia similar to the previous study the biomass productivity reported in this study is consistent with those reported by various predictive models and experiments borowitzka 1999 de bhowmick et al 2014 das et al 2016 huesemann et al 2016 the productivity reported in various case studies seems to be slightly different pertaining to the variation in meteorological conditions at specific geographical locations as well as the difference in strain taken into consideration the co2 sequestration capacity is also seen to follow a similar profile as that of the biomass productivity fig 3b thus proving that the algal biomass possesses an inherent power to sequester the atmospheric co2 the maximum average co2 captured was predicted to be 224 77 kg co2 ha 1 d 1 it is comparatively much higher than the sequestration potential of terrestrial plants chisti 2007 asmare et al 2013 the study by sudhakar et al 2011 and sudhakar et al 2013b in indian context also projected the highest carbon mitigation potential of microalgae compared to other energy feed stocks the present study also validates the fact that the strategy of biological carbon capture through microalgal cultivation could be co located inside the industrial premises to reduce the ghg emissions as proposed by previous studies sudhakar and deeptibansod 2013 it has been reported that co2 capture efficiency of microalgae varies from 15 to 90 depending on the strain and the cultivation conditions asmare et al 2013 even though the carbon sequestration capacity of microalgae is proportional to the biomass productivity it is noteworthy to mention that lower the gas transfer efficiency more co2 would be required to be supplied to the reactor for achieving the same biomass productivity and also the quantum of wastage of co2 to the atmosphere will be more 3 3 effect of reactor geometry pond depth and microalgal concentration on growth rate and productivity design and geometry of open ponds especially the depth influences the light absorption capacity as it plays an essential role in influencing photosynthetic reactions considering the light gradient to be vertical major light path depends on the pond depth slegers et al 2013 the increase in depth as well as microalgal concentration with time influences the rate of absorption of direct and diffused light that results in attenuation of light over a steep gradient thus algae on the surface are exposed to excess light and those at higher depth are at near darkness huesemann et al 2016 also as microalgae culture density reach a certain value around 0 5 g l 1 light penetration into the culture becomes very critical especially for open ponds in the absence of mixing huesemann et al 2016 along with instantaneous light the degree of exposure of cells to light also affects productivity thus in addition to the incident light and water temperature reactor geometry plays a significant role in influencing the biomass productivity simulations were conducted to show the effect of different operating parameters over the algal productivity the local light intensity photon flux density pfd has been found to decrease exponentially with gradual increase in pond depth z 0 m to z 0 7 m beyond which pfd is found to be almost constant fig 4 a fig 4b shows the exponentially decreasing trend in the incident pfd with the increase in microalgal concentration 0 0 05 kg m 3 similar trends were seen in the incident pfd reduction with the increase in depth and algal concentration fig 4a and b maximum average growth rate 2 15 10 5 s 1 and biomass productivity of 49 35 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 were obtained at 0 15 m depth of the pond as illustrated in fig 5 a and b as seen from the figures the growth rate and biomass productivity increases till it reaches a threshold value at z 0 15 m with the incident pfd of 117 67 μmol photons m 2 s 1 having initial inoculum concentration of 0 01 kg m 3 with subsequent increase in depth productivity were found to decline longer residence time and higher the algal concentration with increase in depth under unmixed conditions a decline in algal productivity will be witnessed due to light attenuation similar to the conclusion of the present study chisti 2016 and bello et al 2017 had reported that irradiance declines with culture depth and further with a peak biomass concentration of 0 5 kg m 3 80 of culture lies in dark zone due to light attenuation however contrary to the above reports the study by sutherland et al 2014 proposed that the increase in pond depth results in increase in photosynthetic efficiency thereby the algal growth rate the variation in growth rate might be due to the difference in site specific environmental parameters slegers et al 2013 lipid productivity and co2 sequestration capacity also shows a similar trend with an increase in pond depth consistent with the biomass productivity fig 5b as evident from the figure maximum lipid productivity of 11 42 m3 ha 1 yr 1 with the inherent carbon capture of 65 14 tons ha 1 yr 1 at 0 15 m as the microalgal productivity declines with pond depth due to decrease in photosynthetic activity the co2 acquisition and lipid content also decreases solimeno et al 2015 and bello et al 2017 also reported similar trends das et al 2016 also showed a decrease in biomass productivity metabolite and fame content with increase in depth low growth rate and productivity at the surface might be attributed to excessive light and dehydration while the increase in depth and microalgal concentration results in inefficient light utilization owing to increased turbidity it could be concluded that for a pond of area 8000 m2 maximum permissible depth could be maintained at 0 7 m to achieve better performance nevertheless it is essential to optimise the algal pond design especially under unmixed conditions to obtain the desired microalgal productivity optimal pond depth with influence over the light and growth processes is also location dependent slegers et al 2013 further it is highly essential to operate the reactor in continuous mode to keep the microalgal concentration below a threshold limit to achieve optimum productivity 3 4 effect of photoinhibition on productivity of microalgae incident light intensity in the form of photon flux density pfd plays a significant role in influencing the areal productivity of microalgae as the growth rate is driven by par in the range of 400 700 nm das et al 2016 huesemann et al 2016 ignoring the photoinhibition effects the rate of photosynthesis thus the microalgal areal productivity increases with increament in pfd till it reaches a region of saturation where the change in pfd have little or no significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis fig 6 as illustrated in fig 6 without photoinhibition effects the areal productivity increases from 38 08 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 at 50 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to 56 26 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 with an irradiance of 200 μmol photons m 2 s 1 once the irradiance is at the saturation level there is a slight increase in photosynthesis till 62 18 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 with further increase in irradiance till 1000 μmol photons m 2 s 1 however with inclusion of photoinhibition decrease in the rate of photosynthesis due to exposure to higher irradiance because of reversible damage photooxidation of psii the areal productivity reaches a peak of 50 26 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 at 150 μmol photons m 2 s 1 with further increase in irradiance the rate of photosynthesis as well the areal biomass productivity declines fig 6 the photosynthetic efficiency for the current study has been reported to be 3 26 considering photoinhibition effects slegers et al 2013 reported the photosynthetic efficiency of 0 4 and 0 36 under open pond cultivation mode in netherland and algeria respectively with t pseudonana chisti 2016 reported that the photosynthetic rate saturates at 10 20 of the peak par as algal cultures becomes photoinhibited when par exceeds the threshold thus photoinhibition plays an essential role in understanding and maintaining the required light intensity driving the differences in theoretical and real time algal productivities the study by pfaffinger et al 2016 also proposed the idea of maintaining an optimum radiation profile based on the light attenuation effects to achieve the desired areal biomass productivity the predicted annual biomass productivity can be very well compared with the available literature showing the yearly annual productivity for open pond system at different locations as shown in table 2 banerjee and ramaswamy 2017 predicted an annual areal biomass productivity of 20 72 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 in different regions of us using the geospatial coordinates without photoinhibiton aly et al 2017 has evaluated the effect of photoinhibition on microalgal productivity in fixed and trackable photobioreactor for the entire odisha state of india at 1142 study locations the variation in productivities at different locations might be attributed to the difference in algal strain and parameters taken into consideration it is well evident from the comparison table 2 with the literature that the simulations carried out without considering the effects of photoinhibition often overestimates the areal productivity thus the inclusion of photoinhibitory effects will provide more real time estimates that facilitates the easy policy making 4 conclusion a simple yet comprehensive model was simulated to theoretically estimate the location specific microalgal growth potential the combined effects of light including attenuation and water temperature along with design and operational factors of algal ponds were studied the following conclusions were drawn from the study the maximum daily average biomass and lipid productivity of 170 28 kg dry mass ha 1 d 1 and 39 42 l ha 1 d 1 has been predicted in september with carbon capture of 224 77 kg ha 1 d 1 the year round microalgal biomass and lipid productivity along with the carbon sequestration data shows the feasibility of the site for large scale algal production and also signifies the importance of geospatial and climatic conditions over algal growth rate estimation pond depth residence time and algal concentration are essential design criteria to be considered for algal ponds the biomass productivity was found to decline with an increase in depth of pond and microalgal concentration with time due to light attenuation thus for deep ponds the biomass concentration has to be kept low to obtain the optimal biomass productivity however with lower depth ponds the biomass concentration has to be maintained at higher levels in order to attain the same productivity photoinhibition effects due to irrevocable damage of photosynthetic apparatus affect the areal productivity of microalgae maximum annual areal productivity declined to 50 26 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 about 19 while considering photoinhibition effects this site specific prediction at nit rourkela india would also aid policy makers on transforming the institute towards the sustainable ecocampus to meet the future educational social and environmental demands the model could assist in performance evaluation of microalgal production

25174,microalgal biomass is currently recognized as a promising sustainable source for biofuel production and carbon dioxide co2 sequestration utilization of biophysical models are emerging to access the real time feasibility of microalgal technology in this present work a comprehensive mathematical model based on the site specific meteorological variables is formulated using matlab ode 45 s solver to estimate the microalgal productivity the predictive model framework utilized material balance equations with basic laws of physics known constants and conservative assumptions to evaluate the water temperature that influences the microalgal viability the dynamic behaviour of algal ponds considering the operating variables like light intensity including the effects of photoinhibition water temperature and design criteria like pond depth microalgal concentration was used to estimate the performance of t pseudonana in open ponds maximum growth was projected in september accounting to the biomass and lipid productivity of 170 28 kg dry mass ha 1 d 1 and 39 42 l ha 1 d 1 respectively with a co2 capture potential of 224 77 kg co2 ha 1 d 1 based on the influence of water temperature optimal pond depth and operational conditions to achieve the desired productivity for the specific site were estimated the maximum annual areal productivity dropped by 19 from 62 18 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 due to photoinhibition the simulated biophysical model as a tool could be used to evaluate the biokinetic processes affecting the algal pond performance for further facilitation of effective decision making on scaling up of microalgae cultivation keywords mathematical modeling microalgae biomass productivity carbon sequestration feasibility analysis photoinhibition 1 introduction the rapid industrialization along with depleting oil reserves and increasing fuel prices in the past few decades has led to the search for alternative renewable energy sources the rising issues of pollution and global climate change have also resulted in profound interest towards carbon neutral renewable third generation algal biofuels microalgae due to its superiority over other energy crops regarding ease of cultivation and the presence of substantial quantity of lipids up to 60 of total biomass have attracted the attention of global researchers recently chisti 2007 behera et al 2018 additionally the concepts of integrated microalgal based industrial wastewater treatment utilizing the flue gasses to grow algae that can be processed into biodiesel could sort out the increasing demands of fuel as well tackle the issues related to environmental pollution and global climate change rangabhashiyam et al 2017 regardless of the portrayed advantages of microalgae the realistic biomass productivity and carbon dioxide co2 sequestration potential at a particular location during scale up are still questionable economic challenges due to the lack of appropriate data with most of the studies confined under controlled lab scale conditions hinder translating the same at the field scale site specific studies with biophysical predictive mathematical models as a preliminary resource can provide a comprehensive knowledge about the practical problems witnessed at the field scale such studies not only evaluate the economic feasibility of the process but also provide an opportunity to the researchers and policy makers to analyze the influence of a range of vital parameters on microalgal productivity microalgal growth depends on several influencing factors with solar radiation light intensity in specific being the most important behera et al 2018 several researchers have evaluated the effects of daily solar irradiation on microalgal productivity and co2 capture capacity weyer et al 2010 wigmosta et al 2011 sudhakar et al 2012 and asmare et al 2013 predicted the microalgal production potential using simple emperical equations for the different parts of india and ethiopia respectively sudhakar and premalatha 2012 estimated the microalgal productivity in open ponds for six global sites based on the received solar insolation at study area sudhakar et al 2014 predicted the microalgal biomass and oil productivity in chennai and una of india using the local climatic parameters like the solar insolation received and the air temperature slegers et al 2011 2013 developed a mathematical model to evaluate the spatiotemporal climatologic effects in closed photobioreactors and open ponds with p tricornutum and t pseudonana as the model organism in netherland france and algeria marsullo et al 2015 used a dynamic mathematical model for open pond reactor and predicted the areal biomass productivity in sevilla spain and petrolina brazil béchet et al 2017 developed the viability model using the temperature function for predicting the growth rate of microalgae at different locations in the mediterranean regions banerjee and ramaswamy 2017 estimated the microalgal biomass productivities based on the year round geospatial characteristics very recently darvehei et al 2017 separately modelled the growth of microalage as a function of daily light exposure and temperature fluctuations most of the above studies were restricted towards the prediction of algal growth rate and biomass productivities based on the ideal light conditions without taking into account the effect of light attenuation and photoinhibition aly et al 2017 have recently modelled the performance of microalgae in the fixed and trackable photobioreactors based on the amount of solar insolation received including the photoinhibition effects aly and balasubramanian 2016 2017 evaluated the effect of changes in microalgal productivities in open ponds of nit rourkela india and ten other locations in equator tropic of cancer and tropic of capricorn including the effects of photoinhibition most of the predictive models reported so far are based only on the effect of a single influencing variable which is either the light intensity or temperature however at outdoor locations different physiological variables like solar insolation water temperature and the reactor design parameters like pond geometry particularly the depth in the absence of mixing and algal concentration can be tuned together to provide more reliable estimates the present study aims to integrate the site specific physiological climatologic conditions and the reactor design with the operating variables to formulate a comprehensive biophysical model for performance simulation of open algal ponds the primary aim is to use the solar irradiance data along with other influencing metereological variables to evaluate the water temperature in order to theoretically predict the average microalgal growth rate biomass productivity which was thereby used to evaluate the lipid productivity and co2 sequestration potential further design criteria like the pond depth and microalgal concentration on overall productivity has also been taken into account the model also includes the realistic light attenuation and photoinhibition effects over the annual areal biomass productivity providing more holistic estimates advantages of the proposed study could be highlighted from the fact that a simple yet comprehensive mathematical model has been formulated to analyze the biokinetic processes in the open algal ponds as the parameters used in the biophysical model are measurable characteristics of algae the model could be easily extended for any other locations as well translated for different algal species the outcome of the study could act as a benchmark for policymakers seeking to implement the large scale cultivation of algae at realistic proportions 2 methodology 2 1 site selection national institute of technology nit rourkela 22 25 n and 84 92 e is located in sundergarh district of odisha india with 219 m above the mean sea level the solar radiation and the temperature of the campus are quite variable with a huge range of temperature difference between summer and winter season this site was chosen as the study location since it harbors 7 7 ha of an open pond and receives the secondary treated wastewater from the institute supplementary fig 1 which could assist the policymakers to realize the wastewater treatment and co2 sequestration potential in view of environmental protection through microalgal biomass production as the source of the third generation biofuel 2 2 model definition and description the metabolic rate and viability of microalgae are being affected by several physiochemical factors with most critical ones being light intensity and water temperature slegers et al 2013 photosynthetically active radiation par as a part of solar energy plays an essential role in several applications like influencing the algal pond temperature and thereby the algal productivity sudhakar et al 2013a for instance the net incident solar radiation in the form of light energy is partly absorbed apart from being reflected and refracted due to the scattering effect of algal broth the absorbed solar insolation increases the heat energy that fluctuates the water temperature in open ponds béchet et al 2017 these two interrelated factors governed by multiple sets of complex empirical equations affects the overall biomass productivities especially in open pond systems where the reactor geometry particularly the depth in the absence of proper mixing plays an essential role since the par is dependent on the location the time of the year and the atmospheric conditions sudhakar et al 2013a the topographic and spatial information of the specified location were used to retrieve the meteorological data sets solar insolation data air dew and soil temperature from nasa databases stackhouse 2015 these datasets were used as inputs for the dynamic water energy balance model to quantify the net effect of the input and output energy fluxes via evaluation of net light absorption evaporation conduction convection radiation and condensation processes that influences the water temperature this model was further used to calculate the microalgal growth rate biomass productivities that in turn influences lipid productivities and co2 sequestration the overall methodology has been depicted as flowchart in fig 1 the shading effect of solar radiation due to nearby objects has not been taken into account the volume of water in the open pond is assumed to be constant due to continuous inflow and outflow of water not affecting the energy balance the details of the dynamic model have been described in the subsequent sections 2 2 1 solar energy balance model the amount of sunlight incident on the horizontal pond surface is given by qirradiance w and is expressed as in eq 1 1 q i r r a d i a n c e a w i s u r f a c e t a w m2 denotes the total area of the pond covered with water eq 2 represents the amount of energy reaching

εw dimensionless is the emissivity of water in the infra red wavelength σ is stefan boltzmann constant expressed in w m 2 k 4 tw c denotes the water temperature and tsky k represents the sky

balance has been done to find out the dynamic water temperature in the pond that correlates directly with the overall growth rate and microalgal productivity 2 2 2 evaluation of water temperature using mass and energy balance model water temperature is a function of various measured variables like air temperature and velocity dew point temperature saturation and ambient air pressure as well as the area and volume of the pond processes like evaporation conduction convection and radiation are to be considered while evaluating the net change in water temperature apart from the heat energy gained from the solar irradiance after subtracting the reflections and refractions from the water surface evaporation rate of water is often influenced by variations in air temperature t a and localized changes in air pressure as well as air velocity sartori 2000 the rate of evaporation q e v a p o r a t i o n w is given by eq 7 7 q e v a p o r a t i o n a w h e v a p p s s p a a hevap w m

to heat flow between liquid and liquid as well as between gasses and liquid over the upper layers of water due to the variation in air liquid temperatures it is considered zero deep inside the pond and is often associated with the evaporation rate bowen s equation eq 11 is used to determine the heat exchange between air and water by convection q c o n v e c t i o n w woolley et al 2011 11 q c o

the pond all energy input and losses were taken into consideration to estimate the dynamic water temperature of the pond by using energy balance equation the dynamic water temperature taking all the previously explained equations is given in eq 13 13 v w c p w ρ w d t w d t q i r r a d i a n c e q a l g a e g r o w t h q r a d i a t i o n q e v a p o r a t i o n q c o n v e c t i o n q c o n d u

processes has been assumed to be compensated by the makeup water added at a constant dilution rate over the specified volume of culture in the reactor to maintain a precise microalgal concentration under the steady state condition the conservation of energy for a particular system includes the flow of heat into the system by inflow along with the work done by the system as coupling the material and energy balance equations is often complicated and also with the unavailability of sufficient literature data related to the above mentioned aspects to keep the process simple the entire reactor content has been taken as a volume unit for a particular residence time and the heat generated due to the flow has been neglected 2 2 3 growth kinetic model for estimating microalgal productivity daily average biomass and lipid productivity as well as co2 sequestration potential of microalgae taking into account the incident solar insolation has been calculated as per the equations used by sudhakar et al 2012 as well as aly and balasubramanian 2016 growth rate and productivity are not only influenced by the energy of photons but also the water temperature and reactor geometry in open pond systems these parameters at optimal levels result in maximum microalgal productivity the equations used by slegers et al 2013 and geider et al 1996 were used to estimate the growth rate of microalgae and the areal productivity under balanced growth conditions the night time respiration loss has been considered significantly less and has been neglected geider et al 1996 optimum temperature and photon flux density are unique for the majority of microalgae a non linear temperature effect model is used to comprehend the effect of temperature on microalgae growth as denoted by temperature factor ft that varies between 0 and 1 the overall viability of the microalgae is represented with the effect of temperature as shown in eq 14 blanchard et al 1996 highest value denotes negligible inhibition 14 f t t l e t t w t l e t t o p t β t e x p β t t l e t t w t l e t t o p t 1 tlet c is the lethal temperature for algae topt c denotes the optimum temperature at which the productivity is maximum βt dimensionless represents the curve modelling constant which is species specific maximum carbon specific photosynthesis rate pmc s 1 influenced by temperature depends on the maximum specific growth rate and the maintenance coefficient as given in eq 15 15 p m c μ m a x f t r m where μ max s 1 is the maximum specific growth rate of microalgae in the pond rm s 1 denotes the metabolic maintenance coefficient chlorophyll a chl a to carbon ratio of microalgae at a particular position in pond varies with the pond depth and incident light at a given time geider et al 1996 moreover this ratio is represented as θ a z t and calculated by using eq 16 16 θ a z t θ max 1 1 θ max α i p f d z t 2 p m c θ m a x g of chl a per g of carbon content is the maximum chl a to carbon ratio pmc s 1 is the maximum carbon specific photosynthetic rate α is the functional cross section of the photosynthetic apparatus often regarded as a constant which is also considered specific for particular algae ipfd z t is the incident photon flux density that represents the photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd it includes a total number of photons in the range of photosynthetically active radiation par between 400 700 nm falling on earth ipfd z t is often estimated using beer lambert s law based on microalgae concentration c a l g a e at a particular depth chisti 2012 using eq 17 17 i p f d z t p p f d t exp δ c a l g a e z where δ m2 kg 1 denotes normal absorption spectrum of light by microalgae z m denotes the pond depth and ppfd t μmol m 2 s 1 is the photosynthetic photon flux density since the model is based on energy balance equation and ppfd denotes the number of photons rather than energy the ppfd could be written in the form of a function of par dimensionless as in eq 18 18 p p f d t f u l l s p e c t r u m p a r e p h o t o n ephoton denotes the energy of photons the full spectrum of light is expressed in terms of energy j m 2 s 1 the energy of a photon is directly proportional to the planck s constant j s 1 and the velocity of the light m s 1 so the energy of a photon is represented by eq 19 19 e p h o t o n h c λ where h dimensionless is the planck s constant c is the velocity of light m s 1 and λ is the wavelength m the maximum growth rate is a function of time and pond depth which depends on maximum carbon specific photosynthetic rate i e maximum chlorophyll a content per carbon content functional cross section and photon flux density the microalgal growth rate is based on the substrate concentration in liquid media and influenced according to different models such as droop equation monod equation etc modifications of growth equation based on temperature photon energy chlorophyll content and the maximum specific growth rate of microalgae have been suggested by many researchers slegers et al 2013 banerjee and ramaswamy 2017 the microalgal growth equation geider et al 1996 has been modified after considering the above said factors as in eq 20 20 μ g r o w t h z t p m c 1 e x p θ a z t α i p f d z t p m c most of the previous researchers have evaluated the growth rate of microalgae only under the optimal condition of light and temperature without taking into consideration the photoinhibition effects photoinhibition is based on the high intensity of sunlight that inhibits growth via photooxidative damage it is based on saturation effect of light or maximum absorptive capacity of microalgae the model took into consideration the photoinhibitory effect of light in growth equation slegers et al 2013 as shown in eq 21 21 μ g r o w t h p i n h z t μ g r o w t h z t f p i n h i p i n h i p f d z t i p i n h it is noteworthy to mention that the present model is based on the steady state assumptions and thus the cell concentration inside the reactor remains always constant the concentration of biomass in the reactor is independent of the time and flow rate of media as the cell concentration remains constant d c x d t equals zero at this state dilution rate is the same as the effective growth rate as given in eq 22 22 d c x z t d t μ g r o w t h z t r m d t c x z t 0 where d t s 1 is the dilution rate in the pond the annual areal productivity y a r e a l tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 is the sum of the normal daily biomass productivity under a specific composition it depends on the pond geometry and time and the part of the pond containing water the annual areal productivity y a r e a l is given in eq 23 23 y a r e a l η l a s o i l 0 d μ g r o w t h z t r m c x z t d z where η l is the fraction of the reactor area occupied by water dimensionless the photosynthetic efficiency pe of microalgae slegers et al 2013 is calculated taking the surface area a as 1 ha using eq 24 24 p e h c o m b y a r e a l t d t a i s u r f a c e t d t 100 several parameters employed during the model are constant and specific for the algae thalassiosira pseudonana taken into consideration the biomass empirical formula has been assumed to be c1h1 99o0 681n0 151p0 093 with a molecular weight of 31 8 picardo et al 2013 the lipid content has been assumed to be 20 mata et al 2010 density of lipid has been taken as 0 85 kg l 1 sudhakar et al 2012 biochemical composition of microalgae carbohydrate lipid protein has been assumed to be 14 20 33 slegers et al 2011 energy content of carbohydrate lipids and proteins has been assumed as 15 7 kj g 1 37 6 kj g 1 and 16 7 kj g 1 respectively asmare et al 2013 due to the lack of sufficient data the lipid content has been assumed to be constant with the variation in temperature however since the effect of temperature has already been considered while computing the biomass productivity it is expected to also have certain effect on overall lipid productivity because of the unavailability of sufficient literature data the effect of variation in nutrient concentration has not been accounted it has been assumed that the microalgal growth rate is not limited by ph and nutrient concentration however since microalgae are photoautotrophic the major source of nutrient is carbon thus the study therefore takes into account the amount of co2 sequestered in order to be incorporated into the biomass the constant values specific for this algae obtained after experimental study of the biomass under laboratory condition by different studies are given in table 1 the model may also be extrapolated for other algal species via implementation of various strain specific factors 2 3 matlab code for model formulation the lack of sufficient and readily accessible meteorological data at specific study location limits the applicability of mathematical modelling the present study utilized 21 years meteorological data as the baseline information retrieved on a daily basis from the usa nasa databases for the specified location stackhouse 2015 mathematical approach used relied on physics based water energy balance modelling integrated with the meteorological and topographic data to generate temporal datasets in terms of water and energy fluxes all these equations were solved by our own code written in matlab r2015b using ode45 s solver that implements runge kutta method with a variable time for prompt computation 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of solar radiation on water temperature obtained from energy and mass balance model water temperature not only varies with the incident solar radiation but is also affected by the rate of evaporation conduction and convection as well as the relative humidity which in turn varies with the air and dew temperature hindersin et al 2013 the variation in meteorological conditions like the air dew and soil temperature along with the relative humidity is discussed in supplementary data section supplementary fig 2 the average daily solar insolation received has been averaged over last 21 years to comprehend the influence on water temperature as evident from fig 2 solar radiation received was found to be at its peak during the summer season especially from march june as the solar radiation received increases the amount of infrared radiation absorbed by water also increases and thus the water temperature rises the fluctuations in water temperature with solar radiation though dependent but are never directly proportional due to the presence of several other meteorological and hydrodynamic functions maximum average solar insolation received is 6 88 kw h m 2 d 1 in the month of april that results in water temperature of 30 06 c the incident solar radiation decreases over the month of july till february fig 2 the corresponding water temperature is also found to exhibit a similar trend it is due to decline in the duration of daylight hours the revolution of earth and other factors like cloud cover similar results were corroborated in earlier studies by béchet et al 2011 banerjee and ramaswamy 2017 which projected the fluctuation in water temperature due to the location specific seasonal variations sudhakar et al 2012 reported an average solar insolation of 4 7 kw h m 2 d 1 being received by most of the parts of india is considered suitable for algal cultivation hence the selected location with solar insolation varying from 3 11 to 6 88 kw h m 2 d 1 has substantial potential to act as a suitable site for algal cultivation furthermore predicting and maintaining an optimal temperature is of vital importance for achieving the desired microalgal growth rate several researchers such as wen et al 2016 and schreiber et al 2017 achieved the desired microalgal productivity by keeping the algal culture media temperature in optimal range since most microalgal strains grows best at 10 35 c béchet et al 2017 the chosen site with monthly temperature ranging from 16 50 to 32 76 c was found to be feasible for establishing large scale algal ponds as 10 c rise in temperature doubles the algal growth rate huesemann et al 2016 an error of 5 c in prediction of water temperature could result in inaccurate estimation of algal productivity by 40 béchet et al 2011 it signifies the essentiality of a simple clear mathematical model as proposed in the study to establish the relation between different physiological factors to predict the accurate algal growth at a specific site 3 2 biomass lipid productivity and co2 sequestration potential of algae as a function of incident radiation and water temperature the mathematical model and the equations described previously have been used to predict the average growth rate and biomass productivities in the unmixed hypothetical ponds considering the maximum specific growth rate of 3 81 10 5 s 1 the biomass productivities reported are based on a constant biomass concentration of 0 3 kg m 3 and dilution rate of 0 3 d 1 fig 3 a shows the variations of average growth rate with the influence of water temperature over a period of year growth rate varied with changes in incident solar radiation and dynamic water temperature with the maximum being recorded in the month of september corresponding to a value of 3 34 10 5 s 1 as evident from fig 3a with the increase in solar insolation there is a subsequent increase in water temperature beyond 30 c in the months of april july that results in a decline in growth rate as the algae taken into consideration bears an optimal tolerance temperature of 10 35 c béchet et al 2017 average daily biomass and lipid productivities also show a very similar profile as that of the growth rate the range of average biomass and lipid productivity varies from 43 68 to 170 28 kg dry mass ha 1 d 1 and 10 11 39 42 l ha 1 d 1 respectively with the maximum being achieved in september for the unmixed hypothetical open algal ponds results presented in fig 3b showing the seasonal variation in algal biomass and lipid productivity throughout a year further helps in identifying the potential hotspots or months seasons with lower productivity where optimal conditions has to be maintained to obtain the desired yield on contrary to the present study rammuni et al 2018 have reported maximal algal productivity in the summer months compared to the winter in spain asmare et al 2013 also reported variation in maximal algal biomass and lipid productivity over different seasons of ethiopia sudhakar et al 2014 predicted the maximum biomass productivity of 94 g m 2 d 1 with oil productivity of 44 ml m 2 d 1 in chennai india for the month of april it signifies that location and climatic conditions have a vital influence over microalgal productivity the growth as well as the biomass productivity profile obtained for the chosen location clearly depicts the potential of the specified site for algal cultivation fig 3b sudhakar et al 2012 reported an average biomass dry productivity of 75 g m 2 d 1 for open ponds in most parts of india using simple emperical equations with only solar insolation sudhakar and premalatha 2012 predicted a theoretical biomass producytivity of 151 g m 2 d 1 in chennai at a photosynthetic efficiency of 11 42 average biomass dry productivity of 80 7 g m 2 d 1 was also reported by asmare et al 2013 in various parts of ethiopia similar to the previous study the biomass productivity reported in this study is consistent with those reported by various predictive models and experiments borowitzka 1999 de bhowmick et al 2014 das et al 2016 huesemann et al 2016 the productivity reported in various case studies seems to be slightly different pertaining to the variation in meteorological conditions at specific geographical locations as well as the difference in strain taken into consideration the co2 sequestration capacity is also seen to follow a similar profile as that of the biomass productivity fig 3b thus proving that the algal biomass possesses an inherent power to sequester the atmospheric co2 the maximum average co2 captured was predicted to be 224 77 kg co2 ha 1 d 1 it is comparatively much higher than the sequestration potential of terrestrial plants chisti 2007 asmare et al 2013 the study by sudhakar et al 2011 and sudhakar et al 2013b in indian context also projected the highest carbon mitigation potential of microalgae compared to other energy feed stocks the present study also validates the fact that the strategy of biological carbon capture through microalgal cultivation could be co located inside the industrial premises to reduce the ghg emissions as proposed by previous studies sudhakar and deeptibansod 2013 it has been reported that co2 capture efficiency of microalgae varies from 15 to 90 depending on the strain and the cultivation conditions asmare et al 2013 even though the carbon sequestration capacity of microalgae is proportional to the biomass productivity it is noteworthy to mention that lower the gas transfer efficiency more co2 would be required to be supplied to the reactor for achieving the same biomass productivity and also the quantum of wastage of co2 to the atmosphere will be more 3 3 effect of reactor geometry pond depth and microalgal concentration on growth rate and productivity design and geometry of open ponds especially the depth influences the light absorption capacity as it plays an essential role in influencing photosynthetic reactions considering the light gradient to be vertical major light path depends on the pond depth slegers et al 2013 the increase in depth as well as microalgal concentration with time influences the rate of absorption of direct and diffused light that results in attenuation of light over a steep gradient thus algae on the surface are exposed to excess light and those at higher depth are at near darkness huesemann et al 2016 also as microalgae culture density reach a certain value around 0 5 g l 1 light penetration into the culture becomes very critical especially for open ponds in the absence of mixing huesemann et al 2016 along with instantaneous light the degree of exposure of cells to light also affects productivity thus in addition to the incident light and water temperature reactor geometry plays a significant role in influencing the biomass productivity simulations were conducted to show the effect of different operating parameters over the algal productivity the local light intensity photon flux density pfd has been found to decrease exponentially with gradual increase in pond depth z 0 m to z 0 7 m beyond which pfd is found to be almost constant fig 4 a fig 4b shows the exponentially decreasing trend in the incident pfd with the increase in microalgal concentration 0 0 05 kg m 3 similar trends were seen in the incident pfd reduction with the increase in depth and algal concentration fig 4a and b maximum average growth rate 2 15 10 5 s 1 and biomass productivity of 49 35 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 were obtained at 0 15 m depth of the pond as illustrated in fig 5 a and b as seen from the figures the growth rate and biomass productivity increases till it reaches a threshold value at z 0 15 m with the incident pfd of 117 67 μmol photons m 2 s 1 having initial inoculum concentration of 0 01 kg m 3 with subsequent increase in depth productivity were found to decline longer residence time and higher the algal concentration with increase in depth under unmixed conditions a decline in algal productivity will be witnessed due to light attenuation similar to the conclusion of the present study chisti 2016 and bello et al 2017 had reported that irradiance declines with culture depth and further with a peak biomass concentration of 0 5 kg m 3 80 of culture lies in dark zone due to light attenuation however contrary to the above reports the study by sutherland et al 2014 proposed that the increase in pond depth results in increase in photosynthetic efficiency thereby the algal growth rate the variation in growth rate might be due to the difference in site specific environmental parameters slegers et al 2013 lipid productivity and co2 sequestration capacity also shows a similar trend with an increase in pond depth consistent with the biomass productivity fig 5b as evident from the figure maximum lipid productivity of 11 42 m3 ha 1 yr 1 with the inherent carbon capture of 65 14 tons ha 1 yr 1 at 0 15 m as the microalgal productivity declines with pond depth due to decrease in photosynthetic activity the co2 acquisition and lipid content also decreases solimeno et al 2015 and bello et al 2017 also reported similar trends das et al 2016 also showed a decrease in biomass productivity metabolite and fame content with increase in depth low growth rate and productivity at the surface might be attributed to excessive light and dehydration while the increase in depth and microalgal concentration results in inefficient light utilization owing to increased turbidity it could be concluded that for a pond of area 8000 m2 maximum permissible depth could be maintained at 0 7 m to achieve better performance nevertheless it is essential to optimise the algal pond design especially under unmixed conditions to obtain the desired microalgal productivity optimal pond depth with influence over the light and growth processes is also location dependent slegers et al 2013 further it is highly essential to operate the reactor in continuous mode to keep the microalgal concentration below a threshold limit to achieve optimum productivity 3 4 effect of photoinhibition on productivity of microalgae incident light intensity in the form of photon flux density pfd plays a significant role in influencing the areal productivity of microalgae as the growth rate is driven by par in the range of 400 700 nm das et al 2016 huesemann et al 2016 ignoring the photoinhibition effects the rate of photosynthesis thus the microalgal areal productivity increases with increament in pfd till it reaches a region of saturation where the change in pfd have little or no significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis fig 6 as illustrated in fig 6 without photoinhibition effects the areal productivity increases from 38 08 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 at 50 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to 56 26 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 with an irradiance of 200 μmol photons m 2 s 1 once the irradiance is at the saturation level there is a slight increase in photosynthesis till 62 18 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 with further increase in irradiance till 1000 μmol photons m 2 s 1 however with inclusion of photoinhibition decrease in the rate of photosynthesis due to exposure to higher irradiance because of reversible damage photooxidation of psii the areal productivity reaches a peak of 50 26 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 at 150 μmol photons m 2 s 1 with further increase in irradiance the rate of photosynthesis as well the areal biomass productivity declines fig 6 the photosynthetic efficiency for the current study has been reported to be 3 26 considering photoinhibition effects slegers et al 2013 reported the photosynthetic efficiency of 0 4 and 0 36 under open pond cultivation mode in netherland and algeria respectively with t pseudonana chisti 2016 reported that the photosynthetic rate saturates at 10 20 of the peak par as algal cultures becomes photoinhibited when par exceeds the threshold thus photoinhibition plays an essential role in understanding and maintaining the required light intensity driving the differences in theoretical and real time algal productivities the study by pfaffinger et al 2016 also proposed the idea of maintaining an optimum radiation profile based on the light attenuation effects to achieve the desired areal biomass productivity the predicted annual biomass productivity can be very well compared with the available literature showing the yearly annual productivity for open pond system at different locations as shown in table 2 banerjee and ramaswamy 2017 predicted an annual areal biomass productivity of 20 72 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 in different regions of us using the geospatial coordinates without photoinhibiton aly et al 2017 has evaluated the effect of photoinhibition on microalgal productivity in fixed and trackable photobioreactor for the entire odisha state of india at 1142 study locations the variation in productivities at different locations might be attributed to the difference in algal strain and parameters taken into consideration it is well evident from the comparison table 2 with the literature that the simulations carried out without considering the effects of photoinhibition often overestimates the areal productivity thus the inclusion of photoinhibitory effects will provide more real time estimates that facilitates the easy policy making 4 conclusion a simple yet comprehensive model was simulated to theoretically estimate the location specific microalgal growth potential the combined effects of light including attenuation and water temperature along with design and operational factors of algal ponds were studied the following conclusions were drawn from the study the maximum daily average biomass and lipid productivity of 170 28 kg dry mass ha 1 d 1 and 39 42 l ha 1 d 1 has been predicted in september with carbon capture of 224 77 kg ha 1 d 1 the year round microalgal biomass and lipid productivity along with the carbon sequestration data shows the feasibility of the site for large scale algal production and also signifies the importance of geospatial and climatic conditions over algal growth rate estimation pond depth residence time and algal concentration are essential design criteria to be considered for algal ponds the biomass productivity was found to decline with an increase in depth of pond and microalgal concentration with time due to light attenuation thus for deep ponds the biomass concentration has to be kept low to obtain the optimal biomass productivity however with lower depth ponds the biomass concentration has to be maintained at higher levels in order to attain the same productivity photoinhibition effects due to irrevocable damage of photosynthetic apparatus affect the areal productivity of microalgae maximum annual areal productivity declined to 50 26 tons dry mass ha 1 yr 1 about 19 while considering photoinhibition effects this site specific prediction at nit rourkela india would also aid policy makers on transforming the institute towards the sustainable ecocampus to meet the future educational social and environmental demands the model could assist in performance evaluation of microalgal production
