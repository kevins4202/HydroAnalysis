cfram based simulation results are summarized in fig 3 while table 4 compares the calculated failure probabilities p f m i n p f m a x p f with kim and park 2005 results obtained from the artificial neural network ann based mcs approaches i e including ann i ann ii ann iii and ann iv models with own input parameters as shown in table 5 as well as the traditional mcs using the van der meer vdm stability model it is noted here that following kim and park 2005 we also neglected the random variability of the parameters i e coefficients 6 2 and 1 0 in equations 4 and 5 respectively signifying the uncertainty of the stability model van der meer 1988b formulated as the performance state equations during the simulations in order to fairly compare the presented results with the other ones in example 3 the cfram was applied for the prediction of failure probability of mersin yacht harbor breakwater balas and ergin 2000 koç and balas 2013 in turkey the performance state function koç and

simulations fig 4 shows the summation of simulation results corresponding to p f m i n 26 66 p f m a x 57 32 and p f 27 03 we remind that for the same problem the expected most likely p m expected defuzzified p e maximum p m a x and minimum p m i n values of fuzzy failure probability from the fuzzy monte carlo simulation fmcs based on the theory of fuzzy random variables are 27 63 27 36 50 and 0 46 respectively while the probability of failure p f obtained from the traditional mcs is 42 61 koç and balas 2013 the followings can be drawn from the analysis of the numerical results 1 as shown in table 2 the failure probabilities obtained by the cfram p f m i n 53 28 p f m a x 100 and p f 53 36 are comparable with the failure probability values calculated using the traditional methods such as form p f 57 71 and mcs p f 56 41 given these presented concepts of probability szmidt and kacprzyk 1998 1999 we may have the following situations for decision making in practice i the fuzzy random failure event f with positive minimal probability p f m i n 0 is a possible event ii p f m i n can be viewed as the sure probability in which f occurs while p f m a x gives the highest possible probability in which f occurs iii and thus the obtained interval p f m i n p f m a x determines the lower and upper limit of the unknown failure probability this allows us to expect that the fuzzy random failure event will be satisfied in the future and the failure probability of the structure will not become lower than 53 28 which is the smallest with respect to the estimated non fuzzy probabilities p f p f m i n p f m a x table 2 2 it is well known that an artificial neural network approximation of the performance state function can be combined with traditional mcs for a correct assessment of the structural reliability kim and park 2005 also pointed out that their four neural network models ann i ann iv with own input parameters table 5 can give more accurate results than the empirical model vdm in estimating the stability number of rubble mound breakwaters so that they argued that their combinations with the mcs based reliability analyses are able to provide the failure probability of the considered rubble mound breakwater with smaller errors hence they have preferred the ann based reliability analysis table 4 to avoid unacceptable design results e g absolutely conservative dangerous compared to the vdm based one on the other hand it can be seen that all of the ann based reliability models yield unacceptable solutions for the same problem of structural reliability table 4 when considering the randomness and fuzziness simultaneously p f p f m i n p f m a x we also noted here that the difference between the percentages of p f m i n 0 227 and p f 0 170 is 25 11 when the ann iv based mcs was compared to the vdm based cfram this concludes that the structural reliability is not related only to the predictability of approximation of the performance state function since an ann model lacks a certain processing ability for the uncertainties i e randomness and fuzziness hidden in the data and its approximation of the performance state function is combined with traditional mcs for handling only random uncertainty as a result this combination ann mcs which is computationally very expensive can easily lead to insufficient results while the use of an inexpensive and interpretable explicit model i e vdm without needing a complicated implicit methodology e g ann can be useful and practicable during the fuzzy random reliability analysis also it must be noted here that unlike ann models it is possible easily to make some corrections on the vdm stability model with the use of an uncertainty or error analysis mertens 2007 for enhancing its modeling capability 3 as pointed in example 3 both fuzzy random reliability methods i e cfram and fmcs lead to very similar results compared to their expected outcomes p f m i n p f p m and p e and it is apparent that the result of the mcs was conservative in comparison to these results of the cfram and the fmcs this is compatible with koç and balas 2013 findings and can be explained by the difference in the representation and propagation of the uncertainties the non traditional reliability methods fmcs and cfram consider that the distribution parameters are known with a certain degree of uncertainty or fuzziness while the traditional one mcs assumes that the knowledge of the parameters is complete koç 2009 on the other hand though all of the mentioned fuzzy random reliability approaches i e cfram and fmcs take into consideration both fuzziness and randomness for the performance assessment of the structural system they offer the different aspects of expressing the fuzzy random reliability i e including fuzzy random input uncertainty quantification uncertainty propagation and performance assessment due to their theoretical and computational bases the latter was based on the fuzzy random variables theory i e utilizing the fuzzification of the parameters of distribution functions of random variables while the former involved the cloud theory i e incorporating the randomization of membership functions of fuzzy variables the use of each to quantify the mixed input uncertainties random fuzzy in a structural system imposes different requirements in the process of propagating those uncertainties through the system model establishing its effect on the system response and performance assessment i e the estimation of the system response given a particular event as summarized below the fmcs combined the fuzzy random variables theory with not only the conventional reliability methods i e the most probable point method and mcs but also the α level optimization möller et al 2000 this is also a typical strategy of using the fuzzy random variables to build the fuzzy random reliability analysis but in turn it leads to significant computational cost i e from significant compute intensive fuzzy tasks or operations due to the optimization as well as other several problems such as poor accuracy cumbersome transformations e g discussed by you et al 2019 on the other hand following the seven steps of the workflow in section 2 the cfram utilized directly the fuzzy random reliability analysis through some basic definitions of fuzzy random event probability and the application of cloud theory where the mixed input uncertainties are quantified and propagated in a similar but slightly different way in comparison to the common mcs technique this means that instead of using the two moments e x and e n the multi dimension clouds figs 2 4 considered the three numerical characteristics i e moments of the probability density functions with additional using of the hyper entropy index h e which links the randomness and fuzziness or the membership degree of each sample steps 1 and 2 as illustrated in fig 1 as well as figs 2 4 here all of the membership degrees were calculated on the basis of the entropy weight method to make them objective wang et al 2017 by eliminating the error produced by subjectively assigning the weights for each index steps 3 and 4 however they had still some uncertainty or hesitancy due to lack of knowledge during describing their membership functions atanassov 1986 and the transition from the concept of normal cloud drop to the concept of hesitant normal cloud drop was introduced to include the degree of hesitancy by using the sugeno type intuitionistic fuzzy generator step 5 thus the fuzzy random reliability was given easily as an interval p f m i n p f m a x following the probability measures on intuitionistic fuzzy sets szmidt and kacprzyk 1998 as well as the expectation method of zadeh 1968 which is simply permissive of non fuzzy crisp calculation of fuzzy random event probability steps 6 and 7 in brief compared to the traditional fuzzy random reliability analysis methods i e using the fuzzy random variables theory the presented method cfram has significantly less computational cost since it allows the computation of fuzzy random reliability without expensive iterative search optimization procedures this study also reveals that compared to the traditional mcs a more reliable and informative uncertainty analysis parhoudeh et al 2016 can be performed with a cloud theory based methodology such as cfram by slightly sacrificing the computational cost also some remarks are as follows i despite the above disadvantage of the traditional fuzzy random reliability methods e g fmcs their outcomes are fuzzy sets e g fuzzy reliability index or fuzzy failure probability with different degrees of memberships corresponding to the different bounds of reliability and thus it provides more information than does its crisp value as obtained by cfram as well as mcs koç and balas 2013 however a fuzzy result is too complicated to be used in practice and it frequently needs to be defuzzified into its expected crisp value hence the interval fuzzy random reliability which is preferred in this study is defined by the expectations of upper and lower bounds of the failure probability and thus they can give a more intuitive and informative evaluation of the reliability compared to the expected defuzzified value of the reliability ii the cfram was used to estimate the fuzzy random reliability for a set of explicit performance state functions which are based on the most known and used functions in coastal engineering design practice however it should be noted that there is no theoretical reason to expect that an explicit performance state function based reliability methodology is not useful or practicable for implicit performance state function you et al 2019 li and nie 2018 shufang et al 2014 kim and park 2005 gomes and awruch 2004 and this issue can be further handled in future studies iii the studies on the fuzzy random structural reliability analysis are in the exploration phase hence it is still very essential to know the relative advantages of alternative ways of handling fuzzy random uncertainties in fuzzy random reliability and what should the best method be for fuzzy random reliability is yet an open question 4 conclusion the results of the numerical and engineering implementations of the presented fuzzy random reliability analysis method cfram show that it has the ability to easily overcomes the disadvantages of traditional as well as non traditional reliability analysis methods hence it has good potential to assess the fuzzy random reliability of not only coastal but also other engineering structures credit authorship contribution statement mehmet levent koç conceptualization methodology software validation writing original

balas 2013 is defined as equation 6 consisting of five random design variables table 6 6 g 3 x y h δ d n k d cot θ 1 3 h s where h s is the significant wave height δ is the relative density of tetrapod in water k d is the stability coefficient θ is the angle of the slope of the breakwater from the horizontal plane and y h is the stochastic variable spm 1984 we take e x i x x i e n i σ x i h e i 0 1 e n i ε 1 and n 10000 the parameters x x i and σ x i of the non normal variable h s with fisher tippet i distribution are set to their equivalent normal counterparts at the beginning of simulations fig 4 shows the summation of simulation results corresponding to p f m i n 26 66 p f m a x 57 32 and p f 27 03 we remind that for the same problem the expected most likely p m expected defuzzified p e maximum p m a x and minimum p m i n values of fuzzy failure probability from the fuzzy monte carlo simulation fmcs based on the theory of fuzzy random variables are 27 63 27 36 50 and 0 46 respectively while the probability of failure p f obtained from the traditional mcs is 42 61 koç and balas 2013 the followings can be drawn from the analysis of the numerical results 1 as shown in table 2 the failure probabilities obtained by the cfram p f m i n 53 28 p f m a x 100 and p f 53 36 are comparable with the failure probability values calculated using the traditional methods such as form p f 57 71 and mcs p f 56 41 given these presented concepts of probability szmidt and kacprzyk 1998 1999 we may have the following situations for decision making in practice i the fuzzy random failure event f with positive minimal probability p f m i n 0 is a possible event ii p f m i n can be viewed as the sure probability in which f occurs while p f m a x gives the highest possible probability in which f occurs iii and thus the obtained interval p f m i n p f m a x determines the lower and upper limit of the unknown failure probability this allows us to expect that the fuzzy random failure event will be satisfied in the future and the failure probability of the structure will not become lower than 53 28 which is the smallest with respect to the estimated non fuzzy probabilities p f p f m i n p f m a x table 2 2 it is well known that an artificial neural network approximation of the performance state function can be combined with traditional mcs for a correct assessment of the structural reliability kim and park 2005 also pointed out that their four neural network models ann i ann iv with own input parameters table 5 can give more accurate results than the empirical model vdm in estimating the stability number of rubble mound breakwaters so that they argued that their combinations with the mcs based reliability analyses are able to provide the failure probability of the considered rubble mound breakwater with smaller errors hence they have preferred the ann based reliability analysis table 4 to avoid unacceptable design results e g absolutely conservative dangerous compared to the vdm based one on the other hand it can be seen that all of the ann based reliability models yield unacceptable solutions for the same problem of structural reliability table 4 when considering the randomness and fuzziness simultaneously p f p f m i n p f m a x we also noted here that the difference between the percentages of p f m i n 0 227 and p f 0 170 is 25 11 when the ann iv based mcs was compared to the vdm based cfram this concludes that the structural reliability is not related only to the predictability of approximation of the performance state function since an ann model lacks a certain processing ability for the uncertainties i e randomness and fuzziness hidden in the data and its approximation of the performance state function is combined with traditional mcs for handling only random uncertainty as a result this combination ann mcs which is computationally very expensive can easily lead to insufficient results while the use of an inexpensive and interpretable explicit model i e vdm without needing a complicated implicit methodology e g ann can be useful and practicable during the fuzzy random reliability analysis also it must be noted here that unlike ann models it is possible easily to make some corrections on the vdm stability model with the use of an uncertainty or error analysis mertens 2007 for enhancing its modeling capability 3 as pointed in example 3 both fuzzy random reliability methods i e cfram and fmcs lead to very similar results compared to their expected outcomes p f m i n p f p m and p e and it is apparent that the result of the mcs was conservative in comparison to these results of the cfram and the fmcs this is compatible with koç and balas 2013 findings and can be explained by the difference in the representation and propagation of the uncertainties the non traditional reliability methods fmcs and cfram consider that the distribution parameters are known with a certain degree of uncertainty or fuzziness while the traditional one mcs assumes that the knowledge of the parameters is complete koç 2009 on the other hand though all of the mentioned fuzzy random reliability approaches i e cfram and fmcs take into consideration both fuzziness and randomness for the performance assessment of the structural system they offer the different aspects of expressing the fuzzy random reliability i e including fuzzy random input uncertainty quantification uncertainty propagation and performance assessment due to their theoretical and computational bases the latter was based on the fuzzy random variables theory i e utilizing the fuzzification of the parameters of distribution functions of random variables while the former involved the cloud theory i e incorporating the randomization of membership functions of fuzzy variables the use of each to quantify the mixed input uncertainties random fuzzy in a structural system imposes different requirements in the process of propagating those uncertainties through the system model establishing its effect on the system response and performance assessment i e the estimation of the system response given a particular event as summarized below the fmcs combined the fuzzy random variables theory with not only the conventional reliability methods i e the most probable point method and mcs but also the α level optimization möller et al 2000 this is also a typical strategy of using the fuzzy random variables to build the fuzzy random reliability analysis but in turn it leads to significant computational cost i e from significant compute intensive fuzzy tasks or operations due to the optimization as well as other several problems such as poor accuracy cumbersome transformations e g discussed by you et al 2019 on the other hand following the seven steps of the workflow in section 2 the cfram utilized directly the fuzzy random reliability analysis through some basic definitions of fuzzy random event probability and the application of cloud theory where the mixed input uncertainties are quantified and propagated in a similar but slightly different way in comparison to the common mcs technique this means that instead of using the two moments e x and e n the multi dimension clouds figs 2 4 considered the three numerical characteristics i e moments of the probability density functions with additional using of the hyper entropy index h e which links the randomness and fuzziness or the membership degree of each sample steps 1 and 2 as illustrated in fig 1 as well as figs 2 4 here all of the membership degrees were calculated on the basis of the entropy weight method to make them objective wang et al 2017 by eliminating the error produced by subjectively assigning the weights for each index steps 3 and 4 however they had still some uncertainty or hesitancy due to lack of knowledge during describing their membership functions atanassov 1986 and the transition from the concept of normal cloud drop to the concept of hesitant normal cloud drop was introduced to include the degree of hesitancy by using the sugeno type intuitionistic fuzzy generator step 5 thus the fuzzy random reliability was given easily as an interval p f m i n p f m a x following the probability measures on intuitionistic fuzzy sets szmidt and kacprzyk 1998 as well as the expectation method of zadeh 1968 which is simply permissive of non fuzzy crisp calculation of fuzzy random event probability steps 6 and 7 in brief compared to the traditional fuzzy random reliability analysis methods i e using the fuzzy random variables theory the presented method cfram has significantly less computational cost since it allows the computation of fuzzy random reliability without expensive iterative search optimization procedures this study also reveals that compared to the traditional mcs a more reliable and informative uncertainty analysis parhoudeh et al 2016 can be performed with a cloud theory based methodology such as cfram by slightly sacrificing the computational cost also some remarks are as follows i despite the above disadvantage of the traditional fuzzy random reliability methods e g fmcs their outcomes are fuzzy sets e g fuzzy reliability index or fuzzy failure probability with different degrees of memberships corresponding to the different bounds of reliability and thus it provides more information than does its crisp value as obtained by cfram as well as mcs koç and balas 2013 however a fuzzy result is too complicated to be used in practice and it frequently needs to be defuzzified into its expected crisp value hence the interval fuzzy random reliability which is preferred in this study is defined by the expectations of upper and lower bounds of the failure probability and thus they can give a more intuitive and informative evaluation of the reliability compared to the expected defuzzified value of the reliability ii the cfram was used to estimate the fuzzy random reliability for a set of explicit performance state functions which are based on the most known and used functions in coastal engineering design practice however it should be noted that there is no theoretical reason to expect that an explicit performance state function based reliability methodology is not useful or practicable for implicit performance state function you et al 2019 li and nie 2018 shufang et al 2014 kim and park 2005 gomes and awruch 2004 and this issue can be further handled in future studies iii the studies on the fuzzy random structural reliability analysis are in the exploration phase hence it is still very essential to know the relative advantages of alternative ways of handling fuzzy random uncertainties in fuzzy random reliability and what should the best method be for fuzzy random reliability is yet an open question 4 conclusion the results of the numerical and engineering implementations of the presented fuzzy random reliability analysis method cfram show that it has the ability to easily overcomes the disadvantages of traditional as well as non traditional reliability analysis methods hence it has good potential to assess the fuzzy random

21776,a meshless cfd method is proposed for numerical simulation of incompressible flows and estimation of hydrodynamic loads during green water events in this paper governing equations are described in finite differences context where spatial operators are derived using weighted least squares volume conservative lagrangian advection is handled by solving a set of geometrical constraints while adjusting to moving boundaries represented by triangulated meshes the validation of the method is performed by simulating four green water experiments on fixed and moving structures and comparing the kinematics of flow and hydrodynamic loads during impacts it is shown that the method accurately reproduces patterns of waves that are wetting the deck as well as the pressure distribution along the deck the resulting method intrinsically handles violent fluid structure interaction with free surface fragmentation while providing second order accurate pressure field keywords green water lagrangian meshless finite differences impact pressure fpso 1 introduction a green water event is characterised by some amount of rapidly moving water which interacts with a moving ship these events include violent fluid structure interaction and therefore need to be examined with the physics of the structure and fluid flow considered in a coupled manner to accurately estimate hydrodynamic loads during the interaction there are hundreds of scientific papers and research reports that deal with green water effects i e the physics of water on deck and possible prediction methods temarel et al 2015 in their review conclude that the green water problem has been investigated experimentally and numerically but with very limited success the issues arise due to the fact that green water is very difficult to measure either under laboratory conditions or in the field and very difficult to simulate numerically the problem due its fast moving multiphase and highly turbulent nature is not very amenable for accurate numerical simulation although three dimensional 3d models help to understand and simulate the mechanisms of green water impinging on deck computations of green water loads with various wave headings are still a challenge yamasaki et al 2005 developed a finite difference method fdm to predict the water impact pressure caused by green water phenomena where the density function method was employed in the framework of a locally refined overlapping grid system colicchio et al 2010 analysed the water shipping caused by head sea waves for a floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel at rest with a 3d domain decomposition strategy where a linear potential flow seakeeping analysis of the vessel is coupled with a local nonlinear rotational flow investigation for the prediction of water on deck phenomena greco and lugni 2012 and greco et al 2012 conducted a synergic 3d experimental and numerical investigation for wave ship interactions involving the water on deck and slamming phenomena a weakly nonlinear external solution for the wave ship interactions was combined with a two dimensional 2d shallow water approximation lee et al 2017 studied the behaviour of green water impacting a fixed rectangular structure and investigated the flow kinematics of a series of experiments and cfd simulations based on the finite volume method fvm gatin et al 2018 validated a fvm solver for green water simulations by employing volume of fluid vof and ghost fluid method gfm to discretise the free surface boundary conditions at the interface mesh based methods for solving partial differential equations pdes have achieved adequate success and they have been applied in computational ship hydrodynamics during the ship wave interaction simulation requires large mesh deformations by cautious node movements or re meshing of deforming areas to avoid mesh tangling and loss of its regularity alternatively the overset grid technique can be used for rigid body motion in free floating body simulations östman et al 2014 lagrangian meshless or mesh free methods have emerged with the goal of avoiding difficulties encountered in conventional mesh based methods mesh free methods adapt to domains with complex and changing geometries and moving phase boundaries without the complexity that is usually required within methods that rely on topological data structures gotoh and khayyer 2018 made a review of state of the art meshless methods that are applicable on ocean engineering problems taking into account the problem of green water dalrymple and rogers 2006 analysed the potential of the sph method for wave structure interactions by reproducing breaking waves that overtop the deck shibata et al 2009 have proposed a variant of the moving particle semi implicit mps method and compared the estimated pressure with the experiments for a ship in head waves the investigation has shown that there is still some lack of agreement in terms of both pressure and forces acting on the deck due to relevant oscillations in time shibata et al 2012 extended the mps method for a 3d ship motion under high wave height conditions where shipping of water occurs the nonlinear effect of shipping water was successfully simulated by the mps method although quantitative differences between the calculated and experimental results still remained bellezi et al 2013a b analysed the green water phenomenon on 3d models using the mps method they focused on the validation of the method comparing the numerical results with experimental results for green water on reduced scale models gómez gesteira et al 2005 analysed the phenomena within the framework of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method and noted how the flow in the wave crest is split into two showing a different behaviour above and below the deck le touzé et al 2010 applied the sph method to predict the fluid behaviour for two different dynamic flooding scenarios the interaction between a ship and travelling waves and the transient flooding behaviour that occurs on a side collision between two ships pakozdi et al 2012 showed the feasibility of the sph method to give more detailed forecast of the hydrodynamics on the deck than the simplified water on deck estimation the green water problem arising due to complex physics is a significant problem for ships and offshore structures and the listed numerical methods give limited insight in determining the occurrence and magnitude of green water loads consequently classification societies seek for new procedures that may approve and improve designs of new buildings commonly used meshless methods have different advantages and disadvantages gotoh and khayyer 2018 a promising class of meshless methods concerning the solution accuracy are generalised finite difference methods gfdm which are strong form methods that usually rely on moving least squares mls as they can be extended to reach arbitrary order of accuracy since gfdms do not require basis functions or quadrature boundary and interface conditions can be implemented in a straightforward manner tiwari and kuhnert 2003 introduced a lagrangian gfdm called finite pointset method fpm for simulating incompressible flows based on chorin s projection method the fpm was recently generalised to work on dynamically changing interfaces suchde and kuhnert 2019 it was successfully applied to fsi problems kuhnert et al 2019 and for simulating free surface flow about ships lu et al 2016 finite point method not to be confused with fpm is a mesh free eulerian gfdm that stabilises the discrete differential equations by balancing momentum in the finite control domain oñate et al 1996 which was extended to lagrangian formulation for solving dam break problems in 2d rodolfo idelsohn et al 2001 fu et al 2020 applied a gfdm to simulate interaction of waves and a cylinder array which was reduced to a 2d formulation wang et al 2018 proposed a lagrangian mesh free finite difference particle method fdpm with variable stencil sizes for solving wave equations suchde and kuhnert 2017 analysed volume conservation errors when performing lagrangian advection in gfdms one of keys problems with mls based gfdms besides volume conservation is that they express the vector space of polynomials up to an arbitrary order which are approximated by solving a linear system for each point at each time step size of the system depends on number of neighbours and basis vector which may be costly for 3d time dependent problems in addition gfdms may have difficulties when describing linear system of equations i e the system may be hardly solvable since the matrix may not be an m matrix seibold 2008 investigated least squares approaches that fail to yield positive stencils and introduced a technique of selecting neighbours that ensure an m matrix structure for poisson problems this paper introduces a new lagrangian gfdm built as a compromise between fast but oscillatory sph mps methods and slow but accurate mls based methods the method is based on the weighted least squares wls operators which require slight computational cost each time step in a unsteady simulation but still yield second order convergence for poisson problems on irregular point clouds as mls based methods do basic et al 2018 moreover the stencils produce an m matrix for the system of navier stokes equations nse which are represented in the poisson pressure equation ppe form instead of the commonly used projection method finally it is worth noting that the lagrangian advection is volume conservative these are important ingredients for obtaining accurate flow kinematics and pressure fields for problems in marine hydrodynamics the method is based on the following hypotheses the lagrangian description of flow naturally describes the advection of fluid with the free surface as compared to the eulerian description of flow it is possible to solve the nonlinear problem of green water with high fidelity by solving nse in ppe form based on the lagrangian description of flow and wls the global domain can be decomposed to improve computational efficiency by coupling the lagrangian nonlinear region with some simpler solver for the outside region the remainder of the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the governing equations their numerical counterparts and the solution algorithm the method is validated by 2d numerical experiments described in section 3 and by 3d simulations of wave ship interactions of a fixed and a heaving fpso model in section 4 the results of the simulations are further discussed in section 5 and the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 numerical methodology 2 1 governing equations for an incompressible fluid the nse form the time dependent initial boundary value problem 1 d u d t 1 ρ p ν 2 u g x ω 2 u 0 x ω γ 3 u u x γ 4 u t 0 u 0 x ω where d d t is the lagrangian or material derivative u is the velocity ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid g is the external acceleration acting on the fluid u is the boundary velocity and u 0 is the initial velocity the time and spatial dependency from eqs 1 4 is implied and the fluid is moving in a r d domain ω bounded by the boundary γ where the number of dimensions are d 2 or d 3 the initial condition eq 4 should satisfy eq 2 i e u 0 0 the system 1 4 can be discretised in a variety of ways but in any case the pressure field must maintain solenoidal divergence free condition of the velocity field defined by eq 2 an accurate but also costly way to numerically advance eq 1 is to solve for u and p in a fully coupled manner since the pressure term in eq 1 is not explicitly dependent on time t cfd methods often employ schemes that decouple velocity and pressure velocity pressure formulations are efficient while not suffering from the numerical boundary layers or restrictions in temporal accuracy johnston and liu 2004 shirokoff and rosales 2011 the pressure is treated explicitly in time 5 p x p u x x ω γ where p is the function that yields the pressure for any given velocity field that solves the nse the incompressibility constraint eq 2 is replaced by a pressure poisson equation ppe therefore decoupling the computation of the momentum and kinematic equations 6 2 p ρ g d u d t in ω n p ρ n t u g ν u on γ where n is the normal on the boundary surface which was used to dot eq 1 to obtain the boundary condition in eq 6 as described by johnston and liu 2004 the gravitational acceleration is taken as constant hence it holds g 0 the divergence operator and material derivative in eq 6 are not interchangeable and by straightforward differentiation of the material derivative caltagirone and vincent 2020 it can be shown that the divergence of acceleration equals to 7 d u d t t u u 2 u u where the partial derivative and divergence operator are commutative therefore eq 7 is zero at all time in continuous context due to eq 2 on account of initial conditions truncation errors machine precision and other sources of errors the velocity divergence will not be zero in the numerical computation henshaw et al 1994 noted that adding some amount of numerically estimated velocity divergence volume compression λ f u will damp the continuity errors in time shirokoff and rosales 2011 showed that adding this parameter forces exponential decay of the velocity divergence to zero the choice of parameter λ f is explained in section 2 3 furthermore shirokoff and rosales 2011 noted that some amount of difference between extrapolated fluid velocity at the boundary and the boundary itself λ b u u should be added to the neumann boundary condition to improve the stability by damping continuity errors near boundaries neglecting surface tension effects and assuming the continuous dynamic viscosity across the interface it follows that the boundary condition for the pressure at the interface is simply the zero dirichlet condition by obtaining the pressure using eq 6 the momentum eq 1 can be solved with an implicit or explicit treatment of the viscous term as the viscosity does not influence investigated flows significantly the term is treated explicitly therefore the lagrangian formulation of eq 1 is an ordinary differential equation ode d u d t f u which can be solved explicitly using the solved velocity field an explicit second order integration is used to update locations of points the numerics to the above mathematical formulations are given in the following sections future work will investigate implicit calculation of the velocity following gatin et al 2018 turbulence modelling is not employed when simulating green water events turbulence effects are of minor importance during the impact but viscosity effects are important at the time interval at which the flow develops before the wave front hits an obstacle park et al 2012 nonlinearities that occur when the wave hits the moving ship are of high importance for further development of the flow that produces eddies jets and backflow lagrangian nature of the nse proper discretisation of the viscous term and point cloud density adequately reproduce eddies and rapid jets in order to suppress the errors that come out of assumptions when the flow on the deck is computed locally colicchio et al 2010 but to keep the computational performance on a high level the complete domain is decomposed into two physically overlapping domains as drawn in fig 2 high fidelity hf domain can be of small size i e encircling only the area of interest while imposing the flow calculated by the lower fidelity lf solver for the large domain the introduced method in this paper solves the hf flow while being indifferent to the type of lf solver one way coupling concept is used in which the hf domains tries to capture all nonlinearities that the lf solver cannot simulate accurately therefore the lf solution is imposed through boundary conditions at the specified inlet shown in fig 2 where lf domain provides the pressure and velocity fields and free surface elevation information consequently the specified inlet of hf domain in fig 2 imposes dirichlet boundary condition for the pressure and velocity p x p l f x and u x u l f x the other boundaries of the hf domain impose the neumann boundary condition for the pressure n p ρ n g the following sections describe how this is treated in the discrete context this means that the proposed model can deal with arbitrary external input conditions provided the velocity and the pressure can be given by lf domain on the inlet at each time step as an example simple linear incident wave combined with the stretching above the mean water level is chosen for generating regular waves in section 4 8 u x x z t η a ω cosh k z h sinh k h cos ω t k x 9 u z x z t η a ω sinh k z h sinh k h sin ω t k x where η a is the wave amplitude ω is the wave frequency k is the wave number and h is the water depth the pressure is defined as p x z t ρ η a g cosh k z h cosh k h cos ω t k x since the linear wave theory is limited to infinitesimally small waves stretching modification by wheeler 1970 is used to scale the vertical coordinate that are initially above the waterlines other more complex nonlinear waves could easily be adapted stream function for regular waves higher order spectral waves for irregular waves etc 2 2 spatial discretisation a mesh free or meshless system is described by a set of points ω the set of points is usually referred to as the point cloud which does not include topology or connectivity information as drawn in fig 1 each point in the set i ω retains relevant characteristics of the system at its location x i t in a specific time instant t since there is no connectivity information the differential volume at some location x of the continuous domain must be distributed among points that are near x which form a set n usually referred to as neighbour points compactly supported methods introduce a continuous positive and symmetric weighting function w r h that dictates the strength of the interaction between two neighbour points based on the distance between them r the arbitrary chosen radius of the compact sphere h captures the set of neighbour points as shown in fig 1 i e w 0 for r h for the sake of simplicity h is assumed constant for all points choosing the weighting function and compact sphere radius is a demanding task because numerical errors may be introduced by choosing too large h or too blunt shape of the weighting function on the other hand too small h may lead to instabilities therefore a compact sphere must overlap with nearest neighbour points and w should monotonically decrease with the increase in r moreover weighting may incorporate properties such as a particle s mass or volume etc interpolation if a function is defined at discrete locations in space one must define how to approximate values in between points interpolation of a function f x at an arbitrary coordinate x uses discrete function values at the neighbour points which can be written as 10 f x j n w j f j j n w j where denotes the discrete version of the expression n is the set of neighbouring points in the compact sphere f j is the discrete value of function f at x j f j f x j and w j describes the weight of the neighbouring interpolation point j w j w x x j h a compact radius that is too large or the shape of the interpolation weighting function that is too blunt can lead to excessive numerical diffusion the compact sphere should include the nearest neighbour points which will yield voronoi like interpolation hopkins 2015 gradient following lanson and vila 2008a the wls renormalisation tensor may be introduced 11 b i j n w i j x i j x i j t 1 where w i j w x i j h and x i j x j x i for a scalar function f x that is defined at discrete locations of points in the set ω the discrete gradient is defined at those locations by the following expression 12 f i j n w i j f i f j b i x i j the derivation of the wls based discrete gradient can be found in basic et al 2018 and convergence theorems are presented in lanson and vila 2008a b this method of calculating approximate spatial derivatives is second order accurate and can be used on a highly irregular distribution of points the term b i x i j in eq 12 can be interpreted as a part of the hamilton operator so the discrete divergence operator can be written as 13 f i j n w i j b i x i j f i f j and the discrete curl operator can be written as 14 f i j n w i j b i x i j f i f j directional derivative appropriate boundary points are generated each time step by projecting onto near boundary surfaces which is explained in section 2 3 due to projecting onto the boundary geometry the closest fluid point to the boundary lies along the normal of the generated boundary point it follows that the second order directional derivative at the boundary may be defined through taylor s series as 15 n f i n f c x i j 2 2 f j where n f c f i f j x i j is evaluated by central fds between the boundary and fluid points fig 3 renders how eq 15 extrapolates from known derivative values along the boundary normal laplacian studies by fatehi and manzari 2011 ma et al 2016 and tamai et al 2017 showed that classical meshless discretisations of the laplacian should be corrected to yield adequate accuracy of discrete approximation or when solving poisson problems basic et al 2018 derived a class of corrected meshless laplacians based on the wls gradient eq 12 and taylor s series which were validated to work on highly irregular point clouds the formulation of the discrete laplacian operator used in this study is defined as 16 2 f i 2 d j n w i j f i f j 1 x i j b i o i j n w i j x i j 2 1 x i j b i o i where o i is the offset vector of the point i defined as 17 o i j n w i j x i j that describes the weighted centre of neighbouring points i e the offset vector points from the point i location in the direction where the neighbourhood point arrangement dominates basic et al 2018 validated that renormalisation stabilises the operator when approximating the laplacian of a scalar field and that it yields second order accuracy when solving the poisson equation while the uncompensated original formulations yields first order accuracy it can be seen that the spatial derivatives eqs 12 16 are defined through least squares in form of finite differences renormalisation helps avoiding to use large neighbourhood stencils if δ is some initial spacing between adjacent points h can be taken as 2 δ h 3 δ as explained in the following sections the introduced operators are directly used to formulate discrete versions of the equations defined in section 2 1 and therefore simulate incompressible flow with complex boundary geometry and boundary conditions 2 3 pressure equation boundary points to allow for flexible and moving boundaries geometry can be represented in any form e g analytically or as polygonal surface meshes therefore boundary points need to be generated at the geometry interface each time step as rendered in fig 4 fluid points which lie on the edge of the point cloud and are located near the boundaries are projected onto those boundaries new points for the current time step are then generated on the projected locations since lf solution is known behind the inlet boundary points are generated to be distanced by δ as rendered in fig 4 this preserving of regularity was shown to yield better convergence which also holds for the open boundary condition finally generated boundary points are assigned the boundary condition type velocity and acceleration of the wall at their corresponding locations it is straightforward to impose body motions in the simulation by moving boundary surfaces representing the body the velocity vector of a point x moving with the rigid body must account for the body rotation ω u x u c o g ω x x c o g where u c o g is the velocity vector at the body centre of gravity cog and x c o g is the global coordinate of the body cog pressure solving recall that all derivatives are written as weighted summation of finite differences between interacting points and now that the boundary points are known it is straightforward to construct a linear system of equations written in the matrix form as 18 a p b where a is the coefficients matrix p is the vector containing pressure solutions for all points forming the system and b is the vector containing the right hand side values for interior fluid points the rows in a are described by eq 16 and according to henshaw et al 1994 the right hand side entry is b i λ f i u i where λ f i is taken as c i max δ and c i max is the largest absolute difference in speed between points in the compact sphere using λ f δ t 1 would try to force the incompressibility condition immediately which leads to an overshoot of predicting values for the next step followed by oscillations cheng et al 2018 the rows in the matrix a that describe solid boundary points i e the neumann boundary condition employ the discrete directional derivative eq 15 rather than directly using eq 12 which would be only first order accurate as all neighbours are located on one side from the boundary point the right hand side for boundary points is simply written b i n i where n i is the known neumann condition to be imposed based on the boundary conditions from section 2 1 free surface points impose a dirichlet boundary condition p i b i 0 it will be shown how the points are always organised and therefore the laplacian may be used to distinguish points on free surface that are missing neighbours i e j n 1 x i j b i o i may be seen as non dimensional volume taken by neighbours consequently the sum for points located on the edge of a point cloud yields values close to zero 3 evidently the coefficient matrix a is not symmetric a fd matrix is called essentially irreducible if every point is connected to a dirichlet boundary point meaning that each fluid clump includes at least one free surface point the matrix a is essentially diagonally dominant see eqs 16 and 15 and each point is connected to some dirichlet point thus satisfying the strict diagonal dominance in addition eq 16 can be forced to yield positive stencils by using absolute value of 1 x i j b i o i which should any way be positive after points are reorganised therefore a is an m matrix because it is discretised by positive stencils and every point has a path to a dirichlet point seibold 2008 in conclusion appropriate iterative solvers such as bicgstab and qmrcgstab have been shown to always converge 2 4 time integration velocity time integration of the velocity at each discrete fluid point is performed by integrating the momentum equation as described in section 2 1 the discrete version of eq 1 is 19 d u d t 1 ρ p ν 2 u g where the pressure gradient term p is calculated by eq 12 the diffusion term ν 2 u is approximated by eq 16 using the current velocity field since it is taken as constant throughout the time step due to impulsive and inertia dominated nature of flows under consideration the lagrangian acceleration term in eq 19 is described by the second order backward euler approximation which is given for constant time stepping as 20 d u d t 3 u i n 1 4 u i n u i n 1 2 δ t o δ t 2 where n n 1 and n 1 are the current next and previous time steps respectively the velocity vector u n 1 is the only unknown in the ode 19 which is directly calculated after the velocity is obtained relaxation zones are employed to solve issues near domain boundaries fuhrman et al 2006 by weighting between the computed solution of u n 1 and some target solution as drawn in fig 5 the flow solution may be rotational or reverting near the open boundary u γ n 0 or it may be accelerating into the domain n u γ t 0 therefore in zones near open boundaries flow is relaxed so that it flows normal to the boundary as drawn in fig 5 displacement lagrangian movement of each fluid point is done also by the backward euler approximation using the velocity of current and previous time steps the new position of each fluid point i is calculated as 21 x i n 1 x i n 3 2 u i n 1 2 u i n 1 δ t which suchde and kuhnert 2017 calls a second order point cloud movement a point moves along its streamline which leads to the distortion of the particle distribution and eventually introduces volume conservation errors reordering after the explicit movement points in the point cloud are reordered so that each point keeps its volume constant to respect the continuity constraint which is done by enforcing equidistant neighbours x i j const this optimisation problem is solved by position based dynamics pbd technique where points are iteratively slightly displaced as described by macklin and müller 2013 pbd solves a set of nonlinear constraints to enforce constant density using jacobi iterations which is unconditionally stable and without time dependency and parameters tweaking free surface points are not allowed to displace along free surface normals after the reorganisation of points the velocity of displaced points needs to be interpolated eq 10 is applied on each new location while the neighbours around that points are found using the non displaced locations in the interpolation stage h δ so only relevant neighbours are chosen and numerical diffusion is kept to a minimum for points that have not displaced significantly and for very small time steps in addition to fluid points in the domain pbd neatly organises wave inlet points that have entered the domain that are described in the previous section finally after the reordering temporary points that enter the fluid domain after the movement are converted to fluid points and those that leave the domain are simply removed from the simulation the time step was kept low enough that only one row of inlet points shown in fig 4 would cross the boundary but in future the method will try to deal with multiple number of rows entering the domain although the advection step is unconditionally stable time step constraints for explicitly solving eq 19 still apply cummins and rudman 1999 i e δ t cfl δ u m a x where u m a x is the maximum fluid speed 2 5 solution procedure the simulation input file does not incorporate any volumetric mesh but only bounding surfaces of the domain and objects in the scene generally a body of liquid is surrounded by various boundaries solid walls virtual boundaries inflow outflow symmetry and the fluid free surface the space is automatically filled starting from the defined flooding locations by generating points with defined initial spacing δ until nearest boundaries are reached the concept of the flood filling is schematically rendered in fig 6 after the boundary geometry and fluid points are initialised the solver iterates in time the following procedure move boundary geometry and advect points as explained in section 2 4 discard points that are out of the domain promote inlet points that entered the domain generate boundary points as explained in section 2 3 compute renormalisation tensors for spatial operators solve the pressure using an iterative matrix free solver as explained in section 2 3 advance velocity by solving eq 19 as explained in section 2 4 relax the velocity within relaxation zones 2 6 implementation the implementation called rhoxyz was programmed using data parallel algorithms and a hpc library named kokkos carter edwards et al 2014 and can run on gpus and cpus when talking about data parallelism the number of cores is the most important factor e g 32 high end cpu cores seems much but is not when compared to 4500 processing units in a high end gpu the gpu was shown to perform 20 times better than cpu for large numbers of points i e less than a second per time step is needed for advancing 1 million meshless points on a high end gpu due to lack of the topology information in the meshless point cloud each point must find its neighbours inside the compact domain at each time instant to perform the interaction background grids are usually employed to avoid testing of all points with each other the cartesian background grid was implemented within the solver by employing atomically built linked lists barbieri et al 2013 which allow dynamic insertion of temporary boundary points into cells the pressure is solved using the matrix free technique müller et al 2013 instead of preparing the system matrix before solving the matrix row and vector multiplication is repeatedly done when needed 3 green water by dam breaking 3 1 wave patterns hernández fontes et al 2018 experimentally investigated the generation of isolated events of green water on a fixed structure using the wet dam break approach the authors verified that it is possible to reproduce different types of green water resembling those obtained with unbroken regular waves reported in literature the experimental setup is shown in fig 7 where h 450 mm w 335 mm h 1 150 mm l 1 195 mm l 2 505 mm and l 3 300 mm the testing matrix is presented in table 1 the authors of the experiment chose the ratios h 0 h 1 such that waves with undular bores are generated each test was repeated five times and the calculated average values given in table 1 are chosen as simulation input parameters fig 8 shows the free surface patterns captured by the video camera during the experiments which are compared to those obtained by the numerical simulations the images captured the situation 120 ms after the water level reached the deck level the simulations have successfully reproduced three different wave patterns from the experiments described by hernández fontes et al 2018 first four cases 1 to 4 form a plunging wave on the deck and an elliptical cavity at the deck leading edge cases with lower depth i e higher freeboards form steeper waves whose peaks are close to the deck leading edge the case 4 is transitional in which a mild wave is formed while wetting the deck the case 5 forms the second pattern where the water simply rises above the deck level while the wave peak is still far from reaching the structure while the image from the 3d experiment shows no cavity the ideally 2d simulation forms a very small cavity the third pattern generated by the last two cases 6 and 7 forms a large cavity and a fluid arm that falls under gravity effects hits the deck and traps the cavity air this type of pattern is sometimes referred to as hammer fist the peak of the travelling wave is near the deck edge or above the deck hernández fontes et al 2018 note that the cases 1 and 6 have the largest cavities for their water height ratios presented in table 1 the scalar fields qualitatively showing magnitude of the velocity in fig 8 validate the formation of water patterns on the deck the main concentration of the velocity magnitude is located near the deck corner where the high pressure gradient develops such high gradient develops due to the proximity of the moving free surface with zero pressure to the vertical wall that experiences impact with high pressure therefore this pressure gradient accelerates the flow around the corner which results in air cavities formed depending on the magnitude of the pressure gradient areas of high velocity magnitude are also generated around the wave peaks that travel towards the structure the water in case 5 smoothly progresses onto the deck due to the low pressure gradient near the corner and the wave peak which remained far from the deck therefore the resulting complex motion of the shape of free surface stems from the pressure gradient evolution near the interface and along the structure wall in conclusion the resulting free surfaces for the test cases shown in fig 8 are properly reproduced by the numerical method hernández fontes et al 2018 demonstrated that it is possible to generate isolated green water events of different types on a fixed structure using the wet dam break approach and here it is demonstrated that these green water events of different types may also be numerically reproduced future work will deal with simulating yet untested scenarios with various parameters to find new forms of isolated green water events the dynamics of dam breaking is sometimes not modelled in numerical experiments i e the dam or gate simply disappears instead of moving upwards or breaking in cases of dam breaks over a wet bed the movement of the gate plays an important role for forming the incoming wave and affects the impact pressure on the wall downstream ye et al 2016 the described numerical experiments needed to incorporate precise gate movement as modifying the gate velocity for e g 10 leads to completely different wave pattern than the expected two probes wp0 and wp1 which are depicted in fig 7 measured the water depth at locations 150 mm left and 250 mm downstream from the gate respectively fig 9 compares the measurements made in two simulations to those obtained experimentally since the authors of the experiment note that the gate release was tuned to ensure opening times t 2 h 1 g by using a free fall weight it was challenging to reproduce the exact movements from the experiment the two simulations differ only in the imposed movement for the gate it can be seen that slightly varying the gate movement yield different steepness of the incoming wave nevertheless the numerically obtained values at wave probes are in very good agreement to the experimental data it should be noted that the bump detected by wp1 probe is a small wave that travels backwards after opening the gate due to a vortex forming by the accelerating flow around the moving gate bottom both simulations have reproduced this phenomenon finally the backflow wave causes oscillations in numerical readings because the numerical wave height sensor registers the highest point below its location without smooth interpolation for the sake of completeness of the analysis it is worth noting that without the gate the high water column falls under the action of gravity and forms a mushroom like jet structure stansby et al 1988 the mushroom grows while travelling downstream and eventually the front breaks the broken wave front continues travelling downstream while inducing subsequent small scale wave breakings this flow development significantly affects the wave pattern on the deck which is characterised mostly by separation of fluid clumps from the incoming wave due to the built up momentum at the interface the development of these events and how they contaminate the resulting wave pattern is rendered in fig 10 validation of numerical methods for coastal engineering usually relies on experimenting with dam breaks and their complex patterns such as mushroom like jets therefore the proposed method may be considered to be used for problems such as the tsunami wave run up 3 2 force on the deck after validating the generation of isolated shipping water events the following numerical experiments deal with vertical loads due to the shipping of water onto the deck the numerical experiment is set up according to the experiments conducted by hernández fontes et al 2019 the configuration of the experimental set up is almost the same to that shown in fig 7 where h 475 mm w 500 mm h 1 150 mm l 1 392 mm l 2 1258 mm and l 3 300 mm additionally a force balance with length of 195 mm was embedded into the deck that measured the slowly varying vertical force on the deck the heights of the water columns were chosen as h 0 144 mm and h 1 240 mm the authors of the experiment note that the chosen ratio of water columns h 0 h 1 0 6 yields a stable undular bore without 3d effects due to wave breaking different to the previous experiment a wave probe was located 5 mm upstream of the deck edge which measured the freeboard exceedance i e the difference of the incoming wave and the deck heights time series of vertical loads were obtained experimentally from the force balance measurements the experiments were repeated five times and the averaged time series is used here to validate the simulation results at the peak of the force curve relative minimum and maximum deviations from the average curve are less than 2 due to the good repeatability this experiment is taken as the 2d experiment for validating green water loads two simulations with initial point spacing of 2 5 mm and 1 5 mm were performed which consisted of 44000 and 112000 number of points respectively the readings of the wave probe located in front of the deck edge are shown in fig 11 through values of freeboard exceedance the finer discretisation yielded 3 higher freeboard exceedance compared to the coarse discretisation on the other hand both simulations had similar evolution of the force excreted on the deck which are graphed in fig 12 the simulations have adequately predicted the rise of the force as the water enters the deck the experiment has detected a sudden drop in pressure as water slides along the deck which was not detected by the simulations and may be due to aeration effects similar to those captured by the experiment some amount of oscillations are present in the numerical curves before the peak which are due to the high pressure gradient area at the edge of the deck that is responsible for developing and imploding air pockets figs 11 and 12 show that the convergence stays stable and similar for different discretisations the authors of the experiment also tried to validate the new convolution model to predict the loads results demonstrated that using the convolution model improved the representation of the time series of loads compared to the traditional dam break approach it managed to capture the peaks and the decay tendencies observed in the experimental data in an approximated way although significantly over predicting the experimentally measured loads on the other hand the results of the numerical simulations are in very good agreement with the experiment measurements 4 green water on a fpso model 4 1 fixed model in this section a validation of the numerical method for 3d green water loads on a fixed structure is conducted several experimental results on green water have been published but there is small amount of data available to be useful for cfd validation in this study the experiments conducted by lee et al 2012 are numerically reproduced in order to understand the physics of green water and to quantify the pressure distributions due to green water on deck the model geometry and the locations of the pressure sensors are shown in fig 13 the shown geometry named rect0 by the authors of the experiment is a simplified fixed model of an fpso vessel ten pressure sensors were installed at the deck of the model and the camera was recording the flow development on the deck the validation study focuses on comparing pressure signals from five innermost sensors that record complex pressure evolutions during green water events p11 p12 p13 p21 p22 the results of experiments under various wave conditions showed very similar shapes measured at p11 nine regular wave cases were investigated by the authors of the experiment the cases were chosen as a combination of three wavelengths λ w 2 25 3 0 and 3 75 m and three wave steepness values 2 a w λ w 0 04 0 05 and 0 06 the experiment with rect0 model and the wave named 9 with the largest amplitude is chosen to be reproduced for the validation study since it yields largest impact pressures the wave amplitude is a w 112 5 mm and the wavelength is λ w 3 75 m regular waves were generated at the inlet and relaxed into the domain wave probes validated the produced wave amplitude and they were used to detect where the nonlinearities start before the wave overtops the deck to size the domain properly one way coupling of the potential wave flow and meshless solver is done using the relaxation zones i e by imposing a known solution of the linear wave theory at the boundaries of the meshless domain and gradually transitioning to the nonlinear solution towards the middle of the domain literature is sparse when it comes to validating green water experiments by numerical means a study published by gatin et al 2018 is used for the comparison of numerical results in which the authors used unsteady rans solver based on the fvm and vof approach the domain size of the meshless solver was iteratively chosen to be small enough to save computational time but to capture relevant nonlinearities without contaminating results the domain extended 1 0 m in front of the model 1 0 m back from the vertical wall 0 5 m below the model and 0 5 m from the sides of the model the velocity known from the linear wave theory was imposed at all domain boundaries except for the downstream boundary which imposed the open boundary condition besides the domain size multiple point spacing values were tested and 12 mm was found to be adequate a couple of screenshots in fig 14 show a wave run up for larger point spacing δ 20 mm and somewhat larger domain size than the chosen one for the sake of comparison with the fvm a constant time step value of 3 ms was used for extracting the results of the study which corresponds to a cfl number of 1 0 at time during the impact firstly the behaviour of the computed green water events is investigated the progress of a green water event may be seen in fig 15 which compares the experimental and numerical behaviour of flow on the deck the meshless points are coloured by the magnitude of their velocity vector they are also rendered small so the deck can be visible typically water ingress started at the fore end of the deck and progressively water from the deck side merged the merging built large momentum which resulted in a violent impact against the wall the water slided along the wall upwards and then fell back on the deck thus receding away from the wall and the deck the numerical solver successfully reproduced the free surface evolution of the extremely nonlinear event i e the ingress of water on the deck piling against the wall during the impact and falling of the water on the deck during the simulation run pressure was registered at five relevant sensor locations using the meshless interpolation eq 10 the numerically obtained pressure signals of ten sequential green water events are plotted in fig 16 and compared to the experimental data and the results obtained by the fvm gatin et al 2018 it should be noted that the plotted numerical signals of 10 typical green water events are shifted in time in order to overlap with a part of the stable experimental signal for easier comparison the pressure signals usually exhibits two peaks during the green water event the first peak with a very short rising time is caused by the impact of the merged water front against the wall and the second peak with a longer rising time is caused by the fall of the piled up water which resembles to typical sloshing events the meshless solver managed to reproduce both peaks within a period of the green water event at all sensor locations the pressure at location p11 where the impact pressure was most frequently observed showed the largest uncertainty suggesting a strongly nonlinear and irregular feature of the green water impact lee et al 2012 the meshless simulation yielded somewhat more uniform peak magnitudes at location p11 than the experiment i e the simulated magnitudes on impacts were in the range from 2900 pa to 3500 pa and the magnitudes of the secondary peak were in the range from 1500 pa to 1750 pa for comparison the fvm yielded generally well fitting signals but with under predicted second peaks and some impact peak oscillations one noticeable difference is that its pressure signal yielded larger discrepancies further from the centreplane lee et al 2012 suggest that the average values of the sensors peak magnitudes are taken for validation of cfd solvers the comparison of the average peak magnitudes is presented in table 2 and also graphed in fig 17 at the location p11 results of the numerical simulations in average have relative deviations less than 4 from the experiment while results of the fvm have a discrepancy of 48 from the experiment due to the uncertain pressure response during the initial impact of the wave front against the wall overall the meshless simulation follows the experimental trend however the pressure peak magnitude itself does not reveal enough information describing a green water event or generally an impact event the pressure impulse is a more relevant measure from the structural point of view therefore the integrals of the graphed pressure signals in fig 16 are compared to the experimental pressure impulses shared by the authors of the experiment the comparison of the pressure impulse is presented in table 3 and also graphed in fig 18 by comparing tables 2 and 3 it is evident that the peaks and impulses are not strongly correlated for example the impulse at p21 is accurately predicted while the average pressure peak magnitude is under predicted by 10 in addition the pressure impulse at p11 obtained by the fvm is under predicted while the peak magnitudes are over predicted the results of the meshless simulation at locations p12 p13 and p21 are in extremely good agreement with the experimental results while the results at p11 and p22 are slightly under and over predicted respectively looking at the graph of the signal at location p11 it can be noticed that the simulation does not smooth out the pressure while water is receding from the location of the sensor similarly at p22 a single row of lagrangian points remains there at all time i e the deck stays wet this is due to the relatively large point spacing value δ 12 mm for such conditions in either case those points that remain at the deck influence the pressure signal only in between the impacts which is irrelevant from the structural point of view but may be relevant if the stability of the ship is investigated the culprit of non smooth ending of the pressure signal is that lagrangian points are either there or they are not therefore contributing or not contributing to the hydrostatic pressure i e wetting the deck this may be alleviated by making the points spacing smaller which would lead to many unnecessary points in the whole simulation domain a current limitation of the implementation is that each point is considered to represent the same amount of fluid volume in eulerian methods this is equivalent to using a uniform grid cell size throughout the domain a solution to this limitation is to size down the point spacing and the domain volume but not too excessively that would contaminate the results by too close boundaries that impose waves future work will deal with implementing adaptively sized points spacing in order to allow for better spatial precision in areas where user specifies on the other hand one may choose to couple an fvm solver and the meshless solver in a way that the meshless domain captures only the deck and its structures as in marrone et al 2016 this discrepancy arising from the pressure in between impacts is not of a significant importance when analysing structural loads therefore it can be concluded that the introduced meshless method and the domain decomposition technique can be used to accurately predict violent fluid structure impacts and green water loads 4 2 heaving model the following numerical experiment is used to test the robustness of the implemented solver by simulating the fpso model with introduced complexity of prescribed vessel movement the fpso model oscillates in the vertical direction i e it heaves with an amplitude of 50 mm the amplitude of incoming waves is 112 5 mm and the period is constrained to t w 1 55 s two heaving periods of the vessel were chosen in the simulations t h 0 75 s and t h 1 0 s the numerically obtained pressure signals of four sequential green water events on the moving vessel are plotted in fig 19 and compared to the numerical results obtained for the fixed vessel since the value of the first chosen heaving period t h 0 75 equals to almost half of the value of the waves period it is expected that the pressure signals will repeat over time indeed fig 19 shows that the signal is similar for each green water event except for some discrepancy of secondary pressure peaks at p21 it is observable that this heaving period significantly amplifies magnitudes of the secondary pressure peak and alleviates magnitudes of the primary pressure peak this is due to the vertical acceleration of the deck that occurs while the piled up water falls on the deck the second chosen heaving period t h 1 0 is not in scale of the waves period the pressure signal varies from event to event overall it can be deduced that magnitudes of the primary pressure peak are significantly amplified while magnitudes of the secondary pressure peak are only slightly modified an advantage the introduced meshless and lagrangian numerical method is that computational performance with moving geometry is similar as if the geometry is fixed on the other hand numerical methods based on conforming meshes would have to perform mesh deformation and advection corrections each time step in combination with physically moving geometry lagrangian fluid advection without a mesh simulates physics of green water events just as it is 5 discussion of the results a green water event can comprise of complex phenomenons i e a breaking wave on the moving deck impulsively impacts a moving wall while generating a jet falling pile of water spray etc the validation cases of isolated events of wetting the deck and periodic green water events in regular seas were successfully simulated in a short amount of time the study showed that wave impact pressures and pressure impulses can be predicted with very good accuracy furthermore a test with moving ship has shown the capability of the method to take all motions into account through the domain decomposition approach since meshing is not needed to set up a simulation the model may be rotated to achieve different wave headings there is an infinite amount of possible combinations of conditions formed by the 6 dof vessel movement and incoming waves that can occur in harsh ocean environments potential flow methods can quickly approximate vessel motions in waves but this validation study has shown that unsteady cfd analyses should be made for questionable combinations of conditions the introduced method has been shown to efficiently and robustly simulate local green water events and accurately predict hydrodynamic loads a solver implemented based on the introduced method can simulate questionable conditions relatively quickly on a modern pc an advantage of this meshless and lagrangian method is keeping similar computational performance of the solver that deals with moving geometry the validation cases have shown that the domain may be small enough to take into account only the space where nonlinearities occur the number of points forming fluid in such small domains may be less than 200000 a modern high end gpu can compute one time step in less than 250 ms i e it takes approximately 1 μ s per point per time step it was empirically found that the investigated simulations were stable with a cfl coefficient that was lower than 2 i e the velocity divergence managed to get damped without oscillations further investigation on the stability of the method is still needed one should also take into account that the end user of a truly meshless method does not need to waste their time on volumetric meshing results of the validation cases could benefit from adaptive refinement techniques which were not implemented in the solver by choosing larger point spacing and adaptively refining the discretisation near high pressure areas the domain could be made larger with the same number of points on another note the meshless domain can be made as small as possible by taking flow input from another mesh based e g fvm solver in either case these issues are not directly connected to the methodology but to the implementation of the solver 6 conclusions predicting the effects of green water on the stability and structure of the vessel is a challenging problem which needs to be assessed in the design process by analysing the limitations of currently used methods a rationale was developed and the research resulted in a novel design tool i e a methodology for incompressible flows suitable for simulating green water events the introduced methodology can be described as meshless lagrangian volume conservative fd based second order accurate in space efficient and suitable for coupling as the lagrangian description of the flow is suitable for violent free surface flows the mesh free description of the fluid volume is assumed using wls based spatial operators in their generalised fd form which work on highly irregular point clouds compared to sph and mps integral based operators fd operators are employed to simulate incompressible fluid flow by solving the velocity pressure formulation of the nse in strong form the novelty of the method also includes proper boundary condition imposed on a single row of points obtained by projecting fluid points onto the geometry each time step which means the geometry may be arbitrary moving or deforming furthermore possible loss or gain in fluid volume during the lagrangian advection is prevented by enforcing equidistant neighbours which adds to the stability of the method the validation was performed by simulating isolated events of green water on a fixed structure and regular waves wetting the deck of a fpso model isolated green water events were simulated using the wet dam break approach the incoming waves with bores and plunging were successfully reproduced as well as the force due to the shipping of water onto the deck a fixed model of an fpso was simulated on a regular wave field by the domain decomposition approach the study showed that wave impact pressures and pressure impulses can be predicted with very good accuracy the fpso was imposed with heaving motions to study the effect of vessel movement on the loads and the applicability of the method on realistic scenarios where the vessel may move with 6 dof it may be concluded that the proposed method provides good estimates of the evolution of pressure in green water problems which may be used for structural analyses besides coupling to another flow solver the flow solver implemented through the introduced methodology is ready to be coupled to a structural or a rigid body solver due to the direct use of discrete geometry in fluid simulations finally it should also be noted that the solver was implemented to run fully in parallel which enables state of the art simulations to be performed efficiently on personal computers proving the efficiency of the methodology it was shown how detailed simulations are computed in a reasonable

21776,a meshless cfd method is proposed for numerical simulation of incompressible flows and estimation of hydrodynamic loads during green water events in this paper governing equations are described in finite differences context where spatial operators are derived using weighted least squares volume conservative lagrangian advection is handled by solving a set of geometrical constraints while adjusting to moving boundaries represented by triangulated meshes the validation of the method is performed by simulating four green water experiments on fixed and moving structures and comparing the kinematics of flow and hydrodynamic loads during impacts it is shown that the method accurately reproduces patterns of waves that are wetting the deck as well as the pressure distribution along the deck the resulting method intrinsically handles violent fluid structure interaction with free surface fragmentation while providing second order accurate pressure field keywords green water lagrangian meshless finite differences impact pressure fpso 1 introduction a green water event is characterised by some amount of rapidly moving water which interacts with a moving ship these events include violent fluid structure interaction and therefore need to be examined with the physics of the structure and fluid flow considered in a coupled manner to accurately estimate hydrodynamic loads during the interaction there are hundreds of scientific papers and research reports that deal with green water effects i e the physics of water on deck and possible prediction methods temarel et al 2015 in their review conclude that the green water problem has been investigated experimentally and numerically but with very limited success the issues arise due to the fact that green water is very difficult to measure either under laboratory conditions or in the field and very difficult to simulate numerically the problem due its fast moving multiphase and highly turbulent nature is not very amenable for accurate numerical simulation although three dimensional 3d models help to understand and simulate the mechanisms of green water impinging on deck computations of green water loads with various wave headings are still a challenge yamasaki et al 2005 developed a finite difference method fdm to predict the water impact pressure caused by green water phenomena where the density function method was employed in the framework of a locally refined overlapping grid system colicchio et al 2010 analysed the water shipping caused by head sea waves for a floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel at rest with a 3d domain decomposition strategy where a linear potential flow seakeeping analysis of the vessel is coupled with a local nonlinear rotational flow investigation for the prediction of water on deck phenomena greco and lugni 2012 and greco et al 2012 conducted a synergic 3d experimental and numerical investigation for wave ship interactions involving the water on deck and slamming phenomena a weakly nonlinear external solution for the wave ship interactions was combined with a two dimensional 2d shallow water approximation lee et al 2017 studied the behaviour of green water impacting a fixed rectangular structure and investigated the flow kinematics of a series of experiments and cfd simulations based on the finite volume method fvm gatin et al 2018 validated a fvm solver for green water simulations by employing volume of fluid vof and ghost fluid method gfm to discretise the free surface boundary conditions at the interface mesh based methods for solving partial differential equations pdes have achieved adequate success and they have been applied in computational ship hydrodynamics during the ship wave interaction simulation requires large mesh deformations by cautious node movements or re meshing of deforming areas to avoid mesh tangling and loss of its regularity alternatively the overset grid technique can be used for rigid body motion in free floating body simulations östman et al 2014 lagrangian meshless or mesh free methods have emerged with the goal of avoiding difficulties encountered in conventional mesh based methods mesh free methods adapt to domains with complex and changing geometries and moving phase boundaries without the complexity that is usually required within methods that rely on topological data structures gotoh and khayyer 2018 made a review of state of the art meshless methods that are applicable on ocean engineering problems taking into account the problem of green water dalrymple and rogers 2006 analysed the potential of the sph method for wave structure interactions by reproducing breaking waves that overtop the deck shibata et al 2009 have proposed a variant of the moving particle semi implicit mps method and compared the estimated pressure with the experiments for a ship in head waves the investigation has shown that there is still some lack of agreement in terms of both pressure and forces acting on the deck due to relevant oscillations in time shibata et al 2012 extended the mps method for a 3d ship motion under high wave height conditions where shipping of water occurs the nonlinear effect of shipping water was successfully simulated by the mps method although quantitative differences between the calculated and experimental results still remained bellezi et al 2013a b analysed the green water phenomenon on 3d models using the mps method they focused on the validation of the method comparing the numerical results with experimental results for green water on reduced scale models gómez gesteira et al 2005 analysed the phenomena within the framework of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method and noted how the flow in the wave crest is split into two showing a different behaviour above and below the deck le touzé et al 2010 applied the sph method to predict the fluid behaviour for two different dynamic flooding scenarios the interaction between a ship and travelling waves and the transient flooding behaviour that occurs on a side collision between two ships pakozdi et al 2012 showed the feasibility of the sph method to give more detailed forecast of the hydrodynamics on the deck than the simplified water on deck estimation the green water problem arising due to complex physics is a significant problem for ships and offshore structures and the listed numerical methods give limited insight in determining the occurrence and magnitude of green water loads consequently classification societies seek for new procedures that may approve and improve designs of new buildings commonly used meshless methods have different advantages and disadvantages gotoh and khayyer 2018 a promising class of meshless methods concerning the solution accuracy are generalised finite difference methods gfdm which are strong form methods that usually rely on moving least squares mls as they can be extended to reach arbitrary order of accuracy since gfdms do not require basis functions or quadrature boundary and interface conditions can be implemented in a straightforward manner tiwari and kuhnert 2003 introduced a lagrangian gfdm called finite pointset method fpm for simulating incompressible flows based on chorin s projection method the fpm was recently generalised to work on dynamically changing interfaces suchde and kuhnert 2019 it was successfully applied to fsi problems kuhnert et al 2019 and for simulating free surface flow about ships lu et al 2016 finite point method not to be confused with fpm is a mesh free eulerian gfdm that stabilises the discrete differential equations by balancing momentum in the finite control domain oñate et al 1996 which was extended to lagrangian formulation for solving dam break problems in 2d rodolfo idelsohn et al 2001 fu et al 2020 applied a gfdm to simulate interaction of waves and a cylinder array which was reduced to a 2d formulation wang et al 2018 proposed a lagrangian mesh free finite difference particle method fdpm with variable stencil sizes for solving wave equations suchde and kuhnert 2017 analysed volume conservation errors when performing lagrangian advection in gfdms one of keys problems with mls based gfdms besides volume conservation is that they express the vector space of polynomials up to an arbitrary order which are approximated by solving a linear system for each point at each time step size of the system depends on number of neighbours and basis vector which may be costly for 3d time dependent problems in addition gfdms may have difficulties when describing linear system of equations i e the system may be hardly solvable since the matrix may not be an m matrix seibold 2008 investigated least squares approaches that fail to yield positive stencils and introduced a technique of selecting neighbours that ensure an m matrix structure for poisson problems this paper introduces a new lagrangian gfdm built as a compromise between fast but oscillatory sph mps methods and slow but accurate mls based methods the method is based on the weighted least squares wls operators which require slight computational cost each time step in a unsteady simulation but still yield second order convergence for poisson problems on irregular point clouds as mls based methods do basic et al 2018 moreover the stencils produce an m matrix for the system of navier stokes equations nse which are represented in the poisson pressure equation ppe form instead of the commonly used projection method finally it is worth noting that the lagrangian advection is volume conservative these are important ingredients for obtaining accurate flow kinematics and pressure fields for problems in marine hydrodynamics the method is based on the following hypotheses the lagrangian description of flow naturally describes the advection of fluid with the free surface as compared to the eulerian description of flow it is possible to solve the nonlinear problem of green water with high fidelity by solving nse in ppe form based on the lagrangian description of flow and wls the global domain can be decomposed to improve computational efficiency by coupling the lagrangian nonlinear region with some simpler solver for the outside region the remainder of the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the governing equations their numerical counterparts and the solution algorithm the method is validated by 2d numerical experiments described in section 3 and by 3d simulations of wave ship interactions of a fixed and a heaving fpso model in section 4 the results of the simulations are further discussed in section 5 and the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 numerical methodology 2 1 governing equations for an incompressible fluid the nse form the time dependent initial boundary value problem 1 d u d t 1 ρ p ν 2 u g x ω 2 u 0 x ω γ 3 u u x γ 4 u t 0 u 0 x ω where d d t is the lagrangian or material derivative u is the velocity ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid g is the external acceleration acting on the fluid u is the boundary velocity and u 0 is the initial velocity the time and spatial dependency from eqs 1 4 is implied and the fluid is moving in a r d domain ω bounded by the boundary γ where the number of dimensions are d 2 or d 3 the initial condition eq 4 should satisfy eq 2 i e u 0 0 the system 1 4 can be discretised in a variety of ways but in any case the pressure field must maintain solenoidal divergence free condition of the velocity field defined by eq 2 an accurate but also costly way to numerically advance eq 1 is to solve for u and p in a fully coupled manner since the pressure term in eq 1 is not explicitly dependent on time t cfd methods often employ schemes that decouple velocity and pressure velocity pressure formulations are efficient while not suffering from the numerical boundary layers or restrictions in temporal accuracy johnston and liu 2004 shirokoff and rosales 2011 the pressure is treated explicitly in time 5 p x p u x x ω γ where p is the function that yields the pressure for any given velocity field that solves the nse the incompressibility constraint eq 2 is replaced by a pressure poisson equation ppe therefore decoupling the computation of the momentum and kinematic equations 6 2 p ρ g d u d t in ω n p ρ n t u g ν u on γ where n is the normal on the boundary surface which was used to dot eq 1 to obtain the boundary condition in eq 6 as described by johnston and liu 2004 the gravitational acceleration is taken as constant hence it holds g 0 the divergence operator and material derivative in eq 6 are not interchangeable and by straightforward differentiation of the material derivative caltagirone and vincent 2020 it can be shown that the divergence of acceleration equals to 7 d u d t t u u 2 u u where the partial derivative and divergence operator are commutative therefore eq 7 is zero at all time in continuous context due to eq 2 on account of initial conditions truncation errors machine precision and other sources of errors the velocity divergence will not be zero in the numerical computation henshaw et al 1994 noted that adding some amount of numerically estimated velocity divergence volume compression λ f u will damp the continuity errors in time shirokoff and rosales 2011 showed that adding this parameter forces exponential decay of the velocity divergence to zero the choice of parameter λ f is explained in section 2 3 furthermore shirokoff and rosales 2011 noted that some amount of difference between extrapolated fluid velocity at the boundary and the boundary itself λ b u u should be added to the neumann boundary condition to improve the stability by damping continuity errors near boundaries neglecting surface tension effects and assuming the continuous dynamic viscosity across the interface it follows that the boundary condition for the pressure at the interface is simply the zero dirichlet condition by obtaining the pressure using eq 6 the momentum eq 1 can be solved with an implicit or explicit treatment of the viscous term as the viscosity does not influence investigated flows significantly the term is treated explicitly therefore the lagrangian formulation of eq 1 is an ordinary differential equation ode d u d t f u which can be solved explicitly using the solved velocity field an explicit second order integration is used to update locations of points the numerics to the above mathematical formulations are given in the following sections future work will investigate implicit calculation of the velocity following gatin et al 2018 turbulence modelling is not employed when simulating green water events turbulence effects are of minor importance during the impact but viscosity effects are important at the time interval at which the flow develops before the wave front hits an obstacle park et al 2012 nonlinearities that occur when the wave hits the moving ship are of high importance for further development of the flow that produces eddies jets and backflow lagrangian nature of the nse proper discretisation of the viscous term and point cloud density adequately reproduce eddies and rapid jets in order to suppress the errors that come out of assumptions when the flow on the deck is computed locally colicchio et al 2010 but to keep the computational performance on a high level the complete domain is decomposed into two physically overlapping domains as drawn in fig 2 high fidelity hf domain can be of small size i e encircling only the area of interest while imposing the flow calculated by the lower fidelity lf solver for the large domain the introduced method in this paper solves the hf flow while being indifferent to the type of lf solver one way coupling concept is used in which the hf domains tries to capture all nonlinearities that the lf solver cannot simulate accurately therefore the lf solution is imposed through boundary conditions at the specified inlet shown in fig 2 where lf domain provides the pressure and velocity fields and free surface elevation information consequently the specified inlet of hf domain in fig 2 imposes dirichlet boundary condition for the pressure and velocity p x p l f x and u x u l f x the other boundaries of the hf domain impose the neumann boundary condition for the pressure n p ρ n g the following sections describe how this is treated in the discrete context this means that the proposed model can deal with arbitrary external input conditions provided the velocity and the pressure can be given by lf domain on the inlet at each time step as an example simple linear incident wave combined with the stretching above the mean water level is chosen for generating regular waves in section 4 8 u x x z t η a ω cosh k z h sinh k h cos ω t k x 9 u z x z t η a ω sinh k z h sinh k h sin ω t k x where η a is the wave amplitude ω is the wave frequency k is the wave number and h is the water depth the pressure is defined as p x z t ρ η a g cosh k z h cosh k h cos ω t k x since the linear wave theory is limited to infinitesimally small waves stretching modification by wheeler 1970 is used to scale the vertical coordinate that are initially above the waterlines other more complex nonlinear waves could easily be adapted stream function for regular waves higher order spectral waves for irregular waves etc 2 2 spatial discretisation a mesh free or meshless system is described by a set of points ω the set of points is usually referred to as the point cloud which does not include topology or connectivity information as drawn in fig 1 each point in the set i ω retains relevant characteristics of the system at its location x i t in a specific time instant t since there is no connectivity information the differential volume at some location x of the continuous domain must be distributed among points that are near x which form a set n usually referred to as neighbour points compactly supported methods introduce a continuous positive and symmetric weighting function w r h that dictates the strength of the interaction between two neighbour points based on the distance between them r the arbitrary chosen radius of the compact sphere h captures the set of neighbour points as shown in fig 1 i e w 0 for r h for the sake of simplicity h is assumed constant for all points choosing the weighting function and compact sphere radius is a demanding task because numerical errors may be introduced by choosing too large h or too blunt shape of the weighting function on the other hand too small h may lead to instabilities therefore a compact sphere must overlap with nearest neighbour points and w should monotonically decrease with the increase in r moreover weighting may incorporate properties such as a particle s mass or volume etc interpolation if a function is defined at discrete locations in space one must define how to approximate values in between points interpolation of a function f x at an arbitrary coordinate x uses discrete function values at the neighbour points which can be written as 10 f x j n w j f j j n w j where denotes the discrete version of the expression n is the set of neighbouring points in the compact sphere f j is the discrete value of function f at x j f j f x j and w j describes the weight of the neighbouring interpolation point j w j w x x j h a compact radius that is too large or the shape of the interpolation weighting function that is too blunt can lead to excessive numerical diffusion the compact sphere should include the nearest neighbour points which will yield voronoi like interpolation hopkins 2015 gradient following lanson and vila 2008a the wls renormalisation tensor may be introduced 11 b i j n w i j x i j x i j t 1 where w i j w x i j h and x i j x j x i for a scalar function f x that is defined at discrete locations of points in the set ω the discrete gradient is defined at those locations by the following expression 12 f i j n w i j f i f j b i x i j the derivation of the wls based discrete gradient can be found in basic et al 2018 and convergence theorems are presented in lanson and vila 2008a b this method of calculating approximate spatial derivatives is second order accurate and can be used on a highly irregular distribution of points the term b i x i j in eq 12 can be interpreted as a part of the hamilton operator so the discrete divergence operator can be written as 13 f i j n w i j b i x i j f i f j and the discrete curl operator can be written as 14 f i j n w i j b i x i j f i f j directional derivative appropriate boundary points are generated each time step by projecting onto near boundary surfaces which is explained in section 2 3 due to projecting onto the boundary geometry the closest fluid point to the boundary lies along the normal of the generated boundary point it follows that the second order directional derivative at the boundary may be defined through taylor s series as 15 n f i n f c x i j 2 2 f j where n f c f i f j x i j is evaluated by central fds between the boundary and fluid points fig 3 renders how eq 15 extrapolates from known derivative values along the boundary normal laplacian studies by fatehi and manzari 2011 ma et al 2016 and tamai et al 2017 showed that classical meshless discretisations of the laplacian should be corrected to yield adequate accuracy of discrete approximation or when solving poisson problems basic et al 2018 derived a class of corrected meshless laplacians based on the wls gradient eq 12 and taylor s series which were validated to work on highly irregular point clouds the formulation of the discrete laplacian operator used in this study is defined as 16 2 f i 2 d j n w i j f i f j 1 x i j b i o i j n w i j x i j 2 1 x i j b i o i where o i is the offset vector of the point i defined as 17 o i j n w i j x i j that describes the weighted centre of neighbouring points i e the offset vector points from the point i location in the direction where the neighbourhood point arrangement dominates basic et al 2018 validated that renormalisation stabilises the operator when approximating the laplacian of a scalar field and that it yields second order accuracy when solving the poisson equation while the uncompensated original formulations yields first order accuracy it can be seen that the spatial derivatives eqs 12 16 are defined through least squares in form of finite differences renormalisation helps avoiding to use large neighbourhood stencils if δ is some initial spacing between adjacent points h can be taken as 2 δ h 3 δ as explained in the following sections the introduced operators are directly used to formulate discrete versions of the equations defined in section 2 1 and therefore simulate incompressible flow with complex boundary geometry and boundary conditions 2 3 pressure equation boundary points to allow for flexible and moving boundaries geometry can be represented in any form e g analytically or as polygonal surface meshes therefore boundary points need to be generated at the geometry interface each time step as rendered in fig 4 fluid points which lie on the edge of the point cloud and are located near the boundaries are projected onto those boundaries new points for the current time step are then generated on the projected locations since lf solution is known behind the inlet boundary points are generated to be distanced by δ as rendered in fig 4 this preserving of regularity was shown to yield better convergence which also holds for the open boundary condition finally generated boundary points are assigned the boundary condition type velocity and acceleration of the wall at their corresponding locations it is straightforward to impose body motions in the simulation by moving boundary surfaces representing the body the velocity vector of a point x moving with the rigid body must account for the body rotation ω u x u c o g ω x x c o g where u c o g is the velocity vector at the body centre of gravity cog and x c o g is the global coordinate of the body cog pressure solving recall that all derivatives are written as weighted summation of finite differences between interacting points and now that the boundary points are known it is straightforward to construct a linear system of equations written in the matrix form as 18 a p b where a is the coefficients matrix p is the vector containing pressure solutions for all points forming the system and b is the vector containing the right hand side values for interior fluid points the rows in a are described by eq 16 and according to henshaw et al 1994 the right hand side entry is b i λ f i u i where λ f i is taken as c i max δ and c i max is the largest absolute difference in speed between points in the compact sphere using λ f δ t 1 would try to force the incompressibility condition immediately which leads to an overshoot of predicting values for the next step followed by oscillations cheng et al 2018 the rows in the matrix a that describe solid boundary points i e the neumann boundary condition employ the discrete directional derivative eq 15 rather than directly using eq 12 which would be only first order accurate as all neighbours are located on one side from the boundary point the right hand side for boundary points is simply written b i n i where n i is the known neumann condition to be imposed based on the boundary conditions from section 2 1 free surface points impose a dirichlet boundary condition p i b i 0 it will be shown how the points are always organised and therefore the laplacian may be used to distinguish points on free surface that are missing neighbours i e j n 1 x i j b i o i may be seen as non dimensional volume taken by neighbours consequently the sum for points located on the edge of a point cloud yields values close to zero 3 evidently the coefficient matrix a is not symmetric a fd matrix is called essentially irreducible if every point is connected to a dirichlet boundary point meaning that each fluid clump includes at least one free surface point the matrix a is essentially diagonally dominant see eqs 16 and 15 and each point is connected to some dirichlet point thus satisfying the strict diagonal dominance in addition eq 16 can be forced to yield positive stencils by using absolute value of 1 x i j b i o i which should any way be positive after points are reorganised therefore a is an m matrix because it is discretised by positive stencils and every point has a path to a dirichlet point seibold 2008 in conclusion appropriate iterative solvers such as bicgstab and qmrcgstab have been shown to always converge 2 4 time integration velocity time integration of the velocity at each discrete fluid point is performed by integrating the momentum equation as described in section 2 1 the discrete version of eq 1 is 19 d u d t 1 ρ p ν 2 u g where the pressure gradient term p is calculated by eq 12 the diffusion term ν 2 u is approximated by eq 16 using the current velocity field since it is taken as constant throughout the time step due to impulsive and inertia dominated nature of flows under consideration the lagrangian acceleration term in eq 19 is described by the second order backward euler approximation which is given for constant time stepping as 20 d u d t 3 u i n 1 4 u i n u i n 1 2 δ t o δ t 2 where n n 1 and n 1 are the current next and previous time steps respectively the velocity vector u n 1 is the only unknown in the ode 19 which is directly calculated after the velocity is obtained relaxation zones are employed to solve issues near domain boundaries fuhrman et al 2006 by weighting between the computed solution of u n 1 and some target solution as drawn in fig 5 the flow solution may be rotational or reverting near the open boundary u γ n 0 or it may be accelerating into the domain n u γ t 0 therefore in zones near open boundaries flow is relaxed so that it flows normal to the boundary as drawn in fig 5 displacement lagrangian movement of each fluid point is done also by the backward euler approximation using the velocity of current and previous time steps the new position of each fluid point i is calculated as 21 x i n 1 x i n 3 2 u i n 1 2 u i n 1 δ t which suchde and kuhnert 2017 calls a second order point cloud movement a point moves along its streamline which leads to the distortion of the particle distribution and eventually introduces volume conservation errors reordering after the explicit movement points in the point cloud are reordered so that each point keeps its volume constant to respect the continuity constraint which is done by enforcing equidistant neighbours x i j const this optimisation problem is solved by position based dynamics pbd technique where points are iteratively slightly displaced as described by macklin and müller 2013 pbd solves a set of nonlinear constraints to enforce constant density using jacobi iterations which is unconditionally stable and without time dependency and parameters tweaking free surface points are not allowed to displace along free surface normals after the reorganisation of points the velocity of displaced points needs to be interpolated eq 10 is applied on each new location while the neighbours around that points are found using the non displaced locations in the interpolation stage h δ so only relevant neighbours are chosen and numerical diffusion is kept to a minimum for points that have not displaced significantly and for very small time steps in addition to fluid points in the domain pbd neatly organises wave inlet points that have entered the domain that are described in the previous section finally after the reordering temporary points that enter the fluid domain after the movement are converted to fluid points and those that leave the domain are simply removed from the simulation the time step was kept low enough that only one row of inlet points shown in fig 4 would cross the boundary but in future the method will try to deal with multiple number of rows entering the domain although the advection step is unconditionally stable time step constraints for explicitly solving eq 19 still apply cummins and rudman 1999 i e δ t cfl δ u m a x where u m a x is the maximum fluid speed 2 5 solution procedure the simulation input file does not incorporate any volumetric mesh but only bounding surfaces of the domain and objects in the scene generally a body of liquid is surrounded by various boundaries solid walls virtual boundaries inflow outflow symmetry and the fluid free surface the space is automatically filled starting from the defined flooding locations by generating points with defined initial spacing δ until nearest boundaries are reached the concept of the flood filling is schematically rendered in fig 6 after the boundary geometry and fluid points are initialised the solver iterates in time the following procedure move boundary geometry and advect points as explained in section 2 4 discard points that are out of the domain promote inlet points that entered the domain generate boundary points as explained in section 2 3 compute renormalisation tensors for spatial operators solve the pressure using an iterative matrix free solver as explained in section 2 3 advance velocity by solving eq 19 as explained in section 2 4 relax the velocity within relaxation zones 2 6 implementation the implementation called rhoxyz was programmed using data parallel algorithms and a hpc library named kokkos carter edwards et al 2014 and can run on gpus and cpus when talking about data parallelism the number of cores is the most important factor e g 32 high end cpu cores seems much but is not when compared to 4500 processing units in a high end gpu the gpu was shown to perform 20 times better than cpu for large numbers of points i e less than a second per time step is needed for advancing 1 million meshless points on a high end gpu due to lack of the topology information in the meshless point cloud each point must find its neighbours inside the compact domain at each time instant to perform the interaction background grids are usually employed to avoid testing of all points with each other the cartesian background grid was implemented within the solver by employing atomically built linked lists barbieri et al 2013 which allow dynamic insertion of temporary boundary points into cells the pressure is solved using the matrix free technique müller et al 2013 instead of preparing the system matrix before solving the matrix row and vector multiplication is repeatedly done when needed 3 green water by dam breaking 3 1 wave patterns hernández fontes et al 2018 experimentally investigated the generation of isolated events of green water on a fixed structure using the wet dam break approach the authors verified that it is possible to reproduce different types of green water resembling those obtained with unbroken regular waves reported in literature the experimental setup is shown in fig 7 where h 450 mm w 335 mm h 1 150 mm l 1 195 mm l 2 505 mm and l 3 300 mm the testing matrix is presented in table 1 the authors of the experiment chose the ratios h 0 h 1 such that waves with undular bores are generated each test was repeated five times and the calculated average values given in table 1 are chosen as simulation input parameters fig 8 shows the free surface patterns captured by the video camera during the experiments which are compared to those obtained by the numerical simulations the images captured the situation 120 ms after the water level reached the deck level the simulations have successfully reproduced three different wave patterns from the experiments described by hernández fontes et al 2018 first four cases 1 to 4 form a plunging wave on the deck and an elliptical cavity at the deck leading edge cases with lower depth i e higher freeboards form steeper waves whose peaks are close to the deck leading edge the case 4 is transitional in which a mild wave is formed while wetting the deck the case 5 forms the second pattern where the water simply rises above the deck level while the wave peak is still far from reaching the structure while the image from the 3d experiment shows no cavity the ideally 2d simulation forms a very small cavity the third pattern generated by the last two cases 6 and 7 forms a large cavity and a fluid arm that falls under gravity effects hits the deck and traps the cavity air this type of pattern is sometimes referred to as hammer fist the peak of the travelling wave is near the deck edge or above the deck hernández fontes et al 2018 note that the cases 1 and 6 have the largest cavities for their water height ratios presented in table 1 the scalar fields qualitatively showing magnitude of the velocity in fig 8 validate the formation of water patterns on the deck the main concentration of the velocity magnitude is located near the deck corner where the high pressure gradient develops such high gradient develops due to the proximity of the moving free surface with zero pressure to the vertical wall that experiences impact with high pressure therefore this pressure gradient accelerates the flow around the corner which results in air cavities formed depending on the magnitude of the pressure gradient areas of high velocity magnitude are also generated around the wave peaks that travel towards the structure the water in case 5 smoothly progresses onto the deck due to the low pressure gradient near the corner and the wave peak which remained far from the deck therefore the resulting complex motion of the shape of free surface stems from the pressure gradient evolution near the interface and along the structure wall in conclusion the resulting free surfaces for the test cases shown in fig 8 are properly reproduced by the numerical method hernández fontes et al 2018 demonstrated that it is possible to generate isolated green water events of different types on a fixed structure using the wet dam break approach and here it is demonstrated that these green water events of different types may also be numerically reproduced future work will deal with simulating yet untested scenarios with various parameters to find new forms of isolated green water events the dynamics of dam breaking is sometimes not modelled in numerical experiments i e the dam or gate simply disappears instead of moving upwards or breaking in cases of dam breaks over a wet bed the movement of the gate plays an important role for forming the incoming wave and affects the impact pressure on the wall downstream ye et al 2016 the described numerical experiments needed to incorporate precise gate movement as modifying the gate velocity for e g 10 leads to completely different wave pattern than the expected two probes wp0 and wp1 which are depicted in fig 7 measured the water depth at locations 150 mm left and 250 mm downstream from the gate respectively fig 9 compares the measurements made in two simulations to those obtained experimentally since the authors of the experiment note that the gate release was tuned to ensure opening times t 2 h 1 g by using a free fall weight it was challenging to reproduce the exact movements from the experiment the two simulations differ only in the imposed movement for the gate it can be seen that slightly varying the gate movement yield different steepness of the incoming wave nevertheless the numerically obtained values at wave probes are in very good agreement to the experimental data it should be noted that the bump detected by wp1 probe is a small wave that travels backwards after opening the gate due to a vortex forming by the accelerating flow around the moving gate bottom both simulations have reproduced this phenomenon finally the backflow wave causes oscillations in numerical readings because the numerical wave height sensor registers the highest point below its location without smooth interpolation for the sake of completeness of the analysis it is worth noting that without the gate the high water column falls under the action of gravity and forms a mushroom like jet structure stansby et al 1988 the mushroom grows while travelling downstream and eventually the front breaks the broken wave front continues travelling downstream while inducing subsequent small scale wave breakings this flow development significantly affects the wave pattern on the deck which is characterised mostly by separation of fluid clumps from the incoming wave due to the built up momentum at the interface the development of these events and how they contaminate the resulting wave pattern is rendered in fig 10 validation of numerical methods for coastal engineering usually relies on experimenting with dam breaks and their complex patterns such as mushroom like jets therefore the proposed method may be considered to be used for problems such as the tsunami wave run up 3 2 force on the deck after validating the generation of isolated shipping water events the following numerical experiments deal with vertical loads due to the shipping of water onto the deck the numerical experiment is set up according to the experiments conducted by hernández fontes et al 2019 the configuration of the experimental set up is almost the same to that shown in fig 7 where h 475 mm w 500 mm h 1 150 mm l 1 392 mm l 2 1258 mm and l 3 300 mm additionally a force balance with length of 195 mm was embedded into the deck that measured the slowly varying vertical force on the deck the heights of the water columns were chosen as h 0 144 mm and h 1 240 mm the authors of the experiment note that the chosen ratio of water columns h 0 h 1 0 6 yields a stable undular bore without 3d effects due to wave breaking different to the previous experiment a wave probe was located 5 mm upstream of the deck edge which measured the freeboard exceedance i e the difference of the incoming wave and the deck heights time series of vertical loads were obtained experimentally from the force balance measurements the experiments were repeated five times and the averaged time series is used here to validate the simulation results at the peak of the force curve relative minimum and maximum deviations from the average curve are less than 2 due to the good repeatability this experiment is taken as the 2d experiment for validating green water loads two simulations with initial point spacing of 2 5 mm and 1 5 mm were performed which consisted of 44000 and 112000 number of points respectively the readings of the wave probe located in front of the deck edge are shown in fig 11 through values of freeboard exceedance the finer discretisation yielded 3 higher freeboard exceedance compared to the coarse discretisation on the other hand both simulations had similar evolution of the force excreted on the deck which are graphed in fig 12 the simulations have adequately predicted the rise of the force as the water enters the deck the experiment has detected a sudden drop in pressure as water slides along the deck which was not detected by the simulations and may be due to aeration effects similar to those captured by the experiment some amount of oscillations are present in the numerical curves before the peak which are due to the high pressure gradient area at the edge of the deck that is responsible for developing and imploding air pockets figs 11 and 12 show that the convergence stays stable and similar for different discretisations the authors of the experiment also tried to validate the new convolution model to predict the loads results demonstrated that using the convolution model improved the representation of the time series of loads compared to the traditional dam break approach it managed to capture the peaks and the decay tendencies observed in the experimental data in an approximated way although significantly over predicting the experimentally measured loads on the other hand the results of the numerical simulations are in very good agreement with the experiment measurements 4 green water on a fpso model 4 1 fixed model in this section a validation of the numerical method for 3d green water loads on a fixed structure is conducted several experimental results on green water have been published but there is small amount of data available to be useful for cfd validation in this study the experiments conducted by lee et al 2012 are numerically reproduced in order to understand the physics of green water and to quantify the pressure distributions due to green water on deck the model geometry and the locations of the pressure sensors are shown in fig 13 the shown geometry named rect0 by the authors of the experiment is a simplified fixed model of an fpso vessel ten pressure sensors were installed at the deck of the model and the camera was recording the flow development on the deck the validation study focuses on comparing pressure signals from five innermost sensors that record complex pressure evolutions during green water events p11 p12 p13 p21 p22 the results of experiments under various wave conditions showed very similar shapes measured at p11 nine regular wave cases were investigated by the authors of the experiment the cases were chosen as a combination of three wavelengths λ w 2 25 3 0 and 3 75 m and three wave steepness values 2 a w λ w 0 04 0 05 and 0 06 the experiment with rect0 model and the wave named 9 with the largest amplitude is chosen to be reproduced for the validation study since it yields largest impact pressures the wave amplitude is a w 112 5 mm and the wavelength is λ w 3 75 m regular waves were generated at the inlet and relaxed into the domain wave probes validated the produced wave amplitude and they were used to detect where the nonlinearities start before the wave overtops the deck to size the domain properly one way coupling of the potential wave flow and meshless solver is done using the relaxation zones i e by imposing a known solution of the linear wave theory at the boundaries of the meshless domain and gradually transitioning to the nonlinear solution towards the middle of the domain literature is sparse when it comes to validating green water experiments by numerical means a study published by gatin et al 2018 is used for the comparison of numerical results in which the authors used unsteady rans solver based on the fvm and vof approach the domain size of the meshless solver was iteratively chosen to be small enough to save computational time but to capture relevant nonlinearities without contaminating results the domain extended 1 0 m in front of the model 1 0 m back from the vertical wall 0 5 m below the model and 0 5 m from the sides of the model the velocity known from the linear wave theory was imposed at all domain boundaries except for the downstream boundary which imposed the open boundary condition besides the domain size multiple point spacing values were tested and 12 mm was found to be adequate a couple of screenshots in fig 14 show a wave run up for larger point spacing δ 20 mm and somewhat larger domain size than the chosen one for the sake of comparison with the fvm a constant time step value of 3 ms was used for extracting the results of the study which corresponds to a cfl number of 1 0 at time during the impact firstly the behaviour of the computed green water events is investigated the progress of a green water event may be seen in fig 15 which compares the experimental and numerical behaviour of flow on the deck the meshless points are coloured by the magnitude of their velocity vector they are also rendered small so the deck can be visible typically water ingress started at the fore end of the deck and progressively water from the deck side merged the merging built large momentum which resulted in a violent impact against the wall the water slided along the wall upwards and then fell back on the deck thus receding away from the wall and the deck the numerical solver successfully reproduced the free surface evolution of the extremely nonlinear event i e the ingress of water on the deck piling against the wall during the impact and falling of the water on the deck during the simulation run pressure was registered at five relevant sensor locations using the meshless interpolation eq 10 the numerically obtained pressure signals of ten sequential green water events are plotted in fig 16 and compared to the experimental data and the results obtained by the fvm gatin et al 2018 it should be noted that the plotted numerical signals of 10 typical green water events are shifted in time in order to overlap with a part of the stable experimental signal for easier comparison the pressure signals usually exhibits two peaks during the green water event the first peak with a very short rising time is caused by the impact of the merged water front against the wall and the second peak with a longer rising time is caused by the fall of the piled up water which resembles to typical sloshing events the meshless solver managed to reproduce both peaks within a period of the green water event at all sensor locations the pressure at location p11 where the impact pressure was most frequently observed showed the largest uncertainty suggesting a strongly nonlinear and irregular feature of the green water impact lee et al 2012 the meshless simulation yielded somewhat more uniform peak magnitudes at location p11 than the experiment i e the simulated magnitudes on impacts were in the range from 2900 pa to 3500 pa and the magnitudes of the secondary peak were in the range from 1500 pa to 1750 pa for comparison the fvm yielded generally well fitting signals but with under predicted second peaks and some impact peak oscillations one noticeable difference is that its pressure signal yielded larger discrepancies further from the centreplane lee et al 2012 suggest that the average values of the sensors peak magnitudes are taken for validation of cfd solvers the comparison of the average peak magnitudes is presented in table 2 and also graphed in fig 17 at the location p11 results of the numerical simulations in average have relative deviations less than 4 from the experiment while results of the fvm have a discrepancy of 48 from the experiment due to the uncertain pressure response during the initial impact of the wave front against the wall overall the meshless simulation follows the experimental trend however the pressure peak magnitude itself does not reveal enough information describing a green water event or generally an impact event the pressure impulse is a more relevant measure from the structural point of view therefore the integrals of the graphed pressure signals in fig 16 are compared to the experimental pressure impulses shared by the authors of the experiment the comparison of the pressure impulse is presented in table 3 and also graphed in fig 18 by comparing tables 2 and 3 it is evident that the peaks and impulses are not strongly correlated for example the impulse at p21 is accurately predicted while the average pressure peak magnitude is under predicted by 10 in addition the pressure impulse at p11 obtained by the fvm is under predicted while the peak magnitudes are over predicted the results of the meshless simulation at locations p12 p13 and p21 are in extremely good agreement with the experimental results while the results at p11 and p22 are slightly under and over predicted respectively looking at the graph of the signal at location p11 it can be noticed that the simulation does not smooth out the pressure while water is receding from the location of the sensor similarly at p22 a single row of lagrangian points remains there at all time i e the deck stays wet this is due to the relatively large point spacing value δ 12 mm for such conditions in either case those points that remain at the deck influence the pressure signal only in between the impacts which is irrelevant from the structural point of view but may be relevant if the stability of the ship is investigated the culprit of non smooth ending of the pressure signal is that lagrangian points are either there or they are not therefore contributing or not contributing to the hydrostatic pressure i e wetting the deck this may be alleviated by making the points spacing smaller which would lead to many unnecessary points in the whole simulation domain a current limitation of the implementation is that each point is considered to represent the same amount of fluid volume in eulerian methods this is equivalent to using a uniform grid cell size throughout the domain a solution to this limitation is to size down the point spacing and the domain volume but not too excessively that would contaminate the results by too close boundaries that impose waves future work will deal with implementing adaptively sized points spacing in order to allow for better spatial precision in areas where user specifies on the other hand one may choose to couple an fvm solver and the meshless solver in a way that the meshless domain captures only the deck and its structures as in marrone et al 2016 this discrepancy arising from the pressure in between impacts is not of a significant importance when analysing structural loads therefore it can be concluded that the introduced meshless method and the domain decomposition technique can be used to accurately predict violent fluid structure impacts and green water loads 4 2 heaving model the following numerical experiment is used to test the robustness of the implemented solver by simulating the fpso model with introduced complexity of prescribed vessel movement the fpso model oscillates in the vertical direction i e it heaves with an amplitude of 50 mm the amplitude of incoming waves is 112 5 mm and the period is constrained to t w 1 55 s two heaving periods of the vessel were chosen in the simulations t h 0 75 s and t h 1 0 s the numerically obtained pressure signals of four sequential green water events on the moving vessel are plotted in fig 19 and compared to the numerical results obtained for the fixed vessel since the value of the first chosen heaving period t h 0 75 equals to almost half of the value of the waves period it is expected that the pressure signals will repeat over time indeed fig 19 shows that the signal is similar for each green water event except for some discrepancy of secondary pressure peaks at p21 it is observable that this heaving period significantly amplifies magnitudes of the secondary pressure peak and alleviates magnitudes of the primary pressure peak this is due to the vertical acceleration of the deck that occurs while the piled up water falls on the deck the second chosen heaving period t h 1 0 is not in scale of the waves period the pressure signal varies from event to event overall it can be deduced that magnitudes of the primary pressure peak are significantly amplified while magnitudes of the secondary pressure peak are only slightly modified an advantage the introduced meshless and lagrangian numerical method is that computational performance with moving geometry is similar as if the geometry is fixed on the other hand numerical methods based on conforming meshes would have to perform mesh deformation and advection corrections each time step in combination with physically moving geometry lagrangian fluid advection without a mesh simulates physics of green water events just as it is 5 discussion of the results a green water event can comprise of complex phenomenons i e a breaking wave on the moving deck impulsively impacts a moving wall while generating a jet falling pile of water spray etc the validation cases of isolated events of wetting the deck and periodic green water events in regular seas were successfully simulated in a short amount of time the study showed that wave impact pressures and pressure impulses can be predicted with very good accuracy furthermore a test with moving ship has shown the capability of the method to take all motions into account through the domain decomposition approach since meshing is not needed to set up a simulation the model may be rotated to achieve different wave headings there is an infinite amount of possible combinations of conditions formed by the 6 dof vessel movement and incoming waves that can occur in harsh ocean environments potential flow methods can quickly approximate vessel motions in waves but this validation study has shown that unsteady cfd analyses should be made for questionable combinations of conditions the introduced method has been shown to efficiently and robustly simulate local green water events and accurately predict hydrodynamic loads a solver implemented based on the introduced method can simulate questionable conditions relatively quickly on a modern pc an advantage of this meshless and lagrangian method is keeping similar computational performance of the solver that deals with moving geometry the validation cases have shown that the domain may be small enough to take into account only the space where nonlinearities occur the number of points forming fluid in such small domains may be less than 200000 a modern high end gpu can compute one time step in less than 250 ms i e it takes approximately 1 μ s per point per time step it was empirically found that the investigated simulations were stable with a cfl coefficient that was lower than 2 i e the velocity divergence managed to get damped without oscillations further investigation on the stability of the method is still needed one should also take into account that the end user of a truly meshless method does not need to waste their time on volumetric meshing results of the validation cases could benefit from adaptive refinement techniques which were not implemented in the solver by choosing larger point spacing and adaptively refining the discretisation near high pressure areas the domain could be made larger with the same number of points on another note the meshless domain can be made as small as possible by taking flow input from another mesh based e g fvm solver in either case these issues are not directly connected to the methodology but to the implementation of the solver 6 conclusions predicting the effects of green water on the stability and structure of the vessel is a challenging problem which needs to be assessed in the design process by analysing the limitations of currently used methods a rationale was developed and the research resulted in a novel design tool i e a methodology for incompressible flows suitable for simulating green water events the introduced methodology can be described as meshless lagrangian volume conservative fd based second order accurate in space efficient and suitable for coupling as the lagrangian description of the flow is suitable for violent free surface flows the mesh free description of the fluid volume is assumed using wls based spatial operators in their generalised fd form which work on highly irregular point clouds compared to sph and mps integral based operators fd operators are employed to simulate incompressible fluid flow by solving the velocity pressure formulation of the nse in strong form the novelty of the method also includes proper boundary condition imposed on a single row of points obtained by projecting fluid points onto the geometry each time step which means the geometry may be arbitrary moving or deforming furthermore possible loss or gain in fluid volume during the lagrangian advection is prevented by enforcing equidistant neighbours which adds to the stability of the method the validation was performed by simulating isolated events of green water on a fixed structure and regular waves wetting the deck of a fpso model isolated green water events were simulated using the wet dam break approach the incoming waves with bores and plunging were successfully reproduced as well as the force due to the shipping of water onto the deck a fixed model of an fpso was simulated on a regular wave field by the domain decomposition approach the study showed that wave impact pressures and pressure impulses can be predicted with very good accuracy the fpso was imposed with heaving motions to study the effect of vessel movement on the loads and the applicability of the method on realistic scenarios where the vessel may move with 6 dof it may be concluded that the proposed method provides good estimates of the evolution of pressure in green water problems which may be used for structural analyses besides coupling to another flow solver the flow solver implemented through the introduced methodology is ready to be coupled to a structural or a rigid body solver due to the direct use of discrete geometry in fluid simulations finally it should also be noted that the solver was implemented to run fully in parallel which enables state of the art simulations to be performed efficiently on personal computers proving the efficiency of the methodology it was shown how detailed simulations are computed in a reasonable amount of time faster than contemporary methods used for simulating same or similar problems credit authorship contribution statement josip bašić conceptualization methodology software validation

21777,flow induced vibrations fiv of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference is rather different and more complex comparing with vortex induced vibrations viv of an isolated cylinder in the uniform flow due to the wake interference mechanism involved in this study the forced vibration experiment is carried out on a rigid cylinder placed in tandem downstream of a stationary cylinder the hydrodynamic coefficients of the forced vibrating cylinder involving the steady drag coefficient c d the excitation coefficient c l v and the added mass coefficient c m y are obtained for the gap ratio g d 2 8 where g is the streamwise distance between the centers of two cylinders and d is the cylinder diameter compared with an isolated cylinder the mean drag coefficient is dramatically reduced and a much broader positive c l v that extends to higher amplitude and lower reduced frequency is observed the negative added mass coefficient presents for lower reduced frequency for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference a significant change in the distribution of hydrodynamic coefficients is found during the flow interference mode converting from the proximity interference into the full wake interference by means of discrete vortex method dvm simulations the free dynamic response of an elastically mounted cylinder placed in the wake of a stationary cylinder is numerically simulated comparison between the free and forced vibration of the downstream cylinder shows a good agreement between the superposed free vibration response plot and the contour line of zero c l v this result confirms the correlation between free and forced vibration for the cylinder fiv response with an upstream wake interference and further suggests that the forced vibration can be one approach to predicting the dynamic response and mapping the hydrodynamic properties of the fiv of multiple interfering cylinders keywords flow induced vibration forced vibration hydrodynamic coefficient wake interference 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a self induced and self limited oscillation of bluff bodies placed in flow viv can be a serious concern for operations and for the integrity and stability of structures and is of great importance to many fields of engineering therefore a great number of studies have been made to understand the characteristics and mechanisms of circular cylinders free to vibrate in the cross flow cf and or the in line il directions to the oncoming flow over the few five decades many of them have been reviewed in the comprehensive literatures of bearman 1984 sarpkaya 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 and triantafyllou et al 2016 the simplest form of the problem is an elastically mounted circular cylinder vibrating in the cf direction to the oncoming flow only feng 1968 experimentally measured the response for a cylinder with very high mass ratio the ratio between the structural mass and the displaced fluid mass from which two amplitude branches namely the initial and the lower branch were found over the reduced velocity khalak and williamson 1996 found the third amplitude branch of the cylinder between the other two branches namely the upper branch when the cylinder was of very low mass damping ratio apart from the dynamic response of cylinder govardhan and williamson 2000 firstly measured the vorticity field for free viv responses and confirmed that the initial branch corresponded to a 2s vortex mode and the upper and lower branches corresponded to a 2p vortex mode aside from the studies with free vibration of an elastically mounted structure one approach to an understanding and possible prediction of viv of an isolated cylinder has been to undertake forced vibrations of a cylinder in order to quantify the hydrodynamic forces on the cylinders undergoing viv the experiment of a rigid cylinder forced vibration in the cf direction only at prescribed frequencies and amplitudes has been conducted by sarpkaya 1977 1978 and gopalkrishnan 1992 later hover et al 1998 compared those hydrodynamic coefficients from forced vibrations with the free viv response data and found a good agreement between the superposed free viv response plot for zero damping and the contour of zero excitation coefficient from forced vibrations as shown in fig 1 in addition to the hydrodynamic forces of the cylinder the correspondence of vortex wake mode between forced and free vibration was also found williamson and roshko 1988 studied the vortex wake pattern for a cylinder controlled to translate in a sinusoidal trajectory over a wide variation of amplitudes and wavelengths they defined a whole set of different regimes for vortex wake modes and categorized them into three principle modes with the renormalization a good correspondence between the vortex shedding modes of free vibrations with the vortex mode regimes deduced from forced vibrations was observed carberry et al 2001 made an extensive flow visualization from forced vibrations of cylinder and showed that the force phase shift was related to the change in the mode of vortex formation yielding a direct agreement with the observations from free vibration in govardhan and williamson 2000 these studies accessed the correlation between forced and free vibration of viv for an isolated rigid cylinder however there are more configurations involving multiple cylinders in tandem side by side or staggered arrangement encountered in the engineering fields such as arrays of riser tubes used in offshore drilling and production platforms heat exchanger tubes closely spaced chimney stacks and overhead conductor cables when one cylinder is placed in the wake of one or several cylinders the hydrodynamic interference among the cylinder will result in different structural dynamic responses and fluid morphologies compared to those of an isolated cylinder as the simplest and representative multiple cylindrical configuration the two cylinders in tandem arrangement have become the canonical model in the investigation of fundamental physics involved in the flow past multiple cylindrical structures for the flow past two stationary cylinders zdravkovich 1987 1988 summarized the flow pattern as the trailing cylinder is arranged circumferentially around a leading cylinder and plotted a map categorizing the flow pattern into four interference regimes the proximity interference occurs for the side by side arrangement this regime is characterized by the interactions of the shear layers of vorticity with opposite direction the proximity wake interference occurs for the cylinders arranged in tandem with a small distance this regime is characterized by the reattachment of the shear layers of vorticity with the same direction the full wake interference occurs for the tandem separation of the cylinders beyond a critical distance in this regime the shear layers of the upstream cylinder fully roll up generating an alternate vortex shedding in the gap the upstream wake vortices impinge on the downstream cylinder and interact with the downstream vortex shedding and no interference for the two cylinders staggered with the separation beyond a critical value the flow responses of two cylinders are similar to those of an isolated cylinder in the uniform inflow in this regime in addition to the categorization by zdravkovich the alternative classifications of the flow pattern around two stationary cylinders can be found in sumner et al 2000 hu and zhou 2008 and zhou and alam 2016 these studies showed that the flow pattern of multiple cylinders become more complicated due to the existence of flow interference flow past the stationary cylinders forms complicated gap flow structures and wake vortex patterns due to wake to wake interference however if the cylinder placed in the wake of the upstream cylinder is allowed to oscillate in the cf direction the interference of wake to structure will occur and result in the cylinder responding in a way that is significantly different from the typical viv of the isolated cylinder such a phenomenon is named as the wake induced vibration wiv a fiv response that is characterized by a build up of the oscillation amplitude persisting to high reduced velocities bokaian and geoola 1984 investigated the effects of the structural mass ratio and the tandem separation between the cylinders on the response of the downstream cylinder they observed that the viv and wiv response of the downstream cylinder can be induced in different specific range of reduced velocities these two types of response can occur separately or overlap depending on the mass ratio and separation distance between two cylinders brika and laneville 1999 investigated the effect of tandem spacing on the wiv of the downstream cylinder they found that the downstream oscillation amplitude and synchronization region is reduced with the increase of tandem spacing until the response resembles that of a single cylinder the phenomenon that the wake interference effect on the downstream response persists to the tandem separation up to 25 diameters was observed assi et al 2010 revealed that the wiv response frequency is not locked to a specific value close to the structural natural frequency as the case of viv of a single cylinder but follows a slightly upward line such a characteristic frequency response persists to the tandem spacing reaching 20 diameters even though the downstream oscillation amplitude resembling that of the typical viv response in such a separation in addition the lift force on the downstream cylinder is dominated by two frequency branches a lower frequency corresponding to the oscillation frequency and a higher frequency associated with the upstream vortex shedding frequency with the understanding of the wiv mechanism zdravkovich 1977 pointed out that the upstream wake would induce a lift force that is acting to return the downstream cylinder to the wake centerline namely the wake displacement mechanism due to the downstream response resembling classical galloping response of the non circular bluff bodies bokaian and geoola 1984 referred to this response as wake induced galloping typical galloping of non circular bluff bodies described by den hartog 1956 is related to a fluid dynamic instability however a hydrodynamic restoring force acting on the downstream cylinder indicates a dynamic equilibrium of the cylinder rather than the phenomenon of instability and therefore the classical galloping theory of non circular bluff bodies is not suitable for the wiv mechanism hover and triantafyllou 2001 observed one single branch of the downstream response that builds up monotonically reaching amplitude of 1 9 diameters for reduced velocity around 17 they explained such a high amplitude branch as an upward extension of the frequency lock in branch that occurs for the viv response of a single cylinder however there was no evidence that the vortex shedding frequency of either cylinder is synchronized with the frequency of oscillation in another word the typical viv resonance cannot be simply extended to the explanation of the wiv response assi et al 2010 investigated the downstream response with the unsteady vortices removed from the wake of the upstream body and found that the wiv response would not be induced in such a situation they concluded that this galloping like response of the downstream cylinder was essentially a result of vortex induced mechanism a mechanism of unsteady vortex structure interactions between the upstream wake vortices and the downstream body in their subsequent study assi et al 2013 they introduced a concept of wake stiffness that was evaluated a quasi static lift map of two stationary cylinders the wake stiffness concept predicted the frequency response of wiv rather well however the wake stiffness cannot explain the excitation mechanism of wiv and failed to quantify the hydrodynamic properties of wiv song et al 2020 proposed an empirical predication model of wiv frequency based on a fitted strouhal frequency formula this model just considered two variables the reduced velocity and the gap spacing ratio but with some other essential parameters as reynolds number and structural mass ratio etc ignored up to now there is no such a model that can predict both the amplitude and frequency response as well as the hydrodynamic properties of wiv inspired by the fact that the viv response and hydrodynamic forces of an isolated cylinder can be quantified by the forced vibration one may raise a question whether forced vibration could be used for predicting the fiv response and mapping the hydrodynamic properties of a cylinder with an upstream wake interference to authors best knowledge no forced vibration experiments have been conducted on such a problem therefore we carried out such forced vibration experiment and the free vibration numerical simulation on the cylinder with an upstream wake interference in this study with an intention to answer the questions a whether the result of fluid forces acquired from the forced vibration experiment with the multiple cylinders could be used to predict the free vibration response of the multiple cylinders b if there is correlation between free and forced vibration what the hydrodynamic properties of the downstream cylinder would be in this study by mean of the forced vibration experiment we obtained the hydrodynamic coefficients involving the drag coefficient c d excitation coefficient c l v and added mass coefficient c m y of the vibrating downstream cylinder with different tandem spacing ratios to the upstream stationary cylinder ranging from 2 to 8 and we numerically simulated the free wiv response of an elastically mounted cylinder placed in the wake of a stationary cylinder by means of dvm simulations at last comparisons between forced and free vibration results were carried out this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the model and method of the experiment of forced vibrations and the numerical method of fiv simulations in section 3 the hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder are presented for the forced vibration in section 4 the dynamic response of the downstream cylinder is presented for the free fiv response in section 5 we make a comparison between the contours of excitation from forced vibration with free vibration response amplitudes and frequencies addressing the correlation between the free and forced vibrations of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference we summarize main findings and conclusions in section 6 in the appendix we present the validation of the current experimental and numerical result with a comparison to the previous studies 2 experimental and numerical method 2 1 experimental method and model the rigid cylinder forced vibration experiments are performed at mit sea grant intelligent towing tank itt lab itt has a towing length of 10m and a 1 m 1 m test cross section the main carriage is installed on two rails aligned with the tank length and is able to reach a constant velocity from 0 01 m s to 1 50 m s on the carriage a three degree of freedom stage is installed allowing combined trajectories of in line align with the towing direction cross flow perpendicular to the towing direction and rotation motions the software of the experimental facility is developed with integrated capability of the motion update and trajectory monitoring power pmac system force measurement ni daq usb6218 with an ati gamma 6 axis force sensor in the current experimental setup the two rigid cylinder models are mounted on the carriage piercing through the water the upstream cylinder is fixed at the non moving part of the carriage as a stationary rigid cylinder and the downstream cylinder is mounted at the linear stage allowing cf motion with prescribed amplitudes and frequencies the diameter of the two cylinders is d 3 81 cm 1 5 and in water length is l 45 72 cm 18 for downstream cylinder and l u 50 8 cm 20 for upstream cylinder the two rigid cylinder models are made from hard anodized aluminum tube in order to prevent corrosion as the cylinders stay in the water for a long time during the experiment process and the ati gamma force sensor is mounted on top of the downstream cylinder out of the water allowing itt to measure the forces applied on the cylinder during the experiment at 1000hz and at the same time itt recorded the cylinder prescribed motion simultaneously in order to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients a sketch of the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 in the cf only vibration experiment the cylinder is towed at a fixed velocity u 0 2 m s thus achieving r e u d v 7 620 where v is the fluid kinematic viscosity the cylinder s prescribed motion is therefore as follows 2 1 y t y 0 cos 2 π f s t where y 0 and f s are the cross flow oscillation amplitude and frequency respectively the lift force l t and drag force d t on the cylinder can be modeled as follows 2 2 l t l 0 cos 2 π f s t φ 0 d t d m d 0 cos 4 π f s t ϕ 0 where d m is the magnitude of the mean drag force l 0 and d 0 are the magnitudes of the oscillating lift and drag forces at frequencies f s and 2 f s respectively φ 0 is the phase difference measured between the cross flow motion and the oscillating lift force and ϕ 0 is the phase difference measured between the cross flow motion and the oscillating drag force the hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder i e mean drag coefficient c d lift coefficient in phase with velocity c l v and added mass coefficient in the cross flow

gap ratio g d from 2 0 to 8 0 as follows 2 3 c d c l v c m y c 0 a y d f r g d therefore from experiments we can measure the three hydrodynamic coefficients as follows 2 4 c d 2 d m ρ l d u 2 2 5 c l v 2 l 0 sin φ 0 ρ l d u 2 2 6 c m y l 0 cos φ 0 2 π ρ y 0 f s where ρ is the fluid density and is the cylinder displacement volume of π d 2 l 4 we need to clarify here the difference between the definition of the reduced velocity u r and the true reduced velocity v r as follows 2 7 v r u f s d 2 8 u r u f 0 d where f s is the cylinder vibration frequency and f 0 is the natural frequency of the elastically mounted cylinder in the still water assuming the added mass coefficient to be 1 0 2 2 numerical method and model in the numerical simulation of the free fiv response of the downstream cylinder placed in tandem with a stationary upstream cylinder a lagrangian computational fluid dynamics cfd model of discrete vortex method dvm is adopted to solve the flow field of fiv numerically dvm is a meshless cfd method it discretizes the continuous vorticity filed of fluid into a number of discrete vortex elements with initial circulation the flow is simulated by tracing the motion of whole vortex elements in the lagrangian reference frame implementing the boundary conditions by the stream function dvm has good boundary adaptability in computation especially for the calculation of flow field involving several bodies or complex two dimensional shapes on the other hand solving the motion of thousands of vortex elements this method is highly efficient in the computation of flow at a relatively high reynolds number benefiting from these aspects dvm is used in the fiv simulations in this work for the flow of an incompressible and viscous newtonian fluid the equation that governs the fluid flow can be formulated by the continuity equations and the navier stokes ns equations 2 9 v 0 2 10 v t v v 1 ρ p v 2 v where v is the fluid velocity vector p is the fluid pressure field ρ is the fluid density and v is the fluid kinematic viscosity taking the curl of both sides of the continuity equations and the ns equations and considering that the fluid vorticity can be expressed by the curl of the velocity ω v the continuity equations can be rewritten as the vorticity stream function form and the ns equations can be rewritten as the vorticity transport equations 2 11 ω 2 ϕ 2 12 d ω d t v 2 ω ω v where ϕ is the stream function assuming the flow is two dimensional ω has only one nonzero component and ω v 0 can be eliminated from above equation with the operator splitting method employed equation 2 12 is divided into two parts the convection equation 2 13 and the diffusion equation 2 14 2 13 ω t v ω 0 2 14 ω t v 2 ω for dvm the essential idea is that the continuous fluid vorticity field is discretized into a series of vortex elements equation 2 13 indicates that the convection of fluid vorticity is according to v ω and the discretization of vorticity field generates the vortex particles having a constant strength equation 2 14 formulates the viscous diffusion of fluid vorticity it has the same form as the one dimensional heat conduction equation its fundamental solution is the green s function on the basis of brownian motion theory chorin 1973 introduced a random walk method to solve the vorticity diffusion the principle involved is to subject all of the free vortex elements to small random displacements which produces a scatter equivalent to the diffusion of vorticity in the continuum for the elastically mounted rigid cylinder considering structural damping and the external force imparted by the fluid flow the dynamics of the cylinders are formulated by equation 2 15 2 15 m 2 q t 2 c q t k q f where m is cylinder mass q is cylinder displacement c is structural damping k is structural spring stiffness and f is the lift force acting on the cylinder defining the mass ratio m damping ratio ς and reduced velocity u r as 2 16 m 4 m ρ π d 2 ς c 2 k m f 0 1 2 π k m u r u f 0 d where d is the diameter of the cylinder f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder and u is the incoming stream velocity introducing these parameters into equation 2 15 we obtain the dimensionless motion equation of the cylinders as 2 17 2 q t 2 4 π ς u r q t 4 π 2 u r 2 q 2 c l π m 0 where c l is the lift coefficient and q is now the dimensionless displacement of the cylinder equation 2 17 comprises 2 s order linear differential equations in the present simulations of fiv of the cylinders the fluid structure interaction is numerically implemented based on a loose coupling strategy the governing equations of fluid flow and the dynamics motion equations of the cylinders are explicitly solved separately the flow field is numerically solved based on the two dimensional discrete vortex method the hydrodynamic force obtained from the fluid field computation is passed into the motion calculations of the cylinders as the external load the dynamic responses of the cylinders are numerically calculated based on a fourth order runge kutta method the displacement and velocity of the cylinders are passed into the fluid computation as the updated boundary condition in lin et al 2020 the present fsi numerical solver has been validated for the fiv simulation of two interfering cylinders in this study the numerical fiv model is identical to that was used in lin et al 2020 therefore the computational parameters used in current simulations are also identical to those have been validated in lin et al 2020 the generation rate of the discrete vortex element is set to 256 per time step where 128 vortex elements are generated for each cylinder per time step the number of vortex elements in whole flow field is kept below 50000 the computational domain extends the distance of 40 cylinder diameters downstream of the downstream cylinder the vortex element beyond this region is eliminated from the computations the non dimensional time step nondimensionalized by the cylinder diameter and oncoming flow speed is set at 0 1 3 hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder for forced vibration in this section we present the hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder from the forced vibration experiment and characterize the hydrodynamic properties for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference in fig 3 we give three examples of the time series of the prescribed cylinder oscillation motion at f r 0 1 and a y d 0 55 a and the corresponding lift blue and drag red coefficient with three different gap ratios g d 2 b 4 c and 8 d the result shows that at the same prescribed motion due to the interference of an upstream cylinder the downstream cylinder experience different force patterns for example we observe that the lift coefficient of g d 4 has a larger magnitude than that of g d 2 and g d 8 it appears that only one dominant frequency component exists in the case of g d 4 while the g d 2 case displays that multiple frequency components coexist in the lift coefficient time series we performed fast fourier transform fft analysis on the downstream cylinder lift coefficient at a fixed a y d 0 55 over different gap ratios from g d 2 to 8 for three different reduced frequencies the result is plotted in fig 4 for f r 0 08 a f r 0 18 b and f r 0 28 c in all three cases we observe that the dominant frequency peak of the lift forced corresponds to the imposed forced vibration reduced frequency as marked with the blue dashed line however coming to the case of f r 0 08 one can observe that in addition to the frequency peak corresponding to forced vibration reduced frequency the blue dash line there is another frequency peak connected by the black dash line increasing with the gap ratio and approaching the reduced frequency of f r 0 2 the red dash line this distinctive frequency branch is expected to be associated with the wake interference mechanism assi et al 2010 observed that the downstream lift force exhibited single frequency for the reduced velocity lower than 6 corresponding to the reduced frequency larger than 0 167 with the reduced velocity increasing over 6 corresponding to the reduced frequency smaller than 0 167 the lift force of downstream cylinder was dominated by two frequencies one frequency branch identical to the upstream vortex shedding frequency and another frequency branch corresponding to the oscillation frequency of downstream cylinder therefore a second frequency peak is identified in the fft plot for the f r 0 08 in addition such a phenomenon also suggests that at least for the low f r vibration not only the hydrodynamic characteristics of the downstream cylinder is affected by the upstream cylinder the downstream cylinder in turn affects the upstream cylinder hydrodynamics when the gap ratio is small the occurrence of the proximity wake interference will reduce the upstream wake frequency resulting in the second reduced frequency component lower than 0 2 with the increase of gap ratio the proximity wake interference effect decreases resulting in the upstream wake frequency as well as the second reduced frequency branch similar to a single static cylinder wake frequency of f r 0 2 fig 5 presents the contour plot of the drag coefficient for the forced vibrating cylinder as a function of f r and a y d for various gap ratios for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference the drag coefficient is smaller compared to that of the isolated cylinder in fig 5 a the minimum c d of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference is drastically reduced to 0 5 for the gap ratio g d 2 at small amplitudes when the gap ratio increases the minimum c d gradually rises to that of isolated cylinder as 1 25 the result of the negative c d of the downstream cylinder at small gap ratios has also been reported by the previous studies with two cylinders in tandem arrangement bokaian and geoola 1984 such a phenomenon is related to the pressure decrease at stagnation point of the downstream cylinder when the two cylinders are very close to each other when the gap ratio is small the downstream cylinder is inside the free shear layer of the upstream cylinder and subjects to the low pressure region in the wake of the upstream cylinder especially for the small amplitude vibration when the downstream cylinder vibrates with large amplitude the downstream motion would exceed the upstream wake region and be immersed within the uniform oncoming flow in the meantime we find that the c d distribution over f r and a y d for different gap ratios are similar c d increases with the increase of f r and a y d the lift coefficient in phase with the velocity c l v is used to quantify the average fluid structure energy transfer the positive c l v represents the average positive energy transfer from the fluid to the structure over one vibration period and when the c l v is negative the surrounding fluid takes energy out of the structural vibration fig 6 presents the contour of c l v for the downstream cylinder as a function of f r and a y d for various gap ratios for the single cylinder the positive c l v is mainly distributed in two regions the primary region is located at f r 0 12 0 18 and a y d 0 0 85 and the second smaller region corresponds to f r 0 23 0 27 and a y d 0 0 25 unlike the c d when there is an upstream cylinder the c l v of the downstream cylinder is found to be significantly different from that of the isolated cylinder to begin with the positive c l v is found to obtain a much wider region of f r for all gap ratios tested in the current experiment compared to the single cylinder case for the gap ratio in the range of 2 5 the main region of positive c l v extends to the lower f r and higher a y d with the gap ratio increasing from 3 to 8 the main region of positive c l v shrinks to the lower a y d and gradually resembles the pattern of the single cylinder the variation trend of the distribution of positive c l v is consistent with the variation of the fiv response amplitude of the elastically mounted cylinder with an upstream wake interference as the gap ratio increases assi et al 2010 it also can be noted that there is a substantial change of the distribution of positive c l v for the gap ratio varying from 2 5 to 3 for the gap ratio below 3 the distribution of positive c l v can be divided into two areas one area located in f r 0 15 0 25 and a y d 0 0 8 and the second area located in f r 0 15 0 25 and a y d 0 6 however the positive c l v is mainly distributed in a whole area for the gap ratio beyond 3 such a change of the positive c l v distribution for the gap ratio changing from 2 5 to 3 is expected to be associated with the transition of flow interference from the proximity interference where a reattachment of the shear layers occurs and the gap flow is characterized by the presence of unstable shear layers to the full wake interference where the shear layers of each cylinders fully roll up and the gap flow is characterized by the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder in a potential flow the added mass coefficient of a cylinder takes the value of 1 0 when viv happens the effective added mass coefficient c m y of the oscillating cylinder can vary significantly with the amplitude and frequency of the cylinder from 0 6 to 3 as a result of the alternation in the relative motion between the shedding vortex and structural motion such a large variation of the effective added mass results in a large range of the potential true natural frequency especially for the low mass ratio systems which leads to the lock in over a large range of the reduced velocity on the basis of the definition given by triantafyllou et al 2016 the crossflow added mass coefficient is evaluated from the lift coefficient in phase with the cylinder acceleration fig 7 presents the contour of the c m y for the downstream cylinder as a function of f r and a y d for various gap ratios in the case of the single cylinder the c m y shows a strong dependence on f r and varies observably with a y d when f r is large at f r 0 15 the c m y decreases from a large positive value to a negative value when f r reduces in the cases of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference the distribution of c m y roughly resembles the pattern of the single cylinder the negative c m y is present for the lower f r and at a certain f r the c m y switches to positive however there is a significant difference of the critical value of f r when the value of the c m y changes sign for different gap ratios for the gap ratio g d 2 the critical line of c m y is located at f r 0 1 for the gap ratios in the range of 3 5 the critical line is generally located at f r 0 08 with the gap ratio increasing from 5 to 8 the f r corresponding to the critical line increases from 0 08 to 0 12 towards the value in the single cylinder case one may also note that the variation of c m y is more complex for the gap ratio g d 2 and 2 5 compared with those for the larger gap ratios for the small a y d in the cases of gap ratio g d 2 and 2 5 the critical line depends both on f r and a y d while the critical line depends highly on f r only for the cases of g d 3 the difference between the distribution of c m y for the gap ratio below and above 3 is also expected to be related to the transition of flow interference from the proximity interference to the full wake interference in addition for the single cylinder case carberry et al 2005 found that the variation of the c m y is directly associated with the variation in the timing of vortex formation relative to the cylinder motion as well as a change in the mode of vortex shedding from a cylinder undergoing controlled oscillations it is expected that the variation of the c m y of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference may be also accompanied with a switch in the wake vortices mode which requires further investigation via flow visualization another difference that should be noted is the minimum value of c m y in the case of the single cylinder the minimum value of c m y reaches a value of about 0 5 however for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference the minimum of the c m y can be lower than 1 0 4 dynamic response of the downstream cylinder for free vibration in this section we discuss the free fiv response of an elastically mounted cylinder placed within the wake of an upstream stationary cylinder assi et al 2010 presented the dynamic response amplitude and frequency of the downstream cylinder positioned at various distances from 4 to 20 diameters from the fixed upstream cylinder the free fiv response was measured at various reynolds numbers ranging from 2500 to 30000 in their experiments however the forced vibration experiment of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference is carried out at a fixed reynolds number of 7620 to make a correspondence with the forced vibration we numerically simulated the fiv response of a cylinder placed within the wake of a stationary cylinder at a fixed reynolds number according to that in the forced vibration by mean of dvm simulation the numerical model is constructed by reference to the experimental model of assi et al 2010 in the simulation the two cylinders are of equal diameter and the reynolds number is fixed at 7500 the mass ratio with respect to the displaced fluid mass and the damping ratio of the downstream system are set equal to 2 6 and 0 respectively the reduced velocity of the downstream cylinder is changed from 3 to 14 respectively four representative gap ratios g d 2 4 5 and 6 are considered in the present simulations figs 8 and 9 presents the fiv response amplitude and displacement frequency ratio of the downstream cylinder respectively the present simulation results are also plotted against the results of assi et al 2010 with the interference of the upstream wake the downstream fiv response persists to high reduced velocities which are beyond the resonance range of a typical single cylinder viv response for reduced velocities below 5 the fiv response amplitude of the downstream cylinder builds up with the increase of reduced velocity the fiv frequency closely following the line of st 0 2 indicates that the synchronization between the cylinder motion and the vortex shedding is responsible for the downstream response at reduced velocities below 5 assi et al 2010 referred to this region as a viv resonance response for reduced velocities beyond 5 the wiv response that is related to the wake interference mechanism emerges the response frequency increases with the reduced velocity following a slightly declined line but is not locked to a value close to the natural frequency as a typical viv response a combined viv and wiv response is established in this range the response amplitude curves also suggest that the amplitude of the downstream fiv response decreases as the cylinders are positioned further apart due to fluid viscosity the upstream wake vortices dissipate with the flow when being convected downstream which weakens the wake interference effect on the downstream cylinder on the other hand a discrepancy can be noted in the amplitude response between the present simulation and assi s experiment in present simulation the reduced velocity is changed by varying the natural frequency and reynolds number is kept constant while in the experiment reduced velocity is varied by changing the oncoming flow speed which also leads to different reynolds numbers at different reduced velocities assi et al 2013 concluded that wiv is a reynolds number dependent type of fiv response the reynolds number difference between two studies causes the discrepancy in wiv as well as the fiv response figs 10 12 present five consecutive instantaneous flow pattern plots in one period of the downstream vibration for u f 0 d 5 for three representative gap ratios in sub figures f we plot the time trace of the downstream cylinder cf motion with the red circles suggesting the time of five flow pattern plots in the flow pattern sub figures simulated by dvm the red and blue points represent the positive and negative vortex elements respectively based on the distribution of vortex elements the clockwise and counterclockwise vortices are identified by the gathering of the vortex elements in blue and red respectively fig 10 a e showing the instantaneous flow patterns for g d 2 display a flow pattern as follow as the downstream cylinder moves upwards the blue shear layers of the upstream cylinder reattaches on the downstream body and merge with the blue shear layers of the downstream cylinder the red shear layers of the upstream cylinder generate a recirculation in the gap as the downstream cylinder moves downwards the reattachment of the red shear layers and the blue recirculation in the gap arises fig 10 g provides the power spectral density of the lift force acting on two cylinders the lift force of two cylinders has the same dominant frequency such a result is due to the occurrence of the reattachment of shear layers and combined wake vortex shedding of two cylinders these results confirm the occurrence of proximity wake interference for g d 2 moving to the instantaneous flow patterns shown in fig 11 a e for g d 3 a different flow pattern exhibits compared to the mode for g d 2 as follow as the downstream reaches the maximum displacement at the downward side the upstream blue shear layers roll up and separate from the upstream cylinder forming a vortex in the wake a when the downstream cylinder moves upwards the blue vortex in the upstream wake merges with the shear layers of downstream cylinder b as the downstream cylinder reaches the maximum position at the upward side a red vortex sheds from the upstream cylinder c then this red vortex splits into two sub vortex due to the downward movement of the downstream cylinder d these plots suggest that the gap flow is characterized by an upstream vortex shedding for the case of g d 3 in addition one may also note that the upstream vortex exhibits different behaviors in the processes of the downstream cylinder moving upward and downward this phenomenon can be explained by fig 11 g where the power spectral density of the lift force acting on two cylinders is shown the lift force frequency of the stationary upstream cylinder is close to the value of strouhal number at subcritical reynolds number the lift force of the downstream cylinder has two frequency peaks a frequency equal to the frequency of the upstream lift force and another frequency that is related to the oscillation frequency also the vortex shedding frequency of the downstream cylinder the difference between the frequencies of the upstream wake and downstream motion results in a varying phase lag between the upstream vortex shedding and the downstream motion as well as the unsteady vortex structure interaction pattern the different frequencies between the lift force of two cylinders and separate vortex shedding indicate the occurrence of full wake interference the similar phenomenon is also found for the gap ratio g d 4 recalling the change in hydrodynamic coefficients for the forced vibration during the gap ratio increasing from 2 5 to 3 it is expected that the transition in the flow interference regime results in the change in hydrodynamic coefficients 5 comparison between free and forced vibration of the downstream cylinder from an energy balance point of view for a stable free vibration of an elastically mounted cylinder placed within an external flow the average fluid structure energy transfer must be balanced for a dynamic equilibrium when the structural damping is negligible c l v should be equal to zero such an assumption has been displayed qualitatively valid by hover et al 1998 for an isolated cylinder in the uniform flow shown in fig 1 this observation confirmed the correlation between the free and forced vibrations of a single cylinder and also demonstrated that the forced vibration can be used for mapping the hydrodynamic properties of viv of a single cylinder in sec 3 the hydrodynamic forces of a cylinder with an upstream wake interference are obtained by the forced vibration experiment in sec 4 the fiv dynamic response of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder in the wake of an upstream stationary cylinder is obtained by numerical simulations in this section in a similar way as used in hover et al 1998 we plot in fig 11 the simulated response amplitude on the contour plots of c l v for forced vibrations at given true reduced velocities shown in equation 2 7 the vibration frequency is used the experimental fiv response points of assi et al 2010 are also referred to and plotted together on the contours in fig 13 the contour plot of c l v for forced vibrations with an overlay of the present simulated and the experimental free vibration results is presented for four cases of gap ratio g d 2 4 5 and 6 the asterisks and circles denote the simulated fiv response points and the experimental fiv response points respectively the red line highlights the contour line of c l v 0 in fig 13 a remarkable agreement can be observed between the free fiv response data path and the zero c l v line of forced vibrations in the case of g d 2 due to the proximity of two cylinders a reattachment of the shear layers occurs the flow around two cylinders behaves as around a single bluff body resulting in the fiv response characterized by the classical galloping of non circular bluff bodies the fiv amplitude a y d increases as the reduced frequency f r deceases the line of c l v 0 generally follows this trend as shown in fig 13 a regarding the cases of g d 3 the flow interference turns into the full wake interference regime the fiv response is sustained by the vortex shedding mechanism in the initial amplitude build up stage the oscillation frequency f s is equal to the vortex shedding frequency and varies with oncoming flow speed u linearly resulting in the reduced frequency f r defined by f s d u roughly constant the contour lines experience a nearly vertical shape at this stage consistent with the path of free vibration points in the subsequent stage the fiv response is dominated by the wake interference mechanism the fiv oscillation turns into a wiv response the oscillation amplitude continues to increase with the oncoming flow speed but the oscillation frequency varies little the fiv response points roughly follows an oblique line towards high amplitude and low reduced frequency also tracing the zero c l v line for forced vibrations in particular although assi et al 2010 measured the wiv response at various reynolds numbers and the present hydrodynamic coefficient is obtained at a fixed reynolds number the free response data of assi et al closely trace the zero c l v line of forced vibrations this suggests the availability of present c l v contour plot for forced vibrations in predicting the free vibration within a similar reynolds number range the good agreement between free and forced vibration results confirms the correlation between free and forced vibrations for the multiple interfering cylinders fiv and suggests that forced vibration can be used for mapping the hydrodynamic properties of the fiv response of a cylinder with an upstream wake interference beyond these similarities one may also note that there is discrepancy between the superposed free vibration response plot and the contour of zero c l v especially in the case of g d 6 there are two possible causes for this discrepancy on the one hand for the free fiv response the cylinder oscillation is an irregular sinusoidal motion including beating motion when the fiv response turns into wiv not only is the average amplitude building up but also the deviation from the average amplitude is increasing with reduced velocity however in the forced vibration the cylinder undergoes strictly sinusoidal motion on the other hand as pointed by hover et al 1998 the force signals have much better correlation in the forced oscillation tests than in the free vibration responses 6 conclusion for the wiv response of an elastically mounted cylinder placed within the wake of a stationary upstream cylinder the most plausible modelling and prediction of it seems to be the wake stiffness concept proposed by assi et al 2013 up to now even though this model just predict the frequency response with the amplitude response not included to authors best knowledge this is the first kind of such a study that verified the forced vibration being a strong candidate to accurately predict the amplitude and frequency responses of wiv also understand the hydrodynamic properties of the fiv response of multiple interfering cylinders furthermore the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained in this work have implications for practical applications especially for the semi empirical modelling efforts to predict the fiv response of multiple cylindrical structures in this study forced vibration experiments are conducted on the cylinder with an upstream wake interference the hydrodynamic coefficients of the cylinder involving the mean drag coefficients c d excitation coefficients c l v and added mass coefficients c m y are obtained over a wide variation of oscillation amplitudes a y d 0 05 1 35 and reduced frequencies f r 0 05 0 35 for various gap ratios g d 2 8 by overlying the simulated wiv response and experimental results of assi et al 2010 on the contour plot of c l v from forced vibrations a remarkable agreement is observed between the superposed free vibration response plot and the contour of zero excitation such a result confirms the correlation between free and forced vibrations and suggests that the dynamic responses of wiv can be predicted by the forced vibration in addition to the prediction of the amplitude and frequency responses of wiv the hydrodynamic properties of the fiv response with an upstream wake interference have also been understood by the forced vibration experiment for mean drag coefficient c d in the case of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference due to the downstream cylinder immersed in the wake of the upstream cylinder the drag coefficient is observed to be dramatically reduced compared with that of a single cylinder especially for the downstream cylinder oscillating with a small amplitude in a close distance for excitation coefficient c l v compared with the distribution of c l v for an isolated cylinder a significantly wider region of positive c l v is observed for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference as it extends to the lower f r and higher a y d with the increase of gap ratio the main region of positive c l v shrinks to lower a y d and gradually resembles the pattern of the single cylinder for added mass coefficient c m y compared with a single cylinder the critical line between positive and negative c m y corresponds to the lower f r which indicates that the cylinder response is more likely to have a negative added mass coefficient for high reduced velocity in the case of the single cylinder the minimum c m y reaches a value of 0 5 however for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference the variation of c m y is particularly striking since it can be as low as 1 0 the more significant variation of added mass coefficient indicates that the cylinder experiences more significant vortex structure interactions with an upstream wake interference for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference a significant change is observed for the distribution of all hydrodynamic coefficients during the gap ratio varying from 2 to 3 for small gap ratio the hydrodynamic coefficients experience more complicated variations the fiv wake pattern by numerical simulation suggests that the significant change of the hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder results from the transition of flow interference regime from the proximity interference to the full wake interference the hydrodynamic coefficient database of the forced vibration experiment in this paper can be downloaded from the link of https github com

of a single cylinder forced vibrating in the cf direction with a prescribed sinusoidal motion at re 7620 similar experiment has also been performed by gopalkrishnan 1992 and hover et al 1998 at mit tow tank lab the acquired hydrodynamic coefficients of gopalkrishnan 1992 not only helped to shed some light on the complex behavior of the rigid cylinder viv but also it formed a hydrodynamic

reynolds number show strong similarities between each other as follows 1 c d is found to increase with an increase of f r and a y d when f r 0 17 while c d does not strongly depend on f r when f r 0 17 and thus only increases with the increase of a y d 2 c l v has two positive regions in the experimental space contour line of c l v 0 is highlighted with bold red line the second positive region

lift force frequency of the upstream cylinder c and the downstream cylinder d between the results of simulation and experiment of assi et al 2010 the experimental data show that the fiv response of the downstream cylinder resembles the initial branch of typical viv response for reduced velocity below 5 then turns into the wiv response which is characterized by a build up of oscillation amplitude persisting to high reduced velocity our numerical simulations yield results in very good quantitative agreement with the experiment and captures all qualitative trends of the wiv response as observed in previous experimental study meanwhile it can be noted that the numerical oscillation amplitude exhibits discrepancy in contrast with those of the experiment for the fiv experiment at subcritical reynolds number the vortex structure in the wake of a rigid cylinder is three dimensional as the simulations were conducted in two dimensional resulting in part of the three dimensional vorticity

21777,flow induced vibrations fiv of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference is rather different and more complex comparing with vortex induced vibrations viv of an isolated cylinder in the uniform flow due to the wake interference mechanism involved in this study the forced vibration experiment is carried out on a rigid cylinder placed in tandem downstream of a stationary cylinder the hydrodynamic coefficients of the forced vibrating cylinder involving the steady drag coefficient c d the excitation coefficient c l v and the added mass coefficient c m y are obtained for the gap ratio g d 2 8 where g is the streamwise distance between the centers of two cylinders and d is the cylinder diameter compared with an isolated cylinder the mean drag coefficient is dramatically reduced and a much broader positive c l v that extends to higher amplitude and lower reduced frequency is observed the negative added mass coefficient presents for lower reduced frequency for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference a significant change in the distribution of hydrodynamic coefficients is found during the flow interference mode converting from the proximity interference into the full wake interference by means of discrete vortex method dvm simulations the free dynamic response of an elastically mounted cylinder placed in the wake of a stationary cylinder is numerically simulated comparison between the free and forced vibration of the downstream cylinder shows a good agreement between the superposed free vibration response plot and the contour line of zero c l v this result confirms the correlation between free and forced vibration for the cylinder fiv response with an upstream wake interference and further suggests that the forced vibration can be one approach to predicting the dynamic response and mapping the hydrodynamic properties of the fiv of multiple interfering cylinders keywords flow induced vibration forced vibration hydrodynamic coefficient wake interference 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a self induced and self limited oscillation of bluff bodies placed in flow viv can be a serious concern for operations and for the integrity and stability of structures and is of great importance to many fields of engineering therefore a great number of studies have been made to understand the characteristics and mechanisms of circular cylinders free to vibrate in the cross flow cf and or the in line il directions to the oncoming flow over the few five decades many of them have been reviewed in the comprehensive literatures of bearman 1984 sarpkaya 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 and triantafyllou et al 2016 the simplest form of the problem is an elastically mounted circular cylinder vibrating in the cf direction to the oncoming flow only feng 1968 experimentally measured the response for a cylinder with very high mass ratio the ratio between the structural mass and the displaced fluid mass from which two amplitude branches namely the initial and the lower branch were found over the reduced velocity khalak and williamson 1996 found the third amplitude branch of the cylinder between the other two branches namely the upper branch when the cylinder was of very low mass damping ratio apart from the dynamic response of cylinder govardhan and williamson 2000 firstly measured the vorticity field for free viv responses and confirmed that the initial branch corresponded to a 2s vortex mode and the upper and lower branches corresponded to a 2p vortex mode aside from the studies with free vibration of an elastically mounted structure one approach to an understanding and possible prediction of viv of an isolated cylinder has been to undertake forced vibrations of a cylinder in order to quantify the hydrodynamic forces on the cylinders undergoing viv the experiment of a rigid cylinder forced vibration in the cf direction only at prescribed frequencies and amplitudes has been conducted by sarpkaya 1977 1978 and gopalkrishnan 1992 later hover et al 1998 compared those hydrodynamic coefficients from forced vibrations with the free viv response data and found a good agreement between the superposed free viv response plot for zero damping and the contour of zero excitation coefficient from forced vibrations as shown in fig 1 in addition to the hydrodynamic forces of the cylinder the correspondence of vortex wake mode between forced and free vibration was also found williamson and roshko 1988 studied the vortex wake pattern for a cylinder controlled to translate in a sinusoidal trajectory over a wide variation of amplitudes and wavelengths they defined a whole set of different regimes for vortex wake modes and categorized them into three principle modes with the renormalization a good correspondence between the vortex shedding modes of free vibrations with the vortex mode regimes deduced from forced vibrations was observed carberry et al 2001 made an extensive flow visualization from forced vibrations of cylinder and showed that the force phase shift was related to the change in the mode of vortex formation yielding a direct agreement with the observations from free vibration in govardhan and williamson 2000 these studies accessed the correlation between forced and free vibration of viv for an isolated rigid cylinder however there are more configurations involving multiple cylinders in tandem side by side or staggered arrangement encountered in the engineering fields such as arrays of riser tubes used in offshore drilling and production platforms heat exchanger tubes closely spaced chimney stacks and overhead conductor cables when one cylinder is placed in the wake of one or several cylinders the hydrodynamic interference among the cylinder will result in different structural dynamic responses and fluid morphologies compared to those of an isolated cylinder as the simplest and representative multiple cylindrical configuration the two cylinders in tandem arrangement have become the canonical model in the investigation of fundamental physics involved in the flow past multiple cylindrical structures for the flow past two stationary cylinders zdravkovich 1987 1988 summarized the flow pattern as the trailing cylinder is arranged circumferentially around a leading cylinder and plotted a map categorizing the flow pattern into four interference regimes the proximity interference occurs for the side by side arrangement this regime is characterized by the interactions of the shear layers of vorticity with opposite direction the proximity wake interference occurs for the cylinders arranged in tandem with a small distance this regime is characterized by the reattachment of the shear layers of vorticity with the same direction the full wake interference occurs for the tandem separation of the cylinders beyond a critical distance in this regime the shear layers of the upstream cylinder fully roll up generating an alternate vortex shedding in the gap the upstream wake vortices impinge on the downstream cylinder and interact with the downstream vortex shedding and no interference for the two cylinders staggered with the separation beyond a critical value the flow responses of two cylinders are similar to those of an isolated cylinder in the uniform inflow in this regime in addition to the categorization by zdravkovich the alternative classifications of the flow pattern around two stationary cylinders can be found in sumner et al 2000 hu and zhou 2008 and zhou and alam 2016 these studies showed that the flow pattern of multiple cylinders become more complicated due to the existence of flow interference flow past the stationary cylinders forms complicated gap flow structures and wake vortex patterns due to wake to wake interference however if the cylinder placed in the wake of the upstream cylinder is allowed to oscillate in the cf direction the interference of wake to structure will occur and result in the cylinder responding in a way that is significantly different from the typical viv of the isolated cylinder such a phenomenon is named as the wake induced vibration wiv a fiv response that is characterized by a build up of the oscillation amplitude persisting to high reduced velocities bokaian and geoola 1984 investigated the effects of the structural mass ratio and the tandem separation between the cylinders on the response of the downstream cylinder they observed that the viv and wiv response of the downstream cylinder can be induced in different specific range of reduced velocities these two types of response can occur separately or overlap depending on the mass ratio and separation distance between two cylinders brika and laneville 1999 investigated the effect of tandem spacing on the wiv of the downstream cylinder they found that the downstream oscillation amplitude and synchronization region is reduced with the increase of tandem spacing until the response resembles that of a single cylinder the phenomenon that the wake interference effect on the downstream response persists to the tandem separation up to 25 diameters was observed assi et al 2010 revealed that the wiv response frequency is not locked to a specific value close to the structural natural frequency as the case of viv of a single cylinder but follows a slightly upward line such a characteristic frequency response persists to the tandem spacing reaching 20 diameters even though the downstream oscillation amplitude resembling that of the typical viv response in such a separation in addition the lift force on the downstream cylinder is dominated by two frequency branches a lower frequency corresponding to the oscillation frequency and a higher frequency associated with the upstream vortex shedding frequency with the understanding of the wiv mechanism zdravkovich 1977 pointed out that the upstream wake would induce a lift force that is acting to return the downstream cylinder to the wake centerline namely the wake displacement mechanism due to the downstream response resembling classical galloping response of the non circular bluff bodies bokaian and geoola 1984 referred to this response as wake induced galloping typical galloping of non circular bluff bodies described by den hartog 1956 is related to a fluid dynamic instability however a hydrodynamic restoring force acting on the downstream cylinder indicates a dynamic equilibrium of the cylinder rather than the phenomenon of instability and therefore the classical galloping theory of non circular bluff bodies is not suitable for the wiv mechanism hover and triantafyllou 2001 observed one single branch of the downstream response that builds up monotonically reaching amplitude of 1 9 diameters for reduced velocity around 17 they explained such a high amplitude branch as an upward extension of the frequency lock in branch that occurs for the viv response of a single cylinder however there was no evidence that the vortex shedding frequency of either cylinder is synchronized with the frequency of oscillation in another word the typical viv resonance cannot be simply extended to the explanation of the wiv response assi et al 2010 investigated the downstream response with the unsteady vortices removed from the wake of the upstream body and found that the wiv response would not be induced in such a situation they concluded that this galloping like response of the downstream cylinder was essentially a result of vortex induced mechanism a mechanism of unsteady vortex structure interactions between the upstream wake vortices and the downstream body in their subsequent study assi et al 2013 they introduced a concept of wake stiffness that was evaluated a quasi static lift map of two stationary cylinders the wake stiffness concept predicted the frequency response of wiv rather well however the wake stiffness cannot explain the excitation mechanism of wiv and failed to quantify the hydrodynamic properties of wiv song et al 2020 proposed an empirical predication model of wiv frequency based on a fitted strouhal frequency formula this model just considered two variables the reduced velocity and the gap spacing ratio but with some other essential parameters as reynolds number and structural mass ratio etc ignored up to now there is no such a model that can predict both the amplitude and frequency response as well as the hydrodynamic properties of wiv inspired by the fact that the viv response and hydrodynamic forces of an isolated cylinder can be quantified by the forced vibration one may raise a question whether forced vibration could be used for predicting the fiv response and mapping the hydrodynamic properties of a cylinder with an upstream wake interference to authors best knowledge no forced vibration experiments have been conducted on such a problem therefore we carried out such forced vibration experiment and the free vibration numerical simulation on the cylinder with an upstream wake interference in this study with an intention to answer the questions a whether the result of fluid forces acquired from the forced vibration experiment with the multiple cylinders could be used to predict the free vibration response of the multiple cylinders b if there is correlation between free and forced vibration what the hydrodynamic properties of the downstream cylinder would be in this study by mean of the forced vibration experiment we obtained the hydrodynamic coefficients involving the drag coefficient c d excitation coefficient c l v and added mass coefficient c m y of the vibrating downstream cylinder with different tandem spacing ratios to the upstream stationary cylinder ranging from 2 to 8 and we numerically simulated the free wiv response of an elastically mounted cylinder placed in the wake of a stationary cylinder by means of dvm simulations at last comparisons between forced and free vibration results were carried out this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the model and method of the experiment of forced vibrations and the numerical method of fiv simulations in section 3 the hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder are presented for the forced vibration in section 4 the dynamic response of the downstream cylinder is presented for the free fiv response in section 5 we make a comparison between the contours of excitation from forced vibration with free vibration response amplitudes and frequencies addressing the correlation between the free and forced vibrations of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference we summarize main findings and conclusions in section 6 in the appendix we present the validation of the current experimental and numerical result with a comparison to the previous studies 2 experimental and numerical method 2 1 experimental method and model the rigid cylinder forced vibration experiments are performed at mit sea grant intelligent towing tank itt lab itt has a towing length of 10m and a 1 m 1 m test cross section the main carriage is installed on two rails aligned with the tank length and is able to reach a constant velocity from 0 01 m s to 1 50 m s on the carriage a three degree of freedom stage is installed allowing combined trajectories of in line align with the towing direction cross flow perpendicular to the towing direction and rotation motions the software of the experimental facility is developed with integrated capability of the motion update and trajectory monitoring power pmac system force measurement ni daq usb6218 with an ati gamma 6 axis force sensor in the current experimental setup the two rigid cylinder models are mounted on the carriage piercing through the water the upstream cylinder is fixed at the non moving part of the carriage as a stationary rigid cylinder and the downstream cylinder is mounted at the linear stage allowing cf motion with prescribed amplitudes and frequencies the diameter of the two cylinders is d 3 81 cm 1 5 and in water length is l 45 72 cm 18 for downstream cylinder and l u 50 8 cm 20 for upstream cylinder the two rigid cylinder models are made from hard anodized aluminum tube in order to prevent corrosion as the cylinders stay in the water for a long time during the experiment process and the ati gamma force sensor is mounted on top of the downstream cylinder out of the water allowing itt to measure the forces applied on the cylinder during the experiment at 1000hz and at the same time itt recorded the cylinder prescribed motion simultaneously in order to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients a sketch of the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 in the cf only vibration experiment the cylinder is towed at a fixed velocity u 0 2 m s thus achieving r e u d v 7 620 where v is the fluid kinematic viscosity the cylinder s prescribed motion is therefore as follows 2 1 y t y 0 cos 2 π f s t where y 0 and f s are the cross flow oscillation amplitude and frequency respectively the lift force l t and drag force d t on the cylinder can be modeled as follows 2 2 l t l 0 cos 2 π f s t φ 0 d t d m d 0 cos 4 π f s t ϕ 0 where d m is the magnitude of the mean drag force l 0 and d 0 are the magnitudes of the oscillating lift and drag forces at frequencies f s and 2 f s respectively φ 0 is the phase difference measured between the cross flow motion and the oscillating lift force and ϕ 0 is the phase difference measured between the cross flow motion and the oscillating drag force the hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder i e mean drag coefficient c d lift coefficient in phase with velocity c l v and added mass coefficient in the cross flow

gap ratio g d from 2 0 to 8 0 as follows 2 3 c d c l v c m y c 0 a y d f r g d therefore from experiments we can measure the three hydrodynamic coefficients as follows 2 4 c d 2 d m ρ l d u 2 2 5 c l

definition of the reduced velocity u r and the true reduced velocity v r as follows 2 7 v r u f s d 2 8 u r u f 0 d where f s is the cylinder vibration frequency and f 0 is the natural frequency of the elastically mounted cylinder in the still water assuming the added mass coefficient to be 1 0 2 2 numerical method and model in the numerical simulation of the free fiv response of the downstream cylinder placed in tandem with a stationary upstream cylinder a lagrangian computational fluid dynamics cfd model of discrete vortex method dvm is adopted to solve the flow field of fiv numerically dvm is a meshless cfd method it discretizes the continuous vorticity filed of fluid into a number of discrete vortex elements with initial circulation the flow is simulated by tracing the motion of whole vortex elements in the lagrangian reference frame implementing the boundary conditions by the stream function dvm has good boundary adaptability in computation especially for the calculation of flow field involving several bodies or complex two dimensional shapes on the other hand solving the motion of thousands of vortex elements this method is highly efficient in the computation of flow at a relatively high reynolds number benefiting from these aspects dvm is used in the fiv simulations in this work for the flow of an incompressible and viscous newtonian fluid the equation that governs the fluid flow can be formulated by the continuity equations and the navier stokes ns equations 2 9 v 0 2 10 v t v v 1 ρ p v 2 v where v is the fluid velocity vector p is the fluid pressure field ρ is the fluid density and v is the fluid kinematic viscosity taking the curl of both sides of the continuity equations and the ns equations and considering that the fluid vorticity can be expressed by the curl of the velocity ω v the continuity equations can be rewritten as the vorticity stream function form and the ns equations can be rewritten as the vorticity transport equations 2 11 ω 2 ϕ 2 12 d ω d t v 2 ω ω v where ϕ is the stream function assuming the flow is two dimensional ω has only one nonzero component and ω v 0 can be eliminated from above equation with the operator splitting method employed equation 2 12 is divided into two parts the convection equation 2 13 and the diffusion equation 2 14 2 13 ω t v ω 0 2 14 ω t v 2 ω for dvm the essential idea is that the continuous fluid vorticity field is discretized into a series of vortex elements equation 2 13 indicates that the convection of fluid vorticity is according to v ω and the discretization of vorticity field generates the vortex particles having a constant strength equation 2 14 formulates the viscous diffusion of fluid vorticity it has the same form as the one dimensional heat conduction equation its fundamental solution is the green s function on the basis of brownian motion theory chorin 1973 introduced a random walk method to solve the vorticity diffusion the principle involved is to subject all of the free vortex elements to small random displacements which produces a scatter equivalent to the diffusion of vorticity in the continuum for the elastically mounted rigid cylinder considering structural damping and the external force imparted by the fluid flow the dynamics of the cylinders are formulated by equation 2 15 2 15 m 2 q t 2 c q t k q f where m is cylinder mass q is cylinder displacement c is structural damping k is structural spring stiffness and f is the lift force acting on the cylinder defining the mass ratio m damping ratio ς and reduced velocity u r as 2 16 m 4 m ρ π d 2 ς c 2 k m f 0 1 2 π k m u r u f 0 d where d is the diameter of the cylinder f n is the natural frequency of the cylinder and u is the incoming stream velocity introducing these parameters into equation 2 15 we obtain the dimensionless motion equation of the cylinders as 2 17 2 q t 2 4 π ς u r q t 4 π 2 u r 2 q 2 c l π m 0 where c l is the lift coefficient and q is now the dimensionless displacement of the cylinder equation 2 17 comprises 2 s order linear differential equations in the present simulations of fiv of the cylinders the fluid structure interaction is numerically implemented based on a loose coupling strategy the governing equations of fluid flow and the dynamics motion equations of the cylinders are explicitly solved separately the flow field is numerically solved based on the two dimensional discrete vortex method the hydrodynamic force obtained from the fluid field computation is passed into the motion calculations of the cylinders as the external load the dynamic responses of the cylinders are numerically calculated based on a fourth order runge kutta method the displacement and velocity of the cylinders are passed into the fluid computation as the updated boundary condition in lin et al 2020 the present fsi numerical solver has been validated for the fiv simulation of two interfering cylinders in this study the numerical fiv model is identical to that was used in lin et al 2020 therefore the computational parameters used in current simulations are also identical to those have been validated in lin et al 2020 the generation rate of the discrete vortex element is set to 256 per time step where 128 vortex elements are generated for each cylinder per time step the number of vortex elements in whole flow field is kept below 50000 the computational domain extends the distance of 40 cylinder diameters downstream of the downstream cylinder the vortex element beyond this region is eliminated from the computations the non dimensional time step nondimensionalized by the cylinder diameter and oncoming flow speed is set at 0 1 3 hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder for forced vibration in this section we present the hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder from the forced vibration experiment and characterize the hydrodynamic properties for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference in fig 3 we give three examples of the time series of the prescribed cylinder oscillation motion at f r 0 1 and a y d 0 55 a and the corresponding lift blue and drag red coefficient with three different gap ratios g d 2 b 4 c and 8 d the result shows that at the same prescribed motion due to the interference of an upstream cylinder the downstream cylinder experience different force patterns for example we observe that the lift coefficient of g d 4 has a larger magnitude than that of g d 2 and g d 8 it appears that only one dominant frequency component exists in the case of g d 4 while the g d 2 case displays that multiple frequency components coexist in the lift coefficient time series we performed fast fourier transform fft analysis on the downstream cylinder lift coefficient at a fixed a y d 0 55 over different gap ratios from g d 2 to 8 for three different reduced frequencies the result is plotted in fig 4 for f r 0 08 a f r 0 18 b and f r 0 28 c in all three cases we observe that the dominant frequency peak of the lift forced corresponds to the imposed forced vibration reduced frequency as marked with the blue dashed line however coming to the case of f r 0 08 one can observe that in addition to the frequency peak corresponding to forced vibration reduced frequency the blue dash line there is another frequency peak connected by the black dash line increasing with the gap ratio and approaching the reduced frequency of f r 0 2 the red dash line this distinctive frequency branch is expected to be associated with the wake interference mechanism assi et al 2010 observed that the downstream lift force exhibited single frequency for the reduced velocity lower than 6 corresponding to the reduced frequency larger than 0 167 with the reduced velocity increasing over 6 corresponding to the reduced frequency smaller than 0 167 the lift force of downstream cylinder was dominated by two frequencies one frequency branch identical to the upstream vortex shedding frequency and another frequency branch corresponding to the oscillation frequency of downstream cylinder therefore a second frequency peak is identified in the fft plot for the f r 0 08 in addition such a phenomenon also suggests that at least for the low f r vibration not only the hydrodynamic characteristics of the downstream cylinder is affected by the upstream cylinder the downstream cylinder in turn affects the upstream cylinder hydrodynamics when the gap ratio is small the occurrence of the proximity wake interference will reduce the upstream wake frequency resulting in the second reduced frequency component lower than 0 2 with the increase of gap ratio the proximity wake interference effect decreases resulting in the upstream wake frequency as well as the second reduced frequency branch similar to a single static cylinder wake frequency of f r 0 2 fig 5 presents the contour plot of the drag coefficient for the forced vibrating cylinder as a function of f r and a y d for various gap ratios for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference the drag coefficient is smaller compared to that of the isolated cylinder in fig 5 a the minimum c d of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference is drastically reduced to 0 5 for the gap ratio g d 2 at small amplitudes when the gap ratio increases the minimum c d gradually rises to that of isolated cylinder as 1 25 the result of the negative c d of the downstream cylinder at small gap ratios has also been reported by the previous studies with two cylinders in tandem arrangement bokaian and geoola 1984 such a phenomenon is related to the pressure decrease at stagnation point of the downstream cylinder when the two cylinders are very close to each other when the gap ratio is small the downstream cylinder is inside the free shear layer of the upstream cylinder and subjects to the low pressure region in the wake of the upstream cylinder especially for the small amplitude vibration when the downstream cylinder vibrates with large amplitude the downstream motion would exceed the upstream wake region and be immersed within the uniform oncoming flow in the meantime we find that the c d distribution over f r and a y d for different gap ratios are similar c d increases with the increase of f r and a y d the lift coefficient in phase with the velocity c l v is used to quantify the average fluid structure energy transfer the positive c l v represents the average positive energy transfer from the fluid to the structure over one vibration period and when the c l v is negative the surrounding fluid takes energy out of the structural vibration fig 6 presents the contour of c l v for the downstream cylinder as a function of f r and a y d for various gap ratios for the single cylinder the positive c l v is mainly distributed in two regions the primary region is located at f r 0 12 0 18 and a y d 0 0 85 and the second smaller region corresponds to f r 0 23 0 27 and a y d 0 0 25 unlike the c d when there is an upstream cylinder the c l v of the downstream cylinder is found to be significantly different from that of the isolated cylinder to begin with the positive c l v is found to obtain a much wider region of f r for all gap ratios tested in the current experiment compared to the single cylinder case for the gap ratio in the range of 2 5 the main region of positive c l v extends to the lower f r and higher a y d with the gap ratio increasing from 3 to 8 the main region of positive c l v shrinks to the lower a y d and gradually resembles the pattern of the single cylinder the variation trend of the distribution of positive c l v is consistent with the variation of the fiv response amplitude of the elastically mounted cylinder with an upstream wake interference as the gap ratio increases assi et al 2010 it also can be noted that there is a substantial change of the distribution of positive c l v for the gap ratio varying from 2 5 to 3 for the gap ratio below 3 the distribution of positive c l v can be divided into two areas one area located in f r 0 15 0 25 and a y d 0 0 8 and the second area located in f r 0 15 0 25 and a y d 0 6 however the positive c l v is mainly distributed in a whole area for the gap ratio beyond 3 such a change of the positive c l v distribution for the gap ratio changing from 2 5 to 3 is expected to be associated with the transition of flow interference from the proximity interference where a reattachment of the shear layers occurs and the gap flow is characterized by the presence of unstable shear layers to the full wake interference where the shear layers of each cylinders fully roll up and the gap flow is characterized by the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder in a potential flow the added mass coefficient of a cylinder takes the value of 1 0 when viv happens the effective added mass coefficient c m y of the oscillating cylinder can vary significantly with the amplitude and frequency of the cylinder from 0 6 to 3 as a result of the alternation in the relative motion between the shedding vortex and structural motion such a large variation of the effective added mass results in a large range of the potential true natural frequency especially for the low mass ratio systems which leads to the lock in over a large range of the reduced velocity on the basis of the definition given by triantafyllou et al 2016 the crossflow added mass coefficient is evaluated from the lift coefficient in phase with the cylinder acceleration fig 7 presents the contour of the c m y for the downstream cylinder as a function of f r and a y d for various gap ratios in the case of the single cylinder the c m y shows a strong dependence on f r and varies observably with a y d when f r is large at f r 0 15 the c m y decreases from a large positive value to a negative value when f r reduces in the cases of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference the distribution of c m y roughly resembles the pattern of the single cylinder the negative c m y is present for the lower f r and at a certain f r the c m y switches to positive however there is a significant difference of the critical value of f r when the value of the c m y changes sign for different gap ratios for the gap ratio g d 2 the critical line of c m y is located at f r 0 1 for the gap ratios in the range of 3 5 the critical line is generally located at f r 0 08 with the gap ratio increasing from 5 to 8 the f r corresponding to the critical line increases from 0 08 to 0 12 towards the value in the single cylinder case one may also note that the variation of c m y is more complex for the gap ratio g d 2 and 2 5 compared with those for the larger gap ratios for the small a y d in the cases of gap ratio g d 2 and 2 5 the critical line depends both on f r and a y d while the critical line depends highly on f r only for the cases of g d 3 the difference between the distribution of c m y for the gap ratio below and above 3 is also expected to be related to the transition of flow interference from the proximity interference to the full wake interference in addition for the single cylinder case carberry et al 2005 found that the variation of the c m y is directly associated with the variation in the timing of vortex formation relative to the cylinder motion as well as a change in the mode of vortex shedding from a cylinder undergoing controlled oscillations it is expected that the variation of the c m y of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference may be also accompanied with a switch in the wake vortices mode which requires further investigation via flow visualization another difference that should be noted is the minimum value of c m y in the case of the single cylinder the minimum value of c m y reaches a value of about 0 5 however for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference the minimum of the c m y can be lower than 1 0 4 dynamic response of the downstream cylinder for free vibration in this section we discuss the free fiv response of an elastically mounted cylinder placed within the wake of an upstream stationary cylinder assi et al 2010 presented the dynamic response amplitude and frequency of the downstream cylinder positioned at various distances from 4 to 20 diameters from the fixed upstream cylinder the free fiv response was measured at various reynolds numbers ranging from 2500 to 30000 in their experiments however the forced vibration experiment of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference is carried out at a fixed reynolds number of 7620 to make a correspondence with the forced vibration we numerically simulated the fiv response of a cylinder placed within the wake of a stationary cylinder at a fixed reynolds number according to that in the forced vibration by mean of dvm simulation the numerical model is constructed by reference to the experimental model of assi et al 2010 in the simulation the two cylinders are of equal diameter and the reynolds number is fixed at 7500 the mass ratio with respect to the displaced fluid mass and the damping ratio of the downstream system are set equal to 2 6 and 0 respectively the reduced velocity of the downstream cylinder is changed from 3 to 14 respectively four representative gap ratios g d 2 4 5 and 6 are considered in the present simulations figs 8 and 9 presents the fiv response amplitude and displacement frequency ratio of the downstream cylinder respectively the present simulation results are also plotted against the results of assi et al 2010 with the interference of the upstream wake the downstream fiv response persists to high reduced velocities which are beyond the resonance range of a typical single cylinder viv response for reduced velocities below 5 the fiv response amplitude of the downstream cylinder builds up with the increase of reduced velocity the fiv frequency closely following the line of st 0 2 indicates that the synchronization between the cylinder motion and the vortex shedding is responsible for the downstream response at reduced velocities below 5 assi et al 2010 referred to this region as a viv resonance response for reduced velocities beyond 5 the wiv response that is related to the wake interference mechanism emerges the response frequency increases with the reduced velocity following a slightly declined line but is not locked to a value close to the natural frequency as a typical viv response a combined viv and wiv response is established in this range the response amplitude curves also suggest that the amplitude of the downstream fiv response decreases as the cylinders are positioned further apart due to fluid viscosity the upstream wake vortices dissipate with the flow when being convected downstream which weakens the wake interference effect on the downstream cylinder on the other hand a discrepancy can be noted in the amplitude response between the present simulation and assi s experiment in present simulation the reduced velocity is changed by varying the natural frequency and reynolds number is kept constant while in the experiment reduced velocity is varied by changing the oncoming flow speed which also leads to different reynolds numbers at different reduced velocities assi et al 2013 concluded that wiv is a reynolds number dependent type of fiv response the reynolds number difference between two studies causes the discrepancy in wiv as well as the fiv response figs 10 12 present five consecutive instantaneous flow pattern plots in one period of the downstream vibration for u f 0 d 5 for three representative gap ratios in sub figures f we plot the time trace of the downstream cylinder cf motion with the red circles suggesting the time of five flow pattern plots in the flow pattern sub figures simulated by dvm the red and blue points represent the positive and negative vortex elements respectively based on the distribution of vortex elements the clockwise and counterclockwise vortices are identified by the gathering of the vortex elements in blue and red respectively fig 10 a e showing the instantaneous flow patterns for g d 2 display a flow pattern as follow as the downstream cylinder moves upwards the blue shear layers of the upstream cylinder reattaches on the downstream body and merge with the blue shear layers of the downstream cylinder the red shear layers of the upstream cylinder generate a recirculation in the gap as the downstream cylinder moves downwards the reattachment of the red shear layers and the blue recirculation in the gap arises fig 10 g provides the power spectral density of the lift force acting on two cylinders the lift force of two cylinders has the same dominant frequency such a result is due to the occurrence of the reattachment of shear layers and combined wake vortex shedding of two cylinders these results confirm the occurrence of proximity wake interference for g d 2 moving to the instantaneous flow patterns shown in fig 11 a e for g d 3 a different flow pattern exhibits compared to the mode for g d 2 as follow as the downstream reaches the maximum displacement at the downward side the upstream blue shear layers roll up and separate from the upstream cylinder forming a vortex in the wake a when the downstream cylinder moves upwards the blue vortex in the upstream wake merges with the shear layers of downstream cylinder b as the downstream cylinder reaches the maximum position at the upward side a red vortex sheds from the upstream cylinder c then this red vortex splits into two sub vortex due to the downward movement of the downstream cylinder d these plots suggest that the gap flow is characterized by an upstream vortex shedding for the case of g d 3 in addition one may also note that the upstream vortex exhibits different behaviors in the processes of the downstream cylinder moving upward and downward this phenomenon can be explained by fig 11 g where the power spectral density of the lift force acting on two cylinders is shown the lift force frequency of the stationary upstream cylinder is close to the value of strouhal number at subcritical reynolds number the lift force of the downstream cylinder has two frequency peaks a frequency equal to the frequency of the upstream lift force and another frequency that is related to the oscillation frequency also the vortex shedding frequency of the downstream cylinder the difference between the frequencies of the upstream wake and downstream motion results in a varying phase lag between the upstream vortex shedding and the downstream motion as well as the unsteady vortex structure interaction pattern the different frequencies between the lift force of two cylinders and separate vortex shedding indicate the occurrence of full wake interference the similar phenomenon is also found for the gap ratio g d 4 recalling the change in hydrodynamic coefficients for the forced vibration during the gap ratio increasing from 2 5 to 3 it is expected that the transition in the flow interference regime results in the change in hydrodynamic coefficients 5 comparison between free and forced vibration of the downstream cylinder from an energy balance point of view for a stable free vibration of an elastically mounted cylinder placed within an external flow the average fluid structure energy transfer must be balanced for a dynamic equilibrium when the structural damping is negligible c l v should be equal to zero such an assumption has been displayed qualitatively valid by hover et al 1998 for an isolated cylinder in the uniform flow shown in fig 1 this observation confirmed the correlation between the free and forced vibrations of a single cylinder and also demonstrated that the forced vibration can be used for mapping the hydrodynamic properties of viv of a single cylinder in sec 3 the hydrodynamic forces of a cylinder with an upstream wake interference are obtained by the forced vibration experiment in sec 4 the fiv dynamic response of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder in the wake of an upstream stationary cylinder is obtained by numerical simulations in this section in a similar way as used in hover et al 1998 we plot in fig 11 the simulated response amplitude on the contour plots of c l v for forced vibrations at given true reduced velocities shown in equation 2 7 the vibration frequency is used the experimental fiv response points of assi et al 2010 are also referred to and plotted together on the contours in fig 13 the contour plot of c l v for forced vibrations with an overlay of the present simulated and the experimental free vibration results is presented for four cases of gap ratio g d 2 4 5 and 6 the asterisks and circles denote the simulated fiv response points and the experimental fiv response points respectively the red line highlights the contour line of c l v 0 in fig 13 a remarkable agreement can be observed between the free fiv response data path and the zero c l v line of forced vibrations in the case of g d 2 due to the proximity of two cylinders a reattachment of the shear layers occurs the flow around two cylinders behaves as around a single bluff body resulting in the fiv response characterized by the classical galloping of non circular bluff bodies the fiv amplitude a y d increases as the reduced frequency f r deceases the line of c l v 0 generally follows this trend as shown in fig 13 a regarding the cases of g d 3 the flow interference turns into the full wake interference regime the fiv response is sustained by the vortex shedding mechanism in the initial amplitude build up stage the oscillation frequency f s is equal to the vortex shedding frequency and varies with oncoming flow speed u linearly resulting in the reduced frequency f r defined by f s d u roughly constant the contour lines experience a nearly vertical shape at this stage consistent with the path of free vibration points in the subsequent stage the fiv response is dominated by the wake interference mechanism the fiv oscillation turns into a wiv response the oscillation amplitude continues to increase with the oncoming flow speed but the oscillation frequency varies little the fiv response points roughly follows an oblique line towards high amplitude and low reduced frequency also tracing the zero c l v line for forced vibrations in particular although assi et al 2010 measured the wiv response at various reynolds numbers and the present hydrodynamic coefficient is obtained at a fixed reynolds number the free response data of assi et al closely trace the zero c l v line of forced vibrations this suggests the availability of present c l v contour plot for forced vibrations in predicting the free vibration within a similar reynolds number range the good agreement between free and forced vibration results confirms the correlation between free and forced vibrations for the multiple interfering cylinders fiv and suggests that forced vibration can be used for mapping the hydrodynamic properties of the fiv response of a cylinder with an upstream wake interference beyond these similarities one may also note that there is discrepancy between the superposed free vibration response plot and the contour of zero c l v especially in the case of g d 6 there are two possible causes for this discrepancy on the one hand for the free fiv response the cylinder oscillation is an irregular sinusoidal motion including beating motion when the fiv response turns into wiv not only is the average amplitude building up but also the deviation from the average amplitude is increasing with reduced velocity however in the forced vibration the cylinder undergoes strictly sinusoidal motion on the other hand as pointed by hover et al 1998 the force signals have much better correlation in the forced oscillation tests than in the free vibration responses 6 conclusion for the wiv response of an elastically mounted cylinder placed within the wake of a stationary upstream cylinder the most plausible modelling and prediction of it seems to be the wake stiffness concept proposed by assi et al 2013 up to now even though this model just predict the frequency response with the amplitude response not included to authors best knowledge this is the first kind of such a study that verified the forced vibration being a strong candidate to accurately predict the amplitude and frequency responses of wiv also understand the hydrodynamic properties of the fiv response of multiple interfering cylinders furthermore the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained in this work have implications for practical applications especially for the semi empirical modelling efforts to predict the fiv response of multiple cylindrical structures in this study forced vibration experiments are conducted on the cylinder with an upstream wake interference the hydrodynamic coefficients of the cylinder involving the mean drag coefficients c d excitation coefficients c l v and added mass coefficients c m y are obtained over a wide variation of oscillation amplitudes a y d 0 05 1 35 and reduced frequencies f r 0 05 0 35 for various gap ratios g d 2 8 by overlying the simulated wiv response and experimental results of assi et al 2010 on the contour plot of c l v from forced vibrations a remarkable agreement is observed between the superposed free vibration response plot and the contour of zero excitation such a result confirms the correlation between free and forced vibrations and suggests that the dynamic responses of wiv can be predicted by the forced vibration in addition to the prediction of the amplitude and frequency responses of wiv the hydrodynamic properties of the fiv response with an upstream wake interference have also been understood by the forced vibration experiment for mean drag coefficient c d in the case of the cylinder with an upstream wake interference due to the downstream cylinder immersed in the wake of the upstream cylinder the drag coefficient is observed to be dramatically reduced compared with that of a single cylinder especially for the downstream cylinder oscillating with a small amplitude in a close distance for excitation coefficient c l v compared with the distribution of c l v for an isolated cylinder a significantly wider region of positive c l v is observed for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference as it extends to the lower f r and higher a y d with the increase of gap ratio the main region of positive c l v shrinks to lower a y d and gradually resembles the pattern of the single cylinder for added mass coefficient c m y compared with a single cylinder the critical line between positive and negative c m y corresponds to the lower f r which indicates that the cylinder response is more likely to have a negative added mass coefficient for high reduced velocity in the case of the single cylinder the minimum c m y reaches a value of 0 5 however for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference the variation of c m y is particularly striking since it can be as low as 1 0 the more significant variation of added mass coefficient indicates that the cylinder experiences more significant vortex structure interactions with an upstream wake interference for the cylinder with an upstream wake interference a significant change is observed for the distribution of all hydrodynamic coefficients during the gap ratio varying from 2 to 3 for small gap ratio the hydrodynamic coefficients experience more complicated variations the fiv wake pattern by numerical simulation suggests that the significant change of the hydrodynamic coefficients of the downstream cylinder results from the transition of flow interference regime from the proximity interference to the full wake interference the hydrodynamic coefficient database of the forced vibration experiment in this paper can be downloaded from the link of https github com

of a single cylinder forced vibrating in the cf direction with a prescribed sinusoidal motion at re 7620 similar experiment has also been performed by gopalkrishnan 1992 and hover et al 1998 at mit tow tank lab the acquired hydrodynamic coefficients of gopalkrishnan 1992 not only helped to shed some light on the complex behavior of the rigid cylinder viv but also it formed a hydrodynamic database and was used widely in various semi empirical code for marine riser dynamic prediction shear 7 viva vivana the result of gopalkrishnan s experiment at r e 10 000 and our experiment at r e 7

reynolds number show strong similarities between each other as follows 1 c d is found to increase with an increase of f r and a y d when f r 0 17 while c d does not strongly depend on f r when f r 0 17 and thus only increases with the increase of a y d 2 c l v has two positive regions in the experimental space contour line of c l v 0 is highlighted with bold red line the second positive region

lift force frequency of the upstream cylinder c and the downstream cylinder d between the results of simulation and experiment of assi et al 2010 the experimental data show that the fiv response of the downstream cylinder resembles the initial branch of typical viv response for reduced velocity below 5 then turns into the wiv response which is characterized by a build up of oscillation amplitude persisting to high reduced velocity our numerical simulations yield results in very good quantitative agreement with the experiment and captures all qualitative trends of the wiv response as observed in previous experimental study meanwhile it can be noted that the numerical oscillation amplitude exhibits discrepancy in contrast with those of the experiment for the fiv experiment at subcritical reynolds number the vortex structure in the wake of a rigid cylinder is three dimensional as the simulations were conducted in two dimensional resulting in part of the three dimensional vorticity

21778,shipping water the flow washing over and impacting the upper decks of ships and offshore structures occurs frequently during their service life and often causes structural problems for engineers to design safe floating structures subjected to shipping water it is essential to gain an in depth understanding of its depth and flow field and the resulting impact forces in this work computational fluid dynamics cfd is applied to understand the physics of shipping water washing over a stepped platform we find that the most accurate solutions are obtained with the k ε turbulence closure the hydrodynamic load generated by the shipping water is found to strongly depends on the kinematic energy of the water hitting the step it is shown that with smaller values of the freeboard a more dynamic flow ensues with a stronger vortex and larger velocity gradient resulting in deeper shipping water and a larger impact force keywords green water floating structures dam break impact force cfd openfoam 1 introduction shipping water also known as green water is the water flow washing the upper deck of ships and offshore structures which can exert large forces responsible for 10 of sea loads see hirdaris et al 2014 and result in motions dillingham 1981 greco et al 2015 deformations buchner 1995 and the loss of transverse stability as the centre of gravity can be shifted upwards ersdal and kvitrud 2000 these problems have a complicated nature and can be caused by different mechanisms e g waves and hurricanes o dea et al 1992 mori and cox 2003 faltinsen et al 2005 in the last decades intensive efforts have been devoted to modelling this problem using various physical analytical and numerical models it is essential to understand the impact loads their physics and the kinematic of the flow washing the body amongst other issues to provide safer operating conditions for ships or offshore structures 2005foneseca and soares faltinsen et al 2004 shipping water occurs when water overtops the freeboard of the floating object faltinsen et al 2002 and is induced by any perturbation typically water waves longuett higgins and cokelet 1976 cox and scott 2001 the wave then collapses and runs on the upper surface of the floating object dolatshah et al 2018 which can be either a ship or an offshore structure depending on the nature of the source the mechanism of formation the impact forces acting on the deck can be different i e the water column collapsing can have different values of kinematic and potential energy which may lead to different impact forces ariyarathne et al 2012 one of the most common types of shipping water is via plunging waves i e the wave crest exceeds the freeboard and then runs across the deck eventually adopting a shallow water pattern greco et al 2005 in this case it is expected that the kinematic energy is the highest contributor to the external forces such phenomenon is probable when the freeboard of the floating object is small so that gentle waves can propagate on the deck it has been found that a very steep wave breaking in the vicinity of the deck can lead to an energetic plunging pattern which then washes the upper surface of the deck greco and colicchio 2007 the plunging pattern that appears after the breaking can run acroskhojasts the water surface following a highly nonlinear pattern and then wash the surface of the deck resulting in large forces chan and melville 1988 cuomo et al 2010 a combination of kinematic energy and potential energy contributes to the generation of an impact force this pattern is seen to occur when the water column exceeds the deck height buchner 2002 such a mechanism is more probable when motions of the vessel or floating object are large ogawa et al 2002 a dam break behaviour has also been described as another type of shipping water for which analytical solutions exist as will be explained later the modelling of the shipping problem can be performed using mathematical methods greco et al 2004 with certain assumptions including the neglection of the viscosity and vorticity one of the most common methods implemented to simulate the waters running on the upper surface of a floating object is to use the dam breaking solution schonberg and rainey 2002 ryu et al 2007 the dam break problem can be solved analytically e g yilmaz et al 2013 and hence the details of the flow field chuang et al 2015 or the loads greco et al 2001 can be obtained these theoretical solutions are helpful in the early understanding of the physics of the problem stansby et al 1998 yilmaz et al 2003 however many aspects of the problem are disregarded such as energy dissipation wave breaking motion coupling etc to overcome these limitations a shallow wave numerical modelling approach has been used huang and hsiung 1996 greco and lungi 2012a b skene et al 2018 in this approach single phase flow is assumed i e no air flow is considered implying that breaking processes cannot be modelled for this reason the energy of the shipping water is likely to be overpredicted hernández fontes et al 2019b and so are the loads if breaking of running water occurs as an alternative computational fluid dynamics cfd can be used to simulate the washing of shipping water over any floating object stern et al 2001 this method has shown significant potential in modelling sea loads izadi et al 2018a dynamic responses zhou et al 2019 esfandiari et al 2019 resistance tezdongan et al 2015 kim et al 2017 demirel et al 2017 khojasteh and kamali 2017 ghadimi et al 2019 huang et al 2019b 2020 nazmand bilandi et al 2020 dashtimanesh et al 2020 and wave energy bayoumi et al 2015 khojasteh and kamali 2016 khojasteh et al 2018a khojasteh et al 2018b lopez et al 2014 masida et al 2019 in the last three decades and its application has become ever more common in recent years larsson et al 2013 different computational methods including finite volume method fvm and smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph can adequately simulate two phase flow stern et al 2006 among these methods sph has been found to accurately model the free water surface while it can under predict the pressure of the fluid field landrini et al 2012 dashtimanesh and ghadimi 2013 ghadimi et al 2012 the fvm which uses different numerical techniques has been shown to effectively predict both sea loads and water surfaces ghadimi et al 2013 cfd methods can be successfully applied to capture different properties of the fluid including shear stresses energy flux and mass flux khojasteh et al 2017 javanmardi et al 2018 while they can also be coupled with solid mechanic solvers izadi et al 2018b huang and thomas 2019 huang et al 2019a with recent advances in high performance computing cfd methods have taken a valuable position in the early stage deign of ships and offshore structures xie et al 2019 in recent years cfd studies have been undertaken to model the green water running on the upper surface of ships offshore structures with good accuracy nielsen and mayer 2004 silva et al 2017 amaro jr et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 chen et al 2019 gatin et al 2018a 2019 however there is still an opportunity for cfd studies of shipping water since the behaviour of the flow including the velocity field and the energy flux is not fully understood one of the most important aspects of the shipping water relates to the energy of the water and its relationship with force and other physical aspect of the problem such phenomenon can be studied through modelling of isolated waves that can be generated using the dam breaking near step in the recent years experiments have been performed reporting on the behaviour of the fluid field when water caused by dam breaking is transported across the upper surface of the deck in the current paper cfd simulations are used to improve the understanding of the physics of the dam break water washing on a stepped platform first the accuracy of the cfd method is shown to be fit for purpose i e it is shown that it can compute the fluid field accurately then detailed results are presented to deepen the understanding of the fundamental physics velocity field velocity gradient energy flux impact force and how they are linked to each other of shipping water caused by a dam break in all this study seeks to compute the energy of the fluid the forces acting on the stepped platform and the velocity profile of the fluid in different conditions the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the numerical model is discussed by explaining the problem case study governing equations and the cfd set up in section 3 the obtained results are provided initially focusing on the optimal grid size for the problem simulation a validation study is performed and the cfd data are compared against the experimental data finally the changes in flow field are discussed in detail in section 4 the concluding remarks and potential future research are presented 2 numerical model 2 1 problem statement the breaking of a dam is simulated in the current problem to numerically replicate the experimental work performed by hernández et al 2018 and hernández fontes et al 2018 and further elucidate the underlying physics a 0 195 m long step with a height of h s is located in the right end of a tank a virtual gate located at a longitudinal location of l g with respect to the left end of the tank is assumed to be in the tank and keeps the water column in a steady condition this gate is suddenly removed triggering a dam break which can then run onto the stepped platform such phenomenon resembles the shipping water on the deck of a fixed floating structure subjected to solitary waves and helps to understand the behaviour of green water in absence of reflection effects the tank is three dimensional and is b t wide the depth of the water located in the left side of the gate is shown by h d dam height and the water depth on the right side is denoted with h w water height a sketch of the tank is shown in fig 1 the freeboard of the step is computed as 1 h f b h s h w 2 2 governing equations the fluid is assumed to be viscous and two phases are considered water and air the relationship between viscosity and shear stresses in a newtonian fluid governs the flow both phases behave as an incompressible fluid the fluid field is denoted by u u x i u y j u z k the navier stokes equations hold in the entire domain 2 u 0 3 t ρ e u ρ e u u t p μ e μ t u u t ρ e f b where the subscript e refers to the effective value of the parameter ρ and μ refer to the density and viscosity of the fluid respectively p is the pressure and f b g k is the body force note that μ t refers to the turbulence viscosity and is found using the k ε model the effective values of density and viscosity are computed by means of a volume fraction parameter which is set to vary between 0 and 1 hirt and nichols 1981 whenever the parameter takes a value of 0 it denotes the pure air whereas value of 1 denotes the pure water using the value of α equations 4 and 5 are used to find effective values of density and viscosity respectively 4 ρ e α ρ w 1 α ρ a 5 μ e α μ w 1 α μ a the parameter α obeys a conservation law itself which can be formulated as 6 t α α u u r α 1 α 0 where u r is the surface compression velocity 2 3 numerical set up the problem is numerically solved using a cfd code based on fvm the numerical set up and simulations are performed using the openfoam library which has shown promising ability to model free surface flows e g in higuara et al 2013 2014a b gatin et al 2018b to perform the simulations the tank is numerically generated using the blockmeshdict the schematic of the tank is shown in fig 2 the walls of the tank both right and left sides satisfy a no slip condition this means that both the zero gradient speed and pressure conditions are governed there the same condition is also set on the walls of the step the upper patch of the domain is set to behave as an area from which fluid can leave the domain the velocity in the whole domain is initially set to zero the value of the volume fraction is set to 1 at the left and right side of the virtual gate for the rest of the domain α is set to 0 the cells in the domain are produced using a structured grid with a rectangular cube shape the cells have a smaller size near the step and at the free water surface with larger mesh sizes with distance from the domain of interest the numerical mesh is shown in fig 2 all diffusion terms are discretised using a second order central scheme and the convection terms are turned into algebra equations using a linear approximation the unsteady terms are discretised in the time domain by means of a euler scheme the simulations are performed for more than a second after the dam break occurs like the experiments the time step is set to be adjusted automatically by forcing the courant number to be less than 0 5 the navier stokes equations are solved using the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm and the interfoam solver jasak 2009 vukcevic et al 2018 2 4 computation of different parameters the water surface elevation at any point is found using a virtual probe to serve this purpose the openfoam library is used to sample all data at different plans the values of α u and p are extracted at all time steps all data are sampled at a frequency of 50 hz the instantaneous elevation of the free surface is computed as 7 η x z z f o r z s z u α x z d y note that z u refers to the vertical position of the upper boundary of the domain z f and z s denote the vertical position of the lower boundary tank floor and the step respectively the vorticity is calculated by 8 ω x y z 1 2 u x y z the force acting on the step is calculated by integrating the pressure and stresses on the surface of the step as follows 9 f s p n σ n d s where σ denotes the stresses and n is the unit normal vector the energy flux related to kinetic energy and potential energy passing through the water column whitham 1962 is measured as 10 e z f o f z s z u 1 2 u 2 g z ρ w α u n d z 2 5 case studies seven cases were modelled numerically table 1 corresponding to the laboratory tests conducted by hernández fontes et al 2018 2019a in each case different values of h d and h w are used note that the ratios of h d h w are set to be 0 4 and 0 6 during the tests which satisfy the bore generation condition during the dam breaking nakagawa et al 1969 the details of the numerical tests are given in table 2 technical information related to the experiments is reported in hernández fontes et al 2017 the length of the tank varies because two different tanks were used by hernández fontes et al 2018 2019a 3 results and discussion 3 1 grid convergence study a grid study was performed to determine the optimal numerical mesh resolution for the simulations to this end different grids including coarse medium fine and finest are used the coarse grid mesh contains cells with a dimension of 5 5 5 mm3 around the step and the finest grid contains cells with dimension of 0 5 0 5 0 5 mm3 in the proximity of the step details of different grids tested are presented in table 3 simulations are performed for all cases using different mesh resolutions throughout the mesh study it has been found that the results including water surface elevation time energy flux forces acting on the step and the vorticity field converged for the fine mesh resolution the mesh study results are summarised in fig 3 the maximum values for the water surface elevation and maximum depth of the shipping water are indicated in fig 3 this simulated depth versus the modelled depth was shown to converge for a mesh size of 1 1 1 mm3 also the vorticity field around the step is found to converge for a mesh size of 1 1 1 mm3 fine mesh the results found using the fine and finest mesh are similar note that the water surface elevation is computed at a point with a non dimensional longitudinal distance of 0 0130l s l s is the length of step from the front edge of step the computed vorticity fields around the body were also found demonstrating that the vorticity fields using the fine and finest mesh are in good agreement as illustrated in fig 4 however the vorticity fields computed using the medium and coarse mesh resolution are different for the case of coarse and medium grids the water surface is not smooth and larger energy dissipation occurs near the free surface the red colour therefore the fine mesh is used for all the simulation cases in the present study 3 2 experimental data versus cfd data here the obtained cfd data are compared against the experimental measurements of hernández fontes et al 2018 2019a to check the accuracy of the numerical platform both the laminar and the turbulent simulations are employed to evaluate the accuracy of both methods three groups of comparisons are performed at the first step the water surface elevation in the left side of the step not on the step is computed and its value is compared against laboratory measurements of hernández fontes et al 2018 subsequently the water surface elevation on the stepped platform is found and quantitively compared against experiments of hernández fontes et al 2019a and hernández fontes et al 2018 in the last step the computed impact force is qualitatively compared against measurements of hernández fontes et al 2019a 2019b 3 2 1 water surface level in the front field left side of the step water surface elevations at two different locations in the front field the field at which the dam breaking occurs are computed two virtual probes are assumed and the water height is found using equation 7 these probes were located at the centreline of the tank at longitudinal positions of 0 15 and 0 45 m with respect to the left wall of the tank simulations were performed for case 2 see table 1 the values of the free surface elevation at these two points have been reported by hernández fontes et al 2018 the time histories of water surface elevation at x 0 15 m left panel and x 0 45 m right panel are shown in fig 5 two different numerical simulations laminar and turbulent flows are used the water surface elevation is observed to decrease on the left side of the gate as expected since it is breaking and then slightly increase again left panel both cfd models are found to follow the experimental results but the laminar simulation is observed to marginally over predict the water level there is also a hallow between t 1 to t 1 2 s in the plot which was not detected by the laminar simulation this behaviour of the water surface on the left side of the dam is observed by different researchers e g kleefsman et al 2005 the water surface increases and reaches a peak value on the right side of the gate note that the dam break phenomenon occurs and water is running toward the right side of the gate zech and soares frazao 2007 as the water level reaches a peak its value decreases and then it starts to increase around t 1 s i e a slight harmonic behaviour which is being dampened further the water surface tends to reach an equilibrium hui et al 2017 the turbulent simulation presents more accurate results as the real nature of the flow turbulence is captured na et al 2016 the laminar simulation results in larger water surface and the peak is predicted to occur sooner as found by taha et al 2018 this difference occurs as the turbulent behaviour is neglected and less energy dissipation is predicted 3 2 2 water surface level on the step computed water depth on the stepped platform were compared against experimental data water height at four different points with longitudinal locations of x l s 0 0388 0 0898 0 1408 and 0 1918 are reported below with laminar and turbulent simulations performed for all cases the results corresponding to case 1 are shown in fig 6 the water surface elevation is seen to reach a peak value and then decrease and converge to zero the further the location from the wave break results in a smaller peak value note that this peak value is experimentally observed when waves wash the deck of a floating object greco et al 2012b in the current research the shipping wave is generated using a dam break flow approach and hence only one peak is evident both cfd simulations predict the time history of water surface elevation as per the experimental data but the turbulent simulation is found to be more accurate especially for the points near the edge of the step the laminar simulations lead to over prediction of the water surface elevation due to the smaller amount of energy dissipation computed under the laminar assumptions gush et al 2007 computed values of water surface elevation corresponding to case 3 and tank 2 are presented in fig 7 experimental and numerical simulations are plotted cfd results are more accurate for the turbulent simulation as seen in fig 6 the tail of the water surface elevation vs time plot is seen to fluctuate when the laminar flow simulation is used the water surface again is higher especially at the tail when turbulence behaviour of the fluid is neglected the results corresponding to case 5 and tank 2 are also illustrated in fig 8 note that water reaches a higher peak in this case as compared to the two previous cases and corresponding freeboard is lower cfd data is shown to agree well with the experimental data i e numerically computed water surface is rising at the time the experimentally measured water surfaces rise the time at which the peaks of water surface elevation occurs are found to be similar laminar simulations may over predict the water surface level as was reported in figs 6 and 7 the cfd results are also compared against the measurements performed in tank 1 the maximum value of the water level the wave crest at a distance of 0 0130l s from the edge of the step is found and compared against experiments note that hernández fontes et al 2018 reported the peak height of shipping water only for this point therefore the quantitative comparisons are only performed for water depth at 0 0130l s table 3 shows the experimental and numerical results as found using both laminar shown by the l and turbulent subscript t models the computed values using the turbulent simulations are closer to the experimental data errors between numerical and experimental results are computed as per 11 e h p e x p h p n u m h p e x p 100 where exp and num refer to experimental and numerical values respectively errors are found to vary between 1 5 and 5 7 percent for the case of turbulent simulations but they range between 8 3 and 11 1 percent for the case of laminar simulations 3 2 3 impact force acting on the step the impact force vertical force acting on the step is computed for different cases in tank 2 note that the impact force was previously measured and reported by hernández fontes et al 2019b an area with width of 334 mm 0 852l and length of 195 mm 0 4794l is considered to calculate the external forces as per hernández fontes et al 2019b time histories of the vertical force for three cases are presented the vertical force is seen to increase and reach a maximum value for all cases and then converge to zero the largest impact force occurs for case 5 where the step has the lowest freeboard cfd results are shown to follow the experimental data for all cases however the turbulent simulations have less error compared to the laminar simulations the force is seen to be over predicted when simulations are performed for the case of a laminar fluid over predictions are most significant at the peak and tail of the plots overall the results show that current cfd model predicts the impact force accurately if turbulent flow is applied 3 3 an overview of the flow washing the step an example of the water washing over the step is depicted in fig 10 this corresponds to case 3 with different snapshots over time at a 0 05s interval the vorticity computed by equation 8 is also shown before the water reaches the step a plunging wave caused by the dam break moves towards the step on which positive or negative vorticities occur due to energy dissipation as observed by de padova et al 2019 as the water reaches the step the vorticities of the front edge of the bore become less significant while considerable vorticities can be found further back as the water impacts the step a cavity occurs as the bores move forward on the step large vortices occur and energy dissipation becomes more significant skene et al 2018 at the early stage of impact the force acts on a very small area but then the water column collapses and the force acts on the whole surface of the step while the air cavity becomes smaller zhou et al 1991 examples of the vorticities found for case 5 are also shown in fig 10 with similar behaviour observed at different time steps as the bore moves toward the step a small amount of vorticity exits on the front bore as it reaches the step an air cavity is generated that directs the water flow forward water impacts a very small area at the beginning and then the area becomes larger while the vortices become significant near the surface of the step see fig 11 3 4 physical understanding in order to investigate the different physical mechanisms from each case the numerical data is used to examine the behaviour of the energy mass flux pressure and cavity area at an early stage the energy fluxes of different cases have been calculated at the front edge of the step samples of the time history of the energy flux are shown in fig 12 comparison between the energy fluxes of cases 1 and 3 in tank 2 are shown in the right panel the energy fluxes are seen to increase at the early stage of shipping and then reach a peak following this peak the flux of energy decreases and reaches negative values meaning that energy is moving toward the tank again mean velocity of the water flow is negative case 1 has seen to be less energetic compared to case 3 note that the step freeboard of the case 3 is lower compared to case 1 the smaller freeboard leads to more energetic flow on the surface of the step resulting in a larger impact force see fig 9 and free surface elevation see figs 6 and 7 the right panel of fig 12 shows the comparison between energy fluxes at the edge of the step caused by case 1 in tanks 1 and 2 similar behaviour to what was observed in the left panel is noted energy fluxes reach a peak and then decrease reaching negative values the dam break occurring in the tank 1 is seen to lead to a more pronounced energy peak note that when water is running in the tank 1 it travels a shorter distance to reach the step thus it is more energetic its kinematic energy is expected to be larger this increased amount of energy is expected to lead to larger pressures and impact forces as will be discussed later the time histories of the hydrodynamic pressure caused by the shipping water are evaluated the hydrodynamic pressure is sampled at a point located at x 0 005 m from the step for different cases and examples of the computations are shown in fig 13 the pressure increases sharply as the water reaches the surface in line with previous research on wave impacts on structures jalalisendi et al 2018 tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2019 after the sudden rise in hydrodynamic pressure the pressure drops drastically tending to zero the pressures caused by the dam break of cases 1 and 3 in tank 2 are displayed in the left panel of fig 13 case 3 results in a larger impact pressure which was expected given as the shipping flow of case 3 is more energetic left panel of fig 12 the impact pressure from case 1 in the two tanks of 1 and 2 is shown in the right panel of fig 13 when dam break occurs in tank 1 the peak pressure occurs earlier and its value is more remarkable this larger pressure occurs since water flow is more energetic in tank 1 as seen in the right panel of fig 12 the profile of horizontal velocity u at the front edge of the step is illustrated in fig 14 results corresponding to four different time steps are highlighted in this figure note that t refers to the difference between the current time and the time at which water has reached the step the horizontal velocity is seen to be negative near the step at the early stage of shipping the velocity then increases and becomes positive t 0 05 s with time the gradient of the velocity becomes more significant i e the magnitude of the negative values become larger compared to the previous time step as reported by yan et al 2018 also the speed value near the free surface the height vertical position becomes larger t 0 1 s later the gradient of the horizontal velocity become less while the horizontal velocity is still negative near the step t 0 15 s then the velocity decreases strongly see skene et al 2018 and negative values disappear t 0 2 s such a behaviour agrees with previous observations fig 12 where it was seen that the energy flux reaches a peak value which corresponds with large velocity observed at t 0 1 s and then highly decreases which corresponds with large velocity observed at t 0 2 s the velocity profiles of different conditions are also compared in the upper panel velocity profiles of cases 1 and 3 are compared dam break occurs in tank 2 case 3 has larger velocity gradient in comparison to case 1 at the early stage of the shipping which means that when the freeboard becomes smaller the flow is more turbulent i e magnitude of negative and positive values of velocity profile become larger at the early stage t 0 05 s and t 0 1 s however the velocity of case 1 becomes larger later the lower panel of fig 14 shows comparisons between velocity profiles of case 1 when the dam break happens in tanks 1 and 2 the velocity profile is observed to have larger gradient when the flow is running in tank 1 in which water travels less till it reaches the step at the early stage of the washing however the velocity gradient of the shipping water occurring in tank 2 becomes larger fig 15 shows the flow velocity direction and magnitude for case 5 in tank 1 at three times the velocity magnitude is seen to be large near the edge of the step at the early stage fig 15 left panel the yellow arrow is pointing to the large value of the speed the flow on the left side of the step is oriented upwards at the next stage fig 15 middle panel the water depth on the step has increased and the edge of the bore signalled by the black arrow in the figure propagates at the highest speed the vertical flow on the left side of the step presents a considerably lower speed compared to the front edge of the bore a vortex appears on the step near its front edge green arrow finally when the water has flowed over the entire step and reached the end wall of the tank fig 15 right panel it is driven upwards by the wall and large flow velocities occur compared to the previous stage the flow velocity at the edge of the step is lower there are three vortices now one at the end of the step at the angle with the wall the previous one which moved to the right and a new one that appeared near the front edge the two latter are indicated by green arrows in the figure the velocity of the flow field on the left side of the step is lower than in the previous stages the summary of the results for the dam break simulations in tank 1 with h d h w 0 6 is illustrated in fig 16 the results presented in this figure include the peak value of water surface elevation at a point with longitudinal position of 0 0130ls maximum value of the energy flux peak pressure and mean value of the horizontal velocity at an arbitrary point the value of the mean velocity corresponds to 0 02 s after water reaches the front edge the results presented show that the peak energy flux and the pressure increase as the freeboard decreases such a dependence higher slope at smaller freeboard is not observed for the surface elevation and velocity note that the velocity increases linearly with a decrease in freeboard as reported by song et al 2015 the proportion of the kinematic energy has been computed for different cases fig 17 the contribution of the kinematic energy of the fluid increases as the freeboard decreases in line with the observations of fig 16 4 conclusions shipping water washing the upper surface of a fixed object was numerically modelled to improve our understanding of the physics of the flow the velocity field the vorticity velocity profile and energy flux as it impacts the deck and runs forward numerical results were compared against the experimental data and it was found that the turbulent simulations provide more accurate results of the shipping water phenomenon when the laminar flow was considered the free surface elevation and the impact force were over predicted both in the tank and over the step it was shown that the maximum water height of the shipping flow washing the step increases as the freeboard decreases which was associated with the energy flux the energy flux of the water at the front edge of the step was observed to increase with a decrease in the freeboard moreover the energy flux was found to be highly dependent on the mean velocity of the flow field as it reaches the edge of the step for the cases with a small freeboard the mean velocity was shown to be larger overall it was shown that the role of kinematic energy in total energy flux becomes more significant as the freeboard becomes smaller the energy flux of the tested cases in which the flow caused by the dam break travels further to reach the step was found to be smaller leading to smaller impact force and water height it was also observed that the energy flux of the solitary shipping water propagating over the step approaches negative values after a while implying that water is driven back to the tank the sampled velocity vectors showed that the horizontal velocity of the shipping water can become negative near the step the extent of which is more significant for the cases with smaller freeboard in such circumstances a large velocity gradient occurs and a moving forward vortex appears a further vortex which is weaker compared to the previous one was seen to emerge following the previous vortex these conclusions can help ocean engineers to ensure safer conditions for the floating objects in real sea conditions ships and floating structures are subjected to ocean waves

21778,shipping water the flow washing over and impacting the upper decks of ships and offshore structures occurs frequently during their service life and often causes structural problems for engineers to design safe floating structures subjected to shipping water it is essential to gain an in depth understanding of its depth and flow field and the resulting impact forces in this work computational fluid dynamics cfd is applied to understand the physics of shipping water washing over a stepped platform we find that the most accurate solutions are obtained with the k ε turbulence closure the hydrodynamic load generated by the shipping water is found to strongly depends on the kinematic energy of the water hitting the step it is shown that with smaller values of the freeboard a more dynamic flow ensues with a stronger vortex and larger velocity gradient resulting in deeper shipping water and a larger impact force keywords green water floating structures dam break impact force cfd openfoam 1 introduction shipping water also known as green water is the water flow washing the upper deck of ships and offshore structures which can exert large forces responsible for 10 of sea loads see hirdaris et al 2014 and result in motions dillingham 1981 greco et al 2015 deformations buchner 1995 and the loss of transverse stability as the centre of gravity can be shifted upwards ersdal and kvitrud 2000 these problems have a complicated nature and can be caused by different mechanisms e g waves and hurricanes o dea et al 1992 mori and cox 2003 faltinsen et al 2005 in the last decades intensive efforts have been devoted to modelling this problem using various physical analytical and numerical models it is essential to understand the impact loads their physics and the kinematic of the flow washing the body amongst other issues to provide safer operating conditions for ships or offshore structures 2005foneseca and soares faltinsen et al 2004 shipping water occurs when water overtops the freeboard of the floating object faltinsen et al 2002 and is induced by any perturbation typically water waves longuett higgins and cokelet 1976 cox and scott 2001 the wave then collapses and runs on the upper surface of the floating object dolatshah et al 2018 which can be either a ship or an offshore structure depending on the nature of the source the mechanism of formation the impact forces acting on the deck can be different i e the water column collapsing can have different values of kinematic and potential energy which may lead to different impact forces ariyarathne et al 2012 one of the most common types of shipping water is via plunging waves i e the wave crest exceeds the freeboard and then runs across the deck eventually adopting a shallow water pattern greco et al 2005 in this case it is expected that the kinematic energy is the highest contributor to the external forces such phenomenon is probable when the freeboard of the floating object is small so that gentle waves can propagate on the deck it has been found that a very steep wave breaking in the vicinity of the deck can lead to an energetic plunging pattern which then washes the upper surface of the deck greco and colicchio 2007 the plunging pattern that appears after the breaking can run acroskhojasts the water surface following a highly nonlinear pattern and then wash the surface of the deck resulting in large forces chan and melville 1988 cuomo et al 2010 a combination of kinematic energy and potential energy contributes to the generation of an impact force this pattern is seen to occur when the water column exceeds the deck height buchner 2002 such a mechanism is more probable when motions of the vessel or floating object are large ogawa et al 2002 a dam break behaviour has also been described as another type of shipping water for which analytical solutions exist as will be explained later the modelling of the shipping problem can be performed using mathematical methods greco et al 2004 with certain assumptions including the neglection of the viscosity and vorticity one of the most common methods implemented to simulate the waters running on the upper surface of a floating object is to use the dam breaking solution schonberg and rainey 2002 ryu et al 2007 the dam break problem can be solved analytically e g yilmaz et al 2013 and hence the details of the flow field chuang et al 2015 or the loads greco et al 2001 can be obtained these theoretical solutions are helpful in the early understanding of the physics of the problem stansby et al 1998 yilmaz et al 2003 however many aspects of the problem are disregarded such as energy dissipation wave breaking motion coupling etc to overcome these limitations a shallow wave numerical modelling approach has been used huang and hsiung 1996 greco and lungi 2012a b skene et al 2018 in this approach single phase flow is assumed i e no air flow is considered implying that breaking processes cannot be modelled for this reason the energy of the shipping water is likely to be overpredicted hernández fontes et al 2019b and so are the loads if breaking of running water occurs as an alternative computational fluid dynamics cfd can be used to simulate the washing of shipping water over any floating object stern et al 2001 this method has shown significant potential in modelling sea loads izadi et al 2018a dynamic responses zhou et al 2019 esfandiari et al 2019 resistance tezdongan et al 2015 kim et al 2017 demirel et al 2017 khojasteh and kamali 2017 ghadimi et al 2019 huang et al 2019b 2020 nazmand bilandi et al 2020 dashtimanesh et al 2020 and wave energy bayoumi et al 2015 khojasteh and kamali 2016 khojasteh et al 2018a khojasteh et al 2018b lopez et al 2014 masida et al 2019 in the last three decades and its application has become ever more common in recent years larsson et al 2013 different computational methods including finite volume method fvm and smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph can adequately simulate two phase flow stern et al 2006 among these methods sph has been found to accurately model the free water surface while it can under predict the pressure of the fluid field landrini et al 2012 dashtimanesh and ghadimi 2013 ghadimi et al 2012 the fvm which uses different numerical techniques has been shown to effectively predict both sea loads and water surfaces ghadimi et al 2013 cfd methods can be successfully applied to capture different properties of the fluid including shear stresses energy flux and mass flux khojasteh et al 2017 javanmardi et al 2018 while they can also be coupled with solid mechanic solvers izadi et al 2018b huang and thomas 2019 huang et al 2019a with recent advances in high performance computing cfd methods have taken a valuable position in the early stage deign of ships and offshore structures xie et al 2019 in recent years cfd studies have been undertaken to model the green water running on the upper surface of ships offshore structures with good accuracy nielsen and mayer 2004 silva et al 2017 amaro jr et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 chen et al 2019 gatin et al 2018a 2019 however there is still an opportunity for cfd studies of shipping water since the behaviour of the flow including the velocity field and the energy flux is not fully understood one of the most important aspects of the shipping water relates to the energy of the water and its relationship with force and other physical aspect of the problem such phenomenon can be studied through modelling of isolated waves that can be generated using the dam breaking near step in the recent years experiments have been performed reporting on the behaviour of the fluid field when water caused by dam breaking is transported across the upper surface of the deck in the current paper cfd simulations are used to improve the understanding of the physics of the dam break water washing on a stepped platform first the accuracy of the cfd method is shown to be fit for purpose i e it is shown that it can compute the fluid field accurately then detailed results are presented to deepen the understanding of the fundamental physics velocity field velocity gradient energy flux impact force and how they are linked to each other of shipping water caused by a dam break in all this study seeks to compute the energy of the fluid the forces acting on the stepped platform and the velocity profile of the fluid in different conditions the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the numerical model is discussed by explaining the problem case study governing equations and the cfd set up in section 3 the obtained results are provided initially focusing on the optimal grid size for the problem simulation a validation study is performed and the cfd data are compared against the experimental data finally the changes in flow field are discussed in detail in section 4 the concluding remarks and potential future research are presented 2 numerical model 2 1 problem statement the breaking of a dam is simulated in the current problem to numerically replicate the experimental work performed by hernández et al 2018 and hernández fontes et al 2018 and further elucidate the underlying physics a 0 195 m long step with a height of h s is located in the right end of a tank a virtual gate located at a longitudinal location of l g with respect to the left end of the tank is assumed to be in the tank and keeps the water column in a steady condition this gate is suddenly removed triggering a dam break which can then run onto the stepped platform such phenomenon resembles the shipping water on the deck of a fixed floating structure subjected to solitary waves and helps to understand the behaviour of green water in absence of reflection effects the tank is three dimensional and is b t wide the depth of the water located in the left side of the gate is shown by h d dam height and the water depth on the right side is denoted with h w water height a sketch of the tank is shown in fig 1 the freeboard of the step is computed as 1 h f b h s h w 2 2 governing equations the fluid is assumed to be viscous and two phases are considered water and air the relationship between viscosity and shear stresses in a newtonian fluid governs the flow both phases behave as an incompressible fluid the fluid field is denoted by u u x i u y j u z k the navier stokes equations hold in the entire domain 2 u 0 3 t ρ e u ρ e u u t p μ e μ t u u t ρ e f b where the subscript e refers to the effective value of the parameter ρ and μ refer to the density and viscosity of the fluid respectively p is the pressure and f b g k is the body force note that μ t refers to the turbulence viscosity and is found using the k ε model the effective values of density and viscosity are computed by means of a volume fraction parameter which is set to vary between 0 and 1 hirt and nichols 1981 whenever the parameter takes a value of 0 it denotes the pure air whereas value of 1 denotes the pure water using the value of α equations 4 and 5 are used to find effective values of density and viscosity respectively 4 ρ e α ρ w 1 α ρ a 5 μ e α μ w 1 α μ a the parameter α obeys a conservation law itself which can be formulated as 6 t α α u u r α 1 α 0 where u r is the surface compression velocity 2 3 numerical set up the problem is numerically solved using a cfd code based on fvm the numerical set up and simulations are performed using the openfoam library which has shown promising ability to model free surface flows e g in higuara et al 2013 2014a b gatin et al 2018b to perform the simulations the tank is numerically generated using the blockmeshdict the schematic of the tank is shown in fig 2 the walls of the tank both right and left sides satisfy a no slip condition this means that both the zero gradient speed and pressure conditions are governed there the same condition is also set on the walls of the step the upper patch of the domain is set to behave as an area from which fluid can leave the domain the velocity in the whole domain is initially set to zero the value of the volume fraction is set to 1 at the left and right side of the virtual gate for the rest of the domain α is set to 0 the cells in the domain are produced using a structured grid with a rectangular cube shape the cells have a smaller size near the step and at the free water surface with larger mesh sizes with distance from the domain of interest the numerical mesh is shown in fig 2 all diffusion terms are discretised using a second order central scheme and the convection terms are turned into algebra equations using a linear approximation the unsteady terms are discretised in the time domain by means of a euler scheme the simulations are performed for more than a second after the dam break occurs like the experiments the time step is set to be adjusted automatically by forcing the courant number to be less than 0 5 the navier stokes equations are solved using the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm and the interfoam solver jasak 2009 vukcevic et al 2018 2 4 computation of different parameters the water surface elevation at any point is found using a virtual probe to serve this purpose the openfoam library is used to sample all data at different plans the values of α u and p are extracted at all time steps all data are sampled at a frequency of 50 hz the instantaneous elevation of the free surface is computed as 7 η x z z f o r z s z u α x z d y note that z u refers to the vertical position of the upper boundary of the domain z f and z s denote the vertical position of the lower boundary tank floor and the step respectively the vorticity is calculated by 8 ω x y z 1 2 u x y z the force acting on the step is calculated by integrating the pressure and stresses on the surface of the step as follows 9 f s p n σ n d s where σ denotes the stresses and n is the unit normal vector the energy flux related to kinetic energy and potential energy passing through the water column whitham 1962 is measured as 10 e z f o f z s z u 1 2 u 2 g z ρ w α u n d z 2 5 case studies seven cases were modelled numerically table 1 corresponding to the laboratory tests conducted by hernández fontes et al 2018 2019a in each case different values of h d and h w are used note that the ratios of h d h w are set to be 0 4 and 0 6 during the tests which satisfy the bore generation condition during the dam breaking nakagawa et al 1969 the details of the numerical tests are given in table 2 technical information related to the experiments is reported in hernández fontes et al 2017 the length of the tank varies because two different tanks were used by hernández fontes et al 2018 2019a 3 results and discussion 3 1 grid convergence study a grid study was performed to determine the optimal numerical mesh resolution for the simulations to this end different grids including coarse medium fine and finest are used the coarse grid mesh contains cells with a dimension of 5 5 5 mm3 around the step and the finest grid contains cells with dimension of 0 5 0 5 0 5 mm3 in the proximity of the step details of different grids tested are presented in table 3 simulations are performed for all cases using different mesh resolutions throughout the mesh study it has been found that the results including water surface elevation time energy flux forces acting on the step and the vorticity field converged for the fine mesh resolution the mesh study results are summarised in fig 3 the maximum values for the water surface elevation and maximum depth of the shipping water are indicated in fig 3 this simulated depth versus the modelled depth was shown to converge for a mesh size of 1 1 1 mm3 also the vorticity field around the step is found to converge for a mesh size of 1 1 1 mm3 fine mesh the results found using the fine and finest mesh are similar note that the water surface elevation is computed at a point with a non dimensional longitudinal distance of 0 0130l s l s is the length of step from the front edge of step the computed vorticity fields around the body were also found demonstrating that the vorticity fields using the fine and finest mesh are in good agreement as illustrated in fig 4 however the vorticity fields computed using the medium and coarse mesh resolution are different for the case of coarse and medium grids the water surface is not smooth and larger energy dissipation occurs near the free surface the red colour therefore the fine mesh is used for all the simulation cases in the present study 3 2 experimental data versus cfd data here the obtained cfd data are compared against the experimental measurements of hernández fontes et al 2018 2019a to check the accuracy of the numerical platform both the laminar and the turbulent simulations are employed to evaluate the accuracy of both methods three groups of comparisons are performed at the first step the water surface elevation in the left side of the step not on the step is computed and its value is compared against laboratory measurements of hernández fontes et al 2018 subsequently the water surface elevation on the stepped platform is found and quantitively compared against experiments of hernández fontes et al 2019a and hernández fontes et al 2018 in the last step the computed impact force is qualitatively compared against measurements of hernández fontes et al 2019a 2019b 3 2 1 water surface level in the front field left side of the step water surface elevations at two different locations in the front field the field at which the dam breaking occurs are computed two virtual probes are assumed and the water height is found using equation 7 these probes were located at the centreline of the tank at longitudinal positions of 0 15 and 0 45 m with respect to the left wall of the tank simulations were performed for case 2 see table 1 the values of the free surface elevation at these two points have been reported by hernández fontes et al 2018 the time histories of water surface elevation at x 0 15 m left panel and x 0 45 m right panel are shown in fig 5 two different numerical simulations laminar and turbulent flows are used the water surface elevation is observed to decrease on the left side of the gate as expected since it is breaking and then slightly increase again left panel both cfd models are found to follow the experimental results but the laminar simulation is observed to marginally over predict the water level there is also a hallow between t 1 to t 1 2 s in the plot which was not detected by the laminar simulation this behaviour of the water surface on the left side of the dam is observed by different researchers e g kleefsman et al 2005 the water surface increases and reaches a peak value on the right side of the gate note that the dam break phenomenon occurs and water is running toward the right side of the gate zech and soares frazao 2007 as the water level reaches a peak its value decreases and then it starts to increase around t 1 s i e a slight harmonic behaviour which is being dampened further the water surface tends to reach an equilibrium hui et al 2017 the turbulent simulation presents more accurate results as the real nature of the flow turbulence is captured na et al 2016 the laminar simulation results in larger water surface and the peak is predicted to occur sooner as found by taha et al 2018 this difference occurs as the turbulent behaviour is neglected and less energy dissipation is predicted 3 2 2 water surface level on the step computed water depth on the stepped platform were compared against experimental data water height at four different points with longitudinal locations of x l s 0 0388 0 0898 0 1408 and 0 1918 are reported below with laminar and turbulent simulations performed for all cases the results corresponding to case 1 are shown in fig 6 the water surface elevation is seen to reach a peak value and then decrease and converge to zero the further the location from the wave break results in a smaller peak value note that this peak value is experimentally observed when waves wash the deck of a floating object greco et al 2012b in the current research the shipping wave is generated using a dam break flow approach and hence only one peak is evident both cfd simulations predict the time history of water surface elevation as per the experimental data but the turbulent simulation is found to be more accurate especially for the points near the edge of the step the laminar simulations lead to over prediction of the water surface elevation due to the smaller amount of energy dissipation computed under the laminar assumptions gush et al 2007 computed values of water surface elevation corresponding to case 3 and tank 2 are presented in fig 7 experimental and numerical simulations are plotted cfd results are more accurate for the turbulent simulation as seen in fig 6 the tail of the water surface elevation vs time plot is seen to fluctuate when the laminar flow simulation is used the water surface again is higher especially at the tail when turbulence behaviour of the fluid is neglected the results corresponding to case 5 and tank 2 are also illustrated in fig 8 note that water reaches a higher peak in this case as compared to the two previous cases and corresponding freeboard is lower cfd data is shown to agree well with the experimental data i e numerically computed water surface is rising at the time the experimentally measured water surfaces rise the time at which the peaks of water surface elevation occurs are found to be similar laminar simulations may over predict the water surface level as was reported in figs 6 and 7 the cfd results are also compared against the measurements performed in tank 1 the maximum value of the water level the wave crest at a distance of 0 0130l s from the edge of the step is found and compared against experiments note that hernández fontes et al 2018 reported the peak height of shipping water only for this point therefore the quantitative comparisons are only performed for water depth at 0 0130l s table 3 shows the experimental and numerical results as found using both laminar shown by the l and turbulent subscript t models the computed values using the turbulent simulations are closer to the experimental data errors between numerical and experimental results are computed as per 11 e h p e x p h p n u m h p e x p 100 where exp and num refer to experimental and numerical values respectively errors are found to vary between 1 5 and 5 7 percent for the case of turbulent simulations but they range between 8 3 and 11 1 percent for the case of laminar simulations 3 2 3 impact force acting on the step the impact force vertical force acting on the step is computed for different cases in tank 2 note that the impact force was previously measured and reported by hernández fontes et al 2019b an area with width of 334 mm 0 852l and length of 195 mm 0 4794l is considered to calculate the external forces as per hernández fontes et al 2019b time histories of the vertical force for three cases are presented the vertical force is seen to increase and reach a maximum value for all cases and then converge to zero the largest impact force occurs for case 5 where the step has the lowest freeboard cfd results are shown to follow the experimental data for all cases however the turbulent simulations have less error compared to the laminar simulations the force is seen to be over predicted when simulations are performed for the case of a laminar fluid over predictions are most significant at the peak and tail of the plots overall the results show that current cfd model predicts the impact force accurately if turbulent flow is applied 3 3 an overview of the flow washing the step an example of the water washing over the step is depicted in fig 10 this corresponds to case 3 with different snapshots over time at a 0 05s interval the vorticity computed by equation 8 is also shown before the water reaches the step a plunging wave caused by the dam break moves towards the step on which positive or negative vorticities occur due to energy dissipation as observed by de padova et al 2019 as the water reaches the step the vorticities of the front edge of the bore become less significant while considerable vorticities can be found further back as the water impacts the step a cavity occurs as the bores move forward on the step large vortices occur and energy dissipation becomes more significant skene et al 2018 at the early stage of impact the force acts on a very small area but then the water column collapses and the force acts on the whole surface of the step while the air cavity becomes smaller zhou et al 1991 examples of the vorticities found for case 5 are also shown in fig 10 with similar behaviour observed at different time steps as the bore moves toward the step a small amount of vorticity exits on the front bore as it reaches the step an air cavity is generated that directs the water flow forward water impacts a very small area at the beginning and then the area becomes larger while the vortices become significant near the surface of the step see fig 11 3 4 physical understanding in order to investigate the different physical mechanisms from each case the numerical data is used to examine the behaviour of the energy mass flux pressure and cavity area at an early stage the energy fluxes of different cases have been calculated at the front edge of the step samples of the time history of the energy flux are shown in fig 12 comparison between the energy fluxes of cases 1 and 3 in tank 2 are shown in the right panel the energy fluxes are seen to increase at the early stage of shipping and then reach a peak following this peak the flux of energy decreases and reaches negative values meaning that energy is moving toward the tank again mean velocity of the water flow is negative case 1 has seen to be less energetic compared to case 3 note that the step freeboard of the case 3 is lower compared to case 1 the smaller freeboard leads to more energetic flow on the surface of the step resulting in a larger impact force see fig 9 and free surface elevation see figs 6 and 7 the right panel of fig 12 shows the comparison between energy fluxes at the edge of the step caused by case 1 in tanks 1 and 2 similar behaviour to what was observed in the left panel is noted energy fluxes reach a peak and then decrease reaching negative values the dam break occurring in the tank 1 is seen to lead to a more pronounced energy peak note that when water is running in the tank 1 it travels a shorter distance to reach the step thus it is more energetic its kinematic energy is expected to be larger this increased amount of energy is expected to lead to larger pressures and impact forces as will be discussed later the time histories of the hydrodynamic pressure caused by the shipping water are evaluated the hydrodynamic pressure is sampled at a point located at x 0 005 m from the step for different cases and examples of the computations are shown in fig 13 the pressure increases sharply as the water reaches the surface in line with previous research on wave impacts on structures jalalisendi et al 2018 tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2019 after the sudden rise in hydrodynamic pressure the pressure drops drastically tending to zero the pressures caused by the dam break of cases 1 and 3 in tank 2 are displayed in the left panel of fig 13 case 3 results in a larger impact pressure which was expected given as the shipping flow of case 3 is more energetic left panel of fig 12 the impact pressure from case 1 in the two tanks of 1 and 2 is shown in the right panel of fig 13 when dam break occurs in tank 1 the peak pressure occurs earlier and its value is more remarkable this larger pressure occurs since water flow is more energetic in tank 1 as seen in the right panel of fig 12 the profile of horizontal velocity u at the front edge of the step is illustrated in fig 14 results corresponding to four different time steps are highlighted in this figure note that t refers to the difference between the current time and the time at which water has reached the step the horizontal velocity is seen to be negative near the step at the early stage of shipping the velocity then increases and becomes positive t 0 05 s with time the gradient of the velocity becomes more significant i e the magnitude of the negative values become larger compared to the previous time step as reported by yan et al 2018 also the speed value near the free surface the height vertical position becomes larger t 0 1 s later the gradient of the horizontal velocity become less while the horizontal velocity is still negative near the step t 0 15 s then the velocity decreases strongly see skene et al 2018 and negative values disappear t 0 2 s such a behaviour agrees with previous observations fig 12 where it was seen that the energy flux reaches a peak value which corresponds with large velocity observed at t 0 1 s and then highly decreases which corresponds with large velocity observed at t 0 2 s the velocity profiles of different conditions are also compared in the upper panel velocity profiles of cases 1 and 3 are compared dam break occurs in tank 2 case 3 has larger velocity gradient in comparison to case 1 at the early stage of the shipping which means that when the freeboard becomes smaller the flow is more turbulent i e magnitude of negative and positive values of velocity profile become larger at the early stage t 0 05 s and t 0 1 s however the velocity of case 1 becomes larger later the lower panel of fig 14 shows comparisons between velocity profiles of case 1 when the dam break happens in tanks 1 and 2 the velocity profile is observed to have larger gradient when the flow is running in tank 1 in which water travels less till it reaches the step at the early stage of the washing however the velocity gradient of the shipping water occurring in tank 2 becomes larger fig 15 shows the flow velocity direction and magnitude for case 5 in tank 1 at three times the velocity magnitude is seen to be large near the edge of the step at the early stage fig 15 left panel the yellow arrow is pointing to the large value of the speed the flow on the left side of the step is oriented upwards at the next stage fig 15 middle panel the water depth on the step has increased and the edge of the bore signalled by the black arrow in the figure propagates at the highest speed the vertical flow on the left side of the step presents a considerably lower speed compared to the front edge of the bore a vortex appears on the step near its front edge green arrow finally when the water has flowed over the entire step and reached the end wall of the tank fig 15 right panel it is driven upwards by the wall and large flow velocities occur compared to the previous stage the flow velocity at the edge of the step is lower there are three vortices now one at the end of the step at the angle with the wall the previous one which moved to the right and a new one that appeared near the front edge the two latter are indicated by green arrows in the figure the velocity of the flow field on the left side of the step is lower than in the previous stages the summary of the results for the dam break simulations in tank 1 with h d h w 0 6 is illustrated in fig 16 the results presented in this figure include the peak value of water surface elevation at a point with longitudinal position of 0 0130ls maximum value of the energy flux peak pressure and mean value of the horizontal velocity at an arbitrary point the value of the mean velocity corresponds to 0 02 s after water reaches the front edge the results presented show that the peak energy flux and the pressure increase as the freeboard decreases such a dependence higher slope at smaller freeboard is not observed for the surface elevation and velocity note that the velocity increases linearly with a decrease in freeboard as reported by song et al 2015 the proportion of the kinematic energy has been computed for different cases fig 17 the contribution of the kinematic energy of the fluid increases as the freeboard decreases in line with the observations of fig 16 4 conclusions shipping water washing the upper surface of a fixed object was numerically modelled to improve our understanding of the physics of the flow the velocity field the vorticity velocity profile and energy flux as it impacts the deck and runs forward numerical results were compared against the experimental data and it was found that the turbulent simulations provide more accurate results of the shipping water phenomenon when the laminar flow was considered the free surface elevation and the impact force were over predicted both in the tank and over the step it was shown that the maximum water height of the shipping flow washing the step increases as the freeboard decreases which was associated with the energy flux the energy flux of the water at the front edge of the step was observed to increase with a decrease in the freeboard moreover the energy flux was found to be highly dependent on the mean velocity of the flow field as it reaches the edge of the step for the cases with a small freeboard the mean velocity was shown to be larger overall it was shown that the role of kinematic energy in total energy flux becomes more significant as the freeboard becomes smaller the energy flux of the tested cases in which the flow caused by the dam break travels further to reach the step was found to be smaller leading to smaller impact force and water height it was also observed that the energy flux of the solitary shipping water propagating over the step approaches negative values after a while implying that water is driven back to the tank the sampled velocity vectors showed that the horizontal velocity of the shipping water can become negative near the step the extent of which is more significant for the cases with smaller freeboard in such circumstances a large velocity gradient occurs and a moving forward vortex appears a further vortex which is weaker compared to the previous one was seen to emerge following the previous vortex these conclusions can help ocean engineers to ensure safer conditions for the floating objects in real sea conditions ships and floating structures are subjected to ocean waves resulting in wave induced vertical and flexural motions which is the subject of the continuation of this work credit authorship contribution statement danial khojasteh conceptualization methodology

21779,this study investigated variations in directional wave parameters by using various combinations of the gnss buoy data such as the displacements e n η and the velocities u v w in the east north and upward directions the investigated directional wave parameters included mean wave direction directional spreading directional wave spectrum and dominant wave direction dwd the three combinations of gnss buoy data for determining the directional wave parameters were η u v e n η and u v w our results revealed that when the significant wave height h s values are 1 m the signal to noise ratios snrs for various measured items are sufficiently large such that the directional wave parameters obtained from various data such as e n η u v w and η u v are identical by contrast under smooth to slight sea conditions with an h s of 1 m the snrs for the displacements are small the small snrs of e n η data tend to produce inaccurate directional wave parameters the deviation in the mean wave direction and dwd obtained from the e n η data compared with those obtained from the u v w and η u v data decreases as the h s increases for small seas the u v w and η u v data are more appropriate than the e n η data for use in determining directional wave parameters keywords global navigation satellite system buoy displacements and velocities signal to noise ratio mean wave direction directional wave spectrum dominant wave direction 1 introduction ocean wave heights periods directions and tide data are essential for coastal engineering and protection projects such as constructing offshore structures like breakwaters mcconnell 1998 and for determining wave run up height and overtopping discharge on a seawall eurotop 2018 directional wave spectra are particularly important for calculating wave loads on offshore structures forecasting real time swells or validating the wave prediction model kuik et al 1988 goda 2000 the directional wave spectra are typically obtained by applying directional analysis methods to wave properties such as elevation velocity pressure and slopes provided by various measuring systems such as directional buoys a pressure sensor combined with a two dimensional 2d current meter wave probe arrays or a remote sensing system benoit and teisson 1994 benoit 1992 conducted a performance survey of methods used for estimating the directional wave spectra from the heave pitch roll data according to the author s preliminary conclusions the directional spreading functions dsfs around peak frequencies obtained from various methods may differ from one another the investigated methods included the unimodal gaussian model bimodal mitsuyasu model long hasselmann method maximum likelihood method mlm iterative mlm eigenvector method evm iterative evm maximum entropy method mem and bayesian directional method benoit 1992 used only the simulated heave pitch roll data that were calculated using the unimodal broad spreading function unimodal thin spreading function and bimodal spreading function benoit and teisson 1994 further evaluated the capabilities of these methods for determining the directional wave spectra from laboratory wave data obtained from i an array of wave probes ii a heave pitch roll gauge and iii a wave velocity gauge young 1994 applied the mlm to determine the dsfs using a spatial array with 4 5 6 7 and 10 water level gauges and noted that the dsfs improved as the number of gauges increased however variations in the directional characteristics other than those obtained from the water surface elevations were not investigated riedel and healey 2005 indicated that by combining time series data of various parameters such as displacements and velocities in the east north and upward directions the directional wave spectrum and its spectral parameters could also be determined harigae et al 2005 and doong et al 2011 used three axis displacements and three axis velocities from a gps global positioning system buoy respectively to calculate the directional wave spectra however they did not investigate the differences in the directional characteristics by using various combinations of different parameters work 2008 compared the directional energy spectra of nearshore surface waves by analyzing data obtained from a data buoy and an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp he used the mem to obtain the directional wave spectra for both systems for the data buoy the time series data of three linear and three angular motions from the data buoy were used the time series data of 12 velocities from the adcp were used the velocities comprised velocities in the upper three layers with each layer having four beam velocities work 2008 noted that both systems provided similar mean and peak wave directions the primary difference was that the directional energy spectra obtained from the adcp data were more tightly concentrated around the peak direction this may suggest that either the instrument or the combination of different parameters leads to differences in directional characteristics however work 2008 did not compare the directional characteristics determined from various combinations of parameters panahi et al 2015 used observed directional wave data from the nortek acoustic wave and current profiler awac to calibrate the bimodal dsf by combining dsf models for wind sea and swell they determined the best dsf for describing the observed directional wave spectra for a region encountering both wind sea and swell a data collection and processing technique used by the awac provides directional wave data by combining water surface elevation and horizontal and vertical velocity components pedersen and siegel 2008 although both the wave and tide data are required the conventional data buoy deployed on the ocean provides only wave data on the basis of the virtual base station real time kinematics vbs rtk positioning technology lin et al 2017a and lin 2018 developed a global navigation satellite system gnss buoy for simultaneously monitoring tides and ocean waves in estuaries and coastal areas the tide levels obtained from the gnss buoy were consistent with those from a neighboring tide station the root mean square error of the tide data was within 10 cm the water surface elevations significant wave height h s values zero crossing periods 1d wave spectra directional wave spectra and dominant wave directions dwds or peak wave directions derived from the gnss buoy agree very well with those obtained from the accelerometer tilt compass atc sensor that is often installed on a data buoy to capture wave data the gnss receiver obtained time series data of six parameters including longitude latitude elevation hereafter e n η and the velocities in the east north and upward directions hereafter u v w lin et al 2017a and lin 2018 used only the water surface elevation and the velocities in the east and north directions hereafter η u v to obtain the directional wave spectra and directional wave parameters please also refer to sickel 2015 and kaplan and hegarty 2017 to obtain more information on the techniques used in gps and gnss ranging from those used in their designs through those used for observation processing real time kinematic rtk and real time networks this study investigated the differences in the directional wave parameters obtained using various combinations of the time series data obtained from the gnss buoy such as η u v e n η and u v w the results may aid practical engineers in selecting appropriate wave properties such as measured displacements and velocities to determine directional wave parameters 2 methodology the working principle of the gnss buoy and gnss accuracy specifications were reported by lin et al 2017a lin et al 2017b and lin 2018 examined the performance of the developed gnss buoy to clarify the effect of the percentage of good elevation data pged on tide and wave monitoring and possible errors in tides and waves that would be caused by the inclination of the buoy hull field tests were performed by deploying the buoy in the wan li waters and small liu qiu waters of taiwan lin et al 2017b lin 2018 the results from field tests indicated that when the inclination of the buoy hull was not considered the gnss tide underestimated a water level by 12 cm as the inclination angle increased up to 16 1 however the corrected water levels due to the inclination of the buoy hull did not lead to a significant change in the wave data such as the h s mean wave period and dwd the possible reason for the good wave height was that the wave height was obtained from the relative water level data in the calculation of the wave height the errors involved in the highest and lowest water levels due to the inclination of the buoy cancel each other out the inclination of the buoy was accordingly not used to correct the water surface elevations when the wave parameters were determined the field data used in this study were collected from 00 00 october 15 to 23 00 october 30 2016 from the small liu qiu data buoy the gnss buoy measured the ellipsoidal height horizontal positions velocities and quality index hourly the sampling rate was 1 hz the data acquisition system was turned on at the 48th minute of each hour to warm up the system for 2 min and it began to acquire samples at the 50th minute the data were thus collected for 10 min therefore in each hour 600 monitoring data were collected for each measuring item the monitored data were transmitted via the gprs modem to the receiving system for further data processing the outlook and location of the small liu qiu buoy are presented in figs 1 and 2 respectively for the details of the deployment of the small liu qiu buoy please refer to lin 2018 in the current study the water surface elevation is denoted by η displacements in the east and north directions by e and n respectively and velocities in the east north and upward directions by u v and w respectively 2 1 calculating positions and velocities using a gnss lin et al 2017a and lin 2018 have discussed the vbs rtk positioning technology used to determine the position of a buoy the vbs rtk system used in our work consisted of three components namely a gnss base station network a control center and a rover station their respective functions were as follows 1 gnss base station network each base station received gnss observation data and transmitted the raw data to the control center continuously currently 78 base stations were implemented in taiwan 2 control center the vbs rtk control center for positioning computation used in this work was operated by the national land surveying and mapping center nlsc of the ministry of the interior taiwan it supported both gps and glonass constellations the progressive infrastructure via overlaid technology pivot commercial software program developed by trimble navigation was run in the center 3 rover station the rover station consisted of a gnss buoy with a gnss receiver and a gnss antenna attached to it the procedure of vbs positioning was conducted as follows 1 pre process network observations establishing the network database and completing the coordinate adjustments for each base station 2 obtaining data from regional stations collecting continuous observations and accurate coordinates from each gnss base station thus establishing an area correction parameters database 3 generating vbs data for the rover the rover station reported approximate coordinates to the vbs rtk control center according to the carrier phase observations the pivot software program continuously calculated the errors caused by the multipath ionosphere troposphere and ephemeris and the integer ambiguity of the carrier phase of l1 and l2 it also established a vbs dataset at a location near the rover station subsequently the vbs data were transmitted to the rover station 4 calculating the position of the rover station the rover station received the vbs data and processed to ultra short baseline rtk positioning wu et al 2013 provided detailed information on the precision of positions obtained using the vbs rtk system operated by the nlsc they reported that the total accuracies of positions for the gps satellite positioning reference network and vbs rtk were approximately 2 cm and 5 cm in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the gnss receiver estimated the velocities using the doppler shift with an accuracy in the order of some c m s according to he 2015 the fundamental principle for determining velocities is equation of doppler shift for the satellite s and the gnss receiver r as written in eq 1 1 d r j s v r c f j s where d r j s is the shift in frequency between the satellite s and the receiver r at the j t h frequency channel f denotes the frequency of the gnss carrier phase observation v r is the radial velocity of the satellite s relative to the receiver r and c denotes the speed of light in a vacuum d r j s had a positive sign when the receiver and the transmitter approached each other and a negative sign when the receiver and the transmitter moved away from each other the gnss receiver used in this study could receive carrier phase signals from the satellites according to its specification topcon positioning systems 2012 the accuracy of the velocity was 0 02 m s circular error probability which was 1 2 times the root mean square accuracy of the velocity the procedure for using a gnss buoy based on vbs rtk positioning to calculate positions and velocities can be summarized as follows 1 a gnss receiver on the buoy receives signals from satellites and uses these data to calculate its velocity and approximate position longitude latitude and elevation 2 the position and gps time data are transmitted to the vbs rtk control center through a general packet radio service gprs modem 3 the vbs rtk control center generates vbs data by using the pivot software and then transmits the data back through the gprs modem to the gnss receiver on the buoy 4 the gnss receiver determines the corrected position and the quality index on the basis of the received satellite signals and vbs data these data are then transmitted to the receiving system on land 2 2 pged percentage of good elevation data according to some key factors including the signals received by the gnss buoy and gnss base station network the network signal quality of the gnss buoy and gnss base station network and ionospheric activity the gnss buoy obtains specific resolution results with specific quality indicators when the quality indicator shows 4 rtk fix solution the instantaneous resolution result is identified as good elevation data ged thus the hourly pged is determined as the ratio of the number of ged to the number of observed data i e 512 and defined as follows 2 pged ged 512 based on the adopted sampling rate 1 hz and the sampling period 10 min h 600 data are available for further data analyzing only the first 512 data are used in this study only hourly data with pged 1 00 are used to determine the directional wave parameters such as the mean wave direction directional spreading directional wave spectrum and dwd 2 3 directional wave spectra determined from η u v data hashimoto and konbune 1988 described the relationship between the directional wave spectrum and the cross power spectrum for any pair of wave properties such as η u and v as follows 3 φ mn f π π i m f θ i n f θ cos k x m n cos θ y m n sin θ i sin k x m n cos θ y m n sin θ s f θ d θ where f is the frequency θ is the wave propagation angle measured from the x axis east direction and increased in the counterclockwise direction φ m n f is the cross power spectrum between the m th and n th wave properties i m f θ is the transfer function from the water surface elevation to the m th wave property the asterisk denotes the conjugate complex k is the wavenumber x m n x n x m y m n y n y m x m y m is the location of the wave probe for the m th wave property i is the imaginary unit and s f θ is the directional wave spectrum when the ηuν data are used the vertical elevation η and the velocities in the east and north directions u and v respectively are measured by the same gnss antenna accordingly x m n 0 and y m n 0 and eq 3 can be simplified as follows 4 φ mn f π π i m f θ i n f θ s f θ d θ with 5 i m f θ h m f cos α θ sin β θ where the function h m and the parameters α and β vary with the wave properties and were provided by hashimoto and konbune 1988 when eq 5 is substituted into eq 4 the cross power spectra between the various wave properties can be obtained the directional wave spectrum s f θ could be determined as follows 6 s f θ d f θ c η η f 7 d f θ 1 π 1 2 n 1 2 a n f cos n θ b n f sin n θ where d f θ is the directional spreading function c η η f is the 1d wave spectrum a n f and b n f are the fourier coefficients and n is the order of the fourier series lin et al 2017a provided the equations for determining the fourier coefficients of d f θ from the η u v data these equations are given as follows 8 a 1 f c η u f c η η f c u u f c v v f 9 b 1 f c η v f c η η f c u u f c v v f 10 a 2 f c u u f c v v f c u u f c v v f 11 b 2 f 2 c u v f c u u f c v v f where c m n f is the cospectrum between the m th and n th wave properties the cospectrum is the real part of the complex cross power spectrum note also that the cross power spectrum of two identical wave properties has no imaginary part therefore it was identical to the cospectrum of these two wave properties namely 12 φ m m f c m m f 2 4 directional wave spectra obtained from e n η data riedel and healey 2005 indicated that by using the e n η data the fourier coefficients of d f θ could be determined as follows 13 a 1 f im φ e η f φ η η f φ e e f φ n n f 14 b 1 f im φ n η f φ η η f φ e e f φ n n f 15 a 2 f φ e e f φ n n f φ e e f φ n n f 16 b 2 f 2 re φ e n f φ e e f φ n n f where im and re denote the imaginary and real parts of the cross power spectrum respectively riedel and healey 2005 also indicated that these coefficients had been incorporated in the datawell directional waverider to determine the directional wave spectrum the 3d displacements are obtained by integrating the 3d accelerations measured by the buoy in this study the 3d displacements were measured directly by the gnss buoy as mentioned earlier the cross power spectrum of two identical wave properties has no imaginary part based on eq 12 eqs 13 16 can be rewritten as follows 17 a 1 f im φ e η f c η η f c e e f c n n f 18 b 1 f im φ n η f c η η f c e e f c n n f 19 a 2 f c e e f c n n f c e e f c n n f 20 b 2 f 2 re φ e n f c e e f c n n f 2 5 directional wave spectra obtained from u v w data riedel and healey 2005 also provided equations for determining the fourier coefficients of d f θ from the u v w data measured by a tri directional current meter their equations were modified as follows 21 a 1 f im φ w u f c w w f c u u f c v v f 22 b 1 f im φ w v f c w w f c u u f c v v f 23 a 2 f c u u f c v v f c u u f c v v f 24 b 2 f 2 re φ u v f c u u f c v v f in this study the displacement and velocity are measured by the gnss buoy fast fourier transform fft was applied to determine the cospectrum the real part of cross power spectrum and the quadrature spectrum the imaginary part of the cross power spectrum for any pair of wave properties such as u v and w the obtained cross power spectra were then used to determine the fourier coefficients of the directional spreading function d f θ such as eqs 8 11 for the η u v data eqs 17 20 for the e n η data and eqs 21 24 for the u v w data 2 6 weighted fourier series method longuet higgins et al 1963 calculated the directional spectrum of ocean waves by using the floating buoy motions including the water surface elevations and slopes in the east and north directions the authors indicated that the dsf might be negative and therefore proposed the weighting coefficients to correct the dsf the weighted fourier coefficients were expressed as follows 25 a 1 f 2 3 a 1 f 26 b 1 f 2 3 b 1 f 27 a 2 f 1 6 a 2 f 28 b 2 f 1 6 b 2 f here we adopt above weighted fourier coefficients to determine the directional spreading functions by using the η u v e n η and u v w data measured by the gnss buoy accordingly eq 7 can be rewritten as follows 29 d f θ 1 π 1 2 n 1 2 a n f cos n θ b n f sin n θ longuet higgins et al 1963 also indicated that the weighted fourier coefficients would extend the width of the dsf accordingly the values of the dsf thus obtained would be larger than those obtained using non weighted fourier coefficients 2 7 mean wave direction and directional spreading to determine the directional characteristics of ocean waves two parameters were also often used namely the mean wave direction and directional spreading the mean wave direction represents the average propagation direction of ocean waves whereas the directional spreading is a measure of the directional spreading of wave energy according to kuik et al 1988 the mean wave direction θ m f and the directional spreading σ θ f could be expressed in terms of the first order fourier coefficients as follows 30 θ m f tan 1 b 1 f a 1 f 31 σ θ f 2 1 a 1 f cos θ m f b 1 f sin θ m f notably both the mean wave direction and directional spreading are functions of the frequency however here the mean wave direction and directional spreading denote their values at the peak frequency the peak frequency denotes the frequency of waves with the maximum power spectral density in the 1d wave spectrum 3 results and discussion this study applied the weighted fourier series wfs method proposed by longuet higgins et al 1963 to investigate variations in directional wave parameters by using the η u v e n η and u v w data obtained from the gnss buoy deployed in the small liu qiu waters taiwan the outlook and location of the small liu qiu buoy are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively the investigated directional wave parameters included the mean wave direction directional spreading directional wave spectrum and dwd the field data were collected in 2016 from 10 15 00 00 this notation refers to month day hour hereafter to 10 30 23 00 however only hourly data with pged 1 0 were used to determine the wave parameters 3 1 sea states during the field test period of gnss buoy to provide more information to understand the temporal variations in directional wave parameters the significant wave heights h s in the small liu qiu waters during the field test period were analyzed fig 3 fig 3 displays the hourly time series data of the significant wave height obtained using the gnss buoy and atc sensor data the atc sensor was installed on the buoy to provide additional wave data to be compared with those obtained from the gnss receiver the atc sensor measurements were conducted on an hourly basis each measurement was conducted for a duration of 10 min and at a sampling rate of 1 hz lin et al 2017a listed the detailed specifications of the atc sensor used in this study the significant wave height was calculated from the one dimensional 1d wave spectrum as follows 32 h s 4 m 0 33 m 0 0 s f d f where m 0 denotes the zero th moment of the 1d wave spectrum and s f is the spectral density at frequency f h s values obtained from the atc sensor were calculated from the power spectral density of water surface elevation η based on the method proposed by earle 1996 for a gnss buoy s f which equals c η η f was calculated after the water surface elevations were obtained and the h s values were then determined using eqs 32 and 33 because only hourly gnss data with a pged value of 1 0 were used to determine the wave data no h s values were obtained from the gnss buoy for some hours fig 3 reveals that the h s values obtained from the gnss buoy are mostly in close agreement with those obtained from the atc sensor furthermore a detailed analysis of 159 h s data samples obtained from both the gnss buoy and atc sensor revealed that the mean absolute error between the two data sets was 2 9 cm fig 3 reveals that the missing h s values from the gnss buoy data mainly corresponded to the hours with heavy winds and waves the gprs connection dropout during severe weather conditions may restrict the number of ged and make the hourly pged value less than 1 0 consequently no h s values would be obtained from the gnss buoy this situation poses a serious operational problem when the gnss buoy based on vbs rtk positioning is used for ocean monitoring a typhoon occurred near taiwan during the field test period thus large wave heights were measured fig 4 illustrates the track of typhoon haima and fig 3 reveals that the h s values exceeded 2 0 m from 10 20 06 00 to 10 22 11 00 and exceeded 4 0 m from 10 20 23 00 to 10 21 11 00 because typhoon haima was then closest to taiwan by contrast during the period from 10 24 11 00 to 10 29 11 00 2016 the small liu qiu waters were smooth with h s values less than 0 4 m in this study the words used to describe the sea states match the wmo world meteorological organization terminology for sea states 3 2 mean wave direction fig 5 a displays the hourly time series data of mean wave direction and their differences obtained using the η u v and e n η data the angles were measured clockwise from the north fig 5 b presents the corresponding results obtained using the u v w and η u v data fig 5 b reveals that the differences in the mean wave direction obtained using the u v w and η u v data ranged between 8 and 11 for diverse wave heights fig 5 a shows that from 10 17 11 00 to 10 23 06 00 the differences in the mean wave directions obtained from the e n η and η u v data are quite small and become large from 10 23 06 00 to 10 30 23 00 comparing to fig 3 it can be noted that the former period corresponds to moderate and higher sea conditions with h s 1 0 m whereas the latter period corresponds to smooth to slight sea conditions with h s 1 0 m the maximum angular difference in the mean wave direction obtained using e n η and η u v data was 156 o or 204 o when the angles were measured clockwise and it occurred at 10 26 00 00 2016 at this time the measured h s was as low as 0 37 m indicating a smooth sea state and the obtained mean wave directions were 138 o 342 o and 146 o by using the η u v e n η and u v w data respectively the mean wave direction determined from the e n η data was close to that determined using two other data sets except under calm sea states the reasons for this difference are discussed in sections 3 4 and 3 6 3 3 directional spreading the hourly time series data of directional spreading and their differences obtained from the η u v and e n η data are displayed in fig 6 a whereas the corresponding results obtained from the u v w and η u v data are presented in fig 6 b comparing fig 6 a and 6 b reveals that from 10 17 11 00 to 10 23 06 00 the differences in directional spreading obtained from the η u v and e n η data were close to those obtained from the η u v and u v w data however the differences become larger from 10 23 06 00 to 10 30 23 00 the former period corresponds to sea states with h s 1 0 m whereas the latter period corresponds to sea states with h s 1 0 m fig 6 b reveals that the directional spreading values obtained using the u v w and η u v data differ slightly for diverse wave heights except that occurred at 10 21 13 00 2016 the angular difference was 9 o 3 4 directional wave spectrum directional wave spectra calculated using the e n η and η u v data collected from 10 25 21 00 to 10 26 02 00 26 10 are shown in the left and right sides of fig 7 respectively during this period the h s values were 1 m the azimuth of the circular plot illustrates the direction from which ocean waves came the angles 0 o 90 o 180 o and 270 o indicate the north east south and west directions respectively the radial direction indicates the wave frequency in hertz furthermore the peak frequency and the dwd are also shown in the upper left corner of each figure the dwd is identified as the direction where the maximum power spectral density unit m2 hz rad occurs the color bar indicates the strength of the power spectral density notably from fig 7 that the directional wave spectra determined using the e n η data are similar to those determined using the η u v data except those obtained at 10 26 00 00 during the observation period as depicted in fig 7 the ocean wave mainly originated from the south semicircle except for that determined using the e n η data at 10 26 00 00 comparison with the atc data see section 3 6 indicates that the e n η results are likely wrong furthermore at this particular time the peak wave energy obtained from the e n η data originated from the nw direction despite the wind originating from the south thus the directional wave spectrum obtained at 10 26 00 00 by using the e n η data is unreasonable the possible reasons that caused this inaccuracy are discussed in section 3 6 fig 3 shows that from 10 18 00 00 to 10 23 04 00 the h s values in the small liu qiu waters were larger than 1 m fig 8 compares some of the directional wave spectra determined by using the η u v e n η and u v w data from 06 00 to 11 00 on october 21 2016 during this period the typhoon haima was close to taiwan hence the h s exceeded 6 0 m notably as shown in fig 8 the directional wave spectra obtained from the η u v e n η and u v w data were mainly identical furthermore all the waves with peak energy were from the southwest direction and the peak frequencies were very low 0 0859 hz or 0 0957 hz probably because of the typhoon induced swell notably from figs 2 and 4 that the typhoon haima was in the west southwest direction of the small liu qiu buoy on october 21 2016 the results shown in figs 7 and 8 reveal that at small seas the directional wave spectra obtained from the e n η data differ from those obtained using the η u v data however at high seas the directional wave spectra obtained using three data combinations were identical 3 5 dwd dominant wave direction fig 9 a shows the hourly time series of the dwd and their differences determined using the η u v and e n η data collected by the gnss buoy from 10 15 00 00 to 10 30 23 00 2016 whereas fig 9 b displays the corresponding results obtained using the u v w and η u v data the dwd is the direction from which an ocean wave with peak energy comes and the angle is measured clockwise from the north notably from fig 9 that the differences in the dwd obtained using the u v w and η u v data were primarily in the 1 25 o range 90 7 whereas those obtained using the e n η and η u v data were primarily in the 30 o range 93 2 indicating that the dwds obtained using the u v w and η u v combinations of gnss buoy data were mostly identical however as shown in fig 9 a we noted that the maximum difference in the dwd between the e n η and η u v data was 169 o which occurred at 10 26 00 00 and was the same as the time when the maximum difference in the mean wave direction obtained using the e n η and η u v data occurred the dominant wave direction determined from the e n η data was apparently different from those determined using two other data sets reasons for this difference are discussed in section 3 6 both the mean wave direction and dwd are widely adopted to indicate the wave directions as mentioned the mean wave direction represents the average propagation direction of ocean waves whereas the dwd denotes the wave direction where the maximum power spectral density occurred in the 2d wave spectrum the difference between them could be noteworthy the histogram of the differences between the mean wave direction and dwd produced using the η u v data is plotted in fig 10 according to this figure 85 7 of the difference was in the 15 o range indicating that mostly two wave directions are very close to each other however the maximum difference is 102 o which occurred at 10 27 00 00 the h s measured by the gnss buoy at this time was small i e 0 43 m the shapes of histogram obtained using the e n η and u v w data are very similar to that obtained from the η u v data 82 6 and 85 6 of the differences determined using the e n η and u v w data respectively were in the 15 o range for brevity these data are not shown herein 3 6 discussions on mean wave directions and directional wave spectrum to clarify the reasons that the mean wave direction and directional wave spectrum obtained from the e n η at 10 26 00 00 considerably differed from those obtained using the η u v and u v w data the time series data of displacements in both east and north directions obtained by the gnss buoy at this time are plotted in fig 11 there are both low and high frequency oscillations during the 10 min measuring period the high frequency parts should be due to the ocean waves whereas the low frequency portions with periods of approximately 90 s may represent the infragravity waves which have a typical period of 25 250 s munk 1950 the capture of these low frequency signals in the e n η gnss solutions suggests that these data potentially have additional value for investigating infragravity waves because we are mainly interested in the ocean waves in the data analysis the signals with frequencies of 0 4 or 0 05 hz are filtered out however the directional wave spectrum obtained after filtering out the signals in undesired frequency ranges was nearly the same as that obtained from the original signals thus the extraordinarily low and high frequency movements did not lead to inaccurate directional wave parameters results because the h s at 10 26 00 00 was only 0 37 m we examined the signal to noise ratio snr of the items measured by the gnss buoy the snr of the measured signals is defined as follows 34 snr σ m σ a where σ m and σ a indicate the standard deviation of measured signals and noise signals respectively σ a specifies the accuracy of the measurements and their values for various measuring items are declared by the vbs rtk positioning service used in this study the values of σ a for the displacements and velocities in the east north and upward directions measured by the gnss buoy are also presented in table 1 as shown in table 1 the root mean square accuracies of the displacements and velocities are approximately 0 05 m and 0 017 m s respectively table 1 lists the snrs of displacements e n η and velocities u v w measured by the gnss buoy at 00 00 on october 26 2016 notably from table 1 that the snrs of displacements were approximately one order of magnitude smaller than those of velocities indicating that the better method for determining the directional wave parameters should be using the u v w data rather than the e n η data table 2 presents the mean and maximum absolute deviations of the mean wave direction obtained from the e n η data the deviation is determined by subtracting the mean wave direction obtained using the e n η data from that obtained using the u v w data the data analyzed here were collected from the field test from 10 15 00 00 to 10 30 23 00 2016 with pged 1 00 the minimum snr denotes the smallest snr value among the samples the number of samples corresponds to various h s values notably as shown in table 2 the mean and maximum absolute deviations decreased considerably as the h s increased the mean absolute deviation was 4 8 o when h s 0 4 m it reached 12 0 o when h s 0 4 m and decreased to 1 6 o when h s 2 0 m the maximum absolute deviation was 61 o when h s 0 4 m it reached 196 when h s 0 4 m and decreased to 4 o when h s 2 0 m furthermore when h s 1 0 m the mean wave directions obtained using the e n η data were nearly identical to those obtained using the u v w data notably the mean and maximum absolute deviations of the mean wave direction decreased as the minimum snr of displacements increased and the minimum snr of displacements increased with the increase in the h s possible reasons why the small snrs of the e n η data tended to produce inaccurate directional wave parameters are the following in this study once the displacement and velocity data were obtained from the gnss buoy fft was used to determine the cospectrum and quadrature spectrum for any pair of wave properties the obtained cross power spectra were then used to determine the fourier coefficients of the dsf d f θ signals with small snrs were contaminated with considerable noises these noises produced inaccurate cross power spectra which led to inaccurate fourier coefficients this then generated errors in the directional wave parameters the mismatch in the directional wave parameters during low seas that we attributed to the poor performance of the e n η data was further confirmed by comparing the directional wave parameters obtained using the gnss buoy data either e n η or u v w with the parameters obtained using the atc sensor data under smooth sea conditions with h s 0 4 m a comparison of 37 hourly mean wave directions obtained from the gnss buoy and atc sensor data revealed that the mean error declined from 9 5 o to 2 1 o when u v w data were used instead of e n η data the error was calculated by subtracting the value obtained using the atc sensor data from that obtained using the gnss buoy data similarly the mean error of the dwd decreased from 7 5 o to 4 9 o when u v w data were used instead of e n η data the results obtained in this study show that when h s 1 0 m the directional wave parameters determined from any of the three gnss data sets namely e n η u v w and η u v agreed well with each other therefore any of these data sets is appropriate for determining the directional wave parameters under these ocean conditions however when h s 1 0 m the u v w and η u v data are more appropriate than the e n η data for determining the directional wave parameters the aforementioned findings as summarized in conclusions 1 and 2 provide useful information for choosing appropriate gnss data for determining directional wave parameters conclusion 3 suggests that examining the snrs of the measured data under various sea states is a possible method of surveying intrinsic uncertainties in measured data used for determining directional wave parameters these findings suggest also that wave related observations such as water surface elevation pressure acceleration tilt and velocity can be combined to obtain directional wave parameters however for choosing appropriate data combination intrinsic uncertainties in measured data must be examined 3 7 limitations using a gnss buoy based on vbs rtk positioning for ocean monitoring as mentioned in section 2 1 the data transmission between the gnss receiver on the buoy and the vbs rtk control center is conducted using a gprs modem the deployment range of the gnss buoy is limited by network coverage because the gprs modem requires a network signal for data transmission the range usually within a few kilometers can be extended to a maximum distance of 20 km if ppk post processed kinematic is used instead of the vbs rtk positioning arroyo suarez et al 2006 nevertheless ppk is not obtained in real time el mowafy et al 2017 indicated that precise point positioning ppp technology can provide decimeter level positioning accuracy by using a single receiver without a base station thus ppp technology can be utilized anywhere several real time open access commercial services are available for ppp positioning such as igs rts the trimble rtx service leandro et al 2011 the fugro g2 service http www starfix com positioning systems and terrastar https www terrastar net therefore the range limitation of the gnss buoy can be alleviated if the global real time ppp rt ppp service is used instead of vbs rtk positioning the accuracy of ppp technology can be improved to the centimeter level if satellite based augmentation systems sbas are implemented choy et al 2017 some commercial gnss augmentation service providers such as novatel with terrastar c corrections https www novatel com products terrastar gnss corrections contenttab1 offer both horizontal and vertical centimeter level positioning solutions for land and airborne applications in addition to the deployment range limitation the gprs connection dropout under severe weather conditions may influence the number of observed data with pged 1 0 in this case a gnss buoy provides less reliable ocean monitoring data compared with a conventional atc sensor fig 3 moreover as demonstrated in sections 3 2 to 3 6 under smooth to slight sea conditions with h s 1 0 m only the u v w and η u v gnss data are recommended for use in determining the directional wave parameters 4 conclusions this study applied the wfs method proposed by longuet higgin et al 1963 to investigate the variations in the directional wave parameters by utilizing three combinations of time series data obtained by the gnss buoy such as η u v e n η and u v w the data that analyzed in this study were collected from the field test by deploying the gnss buoy developed by lin et al 2017a in the small liu qiu waters taiwan only hourly data whose pged 1 0 are utilized to determine the directional wave parameters including the mean wave direction directional spreading directional wave spectrum and dominant wave direction based on the present results we may conclude the following 1 in moderate and higher sea conditions when h s 1 0 m the directional wave parameters determined from any of the three gnss data sets namely e n η u v w and η u v agreed well with each other 2 under smooth to slight sea conditions with h s 1 0 m the u v w and η u v data generate more accurate directional wave parameters than the e n η data accordingly when h s 1 0 m only the u v w and η u v data are recommended for use for determining the directional wave parameters 3 the less accurate directional wave parameters obtained from the e n η data were associated with smaller snr values of the displacement data e n η compared with those of the velocity data u v w the snr values of the e n η data increased with h s 4 during the field tests the maximum difference in the dominant wave direction and the maximum difference in the mean wave direction between the e n η and η u v data occurred at the same time when the h s was only 0 37 m credit authorship contribution statement yen pin

21779,this study investigated variations in directional wave parameters by using various combinations of the gnss buoy data such as the displacements e n η and the velocities u v w in the east north and upward directions the investigated directional wave parameters included mean wave direction directional spreading directional wave spectrum and dominant wave direction dwd the three combinations of gnss buoy data for determining the directional wave parameters were η u v e n η and u v w our results revealed that when the significant wave height h s values are 1 m the signal to noise ratios snrs for various measured items are sufficiently large such that the directional wave parameters obtained from various data such as e n η u v w and η u v are identical by contrast under smooth to slight sea conditions with an h s of 1 m the snrs for the displacements are small the small snrs of e n η data tend to produce inaccurate directional wave parameters the deviation in the mean wave direction and dwd obtained from the e n η data compared with those obtained from the u v w and η u v data decreases as the h s increases for small seas the u v w and η u v data are more appropriate than the e n η data for use in determining directional wave parameters keywords global navigation satellite system buoy displacements and velocities signal to noise ratio mean wave direction directional wave spectrum dominant wave direction 1 introduction ocean wave heights periods directions and tide data are essential for coastal engineering and protection projects such as constructing offshore structures like breakwaters mcconnell 1998 and for determining wave run up height and overtopping discharge on a seawall eurotop 2018 directional wave spectra are particularly important for calculating wave loads on offshore structures forecasting real time swells or validating the wave prediction model kuik et al 1988 goda 2000 the directional wave spectra are typically obtained by applying directional analysis methods to wave properties such as elevation velocity pressure and slopes provided by various measuring systems such as directional buoys a pressure sensor combined with a two dimensional 2d current meter wave probe arrays or a remote sensing system benoit and teisson 1994 benoit 1992 conducted a performance survey of methods used for estimating the directional wave spectra from the heave pitch roll data according to the author s preliminary conclusions the directional spreading functions dsfs around peak frequencies obtained from various methods may differ from one another the investigated methods included the unimodal gaussian model bimodal mitsuyasu model long hasselmann method maximum likelihood method mlm iterative mlm eigenvector method evm iterative evm maximum entropy method mem and bayesian directional method benoit 1992 used only the simulated heave pitch roll data that were calculated using the unimodal broad spreading function unimodal thin spreading function and bimodal spreading function benoit and teisson 1994 further evaluated the capabilities of these methods for determining the directional wave spectra from laboratory wave data obtained from i an array of wave probes ii a heave pitch roll gauge and iii a wave velocity gauge young 1994 applied the mlm to determine the dsfs using a spatial array with 4 5 6 7 and 10 water level gauges and noted that the dsfs improved as the number of gauges increased however variations in the directional characteristics other than those obtained from the water surface elevations were not investigated riedel and healey 2005 indicated that by combining time series data of various parameters such as displacements and velocities in the east north and upward directions the directional wave spectrum and its spectral parameters could also be determined harigae et al 2005 and doong et al 2011 used three axis displacements and three axis velocities from a gps global positioning system buoy respectively to calculate the directional wave spectra however they did not investigate the differences in the directional characteristics by using various combinations of different parameters work 2008 compared the directional energy spectra of nearshore surface waves by analyzing data obtained from a data buoy and an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp he used the mem to obtain the directional wave spectra for both systems for the data buoy the time series data of three linear and three angular motions from the data buoy were used the time series data of 12 velocities from the adcp were used the velocities comprised velocities in the upper three layers with each layer having four beam velocities work 2008 noted that both systems provided similar mean and peak wave directions the primary difference was that the directional energy spectra obtained from the adcp data were more tightly concentrated around the peak direction this may suggest that either the instrument or the combination of different parameters leads to differences in directional characteristics however work 2008 did not compare the directional characteristics determined from various combinations of parameters panahi et al 2015 used observed directional wave data from the nortek acoustic wave and current profiler awac to calibrate the bimodal dsf by combining dsf models for wind sea and swell they determined the best dsf for describing the observed directional wave spectra for a region encountering both wind sea and swell a data collection and processing technique used by the awac provides directional wave data by combining water surface elevation and horizontal and vertical velocity components pedersen and siegel 2008 although both the wave and tide data are required the conventional data buoy deployed on the ocean provides only wave data on the basis of the virtual base station real time kinematics vbs rtk positioning technology lin et al 2017a and lin 2018 developed a global navigation satellite system gnss buoy for simultaneously monitoring tides and ocean waves in estuaries and coastal areas the tide levels obtained from the gnss buoy were consistent with those from a neighboring tide station the root mean square error of the tide data was within 10 cm the water surface elevations significant wave height h s values zero crossing periods 1d wave spectra directional wave spectra and dominant wave directions dwds or peak wave directions derived from the gnss buoy agree very well with those obtained from the accelerometer tilt compass atc sensor that is often installed on a data buoy to capture wave data the gnss receiver obtained time series data of six parameters including longitude latitude elevation hereafter e n η and the velocities in the east north and upward directions hereafter u v w lin et al 2017a and lin 2018 used only the water surface elevation and the velocities in the east and north directions hereafter η u v to obtain the directional wave spectra and directional wave parameters please also refer to sickel 2015 and kaplan and hegarty 2017 to obtain more information on the techniques used in gps and gnss ranging from those used in their designs through those used for observation processing real time kinematic rtk and real time networks this study investigated the differences in the directional wave parameters obtained using various combinations of the time series data obtained from the gnss buoy such as η u v e n η and u v w the results may aid practical engineers in selecting appropriate wave properties such as measured displacements and velocities to determine directional wave parameters 2 methodology the working principle of the gnss buoy and gnss accuracy specifications were reported by lin et al 2017a lin et al 2017b and lin 2018 examined the performance of the developed gnss buoy to clarify the effect of the percentage of good elevation data pged on tide and wave monitoring and possible errors in tides and waves that would be caused by the inclination of the buoy hull field tests were performed by deploying the buoy in the wan li waters and small liu qiu waters of taiwan lin et al 2017b lin 2018 the results from field tests indicated that when the inclination of the buoy hull was not considered the gnss tide underestimated a water level by 12 cm as the inclination angle increased up to 16 1 however the corrected water levels due to the inclination of the buoy hull did not lead to a significant change in the wave data such as the h s mean wave period and dwd the possible reason for the good wave height was that the wave height was obtained from the relative water level data in the calculation of the wave height the errors involved in the highest and lowest water levels due to the inclination of the buoy cancel each other out the inclination of the buoy was accordingly not used to correct the water surface elevations when the wave parameters were determined the field data used in this study were collected from 00 00 october 15 to 23 00 october 30 2016 from the small liu qiu data buoy the gnss buoy measured the ellipsoidal height horizontal positions velocities and quality index hourly the sampling rate was 1 hz the data acquisition system was turned on at the 48th minute of each hour to warm up the system for 2 min and it began to acquire samples at the 50th minute the data were thus collected for 10 min therefore in each hour 600 monitoring data were collected for each measuring item the monitored data were transmitted via the gprs modem to the receiving system for further data processing the outlook and location of the small liu qiu buoy are presented in figs 1 and 2 respectively for the details of the deployment of the small liu qiu buoy please refer to lin 2018 in the current study the water surface elevation is denoted by η displacements in the east and north directions by e and n respectively and velocities in the east north and upward directions by u v and w respectively 2 1 calculating positions and velocities using a gnss lin et al 2017a and lin 2018 have discussed the vbs rtk positioning technology used to determine the position of a buoy the vbs rtk system used in our work consisted of three components namely a gnss base station network a control center and a rover station their respective functions were as follows 1 gnss base station network each base station received gnss observation data and transmitted the raw data to the control center continuously currently 78 base stations were implemented in taiwan 2 control center the vbs rtk control center for positioning computation used in this work was operated by the national land surveying and mapping center nlsc of the ministry of the interior taiwan it supported both gps and glonass constellations the progressive infrastructure via overlaid technology pivot commercial software program developed by trimble navigation was run in the center 3 rover station the rover station consisted of a gnss buoy with a gnss receiver and a gnss antenna attached to it the procedure of vbs positioning was conducted as follows 1 pre process network observations establishing the network database and completing the coordinate adjustments for each base station 2 obtaining data from regional stations collecting continuous observations and accurate coordinates from each gnss base station thus establishing an area correction parameters database 3 generating vbs data for the rover the rover station reported approximate coordinates to the vbs rtk control center according to the carrier phase observations the pivot software program continuously calculated the errors caused by the multipath ionosphere troposphere and ephemeris and the integer ambiguity of the carrier phase of l1 and l2 it also established a vbs dataset at a location near the rover station subsequently the vbs data were transmitted to the rover station 4 calculating the position of the rover station the rover station received the vbs data and processed to ultra short baseline rtk positioning wu et al 2013 provided detailed information on the precision of positions obtained using the vbs rtk system operated by the nlsc they reported that the total accuracies of positions for the gps satellite positioning reference network and vbs rtk were approximately 2 cm and 5 cm in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the gnss receiver estimated the velocities using the doppler shift with an accuracy in the order of some c m s according to he 2015 the fundamental principle for determining velocities is equation of doppler shift for the satellite s and the gnss receiver r as written in eq 1 1 d r j s v r c f j s where d r j s is the shift in frequency between the satellite s and the receiver r at the j t h frequency channel f denotes the frequency of the gnss carrier phase observation v r is the radial velocity of the satellite s relative to the receiver r and c denotes the speed of light in a vacuum d r j s had a positive sign when the receiver and the transmitter approached each other and a negative sign when the receiver and the transmitter moved away from each other the gnss receiver used in this study could receive carrier phase signals from the satellites according to its specification topcon positioning systems 2012 the accuracy of the velocity was 0 02 m s circular error probability which was 1 2 times the root mean square accuracy of the velocity the procedure for using a gnss buoy based on vbs rtk positioning to calculate positions and velocities can be summarized as follows 1 a gnss receiver on the buoy receives signals from satellites and uses these data to calculate its velocity and approximate position longitude latitude and elevation 2 the position and gps time data are transmitted to the vbs rtk control center through a general packet radio service gprs modem 3 the vbs rtk control center generates vbs data by using the pivot software and then transmits the data back through the gprs modem to the gnss receiver on the buoy 4 the gnss receiver determines the corrected position and the quality index on the basis of the received satellite signals and vbs data these data are then transmitted to the receiving system on land 2 2 pged percentage of good elevation data according to some key factors including the signals received by the gnss buoy and gnss base station network the network signal quality of the gnss buoy and gnss base station network and ionospheric activity the gnss buoy obtains specific resolution results with specific quality indicators when the quality indicator shows 4 rtk fix solution the instantaneous resolution result is identified as good elevation data ged thus the hourly pged is determined as the ratio of the number of ged to the number of observed data i e 512 and defined as follows 2 pged ged 512 based on the adopted sampling rate 1 hz and the sampling period 10 min h 600 data are available for further data analyzing only the first 512 data are used in this study only hourly data with pged 1 00 are used to determine the directional wave parameters such as the mean wave direction directional spreading directional wave spectrum and dwd 2 3 directional wave spectra determined from η u v data hashimoto and konbune 1988 described the relationship between the directional wave spectrum and the cross power spectrum for any pair of wave properties such as η u and v as follows 3 φ mn f π π i m f θ i n f θ cos k x m n cos θ y m n sin θ i sin k x m n cos θ y m n sin θ s f θ d θ where f is the frequency θ is the wave propagation angle measured from the x axis east direction and increased in the counterclockwise direction φ m n f is the cross power spectrum between the m th and n th wave properties i m f θ is the transfer function from the water surface elevation to the m th wave property the asterisk denotes the conjugate complex k is the wavenumber x m n x n x m y m n y n y m x m y m is the location of the wave probe for the m th wave property i is the imaginary unit and s f θ is the directional wave spectrum when the ηuν data are used the vertical elevation η and the velocities in the east and north directions u and v respectively are measured by the same gnss antenna accordingly x m n 0 and y m n 0 and eq 3 can be simplified as follows 4 φ mn f π π i m f θ i n f θ s f θ d θ with 5 i m f θ h m f cos α θ sin β θ where the function h m and the parameters α and β vary with the wave properties and were provided by hashimoto and konbune 1988 when eq 5 is substituted into eq 4 the cross power spectra between the various wave properties can be obtained the directional wave spectrum s f θ could be determined as follows 6 s f θ d f θ c η η f 7 d f θ 1 π 1 2 n 1 2 a n f cos n θ b n f sin n θ where d f θ is the directional spreading function c η η f is the 1d wave spectrum a n f and b n f are the fourier coefficients and n is the order of the fourier series lin et al 2017a provided the equations for determining the fourier coefficients of d f θ from the η u v data these equations are given as follows 8 a 1 f c η u f c η η f c u u f c v v f 9 b 1 f c η v f c η η f c u u f c v v f 10 a 2 f c u u f c v v f c u u f c v v f 11 b 2 f 2 c u v f c u u f c v v f where c m n f is the cospectrum between the m th and n th wave properties the cospectrum is the real part of the complex cross power spectrum note also that the cross power spectrum of two identical wave properties has no imaginary part therefore it was identical to the cospectrum of these two wave properties namely 12 φ m m f c m m f 2 4 directional wave spectra obtained from e n η data riedel and healey 2005 indicated that by using the e n η data the fourier coefficients of d f θ could be determined as follows 13 a 1 f im φ e η f φ η η f φ e e f φ n n f 14 b 1 f im φ n η f φ η η f φ e e f φ n n f 15 a 2 f φ e e f φ n n f φ e e f φ n n f 16 b 2 f 2 re φ e n f φ e e f φ n n f where im and re denote the imaginary and real parts of the cross power spectrum respectively riedel and healey 2005 also indicated that these coefficients had been incorporated in the datawell directional waverider to determine the directional wave spectrum the 3d displacements are obtained by integrating the 3d accelerations measured by the buoy in this study the 3d displacements were measured directly by the gnss buoy as mentioned earlier the cross power spectrum of two identical wave properties has no imaginary part based on eq 12 eqs 13 16 can be rewritten as follows 17 a 1 f im φ e η f c η η f c e e f c n n f 18 b 1 f im φ n η f c η η f c e e f c n n f 19 a 2 f c e e f c n n f c e e f c n n f 20 b 2 f 2 re φ e n f c e e f c n n f 2 5 directional wave spectra obtained from u v w data riedel and healey 2005 also provided equations for determining the fourier coefficients of d f θ from the u v w data measured by a tri directional current meter their equations were modified as follows 21 a 1 f im φ w u f c w w f c u u f c v v f 22 b 1 f im φ w v f c w w f c u u f c v v f 23 a 2 f c u u f c v v f c u u f c v v f 24 b 2 f 2 re φ u v f c u u f c v v f in this study the displacement and velocity are measured by the gnss buoy fast fourier transform fft was applied to determine the cospectrum the real part of cross power spectrum and the quadrature spectrum the imaginary part of the cross power spectrum for any pair of wave properties such as u v and w the obtained cross power spectra were then used to determine the fourier coefficients of the directional spreading function d f θ such as eqs 8 11 for the η u v data eqs 17 20 for the e n η data and eqs 21 24 for the u v w data 2 6 weighted fourier series method longuet higgins et al 1963 calculated the directional spectrum of ocean waves by using the floating buoy motions including the water surface elevations and slopes in the east and north directions the authors indicated that the dsf might be negative and therefore proposed the weighting coefficients to correct the dsf the weighted fourier coefficients were expressed as follows 25 a 1 f 2 3 a 1 f 26 b 1 f 2 3 b 1 f 27 a 2 f 1 6 a 2 f 28 b 2 f 1 6 b 2 f here we adopt above weighted fourier coefficients to determine the directional spreading functions by using the η u v e n η and u v w data measured by the gnss buoy accordingly eq 7 can be rewritten as follows 29 d f θ 1 π 1 2 n 1 2 a n f cos n θ b n f sin n θ longuet higgins et al 1963 also indicated that the weighted fourier coefficients would extend the width of the dsf accordingly the values of the dsf thus obtained would be larger than those obtained using non weighted fourier coefficients 2 7 mean wave direction and directional spreading to determine the directional characteristics of ocean waves two parameters were also often used namely the mean wave direction and directional spreading the mean wave direction represents the average propagation direction of ocean waves whereas the directional spreading is a measure of the directional spreading of wave energy according to kuik et al 1988 the mean wave direction θ m f and the directional spreading σ θ f could be expressed in terms of the first order fourier coefficients as follows 30 θ m f tan 1 b 1 f a 1 f 31 σ θ f 2 1 a 1 f cos θ m f b 1 f sin θ m f notably both the mean wave direction and directional spreading are functions of the frequency however here the mean wave direction and directional spreading denote their values at the peak frequency the peak frequency denotes the frequency of waves with the maximum power spectral density in the 1d wave spectrum 3 results and discussion this study applied the weighted fourier series wfs method proposed by longuet higgins et al 1963 to investigate variations in directional wave parameters by using the η u v e n η and u v w data obtained from the gnss buoy deployed in the small liu qiu waters taiwan the outlook and location of the small liu qiu buoy are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively the investigated directional wave parameters included the mean wave direction directional spreading directional wave spectrum and dwd the field data were collected in 2016 from 10 15 00 00 this notation refers to month day hour hereafter to 10 30 23 00 however only hourly data with pged 1 0 were used to determine the wave parameters 3 1 sea states during the field test period of gnss buoy to provide more information to understand the temporal variations in directional wave parameters the significant wave heights h s in the small liu qiu waters during the field test period were analyzed fig 3 fig 3 displays the hourly time series data of the significant wave height obtained using the gnss buoy and atc sensor data the atc sensor was installed on the buoy to provide additional wave data to be compared with those obtained from the gnss receiver the atc sensor measurements were conducted on an hourly basis each measurement was conducted for a duration of 10 min and at a sampling rate of 1 hz lin et al 2017a listed the detailed specifications of the atc sensor used in this study the significant wave height was calculated from the one dimensional 1d wave spectrum as follows 32 h s 4 m 0 33 m 0 0 s f d f where m 0 denotes the zero th moment of the 1d wave spectrum and s f is the spectral density at frequency f h s values obtained from the atc sensor were calculated from the power spectral density of water surface elevation η based on the method proposed by earle 1996 for a gnss buoy s f which equals c η η f was calculated after the water surface elevations were obtained and the h s values were then determined using eqs 32 and 33 because only hourly gnss data with a pged value of 1 0 were used to determine the wave data no h s values were obtained from the gnss buoy for some hours fig 3 reveals that the h s values obtained from the gnss buoy are mostly in close agreement with those obtained from the atc sensor furthermore a detailed analysis of 159 h s data samples obtained from both the gnss buoy and atc sensor revealed that the mean absolute error between the two data sets was 2 9 cm fig 3 reveals that the missing h s values from the gnss buoy data mainly corresponded to the hours with heavy winds and waves the gprs connection dropout during severe weather conditions may restrict the number of ged and make the hourly pged value less than 1 0 consequently no h s values would be obtained from the gnss buoy this situation poses a serious operational problem when the gnss buoy based on vbs rtk positioning is used for ocean monitoring a typhoon occurred near taiwan during the field test period thus large wave heights were measured fig 4 illustrates the track of typhoon haima and fig 3 reveals that the h s values exceeded 2 0 m from 10 20 06 00 to 10 22 11 00 and exceeded 4 0 m from 10 20 23 00 to 10 21 11 00 because typhoon haima was then closest to taiwan by contrast during the period from 10 24 11 00 to 10 29 11 00 2016 the small liu qiu waters were smooth with h s values less than 0 4 m in this study the words used to describe the sea states match the wmo world meteorological organization terminology for sea states 3 2 mean wave direction fig 5 a displays the hourly time series data of mean wave direction and their differences obtained using the η u v and e n η data the angles were measured clockwise from the north fig 5 b presents the corresponding results obtained using the u v w and η u v data fig 5 b reveals that the differences in the mean wave direction obtained using the u v w and η u v data ranged between 8 and 11 for diverse wave heights fig 5 a shows that from 10 17 11 00 to 10 23 06 00 the differences in the mean wave directions obtained from the e n η and η u v data are quite small and become large from 10 23 06 00 to 10 30 23 00 comparing to fig 3 it can be noted that the former period corresponds to moderate and higher sea conditions with h s 1 0 m whereas the latter period corresponds to smooth to slight sea conditions with h s 1 0 m the maximum angular difference in the mean wave direction obtained using e n η and η u v data was 156 o or 204 o when the angles were measured clockwise and it occurred at 10 26 00 00 2016 at this time the measured h s was as low as 0 37 m indicating a smooth sea state and the obtained mean wave directions were 138 o 342 o and 146 o by using the η u v e n η and u v w data respectively the mean wave direction determined from the e n η data was close to that determined using two other data sets except under calm sea states the reasons for this difference are discussed in sections 3 4 and 3 6 3 3 directional spreading the hourly time series data of directional spreading and their differences obtained from the η u v and e n η data are displayed in fig 6 a whereas the corresponding results obtained from the u v w and η u v data are presented in fig 6 b comparing fig 6 a and 6 b reveals that from 10 17 11 00 to 10 23 06 00 the differences in directional spreading obtained from the η u v and e n η data were close to those obtained from the η u v and u v w data however the differences become larger from 10 23 06 00 to 10 30 23 00 the former period corresponds to sea states with h s 1 0 m whereas the latter period corresponds to sea states with h s 1 0 m fig 6 b reveals that the directional spreading values obtained using the u v w and η u v data differ slightly for diverse wave heights except that occurred at 10 21 13 00 2016 the angular difference was 9 o 3 4 directional wave spectrum directional wave spectra calculated using the e n η and η u v data collected from 10 25 21 00 to 10 26 02 00 26 10 are shown in the left and right sides of fig 7 respectively during this period the h s values were 1 m the azimuth of the circular plot illustrates the direction from which ocean waves came the angles 0 o 90 o 180 o and 270 o indicate the north east south and west directions respectively the radial direction indicates the wave frequency in hertz furthermore the peak frequency and the dwd are also shown in the upper left corner of each figure the dwd is identified as the direction where the maximum power spectral density unit m2 hz rad occurs the color bar indicates the strength of the power spectral density notably from fig 7 that the directional wave spectra determined using the e n η data are similar to those determined using the η u v data except those obtained at 10 26 00 00 during the observation period as depicted in fig 7 the ocean wave mainly originated from the south semicircle except for that determined using the e n η data at 10 26 00 00 comparison with the atc data see section 3 6 indicates that the e n η results are likely wrong furthermore at this particular time the peak wave energy obtained from the e n η data originated from the nw direction despite the wind originating from the south thus the directional wave spectrum obtained at 10 26 00 00 by using the e n η data is unreasonable the possible reasons that caused this inaccuracy are discussed in section 3 6 fig 3 shows that from 10 18 00 00 to 10 23 04 00 the h s values in the small liu qiu waters were larger than 1 m fig 8 compares some of the directional wave spectra determined by using the η u v e n η and u v w data from 06 00 to 11 00 on october 21 2016 during this period the typhoon haima was close to taiwan hence the h s exceeded 6 0 m notably as shown in fig 8 the directional wave spectra obtained from the η u v e n η and u v w data were mainly identical furthermore all the waves with peak energy were from the southwest direction and the peak frequencies were very low 0 0859 hz or 0 0957 hz probably because of the typhoon induced swell notably from figs 2 and 4 that the typhoon haima was in the west southwest direction of the small liu qiu buoy on october 21 2016 the results shown in figs 7 and 8 reveal that at small seas the directional wave spectra obtained from the e n η data differ from those obtained using the η u v data however at high seas the directional wave spectra obtained using three data combinations were identical 3 5 dwd dominant wave direction fig 9 a shows the hourly time series of the dwd and their differences determined using the η u v and e n η data collected by the gnss buoy from 10 15 00 00 to 10 30 23 00 2016 whereas fig 9 b displays the corresponding results obtained using the u v w and η u v data the dwd is the direction from which an ocean wave with peak energy comes and the angle is measured clockwise from the north notably from fig 9 that the differences in the dwd obtained using the u v w and η u v data were primarily in the 1 25 o range 90 7 whereas those obtained using the e n η and η u v data were primarily in the 30 o range 93 2 indicating that the dwds obtained using the u v w and η u v combinations of gnss buoy data were mostly identical however as shown in fig 9 a we noted that the maximum difference in the dwd between the e n η and η u v data was 169 o which occurred at 10 26 00 00 and was the same as the time when the maximum difference in the mean wave direction obtained using the e n η and η u v data occurred the dominant wave direction determined from the e n η data was apparently different from those determined using two other data sets reasons for this difference are discussed in section 3 6 both the mean wave direction and dwd are widely adopted to indicate the wave directions as mentioned the mean wave direction represents the average propagation direction of ocean waves whereas the dwd denotes the wave direction where the maximum power spectral density occurred in the 2d wave spectrum the difference between them could be noteworthy the histogram of the differences between the mean wave direction and dwd produced using the η u v data is plotted in fig 10 according to this figure 85 7 of the difference was in the 15 o range indicating that mostly two wave directions are very close to each other however the maximum difference is 102 o which occurred at 10 27 00 00 the h s measured by the gnss buoy at this time was small i e 0 43 m the shapes of histogram obtained using the e n η and u v w data are very similar to that obtained from the η u v data 82 6 and 85 6 of the differences determined using the e n η and u v w data respectively were in the 15 o range for brevity these data are not shown herein 3 6 discussions on mean wave directions and directional wave spectrum to clarify the reasons that the mean wave direction and directional wave spectrum obtained from the e n η at 10 26 00 00 considerably differed from those obtained using the η u v and u v w data the time series data of displacements in both east and north directions obtained by the gnss buoy at this time are plotted in fig 11 there are both low and high frequency oscillations during the 10 min measuring period the high frequency parts should be due to the ocean waves whereas the low frequency portions with periods of approximately 90 s may represent the infragravity waves which have a typical period of 25 250 s munk 1950 the capture of these low frequency signals in the e n η gnss solutions suggests that these data potentially have additional value for investigating infragravity waves because we are mainly interested in the ocean waves in the data analysis the signals with frequencies of 0 4 or 0 05 hz are filtered out however the directional wave spectrum obtained after filtering out the signals in undesired frequency ranges was nearly the same as that obtained from the original signals thus the extraordinarily low and high frequency movements did not lead to inaccurate directional wave parameters results because the h s at 10 26 00 00 was only 0 37 m we examined the signal to noise ratio snr of the items measured by the gnss buoy the snr of the measured signals is defined as follows 34 snr σ m σ a where σ m and σ a indicate the standard deviation of measured signals and noise signals respectively σ a specifies the accuracy of the measurements and their values for various measuring items are declared by the vbs rtk positioning service used in this study the values of σ a for the displacements and velocities in the east north and upward directions measured by the gnss buoy are also presented in table 1 as shown in table 1 the root mean square accuracies of the displacements and velocities are approximately 0 05 m and 0 017 m s respectively table 1 lists the snrs of displacements e n η and velocities u v w measured by the gnss buoy at 00 00 on october 26 2016 notably from table 1 that the snrs of displacements were approximately one order of magnitude smaller than those of velocities indicating that the better method for determining the directional wave parameters should be using the u v w data rather than the e n η data table 2 presents the mean and maximum absolute deviations of the mean wave direction obtained from the e n η data the deviation is determined by subtracting the mean wave direction obtained using the e n η data from that obtained using the u v w data the data analyzed here were collected from the field test from 10 15 00 00 to 10 30 23 00 2016 with pged 1 00 the minimum snr denotes the smallest snr value among the samples the number of samples corresponds to various h s values notably as shown in table 2 the mean and maximum absolute deviations decreased considerably as the h s increased the mean absolute deviation was 4 8 o when h s 0 4 m it reached 12 0 o when h s 0 4 m and decreased to 1 6 o when h s 2 0 m the maximum absolute deviation was 61 o when h s 0 4 m it reached 196 when h s 0 4 m and decreased to 4 o when h s 2 0 m furthermore when h s 1 0 m the mean wave directions obtained using the e n η data were nearly identical to those obtained using the u v w data notably the mean and maximum absolute deviations of the mean wave direction decreased as the minimum snr of displacements increased and the minimum snr of displacements increased with the increase in the h s possible reasons why the small snrs of the e n η data tended to produce inaccurate directional wave parameters are the following in this study once the displacement and velocity data were obtained from the gnss buoy fft was used to determine the cospectrum and quadrature spectrum for any pair of wave properties the obtained cross power spectra were then used to determine the fourier coefficients of the dsf d f θ signals with small snrs were contaminated with considerable noises these noises produced inaccurate cross power spectra which led to inaccurate fourier coefficients this then generated errors in the directional wave parameters the mismatch in the directional wave parameters during low seas that we attributed to the poor performance of the e n η data was further confirmed by comparing the directional wave parameters obtained using the gnss buoy data either e n η or u v w with the parameters obtained using the atc sensor data under smooth sea conditions with h s 0 4 m a comparison of 37 hourly mean wave directions obtained from the gnss buoy and atc sensor data revealed that the mean error declined from 9 5 o to 2 1 o when u v w data were used instead of e n η data the error was calculated by subtracting the value obtained using the atc sensor data from that obtained using the gnss buoy data similarly the mean error of the dwd decreased from 7 5 o to 4 9 o when u v w data were used instead of e n η data the results obtained in this study show that when h s 1 0 m the directional wave parameters determined from any of the three gnss data sets namely e n η u v w and η u v agreed well with each other therefore any of these data sets is appropriate for determining the directional wave parameters under these ocean conditions however when h s 1 0 m the u v w and η u v data are more appropriate than the e n η data for determining the directional wave parameters the aforementioned findings as summarized in conclusions 1 and 2 provide useful information for choosing appropriate gnss data for determining directional wave parameters conclusion 3 suggests that examining the snrs of the measured data under various sea states is a possible method of surveying intrinsic uncertainties in measured data used for determining directional wave parameters these findings suggest also that wave related observations such as water surface elevation pressure acceleration tilt and velocity can be combined to obtain directional wave parameters however for choosing appropriate data combination intrinsic uncertainties in measured data must be examined 3 7 limitations using a gnss buoy based on vbs rtk positioning for ocean monitoring as mentioned in section 2 1 the data transmission between the gnss receiver on the buoy and the vbs rtk control center is conducted using a gprs modem the deployment range of the gnss buoy is limited by network coverage because the gprs modem requires a network signal for data transmission the range usually within a few kilometers can be extended to a maximum distance of 20 km if ppk post processed kinematic is used instead of the vbs rtk positioning arroyo suarez et al 2006 nevertheless ppk is not obtained in real time el mowafy et al 2017 indicated that precise point positioning ppp technology can provide decimeter level positioning accuracy by using a single receiver without a base station thus ppp technology can be utilized anywhere several real time open access commercial services are available for ppp positioning such as igs rts the trimble rtx service leandro et al 2011 the fugro g2 service http www starfix com positioning systems and terrastar https www terrastar net therefore the range limitation of the gnss buoy can be alleviated if the global real time ppp rt ppp service is used instead of vbs rtk positioning the accuracy of ppp technology can be improved to the centimeter level if satellite based augmentation systems sbas are implemented choy et al 2017 some commercial gnss augmentation service providers such as novatel with terrastar c corrections https www novatel com products terrastar gnss corrections contenttab1 offer both horizontal and vertical centimeter level positioning solutions for land and airborne applications in addition to the deployment range limitation the gprs connection dropout under severe weather conditions may influence the number of observed data with pged 1 0 in this case a gnss buoy provides less reliable ocean monitoring data compared with a conventional atc sensor fig 3 moreover as demonstrated in sections 3 2 to 3 6 under smooth to slight sea conditions with h s 1 0 m only the u v w and η u v gnss data are recommended for use in determining the directional wave parameters 4 conclusions this study applied the wfs method proposed by longuet higgin et al 1963 to investigate the variations in the directional wave parameters by utilizing three combinations of time series data obtained by the gnss buoy such as η u v e n η and u v w the data that analyzed in this study were collected from the field test by deploying the gnss buoy developed by lin et al 2017a in the small liu qiu waters taiwan only hourly data whose pged 1 0 are utilized to determine the directional wave parameters including the mean wave direction directional spreading directional wave spectrum and dominant wave direction based on the present results we may conclude the following 1 in moderate and higher sea conditions when h s 1 0 m the directional wave parameters determined from any of the three gnss data sets namely e n η u v w and η u v agreed well with each other 2 under smooth to slight sea conditions with h s 1 0 m the u v w and η u v data generate more accurate directional wave parameters than the e n η data accordingly when h s 1 0 m only the u v w and η u v data are recommended for use for determining the directional wave parameters 3 the less accurate directional wave parameters obtained from the e n η data were associated with smaller snr values of the displacement data e n η compared with those of the velocity data u v w the snr values of the e n η data increased with h s 4 during the field tests the maximum difference in the dominant wave direction and the maximum difference in the mean wave direction between the e n η and η u v data occurred at the same time when the h s was only 0 37 m credit authorship contribution statement yen pin
