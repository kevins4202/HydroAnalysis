910,ocean surges cause seawater inundation of coastal inland areas subsequently seawater infiltrates into coastal aquifers and threatens the fresh groundwater resource the severity of resulting salinization can be affected by hydrogeological factors including aquifer properties and hydrologic conditions however little research has been done to assess these effects to understand the impacts of hydrogeological factors on groundwater salinization we numerically simulated an ocean surge inundation event on a two dimensional conceptual coastal aquifer using a coupled surface subsurface approach we varied model permeability including anisotropy inland hydraulic gradient and recharge rate three salinization assessment indicators were developed based on flushing time depth of salt penetration and a combination of the two weighted flushing time with which the impact of hydrogeological factors on groundwater vulnerability to salinization were quantitatively assessed the vulnerability of coastal aquifers increases with increasing isotropic permeability low horizontal permeability kx and high vertical permeability kz lead to high aquifer vulnerability and high kx and low kz lead to low aquifer vulnerability vulnerability decreases with increasing groundwater hydraulic gradient and increasing recharge rate additionally coastal aquifers with a low recharge rate r 300 mm yr 1 may be highly vulnerable to ocean surge inundation this study shows how the newly introduced indicators can be used to quantitatively assess coastal aquifer vulnerability the results are important for global vulnerability assessment of coastal aquifers to ocean surge inundation keywords ocean surge coastal aquifer salinization hydrogeological characteristics 1 introduction fresh groundwater along densely populated coastlines is an important source of water for agricultural domestic and industrial purposes however it is vulnerable to salinization caused by seawater intrusion swi either laterally due to sea level rise or vertically from land surface due to ocean surge inundation ocean surges are a common feature of coastal areas around the globe werner et al 2012 and it is reported that the ocean surge frequency and intensity will increase due to climate change ipcc et al 2007 therefore it is urgent to understand the response of coastal aquifer resources to ocean surge inundation that potentially leads to the salinization of freshwater resources ocean surges cause seawater inundation if the waves or floodwaters are high enough to run up and pass over the coastal defense structures eurotop 2007 subsequently the seawater infiltrates into the coastal aquifer and percolates into the fresh groundwater fig 1 anderson and lauer 2008 giambastiani et al 2017 illangasekare et al 2007 kooi et al 2000 post and houben 2017 terry and falkland 2010 violette et al 2009 yang et al 2013 natural remediation occurs by seaward transport and discharge of salt as well as dilution by rainwater chui and terry 2011 these processes are impacted by the physical characteristics of coastal aquifers i topography of the land surface which has been assessed in a parallel study by yu et al 2016 and ii hydrogeological factors of the subsurface which are the focus of the present study hydrogeological factors impact salinization and the natural remediation process bailey 2015 holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2013 a number of studies have investigated the effect of seawater inundation on subsurface processes in coastal aquifers chui and terry 2011 simulated a 3 h ocean surge inundation event on an atoll island in the tropical pacific ocean they showed that salinization occurred immediately after seawater reached inland and recovery lasted 2 months yang et al 2015a investigated the impact of ocean surge induced seawater inundation during a partial dyke failure in bremerhaven germany they showed that the salinized part of the shallow aquifer shifted up to several kilometers landward however the deeper aquifer was not significantly salinized because the downward movement of the salt plume was inhibited by a low permeability unit at the aquifer top they also showed that salinization persisted in the shallow aquifer for as long as 20 years more recently gingerich et al 2017 numerically investigated the effects of recharge on the recovery of the freshwater lens of roi namur island central pacific ocean after an ocean surge inundation they concluded that artificial recharge can significantly shorten the recovery time those studies were performed for specific aquifers in which the parameters aquifer property and hydrologic conditions were fixed such that hydrogeological factor variations were not assessed some studies have investigated the effects of hydrogeological factors on salinization caused by ocean surge inundation using either physical or numerical models vithanage et al 2012 used laboratory scale sand tank experiments to study the effects of aquifer heterogeneity and freshwater recharge on salinization during a seawater inundation event they showed that the migration path of the salt plume and recovery time are significantly influenced by the nature of aquifer heterogeneity and that higher freshwater recharge either due to precipitation or by artificial means results in rapid recovery they also concluded that the flushing time was controlled primarily by the flow rate in the sand tank however they did not study the effects of parameter variations such as permeability distribution isotropic or anisotropic and they did not use typical field values of parameters to mimic coastal aquifer due to the limitation to laboratory scale experiments zamrsky et al 2014 numerically investigated the influence of variable hydrogeological factors recharge inland hydraulic head and permeability on salinization during tsunamic inundation using a conceptual two dimensional 2d coastal aquifer of 5 km length and 50 m depth anisotropy in permeability was not considered they concluded that high permeability increases the flushing of infiltrated seawater and a larger freshwater flux from inland reduces the depth of salinization in the aquifer however they did not simulate the dynamic process of inundation but instead used a constant head over the inundation zone for a short duration further they assumed that a part of the upper aquifer 2 km length 1 m thickness was uniformly filled with seawater in every scenario immediately after the retreat of the tsunamic inundation which neglects variation in the volume of seawater that infiltrates due to different hydrogeological factors holding and allen 2015 evaluated the freshwater lens response and recovery to a theoretical ocean surge events for small islands of various types using a fully coupled surface subsurface numerical model they concluded that the degree of aquifer salinization was largely determined by the thickness of the unsaturated zone the recovery time for the freshwater lens ranged from 1 to 19 years for the different island types significantly affected by recharge rate a similar study was performed by bailey 2015 for atoll islands in the western pacific indicating that 4 12 months were required to recover 60 of the freshwater lens depending on the island type these studies were based on the simulation results for different types of island demonstrating the cumulative impact of the island size and hydrogeological factors such as permeability porosity recharge rate and hydraulic gradient they focused on islands and were limited to the small island scale 1 km with relatively fast flushing of salt comparing with coastal aquifers that may be inundated kilometers landward during ocean surge e g coastal aquifer in florida during hurricane ivan in 2004 sheng et al 2010 it is still necessary to perform studies which quantitatively investigate effects of a single factor on groundwater salinization excluding effects from other hydrogeological factors in coastal aquifer of larger scale in the present study we focus on salinization caused by infiltration of seawater from the surface during an ocean surge inundation event we used a fully coupled surface subsurface approach to numerically assess the impact of hydrogeological factors on groundwater salinization and flushing we simulate the dynamic inundation process with surface flow flooding and retreat such that the location amount of infiltrated seawater depends on the hydrogeological factors the objectives were to i numerically simulate the ocean surge inundation on a 2d coastal aquifer with variable typical hydrogeological factors such as permeability hydraulic gradient and recharge rate ii develop indicators to quantify the severity of salinization and iii assess the impact of hydrogeological factors on the salinization using the developed indicators the results are potentially important for global vulnerability assessment of coastal aquifers to ocean surge inundation 2 mathematical model 2 1 hydrogeosphere hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 is a 3d numerical model that simulates fully coupled surface subsurface variably saturated variable density flow and advective dispersive diffusive solute transport therrien et al 2010 it solves richards equation and uses darcy s law to simulate variably saturated variable density flow in the subsurface domain and solves manning s equation and the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equation for flow in the 2d surface domain solute transport is simulated with the advection dispersion diffusion equation in both domains manning 1891 vanderkwaak 1999 yang et al 2013 hydrogeosphere uses a dual node approach to numerically couple the surface and subsurface domains assuming that the surface and subsurface domains are separated by a thin porous layer with a thickness equal to the coupling length water and solute exchange fluxes are implicitly calculated between the domains hydrogeosphere has been used to investigate ocean surge inundation of coastal aquifers because of its feature of surface subsurface coupling holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2013 2015a 2015b the governing equations can be found elsewhere therrien et al 2010 yang et al 2013 and are not repeated here 2 2 conceptual model a 2d vertically oriented cross section of a coastal aquifer fig 2 a was used as the model domain the domain has a length of 4500 m which is divided into two parts by the shoreline at x 500 m the seaside part 0 m x 500 m extends to an elevation of 5 m at point ao into the sea and is submerged by seawater prior to the ocean surge the landside part 500 m x 4500 m extends to an elevation of 4 m at point co with a constant land slope of 1 1000 representing the land surface the horizontal aquifer bottom is 30 m the vertical cross sectional aquifer was discretized into 2700 3d block elements of unit length in the y direction fig 2 a the blocks had a constant cell size of 25 m in x direction and variable cell sizes in z direction ranging from 0 15 m near the aquifer top to 3 8 m near the aquifer bottom to better represent the unsaturated zone similarly the 1d surface domain aoco in fig 2 a was discretized into 180 rectangles corresponding to the uppermost mesh on the subsurface domain a grid convergence study was performed by yu et al 2016 who used similar domain sizes in x and z directions so that the resolution used in present study is able to capture the surface and subsurface processes an adaptive time stepping scheme was used where the time step size adapted to the maximum changes of variables head 1 m relative concentration 0 05 saturation 0 05 during a time step therrien et al 2010 this strategy ensures numerical stability and efficiency of the simulations hirthe and graf 2012 therrien et al 2010 homogeneous aquifer properties were considered isotropic or anisotropic permeability values kx and kz were selected and assigned to the entire subsurface domain described in section 2 3 the surface domain was assigned values of the manning roughness coefficient n tl 1 3 manning 1891 n 10 7 day m 1 3 for the seaside part 0 m x 500 m and n 8 10 7 day m 1 3 for the landside part 500 m x 4500 m chow 1959 yang et al 2013 freshwater was assigned a density ρ 0 of 1000 kg m 3 and a tds concentration of 0 g l 1 seawater was assigned a density ρs of 1025 5 kg m 3 yu et al 2016 and a tds concentration of 34 2 g l 1 millero et al 1980 the density of water with tds concentration between 0 and 34 2 g l 1 was calculated using an isothermal linear density concentration relationship therrien et al 2010 viscosity was considered to be independent from tds concentration other parameters were selected uniformly for the simulated domain according to typical literature values gelhar et al 1992 therrien et al 2010 yang et al 2013 and are listed in table 1 an ocean surge event that lasted for 8 hours with a maximum surge height of 3 88 m yang et al 2015a was simulated fig 2 b shows the surge height variation curve 2 2 1 boundary conditions of the subsurface the flow and transport boundary conditions used are shown in fig 2 a for the subsurface domain a time variable fresh water head hf was applied to the seaside boundary ab yang et al 2013 1 h f surge height t z ρ s ρ 0 z where z l is nodal elevation a constant concentration of seawater 34 2 g l 1 was applied to boundary ab for the inland boundary cd constant fluxes constant in time but variable in space were assigned to the faces along cd the constant fluxes were calculated by running a steady state model prior to ocean surge using a constant fresh water head hinland on the landside boundary cd therefore the constant flux boundary condition is equivalent to the constant head boundary condition of hinland the reason for using constant fluxes instead of constant head is that the hydraulic head on the landside boundary cd would increase during an ocean surge event a range of hinland values were selected described in section 2 3 a constant concentration of freshwater 0 g l 1 was assigned to the landside boundary cd all other boundaries of the subsurface are set to be impermeable to flow and zero flux for transport note that there are water and salt exchange fluxes between surface and subsurface domains through top boundary ac 2 2 2 boundary conditions of the surface a time variable water depth d was applied to the surface domain at ao fig 2a calculated according to the surge height yang et al 2013 2 d surge height t z a o where z a o l is the nodal elevation of ao a constant concentration of seawater 34 2 g l 1 was applied to ao the constant recharge rate r was applied to the surface domain of the landside part 500 m x 4500 m which accounts for precipitation and evapotranspiration note that the applied recharge does not denote fully contribution to groundwater due to the possibility of groundwater surface exchange in the integral model recharge water was assumed to be fresh c 0 g l 1 a range of r values were selected producing several simulation scenarios that are described in section 2 3 2 2 3 base case the base case is defined as i permeability kx kz 10 11 m2 typical of isotropic fine sand ii the landside groundwater head hinland 2 m which approximately corresponds to a realistic groundwater head gradient of a coastal aquifer where ocean surge inundation potentially occurs and iii recharge rate r 300 mm yr 1 yu et al 2016 2 3 parameter variation scenarios three parameters were varied to investigate the impact of hydrogeological factors on groundwater salinization permeability including its anisotropy hydraulic gradient and recharge rate we selected these three parameters because they potentially affect the groundwater flow system by changing the groundwater flow either horizontally from inland to sea or vertically from the land surface through the unsaturated zone of the coastal aquifer yang et al 2015a 2015b 2 3 1 permeability the horizontal permeability kx and the vertical permeability kz ranged independently from 10 14 m2 silt to 10 10 m2 gravel michael et al 2013 by factor of 10 creating the 25 combinations of kx and kz listed in table 2 therefore both isotropic kx kz 1 and anisotropic kx kz 1 situations were investigated other parameters hinland and r were kept constant to the base as permeability varied 2 3 2 hydraulic gradient and recharge rate hydraulic gradient and recharge rate were varied independently three hinland values of 1 2 and 3 m were selected producing average hydraulic gradients of 1 4000 2 4000 and 3 4000 respectively the groundwater hydraulic gradient was constrained by the land surface slope in the simulations because i an unconfined aquifer with the constant land surface slope 4 4000 is considered and ii a gradient larger than the land surface slope leads to significant seepage of groundwater from the subsurface to the surface seven r values were selected ranging from 0 to 1500 mm yr 1 michael et al 2013 a total of 21 combinations of hydraulic gradient and recharge rate were generated listed in table 3 other parameters kx and kz were kept constant at the base case values when the hydraulic gradient and recharge rate were varied before running the ocean surge simulation a preliminary simulation to steady state was performed for each scenario where the surge height was kept constant at 0 m and where the constant head boundary hf hinland at cd fig 2 a was used the preliminary simulation supplied i the initial condition for the ocean surge simulation and ii the equivalent fluxes through the inland boundary cd which were used as boundary condition for the ocean surge simulation 2 4 groundwater salinization assessment indicators salinization at a specific point in a coastal aquifer is defined here to occur when the tds concentration is larger than 0 5 g l 1 which is the human drinking water standard epa 2009 the term recovery to initial state is defined here as the situation when the tds concentration at a specific point in a salinized aquifer drops below 0 5 g l 1 an aquifer can recover by i seaward flushing of salt by groundwater flow and ii dilution by fresh groundwater throughflow and precipitation recharge accordingly recovery to initial state does not denote true recovery to initial pre storm tds concentrations that may have been much lower than 0 5 g l 1 to quantify the severity of salinization caused by ocean surge inundation several indicators have previously been used the time required for the aquifer to completely or partially recover to its initial state after an ocean surge inundation is frequently used examples are salt exist time yang et al 2015b recovery time chui and terry 2011 flush out time vithanage et al 2012 travel time violette et al 2009 and characteristic time zamrsky et al 2014 zamrsky et al 2014 also used reach time representing the time required for the salt to reach a certain depth of the aquifer those indicators quantify the severity of salinization in time and therefore do not characterize the spatial distribution of salinization we therefore defined three groundwater salinization assessment indicators in time and space ft pd and ft w discussed below 2 4 1 spatially averaged flushing time ft in this study ft t is defined as the spatial average of the flushing time ft t which is the time duration from the starting of ocean surge inundation until recovery occurs at a specific point in the aquifer ft is therefore a spatially distributed indicator recovery does not occur in some parts of the aquifer i the part that was already salinized prior to ocean surge inundation fig 4 a and ii the part that is not salinized by the ocean surge inundation fig 4 f for those parts the ft does not exist the ft can be used to quantify the recovery time at specific locations of a coastal aquifer after ocean surge inundation where a large ft means that it will take a long time for the aquifer to recover to the initial state prior to ocean surge inundation and conversely a small ft represents fast recovery the defined ft here is same as the flushing time that was used by yu et al 2016 in despite of minor differences on the computation of it the spatially averaged flushing time ft of an aquifer can be calculated from the spatial ft distribution 3 ft i ft i v i v i where ft i t is the flushing time at node i vi l3 is the volume associated to node i and vi l3 is the total volume of the recovered aquifer the average flushing time ft quantifies the average recovery time of a coastal aquifer in a single number 2 4 2 spatially averaged penetration depth pd as a consequence of ocean surge inundation the shallow aquifer is contaminated first followed by the deeper part of the aquifer because seawater infiltrates into the subsurface and percolates downward into the aquifer the pd l is defined as the spatially averaged penetration depth pd l which is the depth of salinization below the inundation zone pd therefore varies over the inundated area of the surge due to salt plume fingering yang et al 2013 pd is calculated using 4 pd i pd i a i a i where ai l2 is the land surface area below which the penetration depth pd i l is reached and ai l2 is the total land surface area below which salinization occurs the pd is a global indicator that averages the depth of the position where salinization occurs a large pd value indicates that the salinization occurs deeper in the coastal aquifer below the inundation zone such that deeper groundwater resources are affected and conversely a small pd represents contamination of only shallow groundwater the defined pd can be easily converted into a total salinized volume which was used by yu et al 2016 by timing the area of influenced land we used pd in this study because of its advantage in indicating the depth of salinization 2 4 3 weighted flushing time ft w spatially averaged flushing time ft and penetration depth pd do not describe the severity of salinization in extreme cases independently for example in one case salinization may occur only in the shallow aquifer and may last for a very long time leading to large ft and small pd in another case salinization may reach deeper into the aquifer but may last only a short time leading to small ft and large pd it is hard to tell which case undergoes more severe salinization due to ocean surge inundation using either ft or pd independently therefore the weighted flushing time ft w t is defined here as a combination between ft and pd 5 ft w w ft 6 w pd d pd d 1 pd d where w is a weighting factor ranging from 0 to 1 describing the vulnerability of groundwater resources to salinization w 0 means not vulnerable w 1 means highly vulnerable d l is defined as a reference aquifer depth where groundwater resources can be significantly vulnerable to salinization d can be the aquifer depth where fresh groundwater supply is most productive or where pumping wells are screened in the present study we simply use the aquifer thickness 30 m for d a linear relationship between w and pd is assumed when pd d fig 3 indicating that groundwater resources are more vulnerable to deeper salinization however it is assumed that groundwater resources are significantly vulnerable w 1 to salinization deeper than d pd d regardless of the penetration depth pd ft w quantifies the vulnerability of coastal aquifer subject to ocean surge inundation considering both the time duration and the spatial extent of the salinization a large ft w represents high vulnerability of the coastal aquifer to ocean surge inundation and a small ft w means that the aquifer vulnerability is low 3 results and discussion the simulations were performed with an identical ocean surge inundation signal until recovery therefore the simulation periods varied depending on the scenario the maximum simulation period was 500 yr after the ocean surge inundation with the associated cpu time of approximately 2 h the response of the aquifer was dependent on the parameters for each scenario for the base case the simulated ocean surge delivered 187 175 m3 of seawater across the shoreline to the inland and 92 of this seawater flowed back to the sea over land within 24 h the remaining 8 of seawater infiltrated into the subsurface this value was in the range 2 12 for all simulated scenarios the simulated salinization process in the base case provides insights into the coupling between the surface and subsurface during an ocean surge fig 4 shows the simulated tds concentration distribution for the base case at different times the ocean surge inundated a length of 3450 m fig 4 a 500 m x 3950 m where surficial salinization occurred subsequent infiltration of seawater led to the development of a tds plume near the aquifer top fig 4 b the tds plume moved downward toward the aquifer bottom fig 4 c causing salinization c 0 5 g l 1 of the deeper parts of the aquifer natural remediation due to seaward groundwater flow and dilution by rainwater recharge led to recovery to initial state of the salinized aquifer zone such that the plume size was continuously reduced fig 4 d f the recovery of the aquifer lasted more than 20 yr fig 4 f also shows that a part of the aquifer was never salinized the values of the salinization assessment indicators associated with different scenarios are described in the following sections 3 1 effect of aquifer permeability ft pd and ft w were computed for each permeability combination fig 5 within the considered k range the pd is minimum for kx kz 10 14 m2 fig 5 a this indicates that aquifers with low kx and low kz are less affected by ocean surge inundation blue area in fig 5 a because salinization only reaches the shallow aquifer and does not reach the deeper aquifer the maximum pd occurs for kx kz 10 10 m2 which indicates that aquifers with high kx and high kz are more affected by salinization results of the average flushing time ft indicate that simulations with low kx and low kz red area in fig 5 b had a relatively long flushing time ft ranging from 25 yr to 70 yr which was simply due to small lateral groundwater flow velocities conversely high kx and low kz blue area had a relatively short flushing time ft ranging from 1 yr to 5 yr because of high lateral flow velocities in that case the aquifer was less affected by ocean surge inundation because of quick recovery the results of the permeability combination kx kz 10 14 m2 low pd of 1 9 m and large ft of 63 3 yr confirm that the penetration depth and the flushing time can be of limited value to quantify the severity of salinization independently such that it becomes necessary to use the weighted flushing time ft w aquifers with low kx and high kz red area in fig 5 c are highly vulnerable to ocean surge inundation with a large ft w of 14 8 yr kx 10 14 m2 kz 10 10 m2 table 2 and aquifers with high kx and low kz are less vulnerable to ocean surge inundation with a small ft w of 0 2 yr kx 10 11 m2 kz 10 14 m2 table 2 all ft w values are listed in table 2 three k combination cases are selected to discuss the general findings of fig 5 in more detail i isotropic kx kz variable ii anisotropic 1 kx 10 11 m2 variable kz and iii anisotropic 2 variable kx kz 10 11 m2 results of these combinations are shown in fig 6 and distributions of ft of all associated 15 cases are shown in fig 7 note that the ft distributions should not be interpreted as the salinity of groundwater however they indicate the spatial distribution of the salinization for the isotropic cases i fig 6 a c the pd and ft increases and decreases respectively when the permeability increases for higher permeability the salinization occurred deeper in the aquifer fig 7 a but recovery occurred faster while for lower permeability the salinization was limited to the shallower aquifer fig 7 e but persisted longer the opposite trends of pd and ft and the fact that ft w combines the two indicators leads to increased ft w for extreme k values and a ft w minimum for k 10 13 m2 fig 6 c for the anisotropic cases 1 fig 6 d f all three indicators generally increase when kz increases the patterns can also be easily observed by ft distributions in fig 7 f j a low kz led to shallow salinization and fast recovery of the aquifer because low kz inhibited seawater from infiltrating into the deep aquifer by reducing the vertical flow rates the smallest ft w occurred when kz 10 14 m2 fig 7 j the non monotonic nature of the indicator values with permeability e g fig 6 d f may be explained by a diversity in salt plume development and density fingering this can be seen for example in the ft distributions fig 7 f and g for the anisotropic cases 2 fig 6 g i pd and ft partly increases and decreases respectively when kx increases these opposite patterns result in the smallest ft w occurring for intermediate kx 10 11 m2 however the variation of ft with kx is not significant which is confirmed by similar ft distributions shown in fig 7 m o we also computed the 25 and 75 flushing time corresponding to the time when 25 and 75 of the salinized aquifer was recovered respectively fig 6 b e and h these results show that a long flushing time indicates high diversity of aquifer recovery in space while small flushing time indicates that the aquifer recovery is spatially more uniform 3 2 effect of hydraulic gradient and recharge rate pd ft and ft w were computed for each combination of inland head hinland and recharge rate r shown in fig 8 the pd was large for low r and low hinland fig 8 a red area while pd was small for high r and high hinland blue area large ft fig 8 b was found when r was low the ft w distribution fig 8 c shows that an aquifer with low r is highly vulnerable to ocean surge inundation with ft w was as large as 180 yr table 3 two combinations of hydraulic gradient and recharge rate are considered for discussion i hinland varies with a constant r of 300 mm yr 1 and ii r varies with a constant hinland of 2 m represented by the black and green dots in fig 8 respectively the indicator values are shown in fig 9 and distributions of ft of the associated 9 cases are shown in fig 10 pd ft and ft w decrease when hinland increases fig 9 a c indicating that an aquifer with higher hydraulic gradient is less vulnerable to ocean surge inundation this is confirmed by the flushing time ft distributions shown in fig 10a c these patterns indicate that hydraulic gradient has a positive effect on coastal aquifer vulnerability to ocean surge inundation pd ft and ft w also show decreasing patterns with increasing r fig 9 d f which is confirmed by the spatial distributions of ft fig 10 d i these patterns indicate that r has a positive effect on the aquifer vulnerability regarding ocean surge inundation moreover ft w became extremely sensitive to r for r 300 mm yr 1 which indicates that dry coastal aquifers can be extremely vulnerable to ocean surge inundation 3 3 limitations the cross comparison between aquifers with differing hydrogeological characteristics provides insights into the factors that are most important in determining the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to salinization from ocean surge inundation however this study is limited in scope in that it neglects other factors that may have important impacts on the salinization and flushing processes one example is land surface topography we considered only a constant slope in this study but the salinization assessment indicators are sensitive to surface morphology for example flushing times simulated by yu et al 2016 were up to 99 yr for aquifers with different surface morphology compared to 54 yr in an equivalent aquifer with constant slope the increase in flushing time is due to the ponding of seawater in surface depressions which increases the amount of infiltrated seawater we also neglected aquifer heterogeneity which has been shown to affect the migration of the salt plumes vithanage et al 2012 yang et al 2015a in aquifers the flushing time would increase when the salt transfers through a low permeability lens and an opening in a low permeability lens would cause more rapid flushing vithanage et al 2012 the flushing time would very likely decrease when preferential groundwater flow pathways such as macropores and fractures sebbena et al 2015 are present in an aquifer the effect of tidal fluctuations which cause extra salinized volume of the aquifer in the recirculating zone near the shoreline yang et al 2013 was also not considered in this study while the numerical model provides general insights there are some limitations in its applicability firstly the selecting of model parameters such as dispersivity can result in uncertainty in the computed indicators a sensitivity analysis was performed in regard to different αl values of 25 m used in this study 20 m 15 m 10 m and 5 m fig 11 the results show that the ft w decreased when the used αl was reduced from 25 m to 15 m however ft w increased when further reducing the αl value to 5 m these behavior is explained by the twofold effect of reducing the dispersivity on one hand it leads to smaller volume of salinized aquifer as dispersive transport of salt becomes weaker on the other hand it leads to reduced dilution of salt i e reduced natural remediation however using the αl of 25 m in this study is justified by the fact that changes of ft w in response to changes of αl are not significant compared to the total scale of ft w computed in this study 0 180 yr secondly we considered only a 2d aquifer with constant aquifer thickness this may cause underestimation of penetration depths because salt plumes cannot penetrate deeper than the aquifer bottom this cut off effect of the bottom boundary can also result in uncertainty in computing average flushing time additionally the 2d model assumes that groundwater flows only from land to sea ignoring the alongshore transport of salt that may naturally occur lastly the density fingering process differs between 2d and 3d systems knorr et al 2016 and when heterogeneities are present simmons et al 2001 such that salt penetration rates and extent may occur differently in natural systems 4 summary and conclusions in this study we numerically simulated ocean surge inundation on a 2d vertically oriented coastal aquifer under the influence of differing hydrogeological factors i permeability ii hydraulic gradient and iii recharge rate a new contribution of this study is the development of three indicators to quantify the severity of salinization induced by ocean surge inundation spatially averaged flushing time ft spatially averaged penetration depth pd and weighted flushing time ft w the impact of hydrogeological factors on salinization using the developed indicators was assessed the main key contributions of the present study are 1 applicability of the newly developed indicators to assess coastal aquifer vulnerability it is demonstrated how these indicators can be applied to a synthetic coastal aquifer clearly these indicators can be applied to any real coastal aquifer on the base of a numerical model 2 effect of permeability the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to ocean surge inundation increases with increasing isotropic permeability anisotropy of the permeability field has two effects low horizontal permeability and high vertical permeability lead to high aquifer vulnerability quantified by the weighted flushing time ft w of as large as 15 yr conversely high horizontal permeability and low vertical permeability lead to low aquifer vulnerability quantified by the weighted flushing time ft w of as small as 0 2 yr 3 effect of hydraulic gradient and recharge rate the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to ocean surge inundation decreases with increasing groundwater hydraulic gradient and increasing recharge rate coastal aquifers with low recharge rate r 300 mm yr 1 can be extremely vulnerable to ocean surge inundation quantified by the weighted flushing time ft w of as large as 180 yr this study quantitatively investigates the effect of hydrogeological factors on salinization caused by ocean surge inundation the key findings are useful for global vulnerability assessment of coastal aquifers subject and help to identify coastal areas that are at risk of groundwater salinization acknowledgements

swi either laterally due to sea level rise or vertically from land surface due to ocean surge inundation ocean surges are a common feature of coastal areas around the globe werner et al 2012 and it is reported that the ocean surge frequency and intensity will increase due to climate change ipcc et al 2007 therefore it is urgent to understand the response of coastal aquifer resources to ocean surge inundation that potentially leads to the salinization of freshwater resources ocean surges cause seawater inundation if the waves or floodwaters are high enough to run up and pass over the coastal defense structures eurotop 2007 subsequently the seawater infiltrates into the coastal aquifer and percolates into the fresh groundwater fig 1 anderson and lauer 2008 giambastiani et al 2017 illangasekare et al 2007 kooi et al 2000 post and houben 2017 terry and falkland 2010 violette et al 2009 yang et al 2013 natural remediation occurs by seaward transport and discharge of salt as well as dilution by rainwater chui and terry 2011 these processes are impacted by the physical characteristics of coastal aquifers i topography of the land surface which has been assessed in a parallel study by yu et al 2016 and ii hydrogeological factors of the subsurface which are the focus of the present study hydrogeological factors impact salinization and the natural remediation process bailey 2015 holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2013 a number of studies have investigated the effect of seawater inundation on subsurface processes in coastal aquifers chui and terry 2011 simulated a 3 h ocean surge inundation event on an atoll island in the tropical pacific ocean they showed that salinization occurred immediately after seawater reached inland and recovery lasted 2 months yang et al 2015a investigated the impact of ocean surge induced seawater inundation during a partial dyke failure in bremerhaven germany they showed that the salinized part of the shallow aquifer shifted up to several kilometers landward however the deeper aquifer was not significantly salinized because the downward movement of the salt plume was inhibited by a low permeability unit at the aquifer top they also showed that salinization persisted in the shallow aquifer for as long as 20 years more recently gingerich et al 2017 numerically investigated the effects of recharge on the recovery of the freshwater lens of roi namur island central pacific ocean after an ocean surge inundation they concluded that artificial recharge can significantly shorten the recovery time those studies were performed for specific aquifers in which the parameters aquifer property and hydrologic conditions were fixed such that hydrogeological factor variations were not assessed some studies have investigated the effects of hydrogeological factors on salinization caused by ocean surge inundation using either physical or numerical models vithanage et al 2012 used laboratory scale sand tank experiments to study the effects of aquifer heterogeneity and freshwater recharge on salinization during a seawater inundation event they showed that the migration path of the salt plume and recovery time are significantly influenced by the nature of aquifer heterogeneity and that higher freshwater recharge either due to precipitation or by artificial means results in rapid recovery they also concluded that the flushing time was controlled primarily by the flow rate in the sand tank however they did not study the effects of parameter variations such as permeability distribution isotropic or anisotropic and they did not use typical field values of parameters to mimic coastal aquifer due to the limitation to laboratory scale experiments zamrsky et al 2014 numerically investigated the influence of variable hydrogeological factors recharge inland hydraulic head and permeability on salinization during tsunamic inundation using a conceptual two dimensional 2d coastal aquifer of 5 km length and 50 m depth anisotropy in permeability was not considered they concluded that high permeability increases the flushing of infiltrated seawater and a larger freshwater flux from inland reduces the depth of salinization in the aquifer however they did not simulate the dynamic process of inundation but instead used a constant head over the inundation zone for a short duration further they assumed that a part of the upper aquifer 2 km length 1 m thickness was uniformly filled with seawater in every scenario immediately after the retreat of the tsunamic inundation which neglects variation in the volume of seawater that infiltrates due to different hydrogeological factors holding and allen 2015 evaluated the freshwater lens response and recovery to a theoretical ocean surge events for small islands of various types using a fully coupled surface subsurface numerical model they concluded that the degree of aquifer salinization was largely determined by the thickness of the unsaturated zone the recovery time for the freshwater lens ranged from 1 to 19 years for the different island types significantly affected by recharge rate a similar study was performed by bailey 2015 for atoll islands in the western pacific indicating that 4 12 months were required to recover 60 of the freshwater lens depending on the island type these studies were based on the simulation results for different types of island demonstrating the cumulative impact of the island size and hydrogeological factors such as permeability porosity recharge rate and hydraulic gradient they focused on islands and were limited to the small island scale 1 km with relatively fast flushing of salt comparing with coastal aquifers that may be inundated kilometers landward during ocean surge e g coastal aquifer in florida during hurricane ivan in 2004 sheng et al 2010 it is still necessary to perform studies which quantitatively investigate effects of a single factor on groundwater salinization excluding effects from other hydrogeological factors in coastal aquifer of larger scale in the present study we focus on salinization caused by infiltration of seawater from the surface during an ocean surge inundation event we used a fully coupled surface subsurface approach to numerically assess the impact of hydrogeological factors on groundwater salinization and flushing we simulate the dynamic inundation process with surface flow flooding and retreat such that the location amount of infiltrated seawater depends on the hydrogeological factors the objectives were to i numerically simulate the ocean surge inundation on a 2d coastal aquifer with variable typical hydrogeological factors such as permeability hydraulic gradient and recharge rate ii develop indicators to quantify the severity of salinization and iii assess the impact of hydrogeological factors on the salinization using the developed indicators the results are potentially important for global vulnerability assessment of coastal aquifers to ocean surge inundation 2 mathematical model 2 1 hydrogeosphere hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 is a 3d numerical model that simulates fully coupled surface subsurface variably saturated variable density flow and advective dispersive diffusive solute transport therrien et al 2010 it solves richards equation and uses darcy s law to simulate variably saturated variable density flow in the subsurface domain and solves manning s equation and the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equation for flow in the 2d surface domain solute transport is simulated with the advection dispersion diffusion equation in both domains manning 1891 vanderkwaak 1999 yang et al 2013 hydrogeosphere uses a dual node approach to numerically couple the surface and subsurface domains assuming that the surface and subsurface domains are separated by a thin porous layer with a thickness equal to the coupling length water and solute exchange fluxes are implicitly calculated between the domains hydrogeosphere has been used to investigate ocean surge inundation of coastal aquifers because of its feature of surface subsurface coupling holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2013 2015a 2015b the governing equations can be found elsewhere therrien et al 2010 yang et al 2013 and are not repeated here 2 2 conceptual model a 2d vertically oriented cross section of a coastal aquifer fig 2 a was used as the model domain the domain has a length of 4500 m which is divided into two parts by the shoreline at x 500 m the seaside part 0 m x 500 m extends to an elevation of 5 m at point ao into the sea and is submerged by seawater prior to the ocean surge the landside part 500 m x 4500 m extends to an elevation of 4 m at point co with a constant land slope of 1 1000 representing the land surface the horizontal aquifer bottom is 30 m the vertical cross sectional aquifer was discretized into 2700 3d block elements of unit length in the y direction fig 2 a the blocks had a constant cell size of 25 m in x direction and variable cell sizes in z direction ranging from 0 15 m near the aquifer top to 3 8 m near the aquifer bottom to better represent the unsaturated zone similarly the 1d surface domain aoco in fig 2 a was discretized into 180 rectangles corresponding to the uppermost mesh on the subsurface domain a grid convergence study was performed by yu et al 2016 who used similar domain sizes in x and z directions so that the resolution used in present study is able to capture the surface and subsurface processes an adaptive time stepping scheme was used where the time step size adapted to the maximum changes of variables head 1 m relative concentration 0 05 saturation 0 05 during a time step therrien et al 2010 this strategy ensures numerical stability and efficiency of the simulations hirthe and graf 2012 therrien et al 2010 homogeneous aquifer properties were considered isotropic or anisotropic permeability values kx and kz were selected and assigned to the entire subsurface domain described in section 2 3 the surface domain was assigned values of the manning roughness coefficient n tl 1 3 manning 1891 n 10 7 day m 1 3 for the seaside part 0 m x 500 m and n 8 10 7 day m 1 3 for the landside part 500 m x 4500 m chow 1959 yang et al 2013 freshwater was assigned a density ρ 0 of 1000 kg m 3 and a tds concentration of 0 g l 1 seawater was assigned a density ρs of 1025 5 kg m 3 yu et al 2016 and a tds concentration of 34 2 g l 1 millero et al 1980 the density of water with tds concentration between 0 and 34 2 g l 1 was calculated using an isothermal linear density concentration relationship therrien et al 2010 viscosity was considered to be independent from tds concentration other parameters were selected uniformly for the simulated domain according to typical literature values gelhar et al 1992 therrien et al 2010 yang et al 2013 and are listed in table 1 an ocean surge event that lasted for 8 hours with a maximum surge height of 3 88 m yang et al 2015a was simulated fig 2 b shows the surge height variation curve 2 2 1 boundary conditions of the subsurface the flow and transport boundary conditions used are shown in fig 2 a for the subsurface domain a time variable fresh water head hf was applied to the seaside boundary ab yang et al 2013 1 h f surge height t z ρ s ρ 0 z where z l is nodal elevation a constant concentration of seawater 34 2 g l 1 was applied to boundary ab for the inland boundary cd constant fluxes constant in time but variable in space were assigned to the faces along cd the constant fluxes were calculated by running a steady state model prior to ocean surge using a constant fresh water head hinland on the landside boundary cd therefore the constant flux boundary condition is equivalent to the constant head boundary condition of hinland the reason for using constant fluxes instead of constant head is that the hydraulic head on the landside boundary cd would increase during an ocean surge event a range of hinland values were selected described in section 2 3 a constant concentration of freshwater 0 g l 1 was assigned to the landside boundary cd all other boundaries of the subsurface are set to be impermeable to flow and zero flux for transport note that there are water and salt exchange fluxes between surface and subsurface domains through top boundary ac 2 2 2 boundary conditions of the surface a time variable water depth d was applied to the surface domain at ao fig 2a calculated according to the surge height yang et al 2013 2 d surge height t z a o where z a o l is the nodal elevation of ao a constant concentration of seawater 34 2 g l 1 was applied to ao the constant recharge rate r was applied to the surface domain of the landside part 500 m x 4500 m which accounts for precipitation and evapotranspiration note that the applied recharge does not denote fully contribution to groundwater due to the possibility of groundwater surface exchange in the integral model recharge water was assumed to be fresh c 0 g l 1 a range of r values were selected producing several simulation scenarios that are described in section 2 3 2 2 3 base case the base case is defined as i permeability kx kz 10 11 m2 typical of isotropic fine sand ii the landside groundwater head hinland 2 m which approximately corresponds to a realistic groundwater head gradient of a coastal aquifer where ocean surge inundation potentially occurs and iii recharge rate r 300 mm yr 1 yu et al 2016 2 3 parameter variation scenarios three parameters were varied to investigate the impact of hydrogeological factors on groundwater salinization permeability including its anisotropy hydraulic gradient and recharge rate we selected these three parameters because they potentially affect the groundwater flow system by changing the groundwater flow either horizontally from inland to sea or vertically from the land surface through the unsaturated zone of the coastal aquifer yang et al 2015a 2015b 2 3 1 permeability the horizontal permeability kx and the vertical permeability kz ranged independently from 10 14 m2 silt to 10 10 m2 gravel michael et al 2013 by factor of 10 creating the 25 combinations of kx and kz listed in table 2 therefore both isotropic kx kz 1 and anisotropic kx kz 1 situations were investigated other parameters hinland and r were kept constant to the base as permeability varied 2 3 2 hydraulic gradient and recharge rate hydraulic gradient and recharge rate were varied independently three hinland values of 1 2 and 3 m were selected producing average hydraulic gradients of 1 4000 2 4000 and 3 4000 respectively the groundwater hydraulic gradient was constrained by the land surface slope in the simulations because i an unconfined aquifer with the constant land surface slope 4 4000 is considered and ii a gradient larger than the land surface slope leads to significant seepage of groundwater from the subsurface to the surface seven r values were selected ranging from 0 to 1500 mm yr 1 michael et al 2013 a total of 21 combinations of hydraulic gradient and recharge rate were generated listed in table 3 other parameters kx and kz were kept constant at the base case values when the hydraulic gradient and recharge rate were varied before running the ocean surge simulation a preliminary simulation to steady state was performed for each scenario where the surge height was kept constant at 0 m and where the constant head boundary hf hinland at cd fig 2 a was used the preliminary simulation supplied i the initial condition for the ocean surge simulation and ii the equivalent fluxes through the inland boundary cd which were used as boundary condition for the ocean surge simulation 2 4 groundwater salinization assessment indicators salinization at a specific point in a coastal aquifer is defined here to occur when the tds concentration is larger than 0 5 g l 1 which is the human drinking water standard epa 2009 the term recovery to initial state is defined here as the situation when the tds concentration at a specific point in a salinized aquifer drops below 0 5 g l 1 an aquifer can recover by i seaward flushing of salt by groundwater flow and ii dilution by fresh groundwater throughflow and precipitation recharge accordingly recovery to initial state does not denote true recovery to initial pre storm tds concentrations that may have been much lower than 0 5 g l 1 to quantify the severity of salinization caused by ocean surge inundation several indicators have previously been used the time required for the aquifer to completely or partially recover to its initial state after an ocean surge inundation is frequently used examples are salt exist time yang et al 2015b recovery time chui and terry 2011 flush out time vithanage et al 2012 travel time violette et al 2009 and characteristic time zamrsky et al 2014 zamrsky et al 2014 also used reach time representing the time required for the salt to reach a certain depth of the aquifer those indicators quantify the severity of salinization in time and therefore do not characterize the spatial distribution of salinization we therefore defined three groundwater salinization assessment indicators in time and space ft pd and ft w discussed below 2 4 1 spatially averaged flushing time ft in this study ft t is defined as the spatial average of the flushing time ft t which is the time duration from the starting of ocean surge inundation until recovery occurs at a specific point in the aquifer ft is therefore a spatially distributed indicator recovery does not occur in some parts of the aquifer i the part that was already salinized prior to ocean surge inundation fig 4 a and ii the part that is not salinized by the ocean surge inundation fig 4 f for those parts the ft does not exist the ft can be used to quantify the recovery time at specific locations of a coastal aquifer after ocean surge inundation where a large ft means that it will take a long time for the aquifer to recover to the initial state prior to ocean surge inundation and conversely a small ft represents fast recovery the defined ft here is same as the flushing time that was used by yu et al 2016 in despite of minor differences on the computation of it the spatially averaged flushing time ft of an aquifer can be calculated from the spatial ft distribution 3 ft i ft i v i v i where ft i t is the flushing time at node i vi l3 is the volume associated to node i and vi l3 is the total volume of the recovered aquifer the average flushing time ft quantifies the average recovery time of a coastal aquifer in a single number 2 4 2 spatially averaged penetration depth pd as a consequence of ocean surge inundation the shallow aquifer is contaminated first followed by the deeper part of the aquifer because seawater infiltrates into the subsurface and percolates downward into the aquifer the pd l is defined as the spatially averaged penetration depth pd l which is the depth of salinization below the inundation zone pd therefore varies over the inundated area of the surge due to salt plume fingering yang et al 2013 pd is calculated using 4 pd i pd i a i a i where ai l2 is the land surface area below which the penetration depth pd i l is reached and ai l2 is the total land surface area below which salinization occurs the pd is a global indicator that averages the depth of the position where salinization occurs a large pd value indicates that the salinization occurs deeper in the coastal aquifer below the inundation zone such that deeper groundwater resources are affected and conversely a small pd represents contamination of only shallow groundwater the defined pd can be easily converted into a total salinized volume which was used by yu et al 2016 by timing the area of influenced land we used pd in this study because of its advantage in indicating the depth of salinization 2 4 3 weighted flushing time ft w spatially averaged flushing time ft and penetration depth pd do not describe the severity of salinization in extreme cases independently for example in one case salinization may occur only in the shallow aquifer and may last for a very long time leading to large ft and small pd in another case salinization may reach deeper into the aquifer but may last only a short time leading to small ft and large pd it is hard to tell which case undergoes more severe salinization due to ocean surge inundation using either ft or pd independently therefore the weighted flushing time ft w t is defined here as a combination between ft and pd 5 ft w w ft 6 w pd d pd d 1 pd d where w is a weighting factor ranging from 0 to 1 describing the vulnerability of groundwater resources to salinization w 0 means not vulnerable w 1 means highly vulnerable d l is defined as a reference aquifer depth where groundwater resources can be significantly vulnerable to salinization d can be the aquifer depth where fresh groundwater supply is most productive or where pumping wells are screened in the present study we simply use the aquifer thickness 30 m for d a linear relationship between w and pd is assumed when pd d fig 3 indicating that groundwater resources are more vulnerable to deeper salinization however it is assumed that groundwater resources are significantly vulnerable w 1 to salinization deeper than d pd d regardless of the penetration depth pd ft w quantifies the vulnerability of coastal aquifer subject to ocean surge inundation considering both the time duration and the spatial extent of the salinization a large ft w represents high vulnerability of the coastal aquifer to ocean surge inundation and a small ft w means that the aquifer vulnerability is low 3 results and discussion the simulations were performed with an identical ocean surge inundation signal until recovery therefore the simulation periods varied depending on the scenario the maximum simulation period was 500 yr after the ocean surge inundation with the associated cpu time of approximately 2 h the response of the aquifer was dependent on the parameters for each scenario for the base case the simulated ocean surge delivered 187 175 m3 of seawater across the shoreline to the inland and 92 of this seawater flowed back to the sea over land within 24 h the remaining 8 of seawater infiltrated into the subsurface this value was in the range 2 12 for all simulated scenarios the simulated salinization process in the base case provides insights into the coupling between the surface and subsurface during an ocean surge fig 4 shows the simulated tds concentration distribution for the base case at different times the ocean surge inundated a length of 3450 m fig 4 a 500 m x 3950 m where surficial salinization occurred subsequent infiltration of seawater led to the development of a tds plume near the aquifer top fig 4 b the tds plume moved downward toward the aquifer bottom fig 4 c causing salinization c 0 5 g l 1 of the deeper parts of the aquifer natural remediation due to seaward groundwater flow and dilution by rainwater recharge led to recovery to initial state of the salinized aquifer zone such that the plume size was continuously reduced fig 4 d f the recovery of the aquifer lasted more than 20 yr fig 4 f also shows that a part of the aquifer was never salinized the values of the salinization assessment indicators associated with different scenarios are described in the following sections 3 1 effect of aquifer permeability ft pd and ft w were computed for each permeability combination fig 5 within the considered k range the pd is minimum for kx kz 10 14 m2 fig 5 a this indicates that aquifers with low kx and low kz are less affected by ocean surge inundation blue area in fig 5 a because salinization only reaches the shallow aquifer and does not reach the deeper aquifer the maximum pd occurs for kx kz 10 10 m2 which indicates that aquifers with high kx and high kz are more affected by salinization results of the average flushing time ft indicate that simulations with low kx and low kz red area in fig 5 b had a relatively long flushing time ft ranging from 25 yr to 70 yr which was simply due to small lateral groundwater flow velocities conversely high kx and low kz blue area had a relatively short flushing time ft ranging from 1 yr to 5 yr because of high lateral flow velocities in that case the aquifer was less affected by ocean surge inundation because of quick recovery the results of the permeability combination kx kz 10 14 m2 low pd of 1 9 m and large ft of 63 3 yr confirm that the penetration depth and the flushing time can be of limited value to quantify the severity of salinization independently such that it becomes necessary to use the weighted flushing time ft w aquifers with low kx and high kz red area in fig 5 c are highly vulnerable to ocean surge inundation with a large ft w of 14 8 yr kx 10 14 m2 kz 10 10 m2 table 2 and aquifers with high kx and low kz are less vulnerable to ocean surge inundation with a small ft w of 0 2 yr kx 10 11 m2 kz 10 14 m2 table 2 all ft w values are listed in table 2 three k combination cases are selected to discuss the general findings of fig 5 in more detail i isotropic kx kz variable ii anisotropic 1 kx 10 11 m2 variable kz and iii anisotropic 2 variable kx kz 10 11 m2 results of these combinations are shown in fig 6 and distributions of ft of all associated 15 cases are shown in fig 7 note that the ft distributions should not be interpreted as the salinity of groundwater however they indicate the spatial distribution of the salinization for the isotropic cases i fig 6 a c the pd and ft increases and decreases respectively when the permeability increases for higher permeability the salinization occurred deeper in the aquifer fig 7 a but recovery occurred faster while for lower permeability the salinization was limited to the shallower aquifer fig 7 e but persisted longer the opposite trends of pd and ft and the fact that ft w combines the two indicators leads to increased ft w for extreme k values and a ft w minimum for k 10 13 m2 fig 6 c for the anisotropic cases 1 fig 6 d f all three indicators generally increase when kz increases the patterns can also be easily observed by ft distributions in fig 7 f j a low kz led to shallow salinization and fast recovery of the aquifer because low kz inhibited seawater from infiltrating into the deep aquifer by reducing the vertical flow rates the smallest ft w occurred when kz 10 14 m2 fig 7 j the non monotonic nature of the indicator values with permeability e g fig 6 d f may be explained by a diversity in salt plume development and density fingering this can be seen for example in the ft distributions fig 7 f and g for the anisotropic cases 2 fig 6 g i pd and ft partly increases and decreases respectively when kx increases these opposite patterns result in the smallest ft w occurring for intermediate kx 10 11 m2 however the variation of ft with kx is not significant which is confirmed by similar ft distributions shown in fig 7 m o we also computed the 25 and 75 flushing time corresponding to the time when 25 and 75 of the salinized aquifer was recovered respectively fig 6 b e and h these results show that a long flushing time indicates high diversity of aquifer recovery in space while small flushing time indicates that the aquifer recovery is spatially more uniform 3 2 effect of hydraulic gradient and recharge rate pd ft and ft w were computed for each combination of inland head hinland and recharge rate r shown in fig 8 the pd was large for low r and low hinland fig 8 a red area while pd was small for high r and high hinland blue area large ft fig 8 b was found when r was low the ft w distribution fig 8 c shows that an aquifer with low r is highly vulnerable to ocean surge inundation with ft w was as large as 180 yr table 3 two combinations of hydraulic gradient and recharge rate are considered for discussion i hinland varies with a constant r of 300 mm yr 1 and ii r varies with a constant hinland of 2 m represented by the black and green dots in fig 8 respectively the indicator values are shown in fig 9 and distributions of ft of the associated 9 cases are shown in fig 10 pd ft and ft w decrease when hinland increases fig 9 a c indicating that an aquifer with higher hydraulic gradient is less vulnerable to ocean surge inundation this is confirmed by the flushing time ft distributions shown in fig 10a c these patterns indicate that hydraulic gradient has a positive effect on coastal aquifer vulnerability to ocean surge inundation pd ft and ft w also show decreasing patterns with increasing r fig 9 d f which is confirmed by the spatial distributions of ft fig 10 d i these patterns indicate that r has a positive effect on the aquifer vulnerability regarding ocean surge inundation moreover ft w became extremely sensitive to r for r 300 mm yr 1 which indicates that dry coastal aquifers can be extremely vulnerable to ocean surge inundation 3 3 limitations the cross comparison between aquifers with differing hydrogeological characteristics provides insights into the factors that are most important in determining the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to salinization from ocean surge inundation however this study is limited in scope in that it neglects other factors that may have important impacts on the salinization and flushing processes one example is land surface topography we considered only a constant slope in this study but the salinization assessment indicators are sensitive to surface morphology for example flushing times simulated by yu et al 2016 were up to 99 yr for aquifers with different surface morphology compared to 54 yr in an equivalent aquifer with constant slope the increase in flushing time is due to the ponding of seawater in surface depressions which increases the amount of infiltrated seawater we also neglected aquifer heterogeneity which has been shown to affect the migration of the salt plumes vithanage et al 2012 yang et al 2015a in aquifers the flushing time would increase when the salt transfers through a low permeability lens and an opening in a low permeability lens would cause more rapid flushing vithanage et al 2012 the flushing time would very likely decrease when preferential groundwater flow pathways such as macropores and fractures sebbena et al 2015 are present in an aquifer the effect of tidal fluctuations which cause extra salinized volume of the aquifer in the recirculating zone near the shoreline yang et al 2013 was also not considered in this study while the numerical model provides general insights there are some limitations in its applicability firstly the selecting of model parameters such as dispersivity can result in uncertainty in the computed indicators a sensitivity analysis was performed in regard to different αl values of 25 m used in this study 20 m 15 m 10 m and 5 m fig 11 the results show that the ft w decreased when the used αl was reduced from 25 m to 15 m however ft w increased when further reducing the αl value to 5 m these behavior is explained by the twofold effect of reducing the dispersivity on one hand it leads to smaller volume of salinized aquifer as dispersive transport of salt becomes weaker on the other hand it leads to reduced dilution of salt i e reduced natural remediation however using the αl of 25 m in this study is justified by the fact that changes of ft w in response to changes of αl are not significant compared to the total scale of ft w computed in this study 0 180 yr secondly we considered only a 2d aquifer with constant aquifer thickness this may cause underestimation of penetration depths because salt plumes cannot penetrate deeper than the aquifer bottom this cut off effect of the bottom boundary can also result in uncertainty in computing average flushing time additionally the 2d model assumes that groundwater flows only from land to sea ignoring the alongshore transport of salt that may naturally occur lastly the density fingering process differs between 2d and 3d systems knorr et al 2016 and when heterogeneities are present simmons et al 2001 such that salt penetration rates and extent may occur differently in natural systems 4 summary and conclusions in this study we numerically simulated ocean surge inundation on a 2d vertically oriented coastal aquifer under the influence of differing hydrogeological factors i permeability ii hydraulic gradient and iii recharge rate a new contribution of this study is the development of three indicators to quantify the severity of salinization induced by ocean surge inundation spatially averaged flushing time ft spatially averaged penetration depth pd and weighted flushing time ft w the impact of hydrogeological factors on salinization using the developed indicators was assessed the main key contributions of the present study are 1 applicability of the newly developed indicators to assess coastal aquifer vulnerability it is demonstrated how these indicators can be applied to a synthetic coastal aquifer clearly these indicators can be applied to any real coastal aquifer on the base of a numerical model 2 effect of permeability the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to ocean surge inundation increases with increasing isotropic permeability anisotropy of the permeability field has two effects low horizontal permeability and high vertical permeability lead to high aquifer vulnerability quantified by the weighted flushing time ft w of as large as 15 yr conversely high horizontal permeability and low vertical permeability lead to low aquifer vulnerability quantified by the weighted flushing time ft w of as small as 0 2 yr 3 effect of hydraulic gradient and recharge rate the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to ocean surge inundation decreases with increasing groundwater hydraulic gradient and increasing recharge rate coastal aquifers with low recharge rate r 300 mm yr 1 can be extremely vulnerable to ocean surge inundation quantified by the weighted flushing time ft w of as large as 180 yr this study quantitatively investigates the effect of hydrogeological factors on salinization caused by ocean surge inundation the key findings are useful for global vulnerability assessment of coastal aquifers subject and help to identify coastal areas that are at risk of groundwater salinization acknowledgements

911,a reynolds averaged euler lagrange sediment transport model cfdem eim was developed for steady sheet flow where the inter granular interactions were resolved and the flow turbulence was modeled with a low reynolds number corrected k ω turbulence closure modified for two phase flows to model the effect of turbulence on the sediment suspension the interaction between the turbulent eddies and particles was simulated with an eddy interaction model eim the eim was first calibrated with measurements from dilute suspension experiments we demonstrated that the eddy interaction model was able to reproduce the well known rouse profile for suspended sediment concentration the model results were found to be sensitive to the choice of the coefficient c 0 associated with the turbulence sediment interaction time a value c 0 3 was suggested to match the measured concentration in the dilute suspension the calibrated cfdem eim was used to model a steady sheet flow experiment of lightweight coarse particles and yielded reasonable agreements with measured velocity concentration and turbulence kinetic energy profiles further numerical experiments for sheet flow suggested that when c 0 was decreased to c 0 3 the simulation under predicted the amount of suspended sediment in the dilute region and the schmidt number is over predicted sc 1 0 additional simulations for a range of shields parameters between 0 3 and 1 2 confirmed that cfdem eim was capable of predicting sediment transport rates similar to empirical formulations based on the analysis of sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness the eim and the resulting suspended load were shown to be important when the fall parameter is less than 1 25 keywords euler lagrange model eddy interaction model turbulent

wetland and beach erosion for example significant engineering efforts were devoted to control the river discharge and sediment budget to reduce the loss of louisiana wetland allison et al 2012 mossa 1996 in the indian river inlet significant erosion of the north beach is mitigated through proper beach nourishment that interacts with littoral drift keshtpoor et al 2013 the characteristics of sediment transport vary significantly with sediment properties and flow conditions and it is widely believed that sheet flow plays a dominant role in nearshore beach erosion and riverine sediment delivery especially during storm and flood conditions respectively sheet flow is an intense sediment transport mode in which a thick layer of concentrated sediment is mobilized above the quasi static bed the conventional single phase based sediment transport models assume the dynamics of transport can be subjectively separated into bedload and suspended load e g van rijn 1984a 1984b while the

transport rate indicated that the split of bedload and suspended load may be too simple because sediment entrainment deposition is a continuous and highly dynamic process near the mobile bed e g o donoghue and wright 2004 revil baudard et al 2015 in sheet flow the two prevailing mechanisms driving the sediment transport are inter granular interactions and turbulent suspension jenkins and hanes 1998 revil baudard et al 2015 in order to model the full profile of sediment transport both mechanisms must be taken into account in the past decade many eulerian two phase flow models have been developed for sheet flow transport in steady jenkins and hanes 1998 longo 2005 revil baudard and chauchat 2013 and oscillatory flows dong and zhang 2002 hsu et al 2004 amoudry et al chen et al 2011 cheng et al 2017a liu and sato 2006 by solving the mass and momentum equations of fluid phase and sediment phase with appropriate closures for interphase momentum transfer turbulence and intergranular stresses these models are able to resolve the entire profiles of sediment transport without the assumption of bedload and suspended load in the continuum description of the sediment phase the assumption of uniform particle properties and spherical particle shapes are usually adopted to better capture the polydisperse nature of sediment transport and irregular particle shapes the lagrangian approach for the particle phase namely the discrete element method dem cundall and strack 1979 maurin et al 2015 sun and xiao 2016a is superior to the eulerian approach because individual particle properties may be uniquely specified calantoni et al 2004 fukuoka et al 2014 harada and gotoh 2008 one of the main challenges in modeling sheet flow arise from the various length scales involved in inter granular interactions and sediment turbulence interactions to resolve the flow turbulence and turbulence sediment interactions in sheet flow the computational domain needs to be sufficiently large to resolve the largest eddies while the grid resolution should be small enough to resolve the energy containing turbulent eddies this constrain becomes even more challenging in the euler lagrange modeling framework large domains require both a large number of grid points to resolve a sufficient amount of turbulence energy cascade i e large eddy simulation and a large number of particles in a given simulation e g finn et al 2016 it is well established that in sheet flow the transport layer thickness scales with the grain size and the shields parameter wilson 1987 suggesting that a common sheet flow layer thickness must be about several tens of grain diameters to simulate the largest eddies and their subsequent cascade the domain lengths in the two horizontal directions must be proportional to the boundary layer thickness which is usually about several tens of centimeters for a bed layer thickness of 50 grains with a typical grain diameter of 0 2 mm sheet flow simulations may require at least several tens of millions of particles therefore to efficiently model sediment transport for many scenarios in sheet flow a turbulence averaged approach for the carrier phase may be necessary in a turbulence averaged formulation turbulent eddies are not resolved and their effects on the averaged flow field are often parameterized via eddy viscosity in this case the domain lengths in the two horizontal directions are solely determined by the largest length scale of inter granular interaction which is usually captured within 50 grain diameters maurin et al 2015 consequently the number of particles needed for each sheet flow simulation is limited to no more than a few hundred thousand with a goal to develop a robust open source coupled computational fluid dynamics discrete element method cfd dem for sheet flow applications we adopt a turbulence averaged approach in this study existing reynolds averaged cfd dem models have the capability to model bedload transport durán et al 2012 maurin et al 2015 and sheet flow for coarse sand drake and calantoni 2001 where the inter granular interactions are dominant and the turbulent suspension is of minor importance the previous studies made significant progresses in understanding the sediment dynamics due to intergranular collisions and interactions with the mean flow and the key characteristics such as sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness close to the empirical formulations were obtained in more energetic sheet flows with medium to fine sand particles the role of turbulence induced suspension can become important where substantial sediment suspension occurs above the bedload layer bagnold 1966 sumer et al 1996 in such condition a more complete closure models for turbulent suspension and turbulence modulation by particles are needed the natural way of describing the diffusion and dispersion of dispersed particles is to sample the turbulent velocity statistics along their trajectories in a stochastic manner taylor 1922 and this idea lays the foundation of modeling the turbulent motions of particles with a lagrangian approach in the stochastic lagrange model for particle dispersion the turbulent agitation to the sediment particles are considered either through a random walk model rwm or an eddy interaction model eim in the rwm framework the strength of particle velocity fluctuations are typically assumed to be similar to the fluid turbulence and a series of random velocity fluctuations are directly added to the particle velocities while the lagrange model with rwm is successful in studying the particle dispersion in mixing layer coimbra et al 1998 and dilute suspension shi and yu 2015 the assumption of estimating the particle velocity fluctuations based on the fluid turbulence is crucial and many researchers found that the correlation between the particle and fluid fluctuations are highly dependent on the particle stokes number s t t p t l balachandar and eaton 2010 where tp is the particle response time and tl is the characteristic time scale of energetic eddies for the particles with very small inertia st 1 they can closely follow the eddy motion however if st 1 the particle trajectory is hardly affected by the fluid eddy motion due to the particle inertia effect it was found that the fluid turbulent intensity needs to be enhanced for medium to coarse particles shi and yu 2015 this problem can be largely remedied by the eim matida et al 2004 where the fluid velocity fluctuations associated with the fluid turbulence are added through the particle sediment interaction force i e the drag force this approach incorporates the particle inertia effect naturally and it is applicable for a wide range of sediment properties graham 1996 found that the dispersion of inertial particles may be correctly represented with a suitable choice of maximum interaction time and length scales with the eddies this model was later improved by using a randomly sampled eddy interaction time in which more realistic turbulent scales become possible and the enhanced dispersion of high inertia particles are captured in the previous studies of particle dispersion e g shi and yu 2015 the turbulent intensity is either prescribed from the empirical formula or modeled using clear fluid turbulence closure without considering turbulence modulation by the presence of particles in sheet flow it is well known that the sediment turbulence interaction is important in attenuating the flow turbulence thus the presence of sediment can dissipate enhance flow turbulence through drag density stratification in this paper we present an application of the eddy interaction model eim in a reynolds averaged euler lagrange formulation to study sheet flow the eddy interaction model is implemented into an open source coupled cfd dem scheme called cfdem goniva et al 2012 and the new solver is called cfdem eim the fluid phase is modeled in a similar way as the eulerian two phase flow model sedfoam cheng et al 2017a and the particles are modeled with the discrete particle model liggghts kloss et al 2012 the paper is organized in the following manner the model formulation is described in section 2 the model calibration with dilute suspension experiments is presented in section 3 1 followed by model validation of steady sheet flow section 3 2 using a comprehensive dataset revil baudard et al 2015 2016 section 4 discusses the model sensitivity of the resulting sediment diffusivity and schmidt number to model coefficients in the eddy interaction scheme and effects of the eim on the modeled sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness are also evaluated finally a practical regime for the eim to be important is proposed based on the fall parameter concluding remarks are given in section 5 2 model formulations 2 1 discrete particle model in the framework of the discrete element method cundall and strack 1979 the position of each particle is tracked by integrating the particle equation of motion 1 d x p i d t v i where x p i is the position of particle i and v i is the translational velocity the governing equation for the translational motion of particle i with radius ri and mass mi may be written as 2 m i d v i d t f p f i j 1 n c f n i j f t i j m i g the forces acting on the ith particle include the particle fluid interaction force f pf i the gravitational force mi g and the normal f n ij and tangential f t ij contact forces where nc is the number of particles in contact with the particle i the rotational motion of particle i with moment of inertia ii may be written as 3 i i d ω i d t j 1 n c m t i j m r i j where ω i is the angular velocity of particle i the torque acting on particle i from particle j consists of two components closures are used for m t ij which is generated by the tangential force and m r ij which is commonly known as the rolling friction torque luding 2008 to model grain contact forces we adopt the soft sphere approach cundall and strack 1979 based on hertz mindlin theory hertz theory is implemented in the normal direction and the improved mindlin no slip model is implemented in the shear direction mindlin 1949 in the soft sphere model e g renzo and maio 2005 particles are allowed to overlap slightly and the contact between two particles may be described as a nonlinear spring dashpot where the normal contact force f n ij is determined by the overlap δij and relative velocity between colliding particles vr ij while the tangental force f t ij is calculated in a similar way and includes the tangental contact history in addition if the tangential force exceeds the coulomb frictional limit the particles begin to slide and the tangential force is set to f t i j μ c f n i j where μc is the coulomb friction coefficient in the present study we only consider the torque induced by particle particle particle wall contact and the influence of fluid induced torque is ignored in general the particle fluid interaction force f pf is the sum of all types of particle fluid interaction forces on individual particles by fluid including the so called drag force f d the pressure gradient force fp buoyancy force if assuming locally hydrostatic flow virtual mass force f vm basset force f b and lift forces such as the saffman force f saff and the magnus force f mag we assume that the fluid and particles share the pressure field thus the fluid pressure gradient force is also included in the fluid particle interactions maxey and riley 1983 zhou et al 2010 in cfdem eim only the two dominant forces namely the drag force and pressure gradient force are retained here the total fluid particle interaction force acting on particle i may be written as 4 f p f i f d i f p i the pressure gradient force acting on particle i is calculated as 5 f p i f x i i p v i where f x i is the external body force driving the steady flow i p is the interpolated fluid pressure gradient at particle i and vi is the volume of particle i the drag force acting on particle i is expressed as 6 f d i 1 2 c d a s i u f i v i u f i v i where u f i is the instantaneous fluid velocity interpolated at particle i and a s i is the projected area of the ith spherical particle or equivalent spherical particle for non spherical particles according to the reynolds decomposition the instantaneous fluid velocity is decomposed into the reynolds averaged component u f i and the turbulent fluctuating component u f i in cfdem eim the reynolds averaged velocities are provided by the carrier fluid model while the turbulent fluctuating component is modeled with an additional eddy interaction closure see section 2 4 to generalize the drag coefficient for both spherical and non spherical particles the drag coefficient cd is given by haider and levenspiel 1989 7 c d f ϕ 24 r e p 1 a r e p b c 1 d r e p where r e p 1 ϕ u f i v i d i ν f is the particle reynolds number νf is the fluid kinematic viscosity and di is the diameter of the spherical particle or an equivalent sphere that has the same volume as the non spherical particle the four parameters a b c and d are proposed to be functions of particle sphericity η with 8 a exp 2 3288 6 4581 η 2 4486 η 2 9 b 0 0964 0 5565 η 10 c exp 4 905 13 8944 η 18 4222 η 2 10 2599 η 3 11 d exp 1 4681 12 2584 η 20 7322 η 2 15

calculated by averaging the sediment instantaneous sediment concentration within one cfd time step 14 ϕ 1 n s j 1 n s ϕ j where ns is number of dem time steps within one cfd time step see more details in section 2 5 the divided volume fraction model goniva et al 2012 is used for the instantaneous sediment concentration at each dem time step where the particle volumes are divided into 29 parts using the satellite points and the volumes are distributed into the touched fluid grid cells the model works well when particle size is similar to the mesh size 2 2 fluid phase governing equations in contrast of the particle phase the fluid phase is solved in an eulerian framework and the coupled euler lagrange system follows the so called model a e g zhou et al 2010 by further carrying out reynolds averaging the fluid momentum equation may be written as 15 ρ f 1 ϕ u f t ρ f 1 ϕ u f u f 1 ϕ f x 1 ϕ p τ f ρ f 1 ϕ g f d where the overbar denotes the ensemble averaged fields ρf is the fluid density the first term on the right hand side r h s is the external body force that drives the steady flow the second term on r h s is the pressure gradient force τ f is the total fluid stress tensor which includes the viscous stress τ ν and the reynolds stress τ ft the last term on the r h s is the sum of the drag force from the particles within the fluid grid volume vcell which must satisfy the newton s 3rd law 16 f d 1 n s v c e l l j 1 n s i 1 n c e l l f d i the sediment concentration ϕ calculated directly by grid averaging in the dem is usually not smooth and averaging errors may depend on the averaging length scale simeonov et al 2015 to ensure numerical stability a diffusion model is often used to obtain a sufficiently smoothed concentration profile 17 ϕ t d t ϕ the diffusion constant dt is calculated as d t l d 2 d t where ld is a length scale and dt is the fluid phase time step i e cfd time step the choice of length scale l d d is found to be stable and necessary when the fluid grid length is similar to or smaller than the particle diameter capecelatro and desjardins 2013 pirker et al 2011 note that this smoothed concentration field is only used in the fluid governing equations and turbulence closures the model results mainly in sections 3 and 4 of the sediment concentration sediment velocity and transport rate are directly obtained from the dem part i e not smoothed by the diffusion model to ensure a stable calculation of conservation of mass a mixture continuity equation for the incompressible fluid particle system can be derived and is solved cheng et al 2017a 18 1 ϕ u f ϕ u s 0 2 3 fluid turbulence modeling as briefly described in eq 15 the total fluid stress tensor consists of the viscous stress τ ν and the reynolds stress τ ft 19 τ f τ ν τ f

where i is an identity tensor t is the transpose of gradient tensor νft is the turbulent eddy viscosity and kf is the fluid turbulent kinetic energy tke the eddy viscosity and tke are modeled with a low reynolds number version k ω turbulence model lrn k ω closure wilcox 1992 modified for two phase flows 2 3 1 low reynolds number corrected k ω closure for two phase flow in lrn k ω closure the low reynolds number correction was introduced based on the local reynolds number r e t k f ν f ω f with this correction the lrn k ω closure is capable of capturing transitional turbulent flow in the near bed region to take into account of the sediment effect on the flow turbulence the sediment turbulence interaction terms were added to both the transport equations for the fluid tke kf and specific turbulent dissipation frequency ωf similar to the approach suggested by amoudry 2014 and chauchat et al 2017 21 k f t u f k f τ f t ρ f u f ν f ν f t σ k k f c μ k f ω f 2 β 1 λ ϕ k f ρ f 1 ϕ 1 1 ϕ ν f t σ c ρ s ρ f 1 g ϕ where the operation denotes the scalar product of two tensors c μ is model coefficients with low reynolds number corrections based on the original coefficient cμ see table 1 22 c μ c μ 4 15 r e t r e β 4 1 r e t r e β 4 where the model constant r e β 8 is a critical reynolds number except for the last two terms on the r h s of eq 21 the rest of the terms in the present kf equation are essentially the same as those in the clear fluid tke equation the last term in eq 21 represents the buoyancy term for typical sediment concentration with an upward decaying profile this term represents the well known sediment induced density stratification that can attenuate the fluid turbulence the fourth term on the r h s represents attenuation of tke due to drag with β calculated as 23 β 3 4 ρ f c d u r d where cd is calculated by eq 7 with particle reynolds number r e p 1 ϕ u r d ν f in which ur is the magnitude of relative velocity seen by the fluid here to better estimate ur in dilute condition where instantaneous sediment concentration fluctuation is significant a temporal average of the relative velocity is carried out 24 u r 1 t t 0 t 0 t u f u s d t where t 0 is the starting time of the time average and t is the current run time of the simulation for a steady sheet flow application this time average procedure is representative of the ensemble averaged relative velocity between fluid and sediment phases throughout the simulations in this study the quasi steady state is usually reached within 5 s of numerical simulations thus we choose t 0 5 s to quantify the effect of fluid particle turbulence modulation the parameter λ is introduced by following cheng et al 2017a 25 λ e c s s t where cs is an empirical coefficient s t t p t l is the particle stokes number i e the ratio of the particle response time t p ρ s β to the characteristic time scale of energetic eddies in the literatures of reynolds averaged turbulence closures the general expression for the eddy life time can be written as t l c t c μ ω f and the value of the coefficient ct ranges from 0 135 to 0 41 milojeviè 1990 which is highly dependent on the flow conditions from the preliminary numerical experiment we found the eddy life time is vital for the turbulence sediment interaction thus we chose the coefficient c t 1 6 by following cheng et al 2017a and the model coefficients associated with the eddy life time are left as model calibration for example the coefficient cs in eqn 25 is calibrated using the sheet flow experimental dataset see section 3 2 to match the flow hydrodynamics and it was chosen to be c s 1 the balance equation for ωf follows the original work of wilcox 1992 however for turbulence particle sinteractions similar damping terms as in the kf equation are included the ωf equation is written as 26 ω f t u f ω f c 1 ω ω f k f τ f t ρ f u f ν f ν f t σ ω ω f c 2 ω ω f 2 c 3 ω 2 β 1 λ ϕ ω f ρ f 1 ϕ c 4 ω ω f k f 1 1 ϕ ν f t σ c ρ s ρ f 1 g ϕ ω b e d t r e l a x γ ϕ where the fourth and fifth terms take into account of the sediment effect on the fluid turbulence through drag and buoyancy respectively the coefficients c 1 ω is also modulated using the local turbulent reynolds number as 27 c 1 ω c 1 ω 1 α α 0 r e t r e ω 1 r e t r e ω where α is a damping function based on ret 28 α α 0 r e t r e k 1 r e t r e k where α 0 and rek are model coefficient for the low reynolds number corrections the model constant c 1ω c 2ω σk σω rek reω and α 0 are similar to the closure coefficients suggested by guizien et al 2003 see table 1 the coefficient of the buoyancy term c 4 ω 0 is chosen for stable stratification applicable for steady sheet flow rodi 1987 through a series of sensitivity test we found that the modeled flow velocities are also sensitive to the coefficient c 3ω and the optimum value of c 3ω is 0 14 which is close to the value 0 2 suggested by amoudry 2014 a full list of the coefficients associated with the low reynolds number k ω model used in this study is presented in table 1 finally the turbulent eddy viscosity νft is calculated by the fluid turbulence kinetic energy kf tke and specific turbulence dissipation rate ωf 29 ν f t α k f ω f it shall be noted that the lrn k ω can be reduced to the original k ω model wilcox 1993 in the fully turbulent region when the local reynolds number is sufficiently high compared with the critical reynolds numbers 2 3 2 smooth and rough wall functions the wall functions for a smooth bed and rough bed are both relevant to the present study for clear fluid or dilute suspension such as the experiment of muste et al 2005 to be discussed in section 3 1 a smooth wall is exposed and the ωf value in the viscous sublayer scales with 1 z 2 where z is the distance to the bottom wall boundary as a result ωf goes to infinity at the wall boundary in the numerical implementation a finite value of ωf is imposed to the first grid above the solid smooth wall and the following bottom boundary condition is specified bredberg et al 2000 menter and esch 2001 30 ω w a l l ω v i s 2 ω l o g 2 with the ωwall value specified as a blend function of the values in the viscous sublayer ωvis and logarithmic layer ω log 31 ω v i s 6 ν f 0 075 z o 2 ω l o g u c μ κ z o where κ 0 41 is the von karman constant and the bottom frictional velocity is calculated as u ν f ν f t u f z at the wall boundary it was found that this formulation of bottom boundary condition for smooth wall is robust for low to high reynolds number turbulent boundary layer flows on the other hand the bed is covered with a thick layer of sediment particles in sheet flow condition and the particles imposes a rough wall boundary to the flow above the bed however the location of the bed in sediment transport is difficult to determine as a priori due to possible erosion processes to avoid this complexity the last term on the r h s of eq 26 is proposed to impose a desired value of specific turbulence dissipation rate ωbed in the sediment bed and γ ϕ is a step like function of sediment concentration 32 γ ϕ tanh 500 ϕ ϕ b 1 2 where ϕb should be specified as the sediment concentration in the bed so that the ωf value is only imposed inside the sediment bed in this study we choose ϕ b 0 55 an intrinsic relaxation timescale is used for trelax which sums the proper timescale on the r h s of the ωf equation 33 1 t r e l a x c 2 ω ω f c 3 ω 2 β 1 λ ϕ ρ f 1 ϕ c 4 ω 1 k f 1 1 ϕ ν f t σ c ρ s ρ f 1 g ϕ it shall be noted that the relaxation time scale proposed here is positive in sheet flow applications for specific energy dissipation frequency ωbed inside the bed the rough wall value can be specified as wilcox 1988 34 ω b e d s r u 2 ν f where u is the bottom frictional velocity at the bed interface specified based on the flow forcing to drive the steady channel flow and sr is a parameter depending on the bed roughness 35 s r 200 k s 2 k s 5 k r k s 200 k s 2 k r k s e 5 k s k s 5 where k s k s u ν f is the normalized wall roughness in wall units and ks is the nikuradse s equivalent sand roughness which is related with the sand grain size k s 2 5 d the original coefficient kr is 100 as suggested by wilcox 1988 however fuhrman et al 2010 proposed that this coefficient needs to be reduced to k r 80 to match the law of wall therefore k r 80 is used throughout this paper 2 4 eddy interaction model the drag force eq 6 in the particle momentum equation depends on the instantaneous fluid velocity however only the reynolds averaged fluid velocity u f i is solved and hence an additional closure model for the fluid velocity fluctuation in turbulent flow u f i is required appropriate consideration of particle dispersion by turbulent eddies provides a key suspension mechanism in sediment transport i e turbulent suspension following graham and james 1996 particle dispersion by turbulence can be modeled with a stochastic eddy interaction model eim and a series of random lagrangian velocities can be used to represent the fluid turbulent motions i e u f i u i t σ 1 v f i v i t σ 2 and w f i w i t σ 3 where σ 1 2 3 are gaussian random numbers with a zero mean value and a standard deviation of unity in this study the velocity fluctuations are calculated using the fluid turbulent kinetic energy u i t v i t w i t 2 k f i 3 where k f i is interpolated turbulence kinetic energy at the mass center of particle i it is possible to model the anisotropic velocity fluctuations in three directions however to be consistent with the two equation turbulence averaged models lrn k ω closure the turbulent fluctuations are assumed to be isotropic in the eddy interaction model the velocity fluctuations i e u i t v i t w i t are updated every step with the particle position however the random numbers σ 1 2 3 remained unchanged until the eddy interaction time ti is exceeded which is determined either when a particle has completely crossed a turbulent eddy or remains in an eddy but exceeds the eddy life time the mean life time of the turbulent eddy can be estimated as t l i 6 c μ ω f i 1 in the lrn k ω model however the instantaneous turbulent eddy life time is of random like nature kallio and reeks 1989 mehrotra et al 1998 and it is estimated as 36 t e i c 0 ln 1 ξ t l i where ξ is the random number ranging from 0 to 1 as discussed in section 2 3 due to the uncertainties in the parameterization of the eddy life time the coefficient c 0 is introduced as a constant for model calibration see section 3 1 as a result the turbulent eddy length le can be estimated as l e i t e i 2 k f i 3 with the estimation of the turbulent eddy length le the eddy crossing time for a particle can be computed as gosman and loannides 1983 37 t c i t p i ln 1 l e i v i u f i t p i where t p i is the particle response time calculated as t p i 4 ρ s i d i 3 ρ f v i u f i c d it is noted that eq 37 is only evaluated when l e i v i u f i t p i and the eddy interaction time t i i is the minimum between eddy lifetime t e i and eddy crossing time t c i once the time interval exceeds t i i the particle i enters another turbulent eddy i e the gaussian random numbers σ 1 2 3 are re evaluated every interval t i i min t e i t c i 2 5 cfd dem coupling procedure in the present euler lagrange modeling framework the coupling between the fluid phase and sediment phase utilizes the open source code cfdem goniva et al 2012 which couples the finite volume cfd toolbox openfoam weller 2002 with the dem solver liggghts kloss et al 2012 at the beginning of the simulation the particle positions and velocities are initialized in the dem module and the fluid velocity and turbulence quantities are initialized in the cfd module the loop of the cfd dem coupling begins with the update of particle positions and velocities for ns dem time steps within one fluid time step dt in which the time step dts in the dem module is related to the fluid time step by d t s d t n s in the contact force model the energy stored in the collision increases rapidly with the overlapping length of particles thus the time step dts should be sufficiently small to avoid the unphysical energy generation due to particle contacts in this study the following three criteria are used to determine dts 1 the overlap length δn is smaller than 0 5 of particle diameter d i e dts 0 005d vrn where vrn is normal component of the relative velocity to the contact face between two contacting particles 2 to capture the energy transmission in the solid particles the time step dts is chosen to be small enough compared with the rayleigh timescale tr where t r π r ρ s g 0 163 ν 0 8766 1 and g is the shear modulus g is further related to the young s modulus e and the poisson ratio υ as 2 g 1 υ e 3 dts is required to be smaller than the hertzian contact time in order to capture the contact process the hertzian contact time is the duration of a pair of particles in contact which can be estimated as t c 2 87 m 2 r e 2 v r n 1 5 where r 1 r i 1 r j 1 m 1 m i 1 m j 1 and e 1 ν i 2 e i 1 ν j 2 e j 1 for a contact between a sphere particle i with wall j the same relationship applies to e whereas r r i and m m i the dts is constant throughout the simulation once appropriately chosen to satisfy the above criteria and the particle velocities are updated every dts where the forces acting on each particles are solved according to eq 4 in the calculation of drag forces the eddy interaction model is implemented to model the turbulence induced sediment suspensions where a fluctuating component of velocities are introduced to the drag forces through a stochastic procedure which is outlined as follows a initially at t 0 the time marker t mark i and eddy interaction time t i i are set to zero for each particle b random numbers σ 1 2 3 are generated and the fluid velocity fluctuation u f i v f i w f i are updated the drag forces are then calculated using eq 6 c the following two scenarios are considered i if t t m a r k i t i i the particle enters a new turbulent eddy and then new gaussian random number σ 1 2 3 are generated and fluid fluctuations are updated with the new values of σ 1 2 3 both t mark i and t i i are updated to the current values ii else if t t m a r k i t i i the particle remains in the same eddy thus the existing gaussian random numbers are retained and t mark i and t i i remains unchanged however the fluid fluctuations are updated with new particle positions i e new k f i after solving the particle velocities and positions the particle informations are communicated to the fluid phase however prior to solving the fluid equations the diffusion model of sun and xiao 2016a see eq 17 is applied to the sediment concentration to obtain a smooth profile the fluid phase is computed in a similar way as the eulerian two phase flow model sedfoam cheng et al 2017a the fluid momentum equation in eq 15 is solved over a collocated grid arrangement in which the velocities and pressure are stored in the cell centers the convection terms including the k ω equations are discretized using a total variation diminishing tvd scheme based on a sweby limiter sweby 1984 the second order central scheme is used for the diffusion terms for the temporal integration a first order implicit euler scheme is used the piso pressure implicit splitting operation algorithm is used for the velocity pressure decoupling so that the continuity equation 18 is satisfied more details on the numerical solution procedures for the fluid solver can be found in rusche 2002 3 model results through preliminary numerical experiments we confirmed that the modeled sediment concentration profile is sensitive to the prediction of fluid tke and the coefficient c 0 in estimating the turbulent eddy life time in the eddy interaction model see eq 36 this is somewhat expected as the turbulent intensity and the eddy interaction time are the main factors differentiating the present stochastic procedure for modeling turbulent diffusion from incoherent random motions therefore we first validated the turbulence closure with direct numerical simulation dns of clear fluid turbulent channel flow after establishing the accuracy of the turbulence closure for clear fluid the coefficient c 0 in the eddy interaction model is calibrated with the dilute suspension experiment of kiger and pan 2002 where the velocity sediment concentration and reynolds shear stress profiles are measured for sand in a steady channel flow over a smooth bed starved bed the calibrated model is then applied to predict the suspended sand concentration and turbulence of another similar dilute suspension experiment reported by muste et al 2005 because the sediment concentration is very dilute 1 and there is negligible deposit on the bed these datasets allow us to solely calibrate the c 0 value in the eddy interaction model without complication from intergranular interactions after the calibration the model is applied to the steady sheet flow experimental configuration of revil baudard et al 2015 a sensitivity analysis of the model results to the c 0 value is investigated in detail to illustrate the effects on the turbulent suspension in steady sheet flow the capability of the present cfdem eim is further demonstrated by comparing predictions of sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness with classical empirical formula 3 1 model calibration of dilute suspension in steady channel flow firstly the lrn k ω turbulence closure is validated against the dns dataset of moser et al 1999 for a clear fluid steady wall bounded channel flow at a reynolds number of r e τ u h ν f 570 moser et al 1999 where h is the channel half width we carried out a 1dv numerical simulation at the same reynolds number with a vertical domain height h 0 02 m a shear free symmetric boundary condition is used at the top boundary while the bottom boundary condition is a no slip wall the standard smooth wall functions for k and ω are used at the bottom wall boundary see eq 31 in both x and y directions periodic boundaries are used and only one grid cell is used in these two directions with a grid size domain size of l x l y 0 02 m the vertical domain is discretized into 168 grid cells with a uniform grid size δ z 0 122 mm the flow is driven by a mean pressure gradient of f x 43 5 pa m so that the bottom frictional velocity is u 0 0285 m s the distance of the first grid center to the bottom boundary patch corresponds to a wall unit δ z 0 5 u δ z ν f 1 76 therefore the first cell center is within the viscous sublayer the comparisons of the mean reynolds shear stress velocity and tke profiles between the lrn k ω model and dns data are shown in fig 1 very good agreements on all three profiles are obtained especially the velocity profile and reynolds shear stress the agreement in the reynolds shear stress profile confirms that the flow has reached a quasi steady state and the flow condition is similar to the dns simulation of moser et al 1999 meanwhile it is evident that the overall shear stress follows a linear profile τ t o t u 2 1 z h in the range of z h 0 1 dashed curve in fig 1b the modeled tke is also remarkably close to the dns data it is evident that the lrn k ω model is able to resolve the peak of turbulent kinetic energy near the bottom wall around z 0 02 h even though the peak value from the lrn k ω closure 4 4 u 2 is slightly smaller than the dns data 4 75 u 2 kiger and pan 2002 later conducted a sediment laden turbulent flow experiment at a similar reynolds number as moser et al 1999 the data of kiger and pan 2002 can be further used to calibrate the c 0 coefficient in the eim in the experiment the half channel height is h 0 02 m which is the same as the clear fluid simulation at r e τ 570 and hence we kept the same domain setup and boundary conditions as the clear fluid 1dv simulation in the dem implementation the particles are tracked in a meshless 3d domain domain size is the same as in the cfd the lateral boundaries in dem are periodic while the wall boundary was used for both the top and bottom boundaries to conserve the number of particles in the domain the sediments are spherical particles with a density of ρ s 2605 kg m3 and the grain diameter is d 0 195 mm the particle settling velocity is about 0 024 m s which corresponds to a shape factor η 1 in the drag model see eqs 8 11 the domain averaged sediment volumetric concentration in the experiment is φ 2 3 10 4 to match the domain averaged sediment concentration in kiger and pan 2002 a total of n 476 particles are simulated in the dem to calibrate the c 0 value in the eim we carried out four simulations with different c 0 values c 0 1 2 3 4 the resulting profiles of the streamwise velocity tke and sediment concentration are compared with the measured data of kiger and pan 2002 and clear fluid dns data of moser et al 1999 in fig 2 due to the dilute sediment concentration in the domain the numerical results of the streamwise velocity profile are not very sensitive to the c 0 values so only the velocity profiles corresponding to c 0 3 is shown we notice that the measured velocity profile differs slightly from the dns data possibly due to the effect of the presence of sediment in the water column and or measurement uncertainties in addition the averaged particle velocity profile not shown is very close to the fluid velocity the measured data of the turbulent intensity is only available for the streamwise u r m s and vertical w r m s velocity fluctuations in order to compare the turbulence kinetic energy of numerical results and measured data the spanwise velocity fluctuation is reconstructed following the relationship suggested by jha and bombardelli 2009 v r m s 0 3 u 0 6 u r m s thus the turbulent kinetic energy in the experiment can be estimated by k f u r m s 2 v r m s 2 w r m s 2 2 the model results also predict slightly smaller turbulence kinetic energy compared with clear fluid counterpart but the reduction is very small due to dilute sediment concentration overall the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy profiles are in good agreement with the measured data the sediment concentration profiles corresponding to different c 0 values are presented in fig 2c solid curves and they can be compared with measured data symbols in fig 2c it is evident that the suspended sediment concentration is strongly affected by the coefficient c 0 in general more significant sediment suspension is obtained with a larger c 0 value clearly a c 0 value of 1 under predicts the suspended sediment concentration and almost all the sediment particles accumulate near the bottom z h 0 15 see magenta curve in fig 2c when the c 0 value is increased to c 0 2 considerably more sediments are suspended however the resulting sediment concentration remains to be lower than the measured data the optimum c 0 value is found to be c 0 3 and the resulting sediment concentration profile is in good agreement with the measured data finally using c 0 4 clearly over predicts sediment concentration it is well known that the sediment concentration profile in a steady turbulent channel flow follows the rouse profile vanoni 2006 38 ϕ ϕ r h z z z r h z r r o where r o w s s c κ u is the rouse number in which the schmidt number sc is the ratio of turbulent eddy viscosity over the sediment diffusivity zr is the reference location above the bed and ϕr is the concentration at the reference location we choose the reference location to be z r 0 1 h corresponding to the lowest elevation that the reynolds shear stress follows a linear profile the dashed curve in fig 2c shows the fitted rouse profile to the measured data with the rouse number r o 1 44 it is evident that both the measured data and the numerical result with c 0 3 match the rouse profile very well the calibrated c 0 is further applied to another similar dilute suspension experiment reported by muste et al 2005 see table 2 the flow is driven by a prescribed pressure gradient force in order to match the bottom friction velocity of u 0 042 m s in a flow depth of h 0 021 m the sand density is ρ s 2650 kg m3 and the grain diameter is d 0 23 mm the measured settling velocity is about 2 4 cm s which correspond to a shape factor of η 0 644 see eqs 8 11 a similar numerical setup as the simulation of kiger and pan 2002 is used except that the domain height is h 0 021 m to match the experimental condition the streamwise and spanwise domain lengths are specified to be l x l y 100 d in the vertical direction uniform grid sizes are used with n z 210 grids to resolve the entire flow depth and the first grid center above the bottom wall corresponds to a wall unit δ z 1 05 a total number of particles used in the dem is n 803 which matches the domain averaged concentration φ 4 6 10 4 the model results of velocity profile concentration profile and tke kf profile with c 0 3 are compared with the measured data in fig 3 the resulting fluid velocity profile fig 3a matches the measured data reasonably well except that the velocity magnitude is slightly over predicted in the range of 0 1 z h 0 5 the normalized sediment concentration normalized by the mean concentration ϕr at the reference location z r h 0 1 shows that the suspended sediment concentration profile is similar to the measured data as well as the rouse profile with a rouse number r o 0 86 dashed curve in fig 3b in fig 3c the numerical result of tke is compared with the measured data the measured data of the turbulent intensity is reconstructed in the same way as the measurement of kiger and pan 2002 overall the magnitude of the turbulent kinetic energy is smaller than the measured data by no more than 30 however the vertical profile shape is reproduced well by the model in summary the lrn k ω model is validated using a clear fluid dns dataset of moser et al 1999 and the eddy interaction model is calibrated by using the measurements from kiger and pan 2002 and muste et al 2005 it is found that the optimum c 0 value that matches the measured concentration profiles for both experiments is c 0 3 0 while c 0 3 0 underestimated the suspended sediment concentration therefore this calibrated c 0 value is applied to the sheet flow applications in the following subsection 3 2 steady sheet flow in this section we further apply cfdem eim to model steady sheet flow where both bedload inter granular interaction dominant and suspended load turbulent suspension dominant are important the laboratory experiments reported by revil baudard et al 2015 2016 which include a steady flow over a rough fixed bed fb and a steady sheet flow mobile bed mb were used for model validation the flow condition and sediment properties are summarized in table 3 the sediment particles are irregularly shaped with density ρ s 1192 kg m3 and median grain diameter d 3 mm the resulting mean settling velocity is measured to be w s 5 59 cm s similar to the case ns1 in muste et al 2005 we used a sphericity of η 0 594 to match the settling velocity with the experiment while the original grain size d is retained in the dem contact model in the dem model the young s modulus of particles is specified as e 5 10 6 pa the restitution coefficient is e 0 5 the coulomb friction coefficient is μ c 0 5 and the poison ratio is ν 0 45 in the fixed bed fb experiment these particles are glued to the bed forming a single layer rough elements while the bed is covered by thick layers of particles in the mb case and the particles are free to move we first carried out a numerical simulation of the case fb to establish the accuracy of the present numerical model on hydrodynamics before presenting more complicated mobile bed sheet flow model validation to simulate the flow over fixed rough bottom a single layer of particles are fixed above the bottom boundary in the dem i e the particle velocities are zero and their positions are fixed the rough wall function eq 34 is used with a bed roughness k s 2 5 d to estimate the ωbed in the turbulence closure in the experiment of revil baudard et al 2016 the flow depth above the fixed particles is about h 0 105 m the vertical domain length is chosen to be l z h d 0 108 m with a uniform grid size of δ z 0 25 mm therefore the fixed bed layer is resolved by the first 12 grid points above the bottom the measured bottom frictional velocity in the experiment is u 0 052 m s to match the bottom shear stress the flow driving force is prescribed as f x 25 8 pa m the model results of the fluid velocity reynolds shear stress and the tke profiles are compared with the measured data in fig 4 where the fixed particle layer is also denoted as circle symbols due to the drag force from the fixed particles above the bottom the velocity profile drops to zero within the fixed bed layer and good agreements in the streamwise velocity profiles are obtained with the measured data the modeled reynolds shear stress profile captures the linear decaying shape dashed curve and it matches the experimental data reasonably well in particular the reynolds averaged closure provides a good prediction of the tke magnitude throughout most of the water column the good agreement with the fb case confirms that the turbulence closure works well for the steady flow over a rough fixed sediment bed the mobile bed sheet flow see case mb in table 3 is then studied with a thick layer of particles at the bottom of the domain to prepare the sediment bed the particle velocities are initialized to be zero and 43 929 particles are well mixed in the whole domain due to the gravitational settling the particles settle down to the bottom until their kinematic energies are minimized after this initialization step the initial bed level locates at z 0 045 m above the bottom of the domain due to the sediment suspension the final bed depth at the quasi steady state will be smaller through a preliminary test we determined that the total vertical domain height should be l z 0 168 m so that the final flow depth of h 0 128 m sediment bed location becomes z b 0 04 m can be obtained after the flow reaches the steady state the vertical domain is discretized into 168 grid cells with a uniform grid size δ z 0 001 m the streamwise and spanwise domain lengths are l x 0 144 m and l y 0 072 m in these two horizontal directions only one cfd grid cell is used in each direction to confirm the model domain size is adequate we carried out a comparative case by reducing the streamwise domain length by half l x 0 072 m and the model results on mean flow quantities show good convergence the same coefficient c 0 3 calibrated for dilute suspension see section 3 1 is used here for the sheet flow simulation using the lrn k ω model the snapshot of the horizontal fluid velocity profile and sediment particle distribution after the flow reaches the statistically steady state is shown in fig 5 although the flow is solved using a reynolds averaged turbulence closure the stochastic motions of the sediment particles are captured by the eddy interaction model and particle collisions as a result of the eddy interaction model the sediment particles are suspended away from the bed via turbulent suspension the numerical results of the mean velocity profile normalized concentration profile sediment fluxes q s ϕ u s and tke profiles are compared with the measured data in fig 6 to reduce the fluctuations due to stochastic motion of particles time averaging with a 10 second window is applied to calculate the mean flow quantity after the flow reaches steady state in panel a we observe that the modeled fluid velocity profile is similar to the measured data in the upper water column z z b 7 d when sediment concentration is very dilute in the region of intermediate sediment concentration 0 z z b d 7 sediment velocity is slightly smaller than the fluid velocity and agrees with measured velocity profile this lag in sediment phase velocity is consistent with many particle laden flow observations e g muste et al 2005 pal et al 2016 the modeled velocity profiles without the eddy interaction model are similar and hence they are not shown here for brevity very near the bed z z b 3 d the model over predicts the velocity gradient while the measured data shows a milder increase of velocity away from the bottom in the range of 0 z z b 7 d as a result the numerical model under predicts the shear layer thickness above the bed according to revil baudard et al 2015 the large nearbed shear layer observed in the experiment may be related to the nearbed intermittencies even though the eim is used for the turbulence sediment interaction the stochastic model is still too simple to model the bed intermittency and a turbulence resolving simulation approach may be necessary for such feature cheng et al 2017b the sediment concentration profiles normalized by the maximum sediment concentration ϕmax are compared in fig 6b it shall be noted that our numerical model predicts that the maximum sediment concentration is ϕmax 0 635 while the measured data gives ϕ m a x 0 55 the discrepancy in the maximum packing concentration is probably related to the non spherical particle shape used in the experiments from the normalized sediment concentration profiles we can see that the modeled sediment concentration with eim shows a more smooth vertical distribution and is more consistent with measured concentration profile on the other hand the concentration profile without the eim indicates that a dense thin transport layer is predicted between 3 d z z b 5 d consequently excessive sediment accumulation occurs in this region and sediment flux is over predicted see fig 6c this feature is similar to typical bedload transport model results for much coarser particles or aeolian transport durán et al 2012 here the shoulder shape concentration profile is clearly absent in the measured data and the model result with eim shows a better agreement at the higher shields parameter and a fall parameter ratio of settling velocity to friction velocity around 1 or smaller the suspended transport becomes non negligible this point will be discussed more extensively in section 4 2 comparisons presented here indicate that the eim can effectively model the turbulent diffusion of sediment concentration therefore including the eddy interaction model in reynolds averaged formulation is essential to accurately model sediment concentration although the concentration profile with c 0 3 captures the main features similar to the measured data it is clear that the present model underpredicts the sediment suspension in the range of 5 d z z b 10 d and hence the sediment flux is also underpredicted see panel c in fig 6 while it is possible to further increase c 0 increase turbulent suspension to match the measured data better it may not be physically valid the tke profiles are further compared with the measured data in fig 6d firstly we can see that including excluding the eim has negligible impact on the modeled tke profile and both results show under prediction of tke away from the bed z z b d 7 and very near the bed z z b d 3 as presented in fig 4 the model predicts the tke profile very well for fixed rough bed condition of similar bottom friction velocity inter comparison of the measured tke between the fb and mb conditions indicate that turbulence is enhanced by about 40 away from the bed 7 z z b d 25 and a significant enhancement is also observed very near the bed z z b d 3 in the mobile bed experiment revil baudard et al 2016 attribute the enhancement of turbulence to near bed intermittency more recent eulerian two phase large eddy simulation study cheng et al 2017b further demonstrated that turbulence above the concentrated sheet layer z z b d 7 can be enhanced through these frequent but intermittent sediment burst events it is noted that the present turbulence averaged model is not designed to capture these intermittent turbulent features in summary including the eddy interaction model is required for the prediction of sediment concentration and sediment flux under sheet flow conditions although sediment concentration in the dilute region is under predicted with c 0 3 in the eim the discrepancy is believed to be caused by under prediction of turbulence due to intermittent turbulent features but not eim itself the sensitivity of the modeled suspended sediment concentration will be discussed in more details subsequently 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of sediment diffusivity to the coefficient c 0 as demonstrated in section 3 1 for the channel flow with dilute sediment suspension the sediment concentration profiles are sensitive to the coefficient c 0 in the eddy interaction model and the suspended sediment concentration gradient increases with c 0 values it is clear that the gradient of sediment concentration profile is related to the particle dispersion or sediment diffusion in this section we further analyze the sensitivity of the suspended sediment concentrations and the sediment diffusivity to the coefficient c 0 under steady sheet flow conditions by varying c 0 2 3 6 and 8 the effect of c 0 values on the sediment concentration profile is illustrated in fig 7 similar to the rouse profile in dilute particle laden flows eq 38 the rouse profile in the sheet flow can be determined as 39 ϕ ϕ r z z b h z b z h z b z r z r z b r o in practice the rouse profile is only applicable when the turbulent suspension is dominant while the particle particle interactions are negligible therefore the reference location zr is chosen to be the lowest elevation at which the reynolds shear stress follows a linear profile the shear stress profiles corresponding to different c 0 values are shown in fig 7a the reynolds shear stress profile is nearly unaffected by the c 0 value meanwhile the reynolds shear stress follows the linear distribution above z z b d 7 5 and therefore it can be conjectured that the inter granular stress becomes important below z z b d 7 5 and a common reference location z r z b 7 5 d is chosen the normalized sediment concentration profiles are plotted in logarithmic scale in fig 7b where the thick curves are numerical results and thin dash dot curves are the corresponding fitted rouse profiles the modeled sediment concentration profiles fit the rouse profile well in the dilute region z z b 7 d for all the c 0 values tested however different slopes of concentration profiles were observed by varying c 0 values we quantify the slope of sediment concentration in logarithmic scale using the rouse number ro see eq 39 for c 0 2 nearly no sediment is suspended above z z b d 15 and the rouse number r o 4 78 is large compared with the measured data r o 2 14 using c 0 3 sediments are suspended much higher in the water column and the resulting r o 2 98 is significantly lower further increasing c 0 to 6 and 8 the rouse number reduced to 2 42 and 1 64 although the model result using c 0 6 matches the measured sediment concentration profile as discussed before increasing c 0 may not be physically justified because the predicted suspended sediment concentration also depends on modeled turbulence quantities for given sediment properties and flow conditions the rouse number depends on the schmidt number sc which is defined as the ratio between the fluid turbulent eddy viscosity νft and the sediment diffusivity νp in many reynolds averaged eulerian simulations of sediment transport e g hsu et al 2004 revil baudard and chauchat 2013 cheng et al 2017a the gradient transport assumption is adopted 40 w s ϕ ν p ϕ z where the sediment diffusivity is often parameterized by the turbulent eddy viscosity ν p ν f t s c with a constant schmidt number e g hsu et al 2003 chen et al 2011 cheng et al 2017a alternatively the sediment diffusivity may be evaluated as ν p w s ϕ ϕ z by considering the balance between the turbulent suspension flux and the settling flux w s ϕ w s ϕ in the present model the sediment motion is directly resolved by a lagrangian approach and the eddy interaction model is incorporated to simulate the sediment suspension by the flow turbulence therefore it is interesting to evaluate the eddy interaction model in terms of the resulting sediment diffusivity and schmidt number the vertical profiles of turbulent eddy viscosity and sediment diffusivity for c 0 2 3 6 and 8 are compared in fig 8 a and b the turbulent eddy viscosity profiles obtained using different c 0 values are similar to each other and their vertical distributions are close to the measured data however the magnitude of the eddy viscosity is over predicted compared with the measured data recall in fig 6 d that the present model also underpredicts tke we can conclude that the model may significantly underpredict ω due to inability to resolve intermittent turbulent motion and sediment burst this may provide some useful insights to further improve the present k ω model for two phase flow in the future as shown in fig 8 b the vertical profiles of the sediment diffusivities are sensitive to the c 0 values see fig 8 b and the sediment diffusivity increases with the increasing values of c 0 because discrepancies exist in both eddy viscosity and sediment diffusivity the overall evaluation was also examined by the ratio of these two quantities namely the schmidt number the resulting schmidt numbers s c ν f t ν p are presented in fig 8 c we noticed that the predicted schmidt number was more or less a constant in the suspension layer z z b 6 d for all the runs regardless of c 0 values and this feature is consistent with the measurement with c 0 3 the resulting schmidt number is around unity sc 1 which is significantly larger than the measured value sc 0 44 the observed larger schmidt number is consistent with the under prediction of suspended sediment concentration and over prediction of eddy viscosity discussed above by increasing the value of c 0 to 6 and 8 the resulting schmidt number decreased to sc 0 75 and sc 0 65 respectively with this analysis we can also conclude that simply increasing c 0 cannot reproduce the measured schmidt because the eddy viscosity is over predicted by the present two phase flow k ω model in summary we showed that the discrepancies in the sediment diffusivity and schmidt number could be due to the inability of the reynolds averaged model to capture the nearbed intermittencies as observed in the sheet flow experiment of revil baudard et al 2015 the nearbed intermittency enhances the turbulent intensities within the dense layer and upper water column as a result the present model underpredicted turbulent intensity in these regions which can further cause the underprediction of the suspended sediment concentration to fully understand the dependence of schmidt number on turbulent flow characteristics and sediment properties a more sophisticated turbulence resolving models may be needed secondly several interphase momentum transfer forces such as the added mass and lift forces are neglected in the present study it is expected that these interphase transfer forces are less important for heavy sand particles however they can become important for lightweight coarse particles jha and bombardelli 2010 finally we shall note that detailed experimental measurements on natural sand transport in sheet flow are needed to study the relevance of this nearbed intermittency of lightweight particles for the sand transport more comprehensive investigations are warranted for future work 4 2 transport rate and transport layer thickness the present model is applied to study the role of turbulent suspension modeled by eim on sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness in sediment transport applications the sediment transport rate is often of high interest as it is directly used in regional scale models to study morphological evolutions e g lesser et al 2004 warner et al 2008 many steady flow experiments revealed that the dimensionless sediment transport rate can be parameterized by the non dimensional bottom shear stress e g meyer peter and muller 1948 nnadi and wilson 1992 ribberink 1998 the non dimensional form of the bottom shear stress is called shields parameter θ τ b ρ s ρ f g d to evaluate the model capability to predict sediment transport rate we carried out 14 cases with shields parameter ranging from θ 0 3 to 1 2 with without eim see table 4 the resulting sediment concentration profiles and sediment flux profiles for three representative shields parameters θ 0 5 0 8 and 1 2 are shown in fig 9 where panels a b corresponds to the results with eim and panels c d corresponds to the results without eim as the shear stress exerted on the granular bed increases the shear induced dilation causes a larger erosion depth in the dense layer ϕ ϕ m a x 0 5 or z z b d 3 see fig 9a and c this phenomenon is similar to the observations of boyer et al 2011 for dense immersed granular flows and it occurs regardless of the eim as a result of the shear induced dilation more sediments are eroded as the shields parameter increases the vertical location corresponding to ϕ ϕ m a x 0 5 is lower as θ increases between 3 5 z z b d 10 the turbulent suspension mechanism is missing without eim thus a steep concentration gradient is obtained in each case in fig 9 c as a consequence of the much rapid decrease of sediment concentration below ϕ ϕ m a x 0 3 the sediment transport flux occurs mostly in the relatively dense layer see fig 9d e g sediment flux is nearly zero for z z b d 8 for the case with the highest shields parameter on the other hand when eim is incorporated to model turbulent suspension sediments are suspended further away from the bed the sediment transport flux in the relatively dilute layer ϕ ϕ m a x 0 3 is significantly larger and the total flux is expected to be larger compared with the cases without eim see fig 9b the sediment transport rate can be obtained by integrating the sediment transport flux qs over the entire vertical domain and the dimensionless sediment transport rate can be computed as durán et al 2012 41 ψ i 1 n v i v i l x l y s 1 g d 3 in this study the sediment transport rate obtained with eim is denoted as ψt while the transport rate without eim is denoted as ψb according to the previous experimental results on the sediment transport rate a general form of power law relationships between the dimensionless sediment transport rate and the excess shields parameter θ θ c can be written as 42 ψ m 0 θ θ c n 0 where a typical critical shields parameter θ c 0 05 is used several different values of the coefficient m 0 and n 0 were proposed from various experimental results on the basis of the flume experiments for rather coarse sand d 3 mm at low shields parameter θ 0 2 meyer peter and muller 1948 proposed that m 0 5 7 and n 0 1 5 this is the well known power law where the transport rate is proportional to the 3 2 power of the excess shields parameter θ θ c based on the duct flow experiment with a smaller grain size d 0 7 mm at higher shields parameters θ 1 nnadi and wilson 1992 suggested that the coefficient m 0 should be increased to m 0 12 more recent study by ribberink 1998 found that the power 3 2 should be increased to about 1 67 as the suspended load becomes important when the shields parameter becomes larger the numerical results of the dimensionless sediment transport rates as a function of the shields parameters are plotted in fig 10 clearly the sediment transport rates predicted with eim circle symbols and without eim triangle symbols increase rapidly when the shields parameter increases and this trend follows the empirical power law eq 42 very well the dash dot curve in fig 10 shows the power law with n 0 1 5 meyer peter and muller 1948 and the resulting best fit is m 0 8 1 however the fitted curve with a power of n 0 1 5 over predicts the sediment transport rate for lower shields parameters θ 1 while the transport rate in the higher shields parameter range is under predicted on the other hand the best fit of the power law for the present model results gives m 0 8 27 and n 0 2 0 which is consistent the values reported by ribberink 1998 m 0 10 4 and n 0 1 67 in addition the transport rate without eim is also compared with that of eim it is evident that the transport rate without eim is generally smaller and the discrepancy increases as the shields parameter increases if we further fit the transport rate obtained without eim into the power law formula we obtain that m 0 5 5 and n 0 2 0 it is interesting to note that although the proportionality constant m 0 is much lower than that of eim the power n 0 remains the same as shown in fig 9 b and d the sediment horizontal flux mainly occurs within a thick layer of about 10 15 grain diameters above the bed in sheet flow applications the transport layer thickness is another quantity of interest because this is where a large portion of transport takes place for example wilson 1987 argues that mobile beds at high shear stresses can neither be considered as a rough or smooth fixed wall but they obey their own friction law with a frictional length scale proportional to the thickness of the major transport layer wilson 1987 defined the major transport layer thickness as the distance of the lowest mobile bed layer us 1 mm s and the sediment concentration ϕ 8 however we noticed that using the 8 threshold may neglect too much transport for the present analysis and a lower threshold may be more appropriate here we define the transport layer directly from the sediment flux profile where the dimensionless sediment flux is larger than a small threshold q s s 1 g d 0 05 the resulting transport layer thickness with eim δt and without eim δb are compared in fig 10b it is evident that the transport layer thickness increases with the shields parameter according to the experimental observations e g wilson 1987 sumer et al 1996 the transport layer thickness is nearly proportional to the grain diameter and shields parameter as shown in fig 10b we can see that a linear relationship can be found regardless of whether eim is adopted or not even though the proportionality coefficients are quite different without eim the transport layer thickness can be well described as δ b d 6 18 θ however the transport layer thickness with eim is much larger δ s d 10 28 θ with the proportional coefficient very close to the value 10 as suggested by wilson 1987 according to bagnold 1966 the particle suspension occurs when the dominant vertical velocity of the turbulent eddies exceeds the particle settling velocity assuming that the vertical velocity fluctuation can be quantified by the vertical turbulent velocity fluctuation we can assume that the turbulent suspension is important if w r m s w s in the present model an isotropic turbulence is assumed such that the vertical turbulence intensity is approximated as w r m s 2 k 3 nezu 1993 suggested that the maximum tke can be estimated as 4 78 u 2 for turbulent flow over smooth bed in the present sheet sediment transport with coarse light particles the maximum tke can be reasonably represented by 3 u 2 see fig 6d thus the turbulent suspension can be initiated when the shear velocity satisfies w s u 2 this is similar to the discussion of van rijn 1984b and sumer et al 1996 where they suggested that the relative importance between suspended load and bedload sediment transport can be categorized by the fall parameter f w s u as summarized in table 4 the fall parameter varies from 1 44 to 0 72 as the shear velocity increases from 3 87 to 7 74 cm s from the previous discussion on the sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness it is found that the difference of the transport rate between the results with and without eim is negligible when the shields parameter is smaller than 0 5 fall parameter f 1 25 however when the shields parameter is larger than 0 5 or f 1 25 the difference becomes noticeable to carry out more quantitative analysis we consider that the turbulent suspension is most significant for the suspended load which mainly occurs in the region of ϕ 0 08 the non dimensional suspended load sediment transport rate can be defined as 43 ψ s u s 1 s 1 g d 3 z ϕ 0 08 l z ϕ u s d z to illustrate the importance of eim on the prediction of suspended sediment flux the suspended load with without eim are compared in fig 11 for a range of fall parameters as the fall parameter increases the sediment particles are less likely to be suspended by the turbulent eddies thus the suspended sediment transport reduces rapidly this is confirmed by the results of eim where the non dimensional suspended sediment transport rate is reduced from 1 4 to 0 2 when the fall parameter increases from 0 72 to 1 44 however we can see that the suspended load predicted without eim is quite small around 0 2 and more or less a constant independent of the fall parameter this indicates that the eim is essential to capture the suspended sediment flux for f 1 25 suspended load flux can be significantly under predicted and eim should be included in the euler lagrange model for steady sheet flows 5 conclusion in this paper a reynolds averaged euler lagrange sediment transport model was developed and applied to steady sheet flow where the inter granular interaction is directly resolved and the turbulent suspension of particles is modeled using an eddy interaction model a lrn k ω model extended for two phase flow is implemented for the flow turbulence which also provides the required turbulence statistics for the eddy interaction model the eddy interaction model was first calibrated using the dilute suspension experiments of kiger and pan 2002 and muste et al 2005 while the model is able to predict the measured flow velocity and turbulence kinetic energy very well the model results are found to be sensitive to the coefficient c 0 associated with the eddy particle interaction time see eq 36 and a value of c 0 3 is calibrated to match the measured concentration profile in the dilute particle laden flow after calibrating the eddy interaction model for dilute suspension an application of cfdem eim to steady sheet flow was carried out by simulating the laboratory experiment of revil baudard et al 2015 with c 0 3 although good agreements for flow velocity turbulence kinetic energy sediment concentration and sediment flux profiles are obtained for most of the sheet flow layer the model clearly underpredicts turbulence and suspended sediment concentration in the dilute region the underpredicted suspended sediment concentration is quantified by sediment diffusivity and we found that the sediment diffusivity decreases as the coefficient c 0 increases while the fluid turbulent eddy viscosity is not sensitive to c 0 values as a result the resulting schmidt number ratio of fluid eddy viscosity to the sediment diffusivity reduces as c 0 increases however the schmidt number cannot be reduced to the measured value of 0 44 unless an unrealistic large value of c 0 is used therefore it is likely that the under prediction of suspended sediment concentration in the dilute region is mainly due to underprediction of turbulence kinetic energy above the major sheet flow layer as the higher level of turbulence may be associated with intermittent sediment burst events especially pronounced for lightweight particles revil baudard et al 2015 a turbulence resolving approach for the present euler lagrange model may be necessary meanwhile as the model can reproduce the major features of sheet flow layer a model investigation was carried out to investigate the role of eim and the resulting turbulent suspension on sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness model results confirmed that the non dimensional transport rate follows a power law with the shields parameter consistent with empirical formulations significant underprediction of sediment transport rate were obtained without eim due to lack of turbulent suspension and the discrepancy between the result of eim and without eim is more pronounced when the fall parameter is lower than 1 25 relatively smaller setting velocity or larger bottom friction velocity further analysis on transport layer thickness suggests that only when eim is incorporated the model is able to reproduce the well known formula suggested by wilson 1987 future improvements of the present cfdem eim are suggested in the following aspects first the eddy interaction model is included only in the drag force while the other interphase momentum transfer forces such as added mass and lift forces are ignored however their relative importance to the drag force in the eddy interaction model needs more investigations especially for lightweight coarse particles secondly even though the particles are tracked in a 3d domain with a lagrangian approach the fluid is solved only in a 1dv domain and the flow is assumed to be homogeneous in the streamwise and spanwise directions this assumption is reasonable for typical sheet flow conditions however for flows over nonuniform bathymetry or bedforms this assumption is violated and multi dimensional simulations are needed for the fluid phase thirdly the turbulence is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic thus the eddy interaction model may be too simple to reproduce the inhomogeneous features such as turbulent burst and preferential concentrations within the context of turbulence averaged formulation more sophisticated turbulence closure and eddy interaction schemes can be pursued fourthly it is noted that the model results are sensitive to the estimation of eddy life time which is also highly variable based on the flow condition coimbra et al 1998 and a more sophisticated turbulence model that directly resolves the eddy life time will be highly viable furthermore to make good use of the coupled euler lagrange scheme cfdem eim should be extensively applied to study the effects of grain size distribution and grain shape on sediment transport calantoni et al 2004 calantoni and thaxton 2008 fukuoka et al 2014 harada and gotoh 2008 harada et al 2015 finally the present study focused on developing a robust turbulence averaged euler lagrange model for various sediment transport applications however we also identified several outstanding issues in sheet flow sediment transport requiring further investigations such as near bed intermittency and sediment diffusivity which may require a turbulence resolving simulation approach clearly a fundamental understanding on many aspects of turbulence particle interactions must be addressed by turbulence resolving simulations and some encouraging works using the cfdem framework have been reported schmeeckle 2014 sun and

911,a reynolds averaged euler lagrange sediment transport model cfdem eim was developed for steady sheet flow where the inter granular interactions were resolved and the flow turbulence was modeled with a low reynolds number corrected k ω turbulence closure modified for two phase flows to model the effect of turbulence on the sediment suspension the interaction between the turbulent eddies and particles was simulated with an eddy interaction model eim the eim was first calibrated with measurements from dilute suspension experiments we demonstrated that the eddy interaction model was able to reproduce the well known rouse profile for suspended sediment concentration the model results were found to be sensitive to the choice of the coefficient c 0 associated with the turbulence sediment interaction time a value c 0 3 was suggested to match the measured concentration in the dilute suspension the calibrated cfdem eim was used to model a steady sheet flow experiment of lightweight coarse particles and yielded reasonable agreements with measured velocity concentration and turbulence kinetic energy profiles further numerical experiments for sheet flow suggested that when c 0 was decreased to c 0 3 the simulation under predicted the amount of suspended sediment in the dilute region and the schmidt number is over predicted sc 1 0 additional simulations for a range of shields parameters between 0 3 and 1 2 confirmed that cfdem eim was capable of predicting sediment transport rates similar to empirical formulations based on the analysis of sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness the eim and the resulting suspended load were shown to be important when the fall parameter is less than 1 25 keywords euler lagrange model eddy interaction model turbulent suspension steady sheet flow rouse profile sediment transport rate 1 introduction studying sediment transport in rivers and coastal regions is critical to understand the fluvial geomorphology loss of wetland and beach erosion for example significant engineering efforts were devoted to control the river discharge and sediment budget to reduce the loss of louisiana wetland allison et al 2012 mossa 1996 in the indian river inlet significant erosion of the north beach is mitigated through proper beach nourishment that interacts with littoral drift keshtpoor et al 2013 the characteristics of sediment transport vary significantly with sediment properties and flow conditions and it is widely believed that sheet flow plays a dominant role in nearshore beach erosion and riverine sediment delivery especially during storm and flood conditions respectively sheet flow is an intense sediment transport mode in which a thick layer of concentrated sediment is mobilized above the quasi static bed the conventional single phase based sediment transport models assume the dynamics of transport can be subjectively separated into bedload and suspended load e g van rijn 1984a 1984b while the suspended load are directly resolved the bedload are parameterized by empirical formulations several laboratory measurements of sheet flow with the full profile of sediment transport flux and net transport rate indicated that the split of bedload and suspended load may be too simple because sediment entrainment deposition is a continuous and highly dynamic process near the mobile bed e g o donoghue and wright 2004 revil baudard et al 2015 in sheet flow the two prevailing mechanisms driving the sediment transport are inter granular interactions and turbulent suspension jenkins and hanes 1998 revil baudard et al 2015 in order to model the full profile of sediment transport both mechanisms must be taken into account in the past decade many eulerian two phase flow models have been developed for sheet flow transport in steady jenkins and hanes 1998 longo 2005 revil baudard and chauchat 2013 and oscillatory flows dong and zhang 2002 hsu et al 2004 amoudry et al chen et al 2011 cheng et al 2017a liu and sato 2006 by solving the mass and momentum equations of fluid phase and sediment phase with appropriate closures for interphase momentum transfer turbulence and intergranular stresses these models are able to resolve the entire profiles of sediment transport without the assumption of bedload and suspended load in the continuum description of the sediment phase the assumption of uniform particle properties and spherical particle shapes are usually adopted to better capture the polydisperse nature of sediment transport and irregular particle shapes the lagrangian approach for the particle phase namely the discrete element method dem cundall and strack 1979 maurin et al 2015 sun and xiao 2016a is superior to the eulerian approach because individual particle properties may be uniquely specified calantoni et al 2004 fukuoka et al 2014 harada and gotoh 2008 one of the main challenges in modeling sheet flow arise from the various length scales involved in inter granular interactions and sediment turbulence interactions to resolve the flow turbulence and turbulence sediment interactions in sheet flow the computational domain needs to be sufficiently large to resolve the largest eddies while the grid resolution should be small enough to resolve the energy containing turbulent eddies this constrain becomes even more challenging in the euler lagrange modeling framework large domains require both a large number of grid points to resolve a sufficient amount of turbulence energy cascade i e large eddy simulation and a large number of particles in a given simulation e g finn et al 2016 it is well established that in sheet flow the transport layer thickness scales with the grain size and the shields parameter wilson 1987 suggesting that a common sheet flow layer thickness must be about several tens of grain diameters to simulate the largest eddies and their subsequent cascade the domain lengths in the two horizontal directions must be proportional to the boundary layer thickness which is usually about several tens of centimeters for a bed layer thickness of 50 grains with a typical grain diameter of 0 2 mm sheet flow simulations may require at least several tens of millions of particles therefore to efficiently model sediment transport for many scenarios in sheet flow a turbulence averaged approach for the carrier phase may be necessary in a turbulence averaged formulation turbulent eddies are not resolved and their effects on the averaged flow field are often parameterized via eddy viscosity in this case the domain lengths in the two horizontal directions are solely determined by the largest length scale of inter granular interaction which is usually captured within 50 grain diameters maurin et al 2015 consequently the number of particles needed for each sheet flow simulation is limited to no more than a few hundred thousand with a goal to develop a robust open source coupled computational fluid dynamics discrete element method cfd dem for sheet flow applications we adopt a turbulence averaged approach in this study existing reynolds averaged cfd dem models have the capability to model bedload transport durán et al 2012 maurin et al 2015 and sheet flow for coarse sand drake and calantoni 2001 where the inter granular interactions are dominant and the turbulent suspension is of minor importance the previous studies made significant progresses in understanding the sediment dynamics due to intergranular collisions and interactions with the mean flow and the key characteristics such as sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness close to the empirical formulations were obtained in more energetic sheet flows with medium to fine sand particles the role of turbulence induced suspension can become important where substantial sediment suspension occurs above the bedload layer bagnold 1966 sumer et al 1996 in such condition a more complete closure models for turbulent suspension and turbulence modulation by particles are needed the natural way of describing the diffusion and dispersion of dispersed particles is to sample the turbulent velocity statistics along their trajectories in a stochastic manner taylor 1922 and this idea lays the foundation of modeling the turbulent motions of particles with a lagrangian approach in the stochastic lagrange model for particle dispersion the turbulent agitation to the sediment particles are considered either through a random walk model rwm or an eddy interaction model eim in the rwm framework the strength of particle velocity fluctuations are typically assumed to be similar to the fluid turbulence and a series of random velocity fluctuations are directly added to the particle velocities while the lagrange model with rwm is successful in studying the particle dispersion in mixing layer coimbra et al 1998 and dilute suspension shi and yu 2015 the assumption of estimating the particle velocity fluctuations based on the fluid turbulence is crucial and many researchers found that the correlation between the particle and fluid fluctuations are highly dependent on the particle stokes number s t t p t l balachandar and eaton 2010 where tp is the particle response time and tl is the characteristic time scale of energetic eddies for the particles with very small inertia st 1 they can closely follow the eddy motion however if st 1 the particle trajectory is hardly affected by the fluid eddy motion due to the particle inertia effect it was found that the fluid turbulent intensity needs to be enhanced for medium to coarse particles shi and yu 2015 this problem can be largely remedied by the eim matida et al 2004 where the fluid velocity fluctuations associated with the fluid turbulence are added through the particle sediment interaction force i e the drag force this approach incorporates the particle inertia effect naturally and it is applicable for a wide range of sediment properties graham 1996 found that the dispersion of inertial particles may be correctly represented with a suitable choice of maximum interaction time and length scales with the eddies this model was later improved by using a randomly sampled eddy interaction time in which more realistic turbulent scales become possible and the enhanced dispersion of high inertia particles are captured in the previous studies of particle dispersion e g shi and yu 2015 the turbulent intensity is either prescribed from the empirical formula or modeled using clear fluid turbulence closure without considering turbulence modulation by the presence of particles in sheet flow it is well known that the sediment turbulence interaction is important in attenuating the flow turbulence thus the presence of sediment can dissipate enhance flow turbulence through drag density stratification in this paper we present an application of the eddy interaction model eim in a reynolds averaged euler lagrange formulation to study sheet flow the eddy interaction model is implemented into an open source coupled cfd dem scheme called cfdem goniva et al 2012 and the new solver is called cfdem eim the fluid phase is modeled in a similar way as the eulerian two phase flow model sedfoam cheng et al 2017a and the particles are modeled with the discrete particle model liggghts kloss et al 2012 the paper is organized in the following manner the model formulation is described in section 2 the model calibration with dilute suspension experiments is presented in section 3 1 followed by model validation of steady sheet flow section 3 2 using a comprehensive dataset revil baudard et al 2015 2016 section 4 discusses the model sensitivity of the resulting sediment diffusivity and schmidt number to model coefficients in the eddy interaction scheme and effects of the eim on the modeled sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness are also evaluated finally a practical regime for the eim to be important is proposed based on the fall parameter concluding remarks are given in section 5 2 model formulations 2 1 discrete particle model in the framework of the discrete element method cundall and strack 1979 the position of each particle is tracked by integrating the particle equation of motion 1 d x p i d t v i where x p i is the position of particle i and v i is the translational velocity the governing equation for the translational motion of particle i with radius ri and mass mi may be written as 2 m i d v i d t f p f i j 1 n c f n i j f t i j m i g the forces acting on the ith particle include the particle fluid interaction force f pf i the gravitational force mi g and the normal f n ij and tangential f t ij contact forces where nc is the number of particles in contact with the particle i the rotational motion of particle i with moment of inertia ii may be written as 3 i i d ω i d t j 1 n c m t i j m r i j where ω i is the angular velocity of particle i the torque acting on particle i from particle j consists of two components closures are used for m t ij which is generated by the tangential force and m r ij which is commonly known as the rolling friction torque luding 2008 to model grain contact forces we adopt the soft sphere approach cundall and strack 1979 based on hertz mindlin theory hertz theory is implemented in the normal direction and the improved mindlin no slip model is implemented in the shear direction mindlin 1949 in the soft sphere model e g renzo and maio 2005 particles are allowed to overlap slightly and the contact between two particles may be described as a nonlinear spring dashpot where the normal contact force f n ij is determined by the overlap δij and relative velocity between colliding particles vr ij while the tangental force f t ij is calculated in a similar way and includes the tangental contact history in addition if the tangential force exceeds the coulomb frictional limit the particles begin to slide and the tangential force is set to f t i j μ c f n i j where μc is the coulomb friction coefficient in the present study we only consider the torque induced by particle particle particle wall contact and the influence of fluid induced torque is ignored in general the particle fluid interaction force f pf is the sum of all types of particle fluid interaction forces on individual particles by fluid including the so called drag force f d the pressure gradient force fp buoyancy force if assuming locally hydrostatic flow virtual mass force f vm basset force f b and lift forces such as the saffman force f saff and the magnus force f mag we assume that the fluid and particles share the pressure field thus the fluid pressure gradient force is also included in the fluid particle interactions maxey and riley 1983 zhou et al 2010 in cfdem eim only the two dominant forces namely the drag force and pressure gradient force are retained here the total fluid particle interaction force acting on particle i may be written as 4 f p f i f d i f p i the pressure gradient force acting on particle i is calculated as 5 f p i f x i i p v i where f x i is the external body force driving the steady flow i p is the interpolated fluid pressure gradient at particle i and vi is the volume of particle i the drag force acting on particle i is expressed as 6 f d i 1 2 c d a s i u f i v i u f i v i where u f i is the instantaneous fluid velocity interpolated at particle i and a s i is the projected area of the ith spherical particle or equivalent spherical particle for non spherical particles according to the reynolds decomposition the instantaneous fluid velocity is decomposed into the reynolds averaged component u f i and the turbulent fluctuating component u f i in cfdem eim the reynolds averaged velocities are provided by the carrier fluid model while the turbulent fluctuating component is modeled with an additional eddy interaction closure see section 2 4 to generalize the drag coefficient for both spherical and non spherical particles the drag coefficient cd is given by haider and levenspiel 1989 7 c d f ϕ 24 r e p 1 a r e p b c 1 d r e p where r e p 1 ϕ u f i v i d i ν f is the particle reynolds number νf is the fluid kinematic viscosity and di is the diameter of the spherical particle or an equivalent sphere that has the same volume as the non spherical particle the four parameters a b c and d are proposed to be functions of particle sphericity η with 8 a exp 2 3288 6 4581 η 2 4486 η 2 9 b 0 0964 0 5565 η 10 c exp 4 905 13 8944 η 18 4222 η 2 10 2599 η 3 11 d exp 1 4681 12 2584 η 20 7322 η 2 15

calculated by averaging the sediment instantaneous sediment concentration within one cfd time step 14 ϕ 1 n s j 1 n s ϕ j where ns is number of dem time steps within one cfd time step see more details in section 2 5 the divided volume fraction model goniva et al 2012 is used for the instantaneous sediment concentration at each dem time step where the particle volumes are divided into 29 parts using the satellite points and the volumes are distributed into the touched fluid grid cells the model works well when particle size is similar to the mesh size 2 2 fluid phase governing equations in contrast of the particle phase the fluid phase is solved in an eulerian framework and the coupled euler lagrange system follows the so called model a e g zhou et al 2010 by further carrying out reynolds averaging the fluid momentum equation may be written as 15 ρ f 1 ϕ u f t ρ f 1 ϕ u f u f 1 ϕ f x 1 ϕ p τ f ρ f 1 ϕ g f d where the overbar denotes the ensemble averaged fields ρf is the fluid density the first term on the right hand side r h s is the external body force that drives the steady flow the second term on r h s is the pressure gradient force τ f is the total fluid stress tensor which includes the viscous stress τ ν and the reynolds stress τ ft the last term on the r h s is the sum of the drag force from the particles within the fluid grid volume vcell which must satisfy the newton s 3rd law 16 f d 1 n s v c e l l j 1 n s i 1 n c e l l f d i the sediment concentration ϕ calculated directly by grid averaging in the dem is usually not smooth and averaging errors may depend on the averaging length scale simeonov et al 2015 to ensure numerical stability a diffusion model is often used to obtain a sufficiently smoothed concentration profile 17 ϕ t d t ϕ the diffusion constant dt is calculated as d t l d 2 d t where ld is a length scale and dt is the fluid phase time step i e cfd time step the choice of length scale l d d is found to be stable and necessary when the fluid grid length is similar to or smaller than the particle diameter capecelatro and desjardins 2013 pirker et al 2011 note that this smoothed concentration field is only used in the fluid governing equations and turbulence closures the model results mainly in sections 3 and 4 of the sediment concentration sediment velocity and transport rate are directly obtained from the dem part i e not smoothed by the diffusion model to ensure a stable calculation of conservation of mass a mixture continuity equation for the incompressible fluid particle system can be derived and is solved cheng et al 2017a 18 1 ϕ u f ϕ u s 0 2 3 fluid turbulence modeling as briefly described in eq 15 the total fluid stress tensor consists of the viscous stress τ ν and the reynolds stress τ ft 19 τ f τ ν τ f

where i is an identity tensor t is the transpose of gradient tensor νft is the turbulent eddy viscosity and kf is the fluid turbulent kinetic energy tke the eddy viscosity and tke are modeled with a low reynolds number version k ω turbulence model lrn k ω closure wilcox 1992 modified for two phase flows 2 3 1 low reynolds number corrected k ω closure for two phase flow in lrn k ω closure the low reynolds number correction was introduced based on the local reynolds number r e t k f ν f ω f with this correction the lrn k ω closure is capable of capturing transitional turbulent flow in the near bed region to take into account of the sediment effect on the flow turbulence the sediment turbulence interaction terms were added to both the transport equations for the fluid tke kf and specific turbulent dissipation frequency ωf similar to the approach suggested by amoudry 2014 and chauchat et al 2017 21 k f t u f k f τ f t ρ f u f ν f ν f t σ k k f c μ k f ω f 2 β 1 λ ϕ k f ρ f 1 ϕ 1 1 ϕ ν

equation are essentially the same as those in the clear fluid tke equation the last term in eq 21 represents the buoyancy term for typical sediment concentration with an upward decaying profile this term represents the well known sediment induced density stratification that can attenuate the fluid turbulence the fourth term on the r h s represents attenuation of tke due to drag with β calculated as 23 β 3 4 ρ f c d u r d where cd is calculated by eq 7 with particle reynolds number r e p 1 ϕ u r d ν f in which ur is the magnitude of relative velocity seen by the fluid here to better estimate ur in dilute condition where instantaneous sediment concentration fluctuation is significant a temporal average of the relative velocity is carried out 24 u r 1 t t 0 t 0 t u f u s d t where t 0 is the starting time of the time average and t is the current run time of the simulation for a steady sheet flow application this time average procedure is representative of the ensemble averaged relative velocity between fluid and sediment phases throughout the simulations in this study the quasi steady state is usually reached within 5 s of numerical simulations thus we choose t 0 5 s to quantify the effect of fluid particle turbulence modulation the parameter λ is introduced by following cheng et al 2017a 25 λ e c s s t where cs is an empirical coefficient s t t p t l is the particle stokes number i e the ratio of the particle response time t p ρ s β to the characteristic time scale of energetic eddies in the literatures of reynolds averaged turbulence closures the general expression for the eddy life time can be written as t l c t c μ ω f and the value of the coefficient ct ranges from 0 135 to 0 41 milojeviè 1990 which is highly dependent on the flow conditions from the preliminary numerical experiment we found the eddy life time is vital for the turbulence sediment interaction thus we chose the coefficient c t 1 6 by following cheng et al 2017a and the model coefficients associated with the eddy life time are left as model calibration for example the coefficient cs in eqn 25 is calibrated using the sheet flow experimental dataset see section 3 2 to match the flow hydrodynamics and it was chosen to be c s 1 the balance equation for ωf follows the original work of wilcox 1992 however for turbulence particle sinteractions similar damping terms as in the kf equation are included the ωf equation is written as 26 ω f t u f ω f c 1 ω ω f k f τ f t ρ f u f ν f ν f t σ ω ω f c 2 ω ω f 2 c 3 ω 2 β 1 λ ϕ ω f ρ f 1 ϕ c 4 ω ω f k f 1 1 ϕ ν f t σ c ρ s ρ f 1 g ϕ ω b e d t r e l a x γ ϕ where the fourth and fifth terms take into account of the sediment effect on the fluid turbulence through drag and buoyancy respectively the coefficients c 1 ω is also modulated using the local turbulent reynolds number as 27 c 1 ω c 1 ω 1 α α 0 r e t r e ω 1 r e t r e ω where α is a damping function based on ret 28 α α 0 r e t r e k 1 r e t r e k where α 0 and rek are model coefficient for the low reynolds number corrections the model constant c 1ω c 2ω σk σω rek reω and α 0 are similar to the closure coefficients suggested by guizien et al 2003 see table 1 the coefficient of the buoyancy term c 4 ω 0 is chosen for stable stratification applicable for steady sheet flow rodi 1987 through a series of sensitivity test we found that the modeled flow velocities are also sensitive to the coefficient c 3ω and the optimum value of c 3ω is 0 14 which is close to the value 0 2 suggested by amoudry 2014 a full list of the coefficients associated with the low reynolds number k ω model used in this study is presented in table 1 finally the turbulent eddy viscosity νft is calculated by the fluid turbulence kinetic energy kf tke and specific turbulence dissipation rate ωf 29 ν f t α k f ω f it shall be noted that the lrn k ω can be reduced to the original k ω model wilcox 1993 in the fully turbulent region when the local reynolds number is sufficiently high compared with the critical reynolds numbers 2 3 2 smooth and rough wall functions the wall functions for a smooth bed and rough bed are both relevant to the present study for clear fluid or dilute suspension such as the experiment of muste et al 2005 to be discussed in section 3 1 a smooth wall is exposed and the ωf value in the viscous sublayer scales with 1 z 2 where z is the distance to the bottom wall boundary as a result ωf goes to infinity at the wall boundary in the numerical implementation a finite value of ωf is imposed to the first grid above the solid smooth wall and the following bottom boundary condition is specified bredberg et al 2000 menter and esch 2001 30 ω w a l l ω v i s 2 ω l o g 2 with the ωwall value specified as a blend function of the values in the viscous sublayer ωvis and logarithmic layer ω log 31 ω v i s 6 ν f 0 075 z o 2 ω l o g u c μ κ z o where κ 0 41 is the von karman constant and the bottom frictional velocity is calculated as u ν f ν f t u f z at the wall boundary it was found that this formulation of bottom boundary condition for smooth wall is robust for low to high reynolds number turbulent boundary layer flows on the other hand the bed is covered with a thick layer of sediment particles in sheet flow condition and the particles imposes a rough wall boundary to the flow above the bed however the location of the bed in sediment transport is difficult to determine as a priori due to possible erosion processes to avoid this complexity the last term on the r h s of eq 26 is proposed to impose a desired value of specific turbulence dissipation rate ωbed in the sediment bed and γ ϕ is a step like function of sediment concentration 32 γ ϕ tanh 500 ϕ ϕ b 1 2 where ϕb should be specified as the sediment concentration in the bed so that the ωf value is only imposed inside the sediment bed in this study we choose ϕ b 0 55 an intrinsic relaxation timescale is used for trelax which sums the proper timescale on the r h s of the ωf equation 33 1 t r e l a x c 2 ω ω f c 3 ω 2 β 1 λ ϕ ρ f 1 ϕ c 4 ω 1 k f 1 1 ϕ ν f t σ c ρ s ρ f 1 g ϕ it shall be noted that the relaxation time scale proposed here is positive in sheet flow applications for specific energy dissipation frequency ωbed inside the bed the rough wall value can be specified as wilcox 1988 34 ω b e d s r u 2 ν f where u is the bottom frictional velocity at the bed interface specified based on the flow forcing to drive the steady channel flow and sr is a parameter depending on the bed roughness 35 s r 200 k s 2 k s 5 k r k s 200 k s 2 k r k s e 5 k s k s 5 where k s k s u ν f is the normalized wall roughness in wall units and ks is the nikuradse s equivalent sand roughness which is related with the sand grain size k s 2 5 d the original coefficient kr is 100 as suggested by wilcox 1988 however fuhrman et al 2010 proposed that this coefficient needs to be reduced to k r 80 to match the law of wall therefore k r 80 is used throughout this paper 2 4 eddy interaction model the drag force eq 6 in the particle momentum equation depends on the instantaneous fluid velocity however only the reynolds averaged fluid velocity u f i is solved and hence an additional closure model for the fluid velocity fluctuation in turbulent flow u f i is required appropriate consideration of particle dispersion by turbulent eddies provides a key suspension mechanism in sediment transport i e turbulent suspension following graham and james 1996 particle dispersion by turbulence can be modeled with a stochastic eddy interaction model eim and a series of random lagrangian velocities can be used to represent the fluid turbulent motions i e u f i u i t σ 1 v f i v i t σ 2 and w f i w i t σ 3 where σ 1 2 3 are gaussian random numbers with a zero mean value and a standard deviation of unity in this study the velocity fluctuations are calculated using the fluid turbulent kinetic energy u i t v i t w i t 2 k f i 3 where k f i is interpolated turbulence kinetic energy at the mass center of particle i it is possible to model the anisotropic velocity fluctuations in three directions however to be consistent with the two equation turbulence averaged models lrn k ω closure the turbulent fluctuations are assumed to be isotropic in the eddy interaction model the velocity fluctuations i e u i t v i t w i t are updated every step with the particle position however the random numbers σ 1 2 3 remained unchanged until the eddy interaction time ti is exceeded which is determined either when a particle has completely crossed a turbulent eddy or remains in an eddy but exceeds the eddy life time the mean life time of the turbulent eddy can be estimated as t l i 6 c μ ω f i 1 in the lrn k ω model however the instantaneous turbulent eddy life time is of random like nature kallio and reeks 1989 mehrotra et al 1998 and it is estimated as 36 t e i c 0 ln 1 ξ t l i where ξ is the random number ranging from 0 to 1 as discussed in section 2 3 due to the uncertainties in the parameterization of the eddy life time the coefficient c 0 is introduced as a constant for model calibration see section 3 1 as a result the turbulent eddy length le can be estimated as l e i t e i 2 k f i 3 with the estimation of the turbulent eddy length le the eddy crossing time for a particle can be computed as gosman and loannides 1983 37 t c i t p i ln 1 l e i v i u f i t p i where t p i is the particle response time calculated as t p i 4 ρ s i d i 3 ρ f v i u f i c d it is noted that eq 37 is only evaluated when l e i v i u f i t p i and the eddy interaction time t i i is the minimum between eddy lifetime t e i and eddy crossing time t c i once the time interval exceeds t i i the particle i enters another turbulent eddy i e the gaussian random numbers σ 1 2 3 are re evaluated every interval t i i min t e i t c i 2 5 cfd dem coupling procedure in the present euler lagrange modeling framework the coupling between the fluid phase and sediment phase utilizes the open source code cfdem goniva et al 2012 which couples the finite volume cfd toolbox openfoam weller 2002 with the dem solver liggghts kloss et al 2012 at the beginning of the simulation the particle positions and velocities are initialized in the dem module and the fluid velocity and turbulence quantities are initialized in the cfd module the loop of the cfd dem coupling begins with the update of particle positions and velocities for ns dem time steps within one fluid time step dt in which the time step dts in the dem module is related to the fluid time step by d t s d t n s in the contact force model the energy stored in the collision increases rapidly with the overlapping length of particles thus the time step dts should be sufficiently small to avoid the unphysical energy generation due to particle contacts in this study the following three criteria are used to determine dts 1 the overlap length δn is smaller than 0 5 of particle diameter d i e dts 0 005d vrn where vrn is normal component of the relative velocity to the contact face between two contacting particles 2 to capture the energy transmission in the solid particles the time step dts is chosen to be small enough compared with the rayleigh timescale tr where t r π r ρ s g 0 163 ν 0 8766 1 and g is the shear modulus g is further related to the young s modulus e and the poisson ratio υ as 2 g 1 υ e 3 dts is required to be smaller than the hertzian contact time in order to capture the contact process the hertzian contact time is the duration of a pair of particles in contact which can be estimated as t c 2 87 m 2 r e 2 v r n 1 5 where r 1 r i 1 r j 1 m 1 m i 1 m j 1 and e 1 ν i 2 e i 1 ν j 2 e j 1 for a contact between a sphere particle i with wall j the same relationship applies to e whereas r r i and m m i the dts is constant throughout the simulation once appropriately chosen to satisfy the above criteria and the particle velocities are updated every dts where the forces acting on each particles are solved according to eq 4 in the calculation of drag forces the eddy interaction model is implemented to model the turbulence induced sediment suspensions where a fluctuating component of velocities are introduced to the drag forces through a stochastic procedure which is outlined as follows a initially at t 0 the time marker t mark i and eddy interaction time t i i are set to zero for each particle b random numbers σ 1 2 3 are generated and the fluid velocity fluctuation u f i v f i w f i are updated the drag forces are then calculated using eq 6 c the following two scenarios are considered i if t t m a r k i t i i the particle enters a new turbulent eddy and then new gaussian random number σ 1 2 3 are generated and fluid fluctuations are updated with the new values of σ 1 2 3 both t mark i and t i i are updated to the current values ii else if t t m a r k i t i i the particle remains in the same eddy thus the existing gaussian random numbers are retained and t mark i and t i i remains unchanged however the fluid fluctuations are updated with new particle positions i e new k f i after solving the particle velocities and positions the particle informations are communicated to the fluid phase however prior to solving the fluid equations the diffusion model of sun and xiao 2016a see eq 17 is applied to the sediment concentration to obtain a smooth profile the fluid phase is computed in a similar way as the eulerian two phase flow model sedfoam cheng et al 2017a the fluid momentum equation in eq 15 is solved over a collocated grid arrangement in which the velocities and pressure are stored in the cell centers the convection terms including the k ω equations are discretized using a total variation diminishing tvd scheme based on a sweby limiter sweby 1984 the second order central scheme is used for the diffusion terms for the temporal integration a first order implicit euler scheme is used the piso pressure implicit splitting operation algorithm is used for the velocity pressure decoupling so that the continuity equation 18 is satisfied more details on the numerical solution procedures for the fluid solver can be found in rusche 2002 3 model results through preliminary numerical experiments we confirmed that the modeled sediment concentration profile is sensitive to the prediction of fluid tke and the coefficient c 0 in estimating the turbulent eddy life time in the eddy interaction model see eq 36 this is somewhat expected as the turbulent intensity and the eddy interaction time are the main factors differentiating the present stochastic procedure for modeling turbulent diffusion from incoherent random motions therefore we first validated the turbulence closure with direct numerical simulation dns of clear fluid turbulent channel flow after establishing the accuracy of the turbulence closure for clear fluid the coefficient c 0 in the eddy interaction model is calibrated with the dilute suspension experiment of kiger and pan 2002 where the velocity sediment concentration and reynolds shear stress profiles are measured for sand in a steady channel flow over a smooth bed starved bed the calibrated model is then applied to predict the suspended sand concentration and turbulence of another similar dilute suspension experiment reported by muste et al 2005 because the sediment concentration is very dilute 1 and there is negligible deposit on the bed these datasets allow us to solely calibrate the c 0 value in the eddy interaction model without complication from intergranular interactions after the calibration the model is applied to the steady sheet flow experimental configuration of revil baudard et al 2015 a sensitivity analysis of the model results to the c 0 value is investigated in detail to illustrate the effects on the turbulent suspension in steady sheet flow the capability of the present cfdem eim is further demonstrated by comparing predictions of sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness with classical empirical formula 3 1 model calibration of dilute suspension in steady channel flow firstly the lrn k ω turbulence closure is validated against the dns dataset of moser et al 1999 for a clear fluid steady wall bounded channel flow at a reynolds number of r e τ u h ν f 570 moser et al 1999 where h is the channel half width we carried out a 1dv numerical simulation at the same reynolds number with a vertical domain height h 0 02 m a shear free symmetric boundary condition is used at the top boundary while the bottom boundary condition is a no slip wall the standard smooth wall functions for k and ω are used at the bottom wall boundary see eq 31 in both x and y directions periodic boundaries are used and only one grid cell is used in these two directions with a grid size domain size of l x l y 0 02 m the vertical domain is discretized into 168 grid cells with a uniform grid size δ z 0 122 mm the flow is driven by a mean pressure gradient of f x 43 5 pa m so that the bottom frictional velocity is u 0 0285 m s the distance of the first grid center to the bottom boundary patch corresponds to a wall unit δ z 0 5 u δ z ν f 1 76 therefore the first cell center is within the viscous sublayer the comparisons of the mean reynolds shear stress velocity and tke profiles between the lrn k ω model and dns data are shown in fig 1 very good agreements on all three profiles are obtained especially the velocity profile and reynolds shear stress the agreement in the reynolds shear stress profile confirms that the flow has reached a quasi steady state and the flow condition is similar to the dns simulation of moser et al 1999 meanwhile it is evident that the overall shear stress follows a linear profile τ t o t u 2 1 z h in the range of z h 0 1 dashed curve in fig 1b the modeled tke is also remarkably close to the dns data it is evident that the lrn k ω model is able to resolve the peak of turbulent kinetic energy near the bottom wall around z 0 02 h even though the peak value from the lrn k ω closure 4 4 u 2 is slightly smaller than the dns data 4 75 u 2 kiger and pan 2002 later conducted a sediment laden turbulent flow experiment at a similar reynolds number as moser et al 1999 the data of kiger and pan 2002 can be further used to calibrate the c 0 coefficient in the eim in the experiment the half channel height is h 0 02 m which is the same as the clear fluid simulation at r e τ 570 and hence we kept the same domain setup and boundary conditions as the clear fluid 1dv simulation in the dem implementation the particles are tracked in a meshless 3d domain domain size is the same as in the cfd the lateral boundaries in dem are periodic while the wall boundary was used for both the top and bottom boundaries to conserve the number of particles in the domain the sediments are spherical particles with a density of ρ s 2605 kg m3 and the grain diameter is d 0 195 mm the particle settling velocity is about 0 024 m s which corresponds to a shape factor η 1 in the drag model see eqs 8 11 the domain averaged sediment volumetric concentration in the experiment is φ 2 3 10 4 to match the domain averaged sediment concentration in kiger and pan 2002 a total of n 476 particles are simulated in the dem to calibrate the c 0 value in the eim we carried out four simulations with different c 0 values c 0 1 2 3 4 the resulting profiles of the streamwise velocity tke and sediment concentration are compared with the measured data of kiger and pan 2002 and clear fluid dns data of moser et al 1999 in fig 2 due to the dilute sediment concentration in the domain the numerical results of the streamwise velocity profile are not very sensitive to the c 0 values so only the velocity profiles corresponding to c 0 3 is shown we notice that the measured velocity profile differs slightly from the dns data possibly due to the effect of the presence of sediment in the water column and or measurement uncertainties in addition the averaged particle velocity profile not shown is very close to the fluid velocity the measured data of the turbulent intensity is only available for the streamwise u r m s and vertical w r m s velocity fluctuations in order to compare the turbulence kinetic energy of numerical results and measured data the spanwise velocity fluctuation is reconstructed following the relationship suggested by jha and bombardelli 2009 v r m s 0 3 u 0 6 u r m s thus the turbulent kinetic energy in the experiment can be estimated by k f u r m s 2 v r m s 2 w r m s 2 2 the model results also predict slightly smaller turbulence kinetic energy compared with clear fluid counterpart but the reduction is very small due to dilute sediment concentration overall the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy profiles are in good agreement with the measured data the sediment concentration profiles corresponding to different c 0 values are presented in fig 2c solid curves and they can be compared with measured data symbols in fig 2c it is evident that the suspended sediment concentration is strongly affected by the coefficient c 0 in general more significant sediment suspension is obtained with a larger c 0 value clearly a c 0 value of 1 under predicts the suspended sediment concentration and almost all the sediment particles accumulate near the bottom z h 0 15 see magenta curve in fig 2c when the c 0 value is increased to c 0 2 considerably more sediments are suspended however the resulting sediment concentration remains to be lower than the measured data the optimum c 0 value is found to be c 0 3 and the resulting sediment concentration profile is in good agreement with the measured data finally using c 0 4 clearly over predicts sediment concentration it is well known that the sediment concentration profile in a steady turbulent channel flow follows the rouse profile vanoni 2006 38 ϕ ϕ r h z z z r h z r r o where r o w s s c κ u is the rouse number in which the schmidt number sc is the ratio of turbulent eddy viscosity over the sediment diffusivity zr is the reference location above the bed and ϕr is the concentration at the reference location we choose the reference location to be z r 0 1 h corresponding to the lowest elevation that the reynolds shear stress follows a linear profile the dashed curve in fig 2c shows the fitted rouse profile to the measured data with the rouse number r o 1 44 it is evident that both the measured data and the numerical result with c 0 3 match the rouse profile very well the calibrated c 0 is further applied to another similar dilute suspension experiment reported by muste et al 2005 see table 2 the flow is driven by a prescribed pressure gradient force in order to match the bottom friction velocity of u 0 042 m s in a flow depth of h 0 021 m the sand density is ρ s 2650 kg m3 and the grain diameter is d 0 23 mm the measured settling velocity is about 2 4 cm s which correspond to a shape factor of η 0 644 see eqs 8 11 a similar numerical setup as the simulation of kiger and pan 2002 is used except that the domain height is h 0 021 m to match the experimental condition the streamwise and spanwise domain lengths are specified to be l x l y 100 d in the vertical direction uniform grid sizes are used with n z 210 grids to resolve the entire flow depth and the first grid center above the bottom wall corresponds to a wall unit δ z 1 05 a total number of particles used in the dem is n 803 which matches the domain averaged concentration φ 4 6 10 4 the model results of velocity profile concentration profile and tke kf profile with c 0 3 are compared with the measured data in fig 3 the resulting fluid velocity profile fig 3a matches the measured data reasonably well except that the velocity magnitude is slightly over predicted in the range of 0 1 z h 0 5 the normalized sediment concentration normalized by the mean concentration ϕr at the reference location z r h 0 1 shows that the suspended sediment concentration profile is similar to the measured data as well as the rouse profile with a rouse number r o 0 86 dashed curve in fig 3b in fig 3c the numerical result of tke is compared with the measured data the measured data of the turbulent intensity is reconstructed in the same way as the measurement of kiger and pan 2002 overall the magnitude of the turbulent kinetic energy is smaller than the measured data by no more than 30 however the vertical profile shape is reproduced well by the model in summary the lrn k ω model is validated using a clear fluid dns dataset of moser et al 1999 and the eddy interaction model is calibrated by using the measurements from kiger and pan 2002 and muste et al 2005 it is found that the optimum c 0 value that matches the measured concentration profiles for both experiments is c 0 3 0 while c 0 3 0 underestimated the suspended sediment concentration therefore this calibrated c 0 value is applied to the sheet flow applications in the following subsection 3 2 steady sheet flow in this section we further apply cfdem eim to model steady sheet flow where both bedload inter granular interaction dominant and suspended load turbulent suspension dominant are important the laboratory experiments reported by revil baudard et al 2015 2016 which include a steady flow over a rough fixed bed fb and a steady sheet flow mobile bed mb were used for model validation the flow condition and sediment properties are summarized in table 3 the sediment particles are irregularly shaped with density ρ s 1192 kg m3 and median grain diameter d 3 mm the resulting mean settling velocity is measured to be w s 5 59 cm s similar to the case ns1 in muste et al 2005 we used a sphericity of η 0 594 to match the settling velocity with the experiment while the original grain size d is retained in the dem contact model in the dem model the young s modulus of particles is specified as e 5 10 6 pa the restitution coefficient is e 0 5 the coulomb friction coefficient is μ c 0 5 and the poison ratio is ν 0 45 in the fixed bed fb experiment these particles are glued to the bed forming a single layer rough elements while the bed is covered by thick layers of particles in the mb case and the particles are free to move we first carried out a numerical simulation of the case fb to establish the accuracy of the present numerical model on hydrodynamics before presenting more complicated mobile bed sheet flow model validation to simulate the flow over fixed rough bottom a single layer of particles are fixed above the bottom boundary in the dem i e the particle velocities are zero and their positions are fixed the rough wall function eq 34 is used with a bed roughness k s 2 5 d to estimate the ωbed in the turbulence closure in the experiment of revil baudard et al 2016 the flow depth above the fixed particles is about h 0 105 m the vertical domain length is chosen to be l z h d 0 108 m with a uniform grid size of δ z 0 25 mm therefore the fixed bed layer is resolved by the first 12 grid points above the bottom the measured bottom frictional velocity in the experiment is u 0 052 m s to match the bottom shear stress the flow driving force is prescribed as f x 25 8 pa m the model results of the fluid velocity reynolds shear stress and the tke profiles are compared with the measured data in fig 4 where the fixed particle layer is also denoted as circle symbols due to the drag force from the fixed particles above the bottom the velocity profile drops to zero within the fixed bed layer and good agreements in the streamwise velocity profiles are obtained with the measured data the modeled reynolds shear stress profile captures the linear decaying shape dashed curve and it matches the experimental data reasonably well in particular the reynolds averaged closure provides a good prediction of the tke magnitude throughout most of the water column the good agreement with the fb case confirms that the turbulence closure works well for the steady flow over a rough fixed sediment bed the mobile bed sheet flow see case mb in table 3 is then studied with a thick layer of particles at the bottom of the domain to prepare the sediment bed the particle velocities are initialized to be zero and 43 929 particles are well mixed in the whole domain due to the gravitational settling the particles settle down to the bottom until their kinematic energies are minimized after this initialization step the initial bed level locates at z 0 045 m above the bottom of the domain due to the sediment suspension the final bed depth at the quasi steady state will be smaller through a preliminary test we determined that the total vertical domain height should be l z 0 168 m so that the final flow depth of h 0 128 m sediment bed location becomes z b 0 04 m can be obtained after the flow reaches the steady state the vertical domain is discretized into 168 grid cells with a uniform grid size δ z 0 001 m the streamwise and spanwise domain lengths are l x 0 144 m and l y 0 072 m in these two horizontal directions only one cfd grid cell is used in each direction to confirm the model domain size is adequate we carried out a comparative case by reducing the streamwise domain length by half l x 0 072 m and the model results on mean flow quantities show good convergence the same coefficient c 0 3 calibrated for dilute suspension see section 3 1 is used here for the sheet flow simulation using the lrn k ω model the snapshot of the horizontal fluid velocity profile and sediment particle distribution after the flow reaches the statistically steady state is shown in fig 5 although the flow is solved using a reynolds averaged turbulence closure the stochastic motions of the sediment particles are captured by the eddy interaction model and particle collisions as a result of the eddy interaction model the sediment particles are suspended away from the bed via turbulent suspension the numerical results of the mean velocity profile normalized concentration profile sediment fluxes q s ϕ u s and tke profiles are compared with the measured data in fig 6 to reduce the fluctuations due to stochastic motion of particles time averaging with a 10 second window is applied to calculate the mean flow quantity after the flow reaches steady state in panel a we observe that the modeled fluid velocity profile is similar to the measured data in the upper water column z z b 7 d when sediment concentration is very dilute in the region of intermediate sediment concentration 0 z z b d 7 sediment velocity is slightly smaller than the fluid velocity and agrees with measured velocity profile this lag in sediment phase velocity is consistent with many particle laden flow observations e g muste et al 2005 pal et al 2016 the modeled velocity profiles without the eddy interaction model are similar and hence they are not shown here for brevity very near the bed z z b 3 d the model over predicts the velocity gradient while the measured data shows a milder increase of velocity away from the bottom in the range of 0 z z b 7 d as a result the numerical model under predicts the shear layer thickness above the bed according to revil baudard et al 2015 the large nearbed shear layer observed in the experiment may be related to the nearbed intermittencies even though the eim is used for the turbulence sediment interaction the stochastic model is still too simple to model the bed intermittency and a turbulence resolving simulation approach may be necessary for such feature cheng et al 2017b the sediment concentration profiles normalized by the maximum sediment concentration ϕmax are compared in fig 6b it shall be noted that our numerical model predicts that the maximum sediment concentration is ϕmax 0 635 while the measured data gives ϕ m a x 0 55 the discrepancy in the maximum packing concentration is probably related to the non spherical particle shape used in the experiments from the normalized sediment concentration profiles we can see that the modeled sediment concentration with eim shows a more smooth vertical distribution and is more consistent with measured concentration profile on the other hand the concentration profile without the eim indicates that a dense thin transport layer is predicted between 3 d z z b 5 d consequently excessive sediment accumulation occurs in this region and sediment flux is over predicted see fig 6c this feature is similar to typical bedload transport model results for much coarser particles or aeolian transport durán et al 2012 here the shoulder shape concentration profile is clearly absent in the measured data and the model result with eim shows a better agreement at the higher shields parameter and a fall parameter ratio of settling velocity to friction velocity around 1 or smaller the suspended transport becomes non negligible this point will be discussed more extensively in section 4 2 comparisons presented here indicate that the eim can effectively model the turbulent diffusion of sediment concentration therefore including the eddy interaction model in reynolds averaged formulation is essential to accurately model sediment concentration although the concentration profile with c 0 3 captures the main features similar to the measured data it is clear that the present model underpredicts the sediment suspension in the range of 5 d z z b 10 d and hence the sediment flux is also underpredicted see panel c in fig 6 while it is possible to further increase c 0 increase turbulent suspension to match the measured data better it may not be physically valid the tke profiles are further compared with the measured data in fig 6d firstly we can see that including excluding the eim has negligible impact on the modeled tke profile and both results show under prediction of tke away from the bed z z b d 7 and very near the bed z z b d 3 as presented in fig 4 the model predicts the tke profile very well for fixed rough bed condition of similar bottom friction velocity inter comparison of the measured tke between the fb and mb conditions indicate that turbulence is enhanced by about 40 away from the bed 7 z z b d 25 and a significant enhancement is also observed very near the bed z z b d 3 in the mobile bed experiment revil baudard et al 2016 attribute the enhancement of turbulence to near bed intermittency more recent eulerian two phase large eddy simulation study cheng et al 2017b further demonstrated that turbulence above the concentrated sheet layer z z b d 7 can be enhanced through these frequent but intermittent sediment burst events it is noted that the present turbulence averaged model is not designed to capture these intermittent turbulent features in summary including the eddy interaction model is required for the prediction of sediment concentration and sediment flux under sheet flow conditions although sediment concentration in the dilute region is under predicted with c 0 3 in the eim the discrepancy is believed to be caused by under prediction of turbulence due to intermittent turbulent features but not eim itself the sensitivity of the modeled suspended sediment concentration will be discussed in more details subsequently 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of sediment diffusivity to the coefficient c 0 as demonstrated in section 3 1 for the channel flow with dilute sediment suspension the sediment concentration profiles are sensitive to the coefficient c 0 in the eddy interaction model and the suspended sediment concentration gradient increases with c 0 values it is clear that the gradient of sediment concentration profile is related to the particle dispersion or sediment diffusion in this section we further analyze the sensitivity of the suspended sediment concentrations and the sediment diffusivity to the coefficient c 0 under steady sheet flow conditions by varying c 0 2 3 6 and 8 the effect of c 0 values on the sediment concentration profile is illustrated in fig 7 similar to the rouse profile in dilute particle laden flows eq 38 the rouse profile in the sheet flow can be determined as 39 ϕ ϕ r z z b h z b z h z b z r z r z b r o in practice the rouse profile is only applicable when the turbulent suspension is dominant while the particle particle interactions are negligible therefore the reference location zr is chosen to be the lowest elevation at which the reynolds shear stress follows a linear profile the shear stress profiles corresponding to different c 0 values are shown in fig 7a the reynolds shear stress profile is nearly unaffected by the c 0 value meanwhile the reynolds shear stress follows the linear distribution above z z b d 7 5 and therefore it can be conjectured that the inter granular stress becomes important below z z b d 7 5 and a common reference location z r z b 7 5 d is chosen the normalized sediment concentration profiles are plotted in logarithmic scale in fig 7b where the thick curves are numerical results and thin dash dot curves are the corresponding fitted rouse profiles the modeled sediment concentration profiles fit the rouse profile well in the dilute region z z b 7 d for all the c 0 values tested however different slopes of concentration profiles were observed by varying c 0 values we quantify the slope of sediment concentration in logarithmic scale using the rouse number ro see eq 39 for c 0 2 nearly no sediment is suspended above z z b d 15 and the rouse number r o 4 78 is large compared with the measured data r o 2 14 using c 0 3 sediments are suspended much higher in the water column and the resulting r o 2 98 is significantly lower further increasing c 0 to 6 and 8 the rouse number reduced to 2 42 and 1 64 although the model result using c 0 6 matches the measured sediment concentration profile as discussed before increasing c 0 may not be physically justified because the predicted suspended sediment concentration also depends on modeled turbulence quantities for given sediment properties and flow conditions the rouse number depends on the schmidt number sc which is defined as the ratio between the fluid turbulent eddy viscosity νft and the sediment diffusivity νp in many reynolds averaged eulerian simulations of sediment transport e g hsu et al 2004 revil baudard and chauchat 2013 cheng et al 2017a the gradient transport assumption is adopted 40 w s ϕ ν p ϕ z where the sediment diffusivity is often parameterized by the turbulent eddy viscosity ν p ν f t s c with a constant schmidt number e g hsu et al 2003 chen et al 2011 cheng et al 2017a alternatively the sediment diffusivity may be evaluated as ν p w s ϕ ϕ z by considering the balance between the turbulent suspension flux and the settling flux w s ϕ w s ϕ in the present model the sediment motion is directly resolved by a lagrangian approach and the eddy interaction model is incorporated to simulate the sediment suspension by the flow turbulence therefore it is interesting to evaluate the eddy interaction model in terms of the resulting sediment diffusivity and schmidt number the vertical profiles of turbulent eddy viscosity and sediment diffusivity for c 0 2 3 6 and 8 are compared in fig 8 a and b the turbulent eddy viscosity profiles obtained using different c 0 values are similar to each other and their vertical distributions are close to the measured data however the magnitude of the eddy viscosity is over predicted compared with the measured data recall in fig 6 d that the present model also underpredicts tke we can conclude that the model may significantly underpredict ω due to inability to resolve intermittent turbulent motion and sediment burst this may provide some useful insights to further improve the present k ω model for two phase flow in the future as shown in fig 8 b the vertical profiles of the sediment diffusivities are sensitive to the c 0 values see fig 8 b and the sediment diffusivity increases with the increasing values of c 0 because discrepancies exist in both eddy viscosity and sediment diffusivity the overall evaluation was also examined by the ratio of these two quantities namely the schmidt number the resulting schmidt numbers s c ν f t ν p are presented in fig 8 c we noticed that the predicted schmidt number was more or less a constant in the suspension layer z z b 6 d for all the runs regardless of c 0 values and this feature is consistent with the measurement with c 0 3 the resulting schmidt number is around unity sc 1 which is significantly larger than the measured value sc 0 44 the observed larger schmidt number is consistent with the under prediction of suspended sediment concentration and over prediction of eddy viscosity discussed above by increasing the value of c 0 to 6 and 8 the resulting schmidt number decreased to sc 0 75 and sc 0 65 respectively with this analysis we can also conclude that simply increasing c 0 cannot reproduce the measured schmidt because the eddy viscosity is over predicted by the present two phase flow k ω model in summary we showed that the discrepancies in the sediment diffusivity and schmidt number could be due to the inability of the reynolds averaged model to capture the nearbed intermittencies as observed in the sheet flow experiment of revil baudard et al 2015 the nearbed intermittency enhances the turbulent intensities within the dense layer and upper water column as a result the present model underpredicted turbulent intensity in these regions which can further cause the underprediction of the suspended sediment concentration to fully understand the dependence of schmidt number on turbulent flow characteristics and sediment properties a more sophisticated turbulence resolving models may be needed secondly several interphase momentum transfer forces such as the added mass and lift forces are neglected in the present study it is expected that these interphase transfer forces are less important for heavy sand particles however they can become important for lightweight coarse particles jha and bombardelli 2010 finally we shall note that detailed experimental measurements on natural sand transport in sheet flow are needed to study the relevance of this nearbed intermittency of lightweight particles for the sand transport more comprehensive investigations are warranted for future work 4 2 transport rate and transport layer thickness the present model is applied to study the role of turbulent suspension modeled by eim on sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness in sediment transport applications the sediment transport rate is often of high interest as it is directly used in regional scale models to study morphological evolutions e g lesser et al 2004 warner et al 2008 many steady flow experiments revealed that the dimensionless sediment transport rate can be parameterized by the non dimensional bottom shear stress e g meyer peter and muller 1948 nnadi and wilson 1992 ribberink 1998 the non dimensional form of the bottom shear stress is called shields parameter θ τ b ρ s ρ f g d to evaluate the model capability to predict sediment transport rate we carried out 14 cases with shields parameter ranging from θ 0 3 to 1 2 with without eim see table 4 the resulting sediment concentration profiles and sediment flux profiles for three representative shields parameters θ 0 5 0 8 and 1 2 are shown in fig 9 where panels a b corresponds to the results with eim and panels c d corresponds to the results without eim as the shear stress exerted on the granular bed increases the shear induced dilation causes a larger erosion depth in the dense layer ϕ ϕ m a x 0 5 or z z b d 3 see fig 9a and c this phenomenon is similar to the observations of boyer et al 2011 for dense immersed granular flows and it occurs regardless of the eim as a result of the shear induced dilation more sediments are eroded as the shields parameter increases the vertical location corresponding to ϕ ϕ m a x 0 5 is lower as θ increases between 3 5 z z b d 10 the turbulent suspension mechanism is missing without eim thus a steep concentration gradient is obtained in each case in fig 9 c as a consequence of the much rapid decrease of sediment concentration below ϕ ϕ m a x 0 3 the sediment transport flux occurs mostly in the relatively dense layer see fig 9d e g sediment flux is nearly zero for z z b d 8 for the case with the highest shields parameter on the other hand when eim is incorporated to model turbulent suspension sediments are suspended further away from the bed the sediment transport flux in the relatively dilute layer ϕ ϕ m a x 0 3 is significantly larger and the total flux is expected to be larger compared with the cases without eim see fig 9b the sediment transport rate can be obtained by integrating the sediment transport flux qs over the entire vertical domain and the dimensionless sediment transport rate can be computed as durán et al 2012 41 ψ i 1 n v i v i l x l y s 1 g d 3 in this study the sediment transport rate obtained with eim is denoted as ψt while the transport rate without eim is denoted as ψb according to the previous experimental results on the sediment transport rate a general form of power law relationships between the dimensionless sediment transport rate and the excess shields parameter θ θ c can be written as 42 ψ m 0 θ θ c n 0 where a typical critical shields parameter θ c 0 05 is used several different values of the coefficient m 0 and n 0 were proposed from various experimental results on the basis of the flume experiments for rather coarse sand d 3 mm at low shields parameter θ 0 2 meyer peter and muller 1948 proposed that m 0 5 7 and n 0 1 5 this is the well known power law where the transport rate is proportional to the 3 2 power of the excess shields parameter θ θ c based on the duct flow experiment with a smaller grain size d 0 7 mm at higher shields parameters θ 1 nnadi and wilson 1992 suggested that the coefficient m 0 should be increased to m 0 12 more recent study by ribberink 1998 found that the power 3 2 should be increased to about 1 67 as the suspended load becomes important when the shields parameter becomes larger the numerical results of the dimensionless sediment transport rates as a function of the shields parameters are plotted in fig 10 clearly the sediment transport rates predicted with eim circle symbols and without eim triangle symbols increase rapidly when the shields parameter increases and this trend follows the empirical power law eq 42 very well the dash dot curve in fig 10 shows the power law with n 0 1 5 meyer peter and muller 1948 and the resulting best fit is m 0 8 1 however the fitted curve with a power of n 0 1 5 over predicts the sediment transport rate for lower shields parameters θ 1 while the transport rate in the higher shields parameter range is under predicted on the other hand the best fit of the power law for the present model results gives m 0 8 27 and n 0 2 0 which is consistent the values reported by ribberink 1998 m 0 10 4 and n 0 1 67 in addition the transport rate without eim is also compared with that of eim it is evident that the transport rate without eim is generally smaller and the discrepancy increases as the shields parameter increases if we further fit the transport rate obtained without eim into the power law formula we obtain that m 0 5 5 and n 0 2 0 it is interesting to note that although the proportionality constant m 0 is much lower than that of eim the power n 0 remains the same as shown in fig 9 b and d the sediment horizontal flux mainly occurs within a thick layer of about 10 15 grain diameters above the bed in sheet flow applications the transport layer thickness is another quantity of interest because this is where a large portion of transport takes place for example wilson 1987 argues that mobile beds at high shear stresses can neither be considered as a rough or smooth fixed wall but they obey their own friction law with a frictional length scale proportional to the thickness of the major transport layer wilson 1987 defined the major transport layer thickness as the distance of the lowest mobile bed layer us 1 mm s and the sediment concentration ϕ 8 however we noticed that using the 8 threshold may neglect too much transport for the present analysis and a lower threshold may be more appropriate here we define the transport layer directly from the sediment flux profile where the dimensionless sediment flux is larger than a small threshold q s s 1 g d 0 05 the resulting transport layer thickness with eim δt and without eim δb are compared in fig 10b it is evident that the transport layer thickness increases with the shields parameter according to the experimental observations e g wilson 1987 sumer et al 1996 the transport layer thickness is nearly proportional to the grain diameter and shields parameter as shown in fig 10b we can see that a linear relationship can be found regardless of whether eim is adopted or not even though the proportionality coefficients are quite different without eim the transport layer thickness can be well described as δ b d 6 18 θ however the transport layer thickness with eim is much larger δ s d 10 28 θ with the proportional coefficient very close to the value 10 as suggested by wilson 1987 according to bagnold 1966 the particle suspension occurs when the dominant vertical velocity of the turbulent eddies exceeds the particle settling velocity assuming that the vertical velocity fluctuation can be quantified by the vertical turbulent velocity fluctuation we can assume that the turbulent suspension is important if w r m s w s in the present model an isotropic turbulence is assumed such that the vertical turbulence intensity is approximated as w r m s 2 k 3 nezu 1993 suggested that the maximum tke can be estimated as 4 78 u 2 for turbulent flow over smooth bed in the present sheet sediment transport with coarse light particles the maximum tke can be reasonably represented by 3 u 2 see fig 6d thus the turbulent suspension can be initiated when the shear velocity satisfies w s u 2 this is similar to the discussion of van rijn 1984b and sumer et al 1996 where they suggested that the relative importance between suspended load and bedload sediment transport can be categorized by the fall parameter f w s u as summarized in table 4 the fall parameter varies from 1 44 to 0 72 as the shear velocity increases from 3 87 to 7 74 cm s from the previous discussion on the sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness it is found that the difference of the transport rate between the results with and without eim is negligible when the shields parameter is smaller than 0 5 fall parameter f 1 25 however when the shields parameter is larger than 0 5 or f 1 25 the difference becomes noticeable to carry out more quantitative analysis we consider that the turbulent suspension is most significant for the suspended load which mainly occurs in the region of ϕ 0 08 the non dimensional suspended load sediment transport rate can be defined as 43 ψ s u s 1 s 1 g d 3 z ϕ 0 08 l z ϕ u s d z to illustrate the importance of eim on the prediction of suspended sediment flux the suspended load with without eim are compared in fig 11 for a range of fall parameters as the fall parameter increases the sediment particles are less likely to be suspended by the turbulent eddies thus the suspended sediment transport reduces rapidly this is confirmed by the results of eim where the non dimensional suspended sediment transport rate is reduced from 1 4 to 0 2 when the fall parameter increases from 0 72 to 1 44 however we can see that the suspended load predicted without eim is quite small around 0 2 and more or less a constant independent of the fall parameter this indicates that the eim is essential to capture the suspended sediment flux for f 1 25 suspended load flux can be significantly under predicted and eim should be included in the euler lagrange model for steady sheet flows 5 conclusion in this paper a reynolds averaged euler lagrange sediment transport model was developed and applied to steady sheet flow where the inter granular interaction is directly resolved and the turbulent suspension of particles is modeled using an eddy interaction model a lrn k ω model extended for two phase flow is implemented for the flow turbulence which also provides the required turbulence statistics for the eddy interaction model the eddy interaction model was first calibrated using the dilute suspension experiments of kiger and pan 2002 and muste et al 2005 while the model is able to predict the measured flow velocity and turbulence kinetic energy very well the model results are found to be sensitive to the coefficient c 0 associated with the eddy particle interaction time see eq 36 and a value of c 0 3 is calibrated to match the measured concentration profile in the dilute particle laden flow after calibrating the eddy interaction model for dilute suspension an application of cfdem eim to steady sheet flow was carried out by simulating the laboratory experiment of revil baudard et al 2015 with c 0 3 although good agreements for flow velocity turbulence kinetic energy sediment concentration and sediment flux profiles are obtained for most of the sheet flow layer the model clearly underpredicts turbulence and suspended sediment concentration in the dilute region the underpredicted suspended sediment concentration is quantified by sediment diffusivity and we found that the sediment diffusivity decreases as the coefficient c 0 increases while the fluid turbulent eddy viscosity is not sensitive to c 0 values as a result the resulting schmidt number ratio of fluid eddy viscosity to the sediment diffusivity reduces as c 0 increases however the schmidt number cannot be reduced to the measured value of 0 44 unless an unrealistic large value of c 0 is used therefore it is likely that the under prediction of suspended sediment concentration in the dilute region is mainly due to underprediction of turbulence kinetic energy above the major sheet flow layer as the higher level of turbulence may be associated with intermittent sediment burst events especially pronounced for lightweight particles revil baudard et al 2015 a turbulence resolving approach for the present euler lagrange model may be necessary meanwhile as the model can reproduce the major features of sheet flow layer a model investigation was carried out to investigate the role of eim and the resulting turbulent suspension on sediment transport rate and transport layer thickness model results confirmed that the non dimensional transport rate follows a power law with the shields parameter consistent with empirical formulations significant underprediction of sediment transport rate were obtained without eim due to lack of turbulent suspension and the discrepancy between the result of eim and without eim is more pronounced when the fall parameter is lower than 1 25 relatively smaller setting velocity or larger bottom friction velocity further analysis on transport layer thickness suggests that only when eim is incorporated the model is able to reproduce the well known formula suggested by wilson 1987 future improvements of the present cfdem eim are suggested in the following aspects first the eddy interaction model is included only in the drag force while the other interphase momentum transfer forces such as added mass and lift forces are ignored however their relative importance to the drag force in the eddy interaction model needs more investigations especially for lightweight coarse particles secondly even though the particles are tracked in a 3d domain with a lagrangian approach the fluid is solved only in a 1dv domain and the flow is assumed to be homogeneous in the streamwise and spanwise directions this assumption is reasonable for typical sheet flow conditions however for flows over nonuniform bathymetry or bedforms this assumption is violated and multi dimensional simulations are needed for the fluid phase thirdly the turbulence is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic thus the eddy interaction model may be too simple to reproduce the inhomogeneous features such as turbulent burst and preferential concentrations within the context of turbulence averaged formulation more sophisticated turbulence closure and eddy interaction schemes can be pursued fourthly it is noted that the model results are sensitive to the estimation of eddy life time which is also highly variable based on the flow condition coimbra et al 1998 and a more sophisticated turbulence model that directly resolves the eddy life time will be highly viable furthermore to make good use of the coupled euler lagrange scheme cfdem eim should be extensively applied to study the effects of grain size distribution and grain shape on sediment transport calantoni et al 2004 calantoni and thaxton 2008 fukuoka et al 2014 harada and gotoh 2008 harada et al 2015 finally the present study focused on developing a robust turbulence averaged euler lagrange model for various sediment transport applications however we also identified several outstanding issues in sheet flow sediment transport requiring further investigations such as near bed intermittency and sediment diffusivity which may require a turbulence resolving simulation approach clearly a fundamental understanding on many aspects of turbulence particle interactions must be addressed by turbulence resolving simulations and some encouraging works using the cfdem framework have been reported schmeeckle 2014 sun and

912,leaf litter decomposition in solution is an important part of the carbon cycle when leaf litter is deposited in water the decomposition process takes place releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in hungary the goldenrod and bulrush are spreading over increasing areas along lakes and rivers including the shores of lake balaton the primary role of the kis balaton wetland is to retain inorganic nutrients thereby improving the water quality of lake balaton as the water movement in this area is not very intensive and the water retention time is long carbon dioxide emissions of parts of decomposing plants can be higher in this area we set up a microcosm experiment in a climate chamber to determine the carbon dioxide emissions from the decomposition of goldenrod and bulrush leaves and stems in winter when information about the process is limited due to short investigation time the difference in the impact of temperatures on decomposition of the studied plants was restricted to leaves only in the study significant difference was obtained for the plant species and the plant parts the carbon dioxide increments ranged from 46 7 p 0 001 to 54 5 p 0 001 in every plant treatment related to control one changes in water temperature are reflected in carbon dioxide release with a minor time delay the results showed that the decomposition of plant parts in water during winter contributes to the increase of carbon dioxide emissions from shallow water bodies such as the kis balaton wetland keywords leaf litter decomposition climate chamber kis balaton wetland goldenrod bulrush 1 introduction wetlands play important roles in the regional and global carbon cycle as well as greenhouse gas emissions peng et al 2022 wetlands contain about 12 15 of the global carbon pool and have been studied as sources or sinks of carbon to discover the relationship with global climate change means et al 2016 cao et al 2017 many factors affect co2 emissions in wetlands such as the vegetation types and temperature hu et al 2017 jacotot et al 2018 the global surface temperature is predicted to increase by at least 1 5 c within this century ipcc 2021 because of climate change that expected to affect the litter decomposition rate thus under a warmer climate the balance between ecosystem carbon fixation and decomposition may be altered potentially causing a dramatic increase in the flux of co2 to the atmosphere cox et al 2000 elevated temperatures as a result of global warming have the potential to dramatically alter local ecosystems salah and scholes 2011 carbon cycle is one of the most complexed yet still least well known major natural ecosystem processes on earth brown et al 2001 carbon stored in plants may be released back into the atmosphere in the following two ways it might happen through plant respiration or when plant litter releasing carbon dioxide co2 in the atmosphere kerényi 1995 the decomposition dynamics and rate are largely influenced by the inner characteristics of leaf litter such as physical and chemical goncalves et al 2017 leite rossi et al 2016 furthermore by outer factors both biotic the presence of fungi bacteria and macroinvertebrates and abiotic such as temperature woodward et al 2012 chen et al 2019 without doubt results of the literature have already contributed to a clearer understanding of leaf litter decomposition mainly in terms of streams boyero et al 2015 kominoski et al 2011 thus it can be established that the major factors influencing leaf litter decomposition in an aquatic ecosystem are the environment of decomposers from the dozens of examined factors most emphasis was laid on temperature ph and soluble nutrients ferreira et al 2015 álvarez and bécares 2006 found limited information about variation in decomposition during wintertime they obtained 12 and 15 mass losses in summer and wintertime respectively for bulrush on a constructed wetland in the province of león northwest spain during the first three days of the experiment however despite of all investigations there is still no definite answer in literature regarding the scope and impacts of the outer factors in leaf litter decomposition as leaf litter decomposition is dependent on temperature it may also be affected by the effects of global warming since higher temperatures accelerate decomposition processes through dissolution and increasing energy intake by macroinvertebrates and microbial decomposers gonzález and graca 2003 ferreira and chauvet 2011 kis balaton is an aquatic habitat and wetland with the primary aim of restoring the original flow condition of river zala and retaining inorganic matter in the estuary of the river and also containing the decrease of water quality in lake balaton tátrai et al 2000 littoral zone aquatic habitats play an essential role in the case of lake systems an ecotone between dry land and water body can create diverse natural habitats and the high rate of biomass production at water bodies supply the food chain with a lot of energy strayer and findlay 2010 bulrush typha angustifolia l is a common perennial herbaceous plant distributed throughout wetland systems rivers and lakes of tropical and temperate climate zones smith 1987 it prefers wet soil shallow slow and saline waters and has a tendency to form monodominant stands thus quickly dominating over wetland communities panich pat et al 2004 it is an herbaceous rhizomic species growing up to 3 meters tall pignatti 1982 the stem and the leaves are active during the growing period growing meters above the water level and withering during winter wetzel 2006 in hungary goldenrod solidago canadensis l constantly spreads to newer areas which can also be observed at the banks of lake balaton and kis balaton as an invasive species the novelty of the manuscript is the examination of co2 emission into the atmosphere from plants decomposing under the water surface which has not been examined until now following a site investigation in both kis balaton wetland and a microcosmos study was conducted to analyze the co2 release of goldenrod and bulrush plant components in winter in the in situ studies it is not possible to separate both the effect of decaying plants from other co2 emitters and the tw impact on decomposition process in most cases laboratory studies are carried out under fictitious conditions temperature e t c our study models the effect of daily mean tw based on ten minute s values on decomposition process measured in the wetland and used in simulated laboratory conditions in a climate chamber this way the effecting tw was separated from other environmental factors existing in the nature and we were able to detect only the co2 emissions of decomposing litter under real tw conditions although decomposition only depicts the potential co2 emission during the first three months representing the first 10 20 of mass loss those studies related to winter period are unworthily suffering a lack of proper care the expectance of the investigation was a determination of decomposition for three winter months quantifying the early stage of litter decay using more frequent sample takings than usual in addition we included in the study an invasive plant whose decomposition has not been investigated in the aquatic environment yet 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the climate of hungary is mild continental with long warm and dry summers and fairly cold winters koppen geiger classification cfb a warm temperate humid climate the climate norm 1971 2000 for yearly mean temperature is 10 c and the sum of precipitation is about 600 mm the special geographic and weather conditions of the carpathian basin make hungary sensitive to changes in climate anda and soos 2017 the study was conducted during the winter period of 2019 2020 a three month investigation was conducted during the winter period 9 december 2019 16 march 2020 at the ingói bay of kis balaton latitude 46 65 n longitude 17 19 e elevation 106 m above sea level to determine the decomposition rate for both the stem and leaf material of the goldenrod and the bulrush in the course of investigation the widely used leaf litter bag method was applied in situ experiment bärlocher et al 2020 water temperatures were also in situ recorded using hobo ua 002 64 data logger at 10 min intervals daily mean tw tmin and tmax data were analyzed in the study the latter two ones result the tw range the variability of the daily water temperatures 2 2 determination of leaf litter mass loss in situ experiment samples were collected at time of litter fall october 2019 cleaned from foreign material then dried until reaching their constant dry weight room temperature and low humidity at last 10 g of each were placed into 15x15 cm polyethylene bags with 3 mm mesh sizes thus enabling access for the macroinvertebrate species to leaf litter 54 leaf litter bags were used for each plant part equaling 108 pieces attached to a plastic compartment and finally delivered to the sampling site at the sampling site bags were sprayed with the water of kis balaton to avoid fragmentation caused by sudden intense soaking bags were fastened to the bank and then placed into the water body approximately 1 m from the bank meanwhile special attention was paid to make sure that the bags constantly remain at least 0 4 m below water surface and to ensure this rocks were placed in the middle of the compartments three parallel samples of each plant component the stem and the leaves were retrieved at 1 2 3 7 14 21 42 70 and 98 days after having been placed into water 9 december 2019 16 march 2020 the retrieved litter bags were transferred to laboratory where the foreign material was carefully removed then samples were airdried until reaching constant weight and finally the mass of the remaining leaf litter was measured 2 3 microcosm experiment design following the in situ investigation a microcosmos study was also conducted to analyze the co2 release for both the stem and leaf material of the goldenrod and the bulrush 1 april 2021 7 june 2021 as a first step the water temperature of kis balaton wetland was measured during the in situ experiment during the investigation period a significant fluctuation could be observed in water with ranging between 13 5 3 1 c figure 1 during the investigation the temperature was changed according to these results in the climate chamber the angelantoni industrie ekochl 700 climate chamber enables variable temperature humidity and lighting levels the humidity level was constantly set for 50 the lighting due to wintertime for 7 hours daylight and 17 hours dark period during the preparation of the samples the same protocol was followed as in the case of the other investigation in each 300 ml test tube 1 g of plant material 10 g of mud and 100 ml of water were placed with three repetitions for each plant material as a control three test tubes were filled with 10 g of mud and 100 ml water to eliminate plant interference prior to being placed into the climate chamber test tubes were sealed airtight with parafilm for the co2 measurements a testo 535 device was used with equipped with two infrared co2 absorption sensors the first sample was taken 1 hour after having been placed into the chamber for calibration first the room temperature outside the climate chamber was measured then the examined test tube was taken out from the chamber its parafilm cover removed and the hand held testo device quickly placed into it upon finishing the examination the co2 was blown out of the test tube the second sampling took place 4 hour after incubation and in the remaining time the co2 content of the test tubes filled with plant material water and sediment was measured three times a week on the 98th day after the co2 measurement the water and the plant material were removed from the test tubes the plant material was dried at room temperature to a constant weight 2 4 statistical analysis the distribution of each decomposition series in situ study and microcosm experiment was checked by the shapiro wilks test for normality shapiro wilks test of normality indicated that all data set in situ p 0 102 and microcosm p 0 112 were normally distributed two way analysis of variance anova was performed to examine the impacts of litter species and plant parts effects on litter decomposition in situ study and co2 emission microcosm experiment applying spss software version 17 0 ibm corp new york usa the used model comprised all main effects and all two way interactions followed by student s t test critical value of significance was set to 0 05 correlation analysis between tw tmin and tmax and measured co2 emission in goldenrod stem and leaf and bulrush stem and leaf was carried out spss software version 17 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 leaf litter mass loss litterbag mass for plant and plant parts decreased with time figure 2 a and b different mass loss patterns were observed between litter types the leaves had a significant dry weight loss in the first day due to the dissolution of low molecular weight substances and the effective utilization of these products by microconsumers whereas leaves showed the greatest mass loss in the experiment stems decomposed slowly and gradually until the second stages of the decomposition experiment when mass loss increased considerably after the 21st day bulrush decomposition rates were generally lower than those of other aquatic macrophytes kirschner et al 2001 and were on the same magnitude as tree leaves álvarez and bécares 2006 remaining leaf and stem litter mass on specific sampling dates are presented on figure 2 due to less soluble components in case of the goldenrod a 22 2 mass loss of leaf and a lower 14 5 loss of stem were measured but the difference in remaining litter was insignificant p 0 0948 with time a constant decrease could be noticed for both plant parts in the climate chamber by the end of the investigation a 4 0 mass loss of leaf and a 3 0 loss of the stem material were measured figure 3 in case of the bulrush notably smaller differences were noted figure 3 during the microcosm study 0 5 and 0 2 mass losses were measured in leaf and stem respectively while by the end of the in situ investigation a 12 5 of leaf loss and a 4 5 of stem mass loss were observed p 0 0437 during the in situ investigation 11 1 p 0 0281 and 10 2 p 0 01 differences in mass loss between leaf and stem respectively were observed between goldenrod and bulrush the lowest remaining mass in bulrush stem assumed to be the most resistant emergent macrophyte in wetlands was like that of published by álvarez and bécares 2006 among six studied wetland species differences between the results of the in situ and microcosm study may arise from fragmentation and falling out due to the natural flow of water due to structure of bulrush sheaths leaf with stem there is limited investigation related to decomposition that would treat the bulrush stem and leaf decay separately to solve this problem álvarez and bécares 2006 used constant amount of dried leaf 3 g and stem 2 g to imitate the proportion previously measured in the bulrush in this study the bulrush decomposition was investigated in different organs separately as for the anova results table 1 significant differences were measured for the either the plant species p 0 001 and the plant parts p 0 001 lan et al 2012 concluded as a general rule that decomposition rates of the leaves were always higher than those of the stems for five emerged and one submerged species including bulrush in the north china plain at the baiyangdian lake nevertheless the cross effect examinations showed an insignificant influence p 0 103 therefore in can be concluded that the decomposition process proceeded homogeneously to the two plant species in this study the cumulative mass loss was 12 5 in bulrush at the end of the 98 day experiment for 3 times longer incubation time produced 3 times higher mass loss 39 4 in bulrush duke et al 2015 in erie lake 42 n in the us in accordance with observation of dekanová et al 2021 carried out in aquatic environment the litter of invasive plant goldenrod in this case decomposed faster than the native one previous studies in invasive plants confirmed easily disrupted and processed thin and soft leaves leishman et al 2007 may be the reason of faster decomposition of invasive plants compared to native ones in addition kuglerová et al 2017 reported high nutrient concentration in goldenrod leaves the above observations seem to contradict homefield advantage hypothesis of native species dekanová et al 2021 3 2 co2 emission during the decomposition of bulrush and goldenrod microcosm experiment at the area of kis balaton water flow is not intense and water resides for considerable time due to its water retaining capacity thus through measuring decomposing plant components co2 release can be thoroughly examined as shown in the figure 4 it is clearly visible that samples containing plant material had a significantly higher co2 release compared to the control study despite the fact that decomposition takes place subsurface it still results in measurable gas release changes in tw are reflected in co2 release with a minor time delay the co2 increments ranged from 46 7 p 0 001 to 54 5 p 0 001 in every plant treatment related to control one out of the examined plants and plant components the bulrush stem exhibited the highest co2 release figure 4 compared to the goldenrod leaf the bulrush leaf had a 6 2 lower co2 release which is not a significant difference p 0 2249 regarding the goldenrod the lowest co2 release was measured in case of its stem the bulrush stem had a 14 0 higher co2 release p 0 0302 while no significant difference was detected for the leaf and stem of the bulrush p 0 2779 similarly to goldenrod tissues p 0 7004 the slopes of the linear regression between co2 release and unit investigation time increased for leaves bulrush 12 422 mg m 2 solidago 11 419 mg m 2 in comparison with stems the goldenrod leaves produced 8 4 higher gas emission for time unit than bulrush leaves although the two species stem co2 emissions were very close to each other bulrush 10 807 mg m 2 goldenrod 10 833 mg m 2 based on anova results table 2 both the main effect of species p 0 001 and plant parts p 0 001 and their interaction p 0 001 on the co2 release during the winter 2019 2020 were highly significant goldenrod had 6 7 and 17 8 greater co2 production in leaves and stem respectively than that of bulrush organs in the current study the co2 production of plant leaves were strongly correlated with water temperature variables including mean tw bulrush r 0 629 goldenrod r 0 647 and extreme ones bulrush r 0 575 0 63 goldenrod r 0 658 0 624 table 3 the r values of the goldenrod stem r 0 509 0 401 were close to the r for leaves each temperature variables tw tmin and tmax the lower water temperature effect on bulrush stem s co2 release r 0 024 0 509 might be the short observational time in the study in the investigation the amount co2 release coming from the water cover during the decomposition process was uniquely examined until now this phenomenon was not studied in the invasive goldenrod goldenrod produced 1 13 times as much aboveground litter as native bulrush thus in goldenrod invaded areas co2 emission and c input in water might increase as a result of higher litter production as well as increased mass specific input zhang et al 2014 feng et al 2007 observed that due to faster litter decomposition of invasive plant species greater carbon fixing capacity relative to native ones was manifested as there are limited number of literatures for bulrush and goldenrod decomposition dealing with co2 release under water we couldn t compare our results to those ones coming from available publications from the co2 inputs of groundwater and respiration of plants in the nature min and rulík s 2020 study measured the co2 emission coming from macrophyte litters as co2 dynamics may vary among geographical places hydrological factors and wetland types there are some doubts about the contribution of plants into the co2 emission in different environmental conditions in fact striegl et al 2012 published that contribution of wetland macrophytes to co2 release was negligible in the yukon river basin for deeper understanding of global carbon cycle spatial and temporal variabilities of co2 emissions are needed chan et al 2021 carbon dioxide release for bulrush in this study was close to the kuye river basin one published by chan et al 2021 although their chamber experiment hasn t provided the plant species chan et al 2021 examined the co2 amount of kuye river basin according to their results the co2 amount of the streamwater was 300 ppm lower in the autumn than in all the other seasons furthermore they observed similar co2 results in the spring and summer months although the temperature is lower in spring and probably the organic carbon and co2 production is slower due to the mineralization by microorganisms acuna et al 2008 chan et al 2021 pointed out that this result is probably explained by the frosty period in kuye river basin in this frosty winter period the ice covering can greatly prevent the co2 release into the atmosphere leading to the accumulation of a great amount of dissolved co2 as the organic components continue to undergo decomposition processes in the water body below the ice covering wallin et al 2013 teodoru et al 2009 a number of studies confirm that the partial pressure of co2 at the water air surface is both influenced by biotic and abiotic processes alike reiman et al 2019 striegl et al 2012 below water surface the co2 release of samples with plant tissues significantly differed from those one without any plant material increments between 46 7 p 0 001 and 54 5 p 0 001 were observed in co2 release containing plant parts compared with gas emission of water only this data exceeded

the river amazon by acuna et al 2008 found that the amount of co2 is mainly restricted by hydrological factors and the respiration of macrophytes in terms of the latter process the results in literature are not unanimous according to the study of striegl et al 2012 his investigation at the bank of river yukon showed that the respiration of macrophytes did not have a significant effect on the co2 dynamics according to marx et al 2017 in the case of lower order streams the major amount of co2 originates from the surrounding terrestrial environment while regarding higher order streams the carbon dynamics is more sensitive to the in situ metabolism 4 conclusions microcosmos study was carried out about co2 release of native bulrush and widely spreading invasive goldenrod in climate chamber input data of the microcosm were based on actual field measurements simulating the real conditions of the kis balaton wetland in situ experiment the increases in released co2 amounts in response to leaf tissues differed in the two species the leaves of invasive goldenrod produced more co2 than that of the leaves of native bulrush although in case of the stems the co2 emission for unit mass were just the opposite bulrush stem goldenrod stem based on the literature the goldenrod produces 1 13 times higher aboveground biomass compared to native species resulting increased co2 emission for wetland surface unit carbon dioxide emission was primarily driven by litter quality beyond litter quality the composition of goldenrod leaves easily disrupted and processed thin and soft leaves might also lead to its higher gas emission however there were differences in the effects of temperatures mean maximum and minimum on co2 releases during wintertime temperature had a stronger

912,leaf litter decomposition in solution is an important part of the carbon cycle when leaf litter is deposited in water the decomposition process takes place releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in hungary the goldenrod and bulrush are spreading over increasing areas along lakes and rivers including the shores of lake balaton the primary role of the kis balaton wetland is to retain inorganic nutrients thereby improving the water quality of lake balaton as the water movement in this area is not very intensive and the water retention time is long carbon dioxide emissions of parts of decomposing plants can be higher in this area we set up a microcosm experiment in a climate chamber to determine the carbon dioxide emissions from the decomposition of goldenrod and bulrush leaves and stems in winter when information about the process is limited due to short investigation time the difference in the impact of temperatures on decomposition of the studied plants was restricted to leaves only in the study significant difference was obtained for the plant species and the plant parts the carbon dioxide increments ranged from 46 7 p 0 001 to 54 5 p 0 001 in every plant treatment related to control one changes in water temperature are reflected in carbon dioxide release with a minor time delay the results showed that the decomposition of plant parts in water during winter contributes to the increase of carbon dioxide emissions from shallow water bodies such as the kis balaton wetland keywords leaf litter decomposition climate chamber kis balaton wetland goldenrod bulrush 1 introduction wetlands play important roles in the regional and global carbon cycle as well as greenhouse gas emissions peng et al 2022 wetlands contain about 12 15 of the global carbon pool and have been studied as sources or sinks of carbon to discover the relationship with global climate change means et al 2016 cao et al 2017 many factors affect co2 emissions in wetlands such as the vegetation types and temperature hu et al 2017 jacotot et al 2018 the global surface temperature is predicted to increase by at least 1 5 c within this century ipcc 2021 because of climate change that expected to affect the litter decomposition rate thus under a warmer climate the balance between ecosystem carbon fixation and decomposition may be altered potentially causing a dramatic increase in the flux of co2 to the atmosphere cox et al 2000 elevated temperatures as a result of global warming have the potential to dramatically alter local ecosystems salah and scholes 2011 carbon cycle is one of the most complexed yet still least well known major natural ecosystem processes on earth brown et al 2001 carbon stored in plants may be released back into the atmosphere in the following two ways it might happen through plant respiration or when plant litter releasing carbon dioxide co2 in the atmosphere kerényi 1995 the decomposition dynamics and rate are largely influenced by the inner characteristics of leaf litter such as physical and chemical goncalves et al 2017 leite rossi et al 2016 furthermore by outer factors both biotic the presence of fungi bacteria and macroinvertebrates and abiotic such as temperature woodward et al 2012 chen et al 2019 without doubt results of the literature have already contributed to a clearer understanding of leaf litter decomposition mainly in terms of streams boyero et al 2015 kominoski et al 2011 thus it can be established that the major factors influencing leaf litter decomposition in an aquatic ecosystem are the environment of decomposers from the dozens of examined factors most emphasis was laid on temperature ph and soluble nutrients ferreira et al 2015 álvarez and bécares 2006 found limited information about variation in decomposition during wintertime they obtained 12 and 15 mass losses in summer and wintertime respectively for bulrush on a constructed wetland in the province of león northwest spain during the first three days of the experiment however despite of all investigations there is still no definite answer in literature regarding the scope and impacts of the outer factors in leaf litter decomposition as leaf litter decomposition is dependent on temperature it may also be affected by the effects of global warming since higher temperatures accelerate decomposition processes through dissolution and increasing energy intake by macroinvertebrates and microbial decomposers gonzález and graca 2003 ferreira and chauvet 2011 kis balaton is an aquatic habitat and wetland with the primary aim of restoring the original flow condition of river zala and retaining inorganic matter in the estuary of the river and also containing the decrease of water quality in lake balaton tátrai et al 2000 littoral zone aquatic habitats play an essential role in the case of lake systems an ecotone between dry land and water body can create diverse natural habitats and the high rate of biomass production at water bodies supply the food chain with a lot of energy strayer and findlay 2010 bulrush typha angustifolia l is a common perennial herbaceous plant distributed throughout wetland systems rivers and lakes of tropical and temperate climate zones smith 1987 it prefers wet soil shallow slow and saline waters and has a tendency to form monodominant stands thus quickly dominating over wetland communities panich pat et al 2004 it is an herbaceous rhizomic species growing up to 3 meters tall pignatti 1982 the stem and the leaves are active during the growing period growing meters above the water level and withering during winter wetzel 2006 in hungary goldenrod solidago canadensis l constantly spreads to newer areas which can also be observed at the banks of lake balaton and kis balaton as an invasive species the novelty of the manuscript is the examination of co2 emission into the atmosphere from plants decomposing under the water surface which has not been examined until now following a site investigation in both kis balaton wetland and a microcosmos study was conducted to analyze the co2 release of goldenrod and bulrush plant components in winter in the in situ studies it is not possible to separate both the effect of decaying plants from other co2 emitters and the tw impact on decomposition process in most cases laboratory studies are carried out under fictitious conditions temperature e t c our study models the effect of daily mean tw based on ten minute s values on decomposition process measured in the wetland and used in simulated laboratory conditions in a climate chamber this way the effecting tw was separated from other environmental factors existing in the nature and we were able to detect only the co2 emissions of decomposing litter under real tw conditions although decomposition only depicts the potential co2 emission during the first three months representing the first 10 20 of mass loss those studies related to winter period are unworthily suffering a lack of proper care the expectance of the investigation was a determination of decomposition for three winter months quantifying the early stage of litter decay using more frequent sample takings than usual in addition we included in the study an invasive plant whose decomposition has not been investigated in the aquatic environment yet 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the climate of hungary is mild continental with long warm and dry summers and fairly cold winters koppen geiger classification cfb a warm temperate humid climate the climate norm 1971 2000 for yearly mean temperature is 10 c and the sum of precipitation is about 600 mm the special geographic and weather conditions of the carpathian basin make hungary sensitive to changes in climate anda and soos 2017 the study was conducted during the winter period of 2019 2020 a three month investigation was conducted during the winter period 9 december 2019 16 march 2020 at the ingói bay of kis balaton latitude 46 65 n longitude 17 19 e elevation 106 m above sea level to determine the decomposition rate for both the stem and leaf material of the goldenrod and the bulrush in the course of investigation the widely used leaf litter bag method was applied in situ experiment bärlocher et al 2020 water temperatures were also in situ recorded using hobo ua 002 64 data logger at 10 min intervals daily mean tw tmin and tmax data were analyzed in the study the latter two ones result the tw range the variability of the daily water temperatures 2 2 determination of leaf litter mass loss in situ experiment samples were collected at time of litter fall october 2019 cleaned from foreign material then dried until reaching their constant dry weight room temperature and low humidity at last 10 g of each were placed into 15x15 cm polyethylene bags with 3 mm mesh sizes thus enabling access for the macroinvertebrate species to leaf litter 54 leaf litter bags were used for each plant part equaling 108 pieces attached to a plastic compartment and finally delivered to the sampling site at the sampling site bags were sprayed with the water of kis balaton to avoid fragmentation caused by sudden intense soaking bags were fastened to the bank and then placed into the water body approximately 1 m from the bank meanwhile special attention was paid to make sure that the bags constantly remain at least 0 4 m below water surface and to ensure this rocks were placed in the middle of the compartments three parallel samples of each plant component the stem and the leaves were retrieved at 1 2 3 7 14 21 42 70 and 98 days after having been placed into water 9 december 2019 16 march 2020 the retrieved litter bags were transferred to laboratory where the foreign material was carefully removed then samples were airdried until reaching constant weight and finally the mass of the remaining leaf litter was measured 2 3 microcosm experiment design following the in situ investigation a microcosmos study was also conducted to analyze the co2 release for both the stem and leaf material of the goldenrod and the bulrush 1 april 2021 7 june 2021 as a first step the water temperature of kis balaton wetland was measured during the in situ experiment during the investigation period a significant fluctuation could be observed in water with ranging between 13 5 3 1 c figure 1 during the investigation the temperature was changed according to these results in the climate chamber the angelantoni industrie ekochl 700 climate chamber enables variable temperature humidity and lighting levels the humidity level was constantly set for 50 the lighting due to wintertime for 7 hours daylight and 17 hours dark period during the preparation of the samples the same protocol was followed as in the case of the other investigation in each 300 ml test tube 1 g of plant material 10 g of mud and 100 ml of water were placed with three repetitions for each plant material as a control three test tubes were filled with 10 g of mud and 100 ml water to eliminate plant interference prior to being placed into the climate chamber test tubes were sealed airtight with parafilm for the co2 measurements a testo 535 device was used with equipped with two infrared co2 absorption sensors the first sample was taken 1 hour after having been placed into the chamber for calibration first the room temperature outside the climate chamber was measured then the examined test tube was taken out from the chamber its parafilm cover removed and the hand held testo device quickly placed into it upon finishing the examination the co2 was blown out of the test tube the second sampling took place 4 hour after incubation and in the remaining time the co2 content of the test tubes filled with plant material water and sediment was measured three times a week on the 98th day after the co2 measurement the water and the plant material were removed from the test tubes the plant material was dried at room temperature to a constant weight 2 4 statistical analysis the distribution of each decomposition series in situ study and microcosm experiment was checked by the shapiro wilks test for normality shapiro wilks test of normality indicated that all data set in situ p 0 102 and microcosm p 0 112 were normally distributed two way analysis of variance anova was performed to examine the impacts of litter species and plant parts effects on litter decomposition in situ study and co2 emission microcosm experiment applying spss software version 17 0 ibm corp new york usa the used model comprised all main effects and all two way interactions followed by student s t test critical value of significance was set to 0 05 correlation analysis between tw tmin and tmax and measured co2 emission in goldenrod stem and leaf and bulrush stem and leaf was carried out spss software version 17 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 leaf litter mass loss litterbag mass for plant and plant parts decreased with time figure 2 a and b different mass loss patterns were observed between litter types the leaves had a significant dry weight loss in the first day due to the dissolution of low molecular weight substances and the effective utilization of these products by microconsumers whereas leaves showed the greatest mass loss in the experiment stems decomposed slowly and gradually until the second stages of the decomposition experiment when mass loss increased considerably after the 21st day bulrush decomposition rates were generally lower than those of other aquatic macrophytes kirschner et al 2001 and were on the same magnitude as tree leaves álvarez and bécares 2006 remaining leaf and stem litter mass on specific sampling dates are presented on figure 2 due to less soluble components in case of the goldenrod a 22 2 mass loss of leaf and a lower 14 5 loss of stem were measured but the difference in remaining litter was insignificant p 0 0948 with time a constant decrease could be noticed for both plant parts in the climate chamber by the end of the investigation a 4 0 mass loss of leaf and a 3 0 loss of the stem material were measured figure 3 in case of the bulrush notably smaller differences were noted figure 3 during the microcosm study 0 5 and 0 2 mass losses were measured in leaf and stem respectively while by the end of the in situ investigation a 12 5 of leaf loss and a 4 5 of stem mass loss were observed p 0 0437 during the in situ investigation 11 1 p 0 0281 and 10 2 p 0 01 differences in mass loss between leaf and stem respectively were observed between goldenrod and bulrush the lowest remaining mass in bulrush stem assumed to be the most resistant emergent macrophyte in wetlands was like that of published by álvarez and bécares 2006 among six studied wetland species differences between the results of the in situ and microcosm study may arise from fragmentation and falling out due to the natural flow of water due to structure of bulrush sheaths leaf with stem there is limited investigation related to decomposition that would treat the bulrush stem and leaf decay separately to solve this problem álvarez and bécares 2006 used constant amount of dried leaf 3 g and stem 2 g to imitate the proportion previously measured in the bulrush in this study the bulrush decomposition was investigated in different organs separately as for the anova results table 1 significant differences were measured for the either the plant species p 0 001 and the plant parts p 0 001 lan et al 2012 concluded as a general rule that decomposition rates of the leaves were always higher than those of the stems for five emerged and one submerged species including bulrush in the north china plain at the baiyangdian lake nevertheless the cross effect examinations showed an insignificant influence p 0 103 therefore in can be concluded that the decomposition process proceeded homogeneously to the two plant species in this study the cumulative mass loss was 12 5 in bulrush at the end of the 98 day experiment for 3 times longer incubation time produced 3 times higher mass loss 39 4 in bulrush duke et al 2015 in erie lake 42 n in the us in accordance with observation of dekanová et al 2021 carried out in aquatic environment the litter of invasive plant goldenrod in this case decomposed faster than the native one previous studies in invasive plants confirmed easily disrupted and processed thin and soft leaves leishman et al 2007 may be the reason of faster decomposition of invasive plants compared to native ones in addition kuglerová et al 2017 reported high nutrient concentration in goldenrod leaves the above observations seem to contradict homefield advantage hypothesis of native species dekanová et al 2021 3 2 co2 emission during the decomposition of bulrush and goldenrod microcosm experiment at the area of kis balaton water flow is not intense and water resides for considerable time due to its water retaining capacity thus through measuring decomposing plant components co2 release can be thoroughly examined as shown in the figure 4 it is clearly visible that samples containing plant material had a significantly higher co2 release compared to the control study despite the fact that decomposition takes place subsurface it still results in measurable gas release changes in tw are reflected in co2 release with a minor time delay the co2 increments ranged from 46 7 p 0 001 to 54 5 p 0 001 in every plant treatment related to control one out of the examined plants and plant components the bulrush stem exhibited the highest co2 release figure 4 compared to the goldenrod leaf the bulrush leaf had a 6 2 lower co2 release which is not a significant difference p 0 2249 regarding the goldenrod the lowest co2 release was measured in case of its stem the bulrush stem had a 14 0 higher co2 release p 0 0302 while no significant difference was detected for the leaf and stem of the bulrush p 0 2779 similarly to goldenrod tissues p 0 7004 the slopes of the linear regression between co2 release and unit investigation time increased for leaves bulrush 12 422 mg m 2 solidago 11 419 mg m 2 in comparison with stems the goldenrod leaves produced 8 4 higher gas emission for time unit than bulrush leaves although the two species stem co2 emissions were very close to each other bulrush 10 807 mg m 2 goldenrod 10 833 mg m 2 based on anova results table 2 both the main effect of species p 0 001 and plant parts p 0 001 and their interaction p 0 001 on the co2 release during the winter 2019 2020 were highly significant goldenrod had 6 7 and 17 8 greater co2 production in leaves and stem respectively than that of bulrush organs in the current study the co2 production of plant leaves were strongly correlated with water temperature variables including mean tw bulrush r 0 629 goldenrod r 0 647 and extreme ones bulrush r 0 575 0 63 goldenrod r 0 658 0 624 table 3 the r values of the goldenrod stem r 0 509 0 401 were close to the r for leaves each temperature variables tw tmin and tmax the lower water temperature effect on bulrush stem s co2 release r 0 024 0 509 might be the short observational time in the study in the investigation the amount co2 release coming from the water cover during the decomposition process was uniquely examined until now this phenomenon was not studied in the invasive goldenrod goldenrod produced 1 13 times as much aboveground litter as native bulrush thus in goldenrod invaded areas co2 emission and c input in water might increase as a result of higher litter production as well as increased mass specific input zhang et al 2014 feng et al 2007 observed that due to faster litter decomposition of invasive plant species greater carbon fixing capacity relative to native ones was manifested as there are limited number of literatures for bulrush and goldenrod decomposition dealing with co2 release under water we couldn t compare our results to those ones coming from available publications from the co2 inputs of groundwater and respiration of plants in the nature min and rulík s 2020 study measured the co2 emission coming from macrophyte litters as co2 dynamics may vary among geographical places hydrological factors and wetland types there are some doubts about the contribution of plants into the co2 emission in different environmental conditions in fact striegl et al 2012 published that contribution of wetland macrophytes to co2 release was negligible in the yukon river basin for deeper understanding of global carbon cycle spatial and temporal variabilities of co2 emissions are needed chan et al 2021 carbon dioxide release for bulrush in this study was close to the kuye river basin one published by chan et al 2021 although their chamber experiment hasn t provided the plant species chan et al 2021 examined the co2 amount of kuye river basin according to their results the co2 amount of the streamwater was 300 ppm lower in the autumn than in all the other seasons furthermore they observed similar co2 results in the spring and summer months although the temperature is lower in spring and probably the organic carbon and co2 production is slower due to the mineralization by microorganisms acuna et al 2008 chan et al 2021 pointed out that this result is probably explained by the frosty period in kuye river basin in this frosty winter period the ice covering can greatly prevent the co2 release into the atmosphere leading to the accumulation of a great amount of dissolved co2 as the organic components continue to undergo decomposition processes in the water body below the ice covering wallin et al 2013 teodoru et al 2009 a number of studies confirm that the partial pressure of co2 at the water air surface is both influenced by biotic and abiotic processes alike reiman et al 2019 striegl et al 2012 below water surface the co2 release of samples with plant tissues significantly differed from those one without any plant material increments between 46 7 p 0 001 and 54 5 p 0 001 were observed in co2 release containing plant parts compared with gas emission of water only this data exceeded

913,wetlands are amongst the world s most effective natural carbon sinks and also have the potential to emit large quantities of stored carbon back into the atmosphere if disturbed in the murray darling basin high consumptive demand for water has led to widespread wetland loss and degradation remaining wetlands are commonly under additional pressure from grazing and trampling by feral herbivores or livestock and unseasonal flooding in summer to meet peak irrigation demand here during a summer flood in barmah national park we compared soil carbon and nitrogen and carbon emissions

co2 and methane ch4 emissions averaged 132 27 9 88 g co2 e m 2 d 1 an estimated 28 to 89 fold higher than the global average for natural wetlands the high warming potential of the wetland was driven strongly by ch4 emissions which made up over 90 of total co2 equivalents with co2 contributing 10 we expect these values represent peak ch4 emissions from the site due to high water and soil temperatures and low water levels at the time of sampling soil carbon and nitrogen did not differ significantly within and outside of the exclusion plot but surface soil samples indicated recent

park we used little rushy swamp lrs a marsh floodplain within barmah forest and the site of a feral herbivore exclusion plot as a case study we sampled soil carbon and soil nitrogen and monitored carbon emissions from within and outside of the exclusion plot in january 2019 following an unseasonal summer flood we hypothesised that 1 carbon emissions would be higher than similar wetlands flooded in winter spring due to higher water temperatures at the time of sampling 2 carbon emissions would be lower in the fenced half of the wetland due to improved soil condition in the absence of

phase of an unseasonal summer flood in barmah national park the sampling window was restricted to a period of only several days prior to the wetland drying and as such intensive sampling was carried out over two days and nights the experimental design divided the wetlands into two zones the first within the exclusion plot fenced where feral herbivores were excluded and the second outside of the exclusion plot unfenced where feral herbivores were present fig 1 2 2 carbon emissions carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 diffusive emissions were recorded in replicates of 10 per wetland zone fenced

sampled manually using 50 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe to a maximum depth of 10 cm from the soil surface this depth was based on carnell et al 2018 showing accretion rates in wetlands of south east australia range from 0 14 0 9 mm per year and our aim to capture differences since exclusion fencing was installed two years prior to sampling 2017 a correction factor was used to adjust depth and volume calculations affected by soil compaction during sample collection wherein the difference between the soil depth within and outside of the pvc soil core was added to the depth of the sample collected this correction factor assumes any compaction is equivalent at all depths of the core although greater compaction likely occurs closer the soil surface samples were sectioned into segments as follows 0 1 cm 1 2 cm 2 3 cm 3 4 cm 4 6 cm and 6 8 cm then oven dried until a stable mass was reached and weighed to calculate dry bulk density dbd g cm 3 the samples were homogenized and

2019 the sustained global warming potential sgwp represented as co2 equivalents co2e of the site was between 28 89 fold higher than other natural wetlands and even 11 40 fold higher than average for constructed wetlands maltais landry et al 2009 ollivier et al 2019a fig 5 this key finding presents a new argument in the case for managed flows following natural hydrological regimes where flood timing is critical not only for floodplain ecohydrology but also for avoiding significant methane emission to the atmosphere methane emissions made up over 90 of the sustained global warming potential sgwp of the wetland at the time of sampling table 1 which is supported by previous research showing that across a range of different wetland types ch4 contributes a greater proportion of total global warming potential than both co2 and n2o page and dalal 2011 tian et al 2011 wang et al 2021 temperature alone is a strong driver of ch4 production e g brix et al 2001 chen et al 2021 mitsch et al 2012 with optimum growth of methanogenic microbes at 30 40 c whalen 2005 which corresponds to water temperatures at little rushy swamp at the time of this research estimated at 30 c this is consistent with a number of studies showing that wetland ch4 emissions peak in summer e g jeffrey et al 2019 kandel et al 2019 ollivier et al 2019b however even compared with a wetland in the same region in spring summer emissions from little rushy swamp were around 7 fold higher boon et al 1997 boon and sorrell 1995 krüger et al 2014 fig 5 this is likely owing to complex interactions between soil and water temperatures soil water content and surface water levels which together control wetland carbon emissions song et al 2003 at the time of sampling little rushy swamp was in the draw down phase of the wet dry cycle with an average water depth of only 7 9 cm a lower water table facilitates heating of the water column which increases gas release rates shelley et al 2015 yvon durocher et al 2014 in addition to transferring both heat and moisture into soils creating conditions that enhance microbial activity promoting rates of methanogenesis and heterotrophic respiration e g moyano et al 2013 gondwe et al 2021 further it reduces the amount of time available for methanotrophic processes to occur in the water column resulting in higher net ch4 emissions bastviken et al 2003 song et al 2003 demonstrate that surface water level is the key controlling factor over wetland ch4 emission above temperature and that while both soil and water temperatures influence carbon emissions from wetlands soil temperature is the stronger driver of the two co2 emissions are also highly correlated with soil temperature increasing linearly with incremental rises in temperature e g kayranli et al 2010 mckenzie et al 1998 moore and dalva 1993 by sampling over a short mid summer period at end of the wet phase our results likely represent peak ch4 emissions for the site owing to the suitability of a high temperature low oxygen environment for promoting methanogenesis wilson et al 2011 boon et al 1997 we would expect that a watering during the cooler months would reduce wet phase emissions of both ch4 and co2 and b during the dry phase total emissions would be higher than during a winter spring flood but lower than a summer flood with co2 contributing more to overall carbon emissions due to the availability of oxygen for methane oxidation treby 2021 ephemeral wetlands such as floodplains typically produce greater volumes of ch4 than permanent wetlands due to higher biogeochemical activity altor and mitsch 2008 evans and wallenstein 2012 this may be driven by higher respiration rates in methanogenic microbes in these systems which are well adapted to dynamic changes in redox conditions boon et al 1997 kannenberg et al 2015 and or increased availability of labile carbon driven by high primary productivity i e autochthonous carbon sources such as course woody debris litter and aquatic macrophytes robertson et al 1999 in floodplain wetlands high loads of allochthonous carbon sourced from upstream erosion and riverine transport may also provide a labile substrate for methanogenesis in sediments robertson et al 1999 where surface and groundwater interact during wetland recharge the biogeochemical mixing zone between them can become an important conduit for diffusive ch4 emissions from groundwater to the atmosphere wu et al 2020 in addition to providing a source of carbon to riverine food webs feris et al 2003 thus here contributions of groundwater ch4 and co2 may have contributed to the net emissions recorded in ephemeral wetlands during periods when the water table is below the soil surface i e there is no surface water present wetland sediments have the potential to become net ch4 sinks as rates of organic matter decomposition in the system increase song et al 2003 we suggest that quantification of dry phase carbon emissions uptake at the site e g treby 2021 in addition to winter spring wet phase sampling would provide context to the fundings of the present study and would enable estimates of annual carbon emissions from the site to be generated 4 2 carbon emissions and feral herbivore exclusion higher co2 emissions corresponding to feral herbivore exclusion at little rushy swamp are most likely the result of increased plant respiration where pseudoraphis spinescens biomass has increased following the reduction of grazing and trampling net ecosystem exchange nee reflects the carbon balance of the system where nee is the balance of co2 uptake through photosynthesis gross primary productivity gpp and co2 emitted via ecosystem respiration e g waring and running 2007 yakir 2003 the dark chamber method used in this study captures only co2 respiration as blocking light penetration during measurement prevents plant photosynthetic activity lankreijer et al 2009 larsen et al 2022 therefore while measured co2 respiration was higher within the exclusion plot photosynthetic activity from increased plant biomass was also almost certainly higher e g reichstein and carvalhais 2019 which would reduce net co2 emissions from this part of the wetland furthermore the additional carbon accrued in plant biomass in the continued absence of feral herbivores will likely contribute to future increases in soil carbon and potentially to long term sequestration craft and richardson 1993 hossler and bouchard 2010 bernal and mitsch 2013 in future research the use of transparent flux chambers and or eddy covariance methods may help elucidate relationships between plant biomass hydrological cycles and co2 emission and uptake as a consequence of grazing disturbance and recovery ch4 emissions did not differ significantly between zones showing no influence of grazing and trampling on methanogenic or methanotrophic microbial activity in the wetland this is in contrast with what we hypothesized trampling can reduce ch4 oxidation through disturbance to the oxic anoxic interface between soils and plant roots and change soil compaction levels and nutrient movement frenzel and rudolph 1998 sitaula et al 2000 yamulki and jarvis 2002 no detectible change in ch4 emissions following grazing removal corresponds to our finding that soil compaction measured as dry bulk density did not differ significantly between wetland zones discussed further below however we did observe more variability in ch4 fluxes in the unfenced wetland zone which could be attributable to trampling effects on soils that increase heterogeneity and microspatial variation across the wetland oates et al 2008 overall the similar rates of ch4 emission between the two areas of the wetland suggest that here hydrological factors including flood timing duration and water level and consequent soil and water temperatures are stronger drivers of wetland carbon emissions than grazing disturbance 4 3 soil condition and feral herbivore exclusion feral herbivore exclusion did not result in any significant changes in soil bulk density nitrogen concentration or carbon concentration however there was a reversal trend in the top 1 cm fig 4 indicating a shift in soil condition in recent history in the surface horizon soil nitrogen and carbon concentrations were slightly higher in the fenced zone than in the unfenced zone while bulk density was slightly lower based on shallow freshwater marsh sediment accretion rates in southeastern australia this surface layer may reflect the past 7 25 years carnell et al 2018 we therefore expect that the top 1 cm captures differences attributable at least in part to the exclusion of feral herbivores at little rushy swamp it is likely that subsequent increases in above and belowground biomass predominantly that of p spinescens are driving this shift in soil condition e g fontaine et al 2004 maucieri et al 2014 across the site soil characteristics appeared similar to averages for other wetlands across victoria carnell et al 2018 soil carbon concentrations were slightly lower than the state wide wetland average 7 7 but higher than the global wetland average of 2 13 dong et al 2022 soil carbon density and bulk density were almost identical to the state wide averages of 31 mg cm 3and 1 g cm 3 respectively carnell et al 2018 below the surface soil carbon concentrations were consistently lower and bulk density was consistently higher in the fenced zone we speculate that this relates to the former mustering station having more concentrated cattle activity in the now fenced zone of little rushy swamp and consequent land use legacy impacts e g holl and aide 2011 peralta et al 2018 treby et al 2020 victorian heritage register 2009 although we were unable to find historical records to substantiate this 4 4 management implications our findings have important implications for land managers and or policy advisors seeking to achieve carbon emission reductions through natural resource management we suggest that floodplain carbon emissions could be substantially reduced by changing the timing of water delivery to actively prevent summer floods through forested floodplains both within the murray darling basin and more widely chong and ladson 2003 discuss approaches for better managing unseasonal flows to reduce summer flooding through barmah millewa forest maintaining a natural flow regime in riverine systems is critical for floodplain ecology and biogeochemical cycling and interactions between these two critical aspects of a healthy wetland ecosystem robertson et al 199 hydrology controls the growth productivity and survival of floodplain vegetation which determines the quantity of carbon available for downstream transport underpins riverine food webs and provides habitat for wetland fauna including many threatened species beesley et al 2011 chong and ladson 2003 robertson et al 1999 an additional benefit of avoiding summer flood events is the reduced risk of hypoxic blackwater events e g mccarthy et al 2014 small et al 2014 watts et al 2017 blackwater is created through the contribution of dissolved organic carbon doc leaches from leaf litter and detritus on floodplains e g howitt et al 2007 kerr et al 2013 high carbon loads in blackwater are consumed by aquatic microorganisms which depletes dissolved oxygen levels creating hypoxic or anoxic conditions that can lead to mass fish and crustacean deaths in the river network e g mccarthy et al 2014 small et al 2014 watts et al 2017 the risk of hypoxic blackwater events is heightened in summer as higher temperatures lead to decreased o2 solubility in water increases microbial metabolic rates enhances enzyme reaction rates and alters doc solubility whitworth et al 2012 forested floodplains typically have large amounts of labile carbon on the forest floor owing to large volumes of leaf litter and other debris robertson et al 1999 when flooded this carbon is readily leached from litter into the water column e g watts et al 2017 whitworth et al 2012 and here was likely a significant contributor to the carbon used in methanogenesis leading to high net ch4 emission from little rushy swamp summer flooding has triggered a number of hypoxic blackwater events of varying sizes and impacts in the murray darling basin robertson et al 2001 howitt et al 2007 whitworth et al 2012 and blackwater risk mitigation is a current management priority joehnk et al 2020 thus we would expect that by delivering flows in winter spring rather than spring summer several beneficial ecohydrological and biogeochemical outcomes could be achieved through this single management strategy australia s emissions reduction fund provides incentives for shifting the timing of savanna burns from late season to early season to reduce fire intensity resulting in emissions avoidance department of the environment and energy 2018 department of the environment and energy 2016 we recommend continued research into seasonal flooding and greenhouse gas emissions for a similar emissions avoidance scheme to be developed for regulated riverine wetland ecosystems however as climate change continues to be realised natural flooding cycles are following decreasing cool season rainfall independent of managed watering murray darling basin authority 2019 therefore some consideration needs to be made for the impact this will have on floodplain wetland carbon emissions where a positive feedback loop for climate change may further exacerbate these environmental shifts 4 5 limitations and further research dry conditions in 2019 and 2020 presented a limitation to this study where insufficient inflows prevented follow up monitoring during a winter spring watering event at little rushy swamp as such our inferences about the seasonal influence on wetland emissions while well documented elsewhere are speculative further research should aim to repeat sampling at little rushy swamp in a winter spring watering event to more definitively attribute the high emissions documented here to flooding seasonality we expect that monitoring over a longer period would show continued soil and vegetation recovery in the absence of feral herbivores and recommend continued monitoring of carbon responses to more conclusively inform wetland management a further limitation of our study method may have been the relatively shallow depth of soil cores taken 10 cm we based this depth on known soil accretion rates in the area but the impacts of trampling and pugging may mean that soil horizons at the site have been mixed and compacted beyond this depth to verify the results reported here we recommend further investigation includes sampling to at least 30 cm below the soil surface ipcc 2014 5 conclusions this research demonstrates that floodplain wetlands have the potential to emit very large quantities of carbon particularly in the form of ch4 to the atmosphere during summer watering events hydrological regimes are of key importance for wetland biogeochemical cycles and optimising managed flows for emission reduction and or carbon uptake in wetlands i e nature based climate solutions remains an area of research that warrants further attention the effectiveness of grazing removal for enhancing the carbon sink potential of wetlands was not evident in this study however our results suggest that long term feral herbivore exclusion may result in increased floodplain carbon storage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
913,wetlands are amongst the world s most effective natural carbon sinks and also have the potential to emit large quantities of stored carbon back into the atmosphere if disturbed in the murray darling basin high consumptive demand for water has led to widespread wetland loss and degradation remaining wetlands are commonly under additional pressure from grazing and trampling by feral herbivores or livestock and unseasonal flooding in summer to meet peak irrigation demand here during a summer flood in barmah national park we compared soil carbon and nitrogen and carbon emissions within and outside of a feral herbivore exclusion plot the sustained global warming potential from the whole wetland i e both within and outside of the exclusion plot totalled from both carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 emissions averaged 132 27 9 88 g co2 e m 2 d 1 an estimated 28 to 89 fold higher than the global average for natural wetlands the high warming potential of the wetland was driven strongly by ch4 emissions which made up over 90 of total co2 equivalents with co2 contributing 10 we expect these values represent peak ch4 emissions from the site due to high water and soil temperatures and low water levels at the time of sampling soil carbon and nitrogen did not differ significantly within and outside of the exclusion plot but surface soil samples indicated recent condition improvement in the absence of feral herbivores we suggest that an emissions avoidance incentive could be developed around unseasonal summer watering of forested floodplains where flood

of carbon sequestration are higher in wetlands than any other ecosystem due to high plant productivity and low decomposition rates under anaerobic conditions that occur during inundation kayranli et

however the influence of feral herbivores on carbon cycling in australian wetlands is currently unknown highlighting a gap in our understanding of the link between key ecological threats and climate change mitigation this study aimed to compare wetland carbon responses to these two important management issues the impact of feral herbivores and unseasonal flooding through barmah forest national park we used little rushy swamp lrs a marsh floodplain within barmah forest and the site of a feral herbivore exclusion plot as a case study we sampled soil carbon and soil nitrogen and monitored carbon emissions from within and outside of the exclusion plot in january 2019 following an unseasonal summer flood we hypothesised that 1 carbon emissions would be higher than similar wetlands flooded in winter spring due to higher water temperatures at the time of sampling 2 carbon emissions would be lower in the fenced half of the wetland due to improved soil condition in the absence of feral herbivores and 3 soil carbon and nitrogen content would be higher and soil bulk density would be lower in the fenced half of the wetland due to increased vegetative cover and reduced compaction

exclusion plot unfenced where feral herbivores were present fig 1 2 2 carbon emissions carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 diffusive emissions were recorded in replicates of 10 per wetland zone fenced and unfenced per diel period day and night over two days n 80 ghg recordings were made for a minimum of 300 seconds at each station using opaque pvc chambers attached to an ultraportable greenhouse gas analyzer ugga los gatos research san jose california usa sampling was carried out between 14 00 and 20 00 day and 21 00 and 02 00 night ghg emissions represented as mmol m 2 d 1 were calculated using a standard diffusive flux equation based on the best fit linear regression of emissions over time lambert and fréchette 2005 carbon dioxide equivalents co2e for ch4 were calculated using the 20 year sustained global warming potential sgwp figures described in neubauer and megonigal 2015 2 3 soil sampling processing eight soil cores were taken per zone fenced and unfenced n 16 soil cores were sampled manually using 50 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe to a maximum depth of 10 cm from the soil surface this depth was based on carnell et al 2018 showing accretion rates in wetlands of south east australia range from 0 14 0 9 mm per year and our aim to capture differences since exclusion fencing was installed two years prior to sampling 2017 a correction factor was used to adjust depth and volume calculations affected by soil compaction during sample collection wherein the difference between the soil depth within and outside of the pvc soil core was added to the depth of the sample collected this correction factor assumes any compaction is equivalent at all depths of the core although greater compaction likely occurs closer the soil surface samples were sectioned into segments as follows 0 1 cm 1 2 cm 2 3 cm 3 4 cm 4 6 cm and 6 8 cm then oven dried until a stable mass was reached and weighed to calculate dry bulk density dbd g cm 3 the samples were homogenized and

zone on c n table 2 4 discussion 4 1 unseasonal flooding and carbon emissions this study reports extremely high carbon emissions from little rushy swamp recorded during an unseasonal summer flood in 2019 the sustained global warming potential sgwp represented as co2 equivalents co2e of the site was between 28 89 fold higher than other natural wetlands and even 11 40 fold higher than average for constructed wetlands maltais landry et al 2009 ollivier et al 2019a fig 5 this key finding presents a new argument in the case for managed flows following natural hydrological regimes where flood timing is critical not only for floodplain ecohydrology but also for avoiding significant methane emission to the atmosphere methane emissions made up over 90 of the sustained global warming potential sgwp of the wetland at the time of sampling table 1 which is supported by previous research showing that across a range of different wetland types ch4 contributes a greater proportion of total global warming potential than both co2 and n2o page and dalal 2011 tian et al 2011 wang et al 2021 temperature alone is a strong driver of ch4 production e g brix et al 2001 chen et al 2021 mitsch et al 2012 with optimum growth of methanogenic microbes at 30 40 c whalen 2005 which corresponds to water temperatures at little rushy swamp at the time of this research estimated at 30 c this is consistent with a number of studies showing that wetland ch4 emissions peak in summer e g jeffrey et al 2019 kandel et al 2019 ollivier et al 2019b however even compared with a wetland in the same region in spring summer emissions from little rushy swamp were around 7 fold higher boon et al 1997 boon and sorrell 1995 krüger et al 2014 fig 5 this is likely owing to complex interactions between soil and water temperatures soil water content and surface water levels which together control wetland carbon emissions song et al 2003 at the time of sampling little rushy swamp was in the draw down phase of the wet dry cycle with an average water depth of only 7 9 cm a lower water table facilitates heating of the water column which increases gas release rates shelley et al 2015 yvon durocher et al 2014 in addition to transferring both heat and moisture into soils creating conditions that enhance microbial activity promoting rates of methanogenesis and heterotrophic respiration e g moyano et al 2013 gondwe et al 2021 further it reduces the amount of time available for methanotrophic processes to occur in the water column resulting in higher net ch4 emissions bastviken et al 2003 song et al 2003 demonstrate that surface water level is the key controlling factor over wetland ch4 emission above temperature and that while both soil and water temperatures influence carbon emissions from wetlands soil temperature is the stronger driver of the two co2 emissions are also highly correlated with soil temperature increasing linearly with incremental rises in temperature e g kayranli et al 2010 mckenzie et al 1998 moore and dalva 1993 by sampling over a short mid summer period at end of the wet phase our results likely represent peak ch4 emissions for the site owing to the suitability of a high temperature low oxygen environment for promoting methanogenesis wilson et al 2011 boon et al 1997 we would expect that a watering during the cooler months would reduce wet phase emissions of both ch4 and co2 and b during the dry phase total emissions would be higher than during a winter spring flood but lower than a summer flood with co2 contributing more to overall carbon emissions due to the availability of oxygen for methane oxidation treby 2021 ephemeral wetlands such as floodplains typically produce greater volumes of ch4 than permanent wetlands due to higher biogeochemical activity altor and mitsch 2008 evans and wallenstein 2012 this may be driven by higher respiration rates in methanogenic microbes in these systems which are well adapted to dynamic changes in redox conditions boon et al 1997 kannenberg et al 2015 and or increased availability of labile carbon driven by high primary productivity i e autochthonous carbon sources such as course woody debris litter and aquatic macrophytes robertson et al 1999 in floodplain wetlands high loads of allochthonous carbon sourced from upstream erosion and riverine transport may also provide a labile substrate for methanogenesis in sediments robertson et al 1999 where surface and groundwater interact during wetland recharge the biogeochemical mixing zone between them can become an important conduit for diffusive ch4 emissions from groundwater to the atmosphere wu et al 2020 in addition to providing a source of carbon to riverine food webs feris et al 2003 thus here contributions of groundwater ch4 and co2 may have contributed to the net emissions recorded in ephemeral wetlands during periods when the water table is below the soil surface i e there is no surface water present wetland sediments have the potential to become net ch4 sinks as rates of organic matter decomposition in the system increase song et al 2003 we suggest that quantification of dry phase carbon emissions uptake at the site e g treby 2021 in addition to winter spring wet phase sampling would provide context to the fundings of the present study and would enable estimates of annual carbon emissions from the site to be generated 4 2 carbon emissions and feral herbivore exclusion higher co2 emissions corresponding to feral herbivore exclusion at little rushy swamp are most likely the result of increased plant respiration where pseudoraphis spinescens biomass has increased following the reduction of grazing and trampling net ecosystem exchange nee reflects the carbon balance of the system where nee is the balance of co2 uptake through photosynthesis gross primary productivity gpp and co2 emitted via ecosystem respiration e g waring and running 2007 yakir 2003 the dark chamber method used in this study captures only co2 respiration as blocking light penetration during measurement prevents plant photosynthetic activity lankreijer et al 2009 larsen et al 2022 therefore while measured co2 respiration was higher within the exclusion plot photosynthetic activity from increased plant biomass was also almost certainly higher e g reichstein and carvalhais 2019 which would reduce net co2 emissions from this part of the wetland furthermore the additional carbon accrued in plant biomass in the continued absence of feral herbivores will likely contribute to future increases in soil carbon and potentially to long term sequestration craft and richardson 1993 hossler and bouchard 2010 bernal and mitsch 2013 in future research the use of transparent flux chambers and or eddy covariance methods may help elucidate relationships between plant biomass hydrological cycles and co2 emission and uptake as a consequence of grazing disturbance and recovery ch4 emissions did not differ significantly between zones showing no influence of grazing and trampling on methanogenic or methanotrophic microbial activity in the wetland this is in contrast with what we hypothesized trampling can reduce ch4 oxidation through disturbance to the oxic anoxic interface between soils and plant roots and change soil compaction levels and nutrient movement frenzel and rudolph 1998 sitaula et al 2000 yamulki and jarvis 2002 no detectible change in ch4 emissions following grazing removal corresponds to our finding that soil compaction measured as dry bulk density did not differ significantly between wetland zones discussed further below however we did observe more variability in ch4 fluxes in the unfenced wetland zone which could be attributable to trampling effects on soils that increase heterogeneity and microspatial variation across the wetland oates et al 2008 overall the similar rates of ch4 emission between the two areas of the wetland suggest that here hydrological factors including flood timing duration and water level and consequent soil and water temperatures are stronger drivers of wetland carbon emissions than grazing disturbance 4 3 soil condition and feral herbivore exclusion feral herbivore exclusion did not result in any significant changes in soil bulk density nitrogen concentration or carbon concentration however there was a reversal trend in the top 1 cm fig 4 indicating a shift in soil condition in recent history in the surface horizon soil nitrogen and carbon concentrations were slightly higher in the fenced zone than in the unfenced zone while bulk density was slightly lower based on shallow freshwater marsh sediment accretion rates in southeastern australia this surface layer may reflect the past 7 25 years carnell et al 2018 we therefore expect that the top 1 cm captures differences attributable at least in part to the exclusion of feral herbivores at little rushy swamp it is likely that subsequent increases in above and belowground biomass predominantly that of p spinescens are driving this shift in soil condition e g fontaine et al 2004 maucieri et al 2014 across the site soil characteristics appeared similar to averages for other wetlands across victoria carnell et al 2018 soil carbon concentrations were slightly lower than the state wide wetland average 7 7 but higher than the global wetland average of 2 13 dong et al 2022 soil carbon density and bulk density were almost identical to the state wide averages of 31 mg cm 3and 1 g cm 3 respectively carnell et al 2018 below the surface soil carbon concentrations were consistently lower and bulk density was consistently higher in the fenced zone we speculate that this relates to the former mustering station having more concentrated cattle activity in the now fenced zone of little rushy swamp and consequent land use legacy impacts e g holl and aide 2011 peralta et al 2018 treby et al 2020 victorian heritage register 2009 although we were unable to find historical records to substantiate this 4 4 management implications our findings have important implications for land managers and or policy advisors seeking to achieve carbon emission reductions through natural resource management we suggest that floodplain carbon emissions could be substantially reduced by changing the timing of water delivery to actively prevent summer floods through forested floodplains both within the murray darling basin and more widely chong and ladson 2003 discuss approaches for better managing unseasonal flows to reduce summer flooding through barmah millewa forest maintaining a natural flow regime in riverine systems is critical for floodplain ecology and biogeochemical cycling and interactions between these two critical aspects of a healthy wetland ecosystem robertson et al 199 hydrology controls the growth productivity and survival of floodplain vegetation which determines the quantity of carbon available for downstream transport underpins riverine food webs and provides habitat for wetland fauna including many threatened species beesley et al 2011 chong and ladson 2003 robertson et al 1999 an additional benefit of avoiding summer flood events is the reduced risk of hypoxic blackwater events e g mccarthy et al 2014 small et al 2014 watts et al 2017 blackwater is created through the contribution of dissolved organic carbon doc leaches from leaf litter and detritus on floodplains e g howitt et al 2007 kerr et al 2013 high carbon loads in blackwater are consumed by aquatic microorganisms which depletes dissolved oxygen levels creating hypoxic or anoxic conditions that can lead to mass fish and crustacean deaths in the river network e g mccarthy et al 2014 small et al 2014 watts et al 2017 the risk of hypoxic blackwater events is heightened in summer as higher temperatures lead to decreased o2 solubility in water increases microbial metabolic rates enhances enzyme reaction rates and alters doc solubility whitworth et al 2012 forested floodplains typically have large amounts of labile carbon on the forest floor owing to large volumes of leaf litter and other debris robertson et al 1999 when flooded this carbon is readily leached from litter into the water column e g watts et al 2017 whitworth et al 2012 and here was likely a significant contributor to the carbon used in methanogenesis leading to high net ch4 emission from little rushy swamp summer flooding has triggered a number of hypoxic blackwater events of varying sizes and impacts in the murray darling basin robertson et al 2001 howitt et al 2007 whitworth et al 2012 and blackwater risk mitigation is a current management priority joehnk et al 2020 thus we would expect that by delivering flows in winter spring rather than spring summer several beneficial ecohydrological and biogeochemical outcomes could be achieved through this single management strategy australia s emissions reduction fund provides incentives for shifting the timing of savanna burns from late season to early season to reduce fire intensity resulting in emissions avoidance department of the environment and energy 2018 department of the environment and energy 2016 we recommend continued research into seasonal flooding and greenhouse gas emissions for a similar emissions avoidance scheme to be developed for regulated riverine wetland ecosystems however as climate change continues to be realised natural flooding cycles are following decreasing cool season rainfall independent of managed watering murray darling basin authority 2019 therefore some consideration needs to be made for the impact this will have on floodplain wetland carbon emissions where a positive feedback loop for climate change may further exacerbate these environmental shifts 4 5 limitations and further research dry conditions in 2019 and 2020 presented a limitation to this study where insufficient inflows prevented follow up monitoring during a winter spring watering event at little rushy swamp as such our inferences about the seasonal influence on wetland emissions while well documented elsewhere are speculative further research should aim to repeat sampling at little rushy swamp in a winter spring watering event to more definitively attribute the high emissions documented here to flooding seasonality we expect that monitoring over a longer period would show continued soil and vegetation recovery in the absence of feral herbivores and recommend continued monitoring of carbon responses to more conclusively inform wetland management a further limitation of our study method may have been the relatively shallow depth of soil cores taken 10 cm we based this depth on known soil accretion rates in the area but the impacts of trampling and pugging may mean that soil horizons at the site have been mixed and compacted beyond this depth to verify the results reported here we recommend further investigation includes sampling to at least 30 cm below the soil surface ipcc 2014 5 conclusions this research demonstrates that floodplain wetlands have the potential to emit very large quantities of carbon particularly in the form of ch4 to the atmosphere during summer watering events hydrological regimes are of key importance for wetland biogeochemical cycles and optimising managed flows for emission reduction and or carbon uptake in wetlands i e nature based climate solutions remains an area of research that warrants further attention the effectiveness of grazing removal for enhancing the carbon sink potential of wetlands was not evident in this study however our results suggest that long term feral herbivore exclusion may result in increased floodplain carbon storage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
914,ecohydrological eh models have been widely applied worldwide to investigate hydrological and environmental issues one obstacle for eh model application in china is the input data preparation especially the soil data this study aims to develop two sets of methods respectively for soil data preprocessing with two different soil database sources harmonized world soil database hwsd and domestic chinese soil databases csd for a typical eh model of swat in china with the two sets of developed methods we have resulted two sets of swat soil datasets for the study region of a real chinese landscape respectively both sets of methods with different database sources can be generalized for other landscapes in china we further compare the two sets of methods to give suggestions for the selection of the two database sources when applying swat in chinese landscapes with hwsd soil data preprocessing requires relatively less work while there are relatively more soil types being resulted with csd although soil data preprocessing require relatively more work and there are relatively less soil types the attribute information for each soil type is more detailed keywords ecohydrological model soil data preprocessing hwsd comparison watershed china swat 1 introduction ecohydrological eh models combine the mechanisms of both hydrological and ecological processes to consider interactions between water cycles and ecosystem issues zalewski 2021 the models are not only essential tools for hydrological and ecological patterns exploration but also significant tools for assessing the impacts of land activity changes on hydrological and ecological processes as well as providing solutions for decision makings on issues of water resources management and ecological conservation plunge et al 2022 nguyen et al 2019 chen et al 2015 due to this eh models have been widely and frequently adopted for a broad range of research and practical issues in various regions guswa et al 2020 ju et al 2022 nakayama and maksyutov 2018 the typical representative of eh models can refer to the soil and water assessment tool swat which is a physically based long term continuous and semi distributed model that operates on a daily time step in the river basin scale arnold et al 2012 one major benefit of swat among eh models is its applicability to the high demanded issue of decision making regarding land management that can have substantial impacts on water quality and quantity as well as relevant ecosystems within a watershed gassman et al 2014 combined with the robustness of the model swat is highly promising for the currently and upcoming global issues of water resources management and environmental conservation however the application of swat requires different types of input data which are spatially variable and difficult to obtain including the five critical aspects of weather topography soil land use and land management qi et al 2020 meanwhile the model of swat itself is initially designed based on the landscape situation in the united states with formats of input data being the united states standards for many other countries preprocessing of critical data to fit the swat formats can be laborious and time consuming cordeiro et al 2018 due to this some countries have developed the modified versions of swat for the facility of application under their specific national situations such as models of swat g and swat k for germany and korea respectively in addition some researchers dedicate to develop the specific database for a particular region regarding one of the five necessary aspects of swat input data for example meng et al meng et al 2017 have established a specific weather dataset for swat application in east asia with the whole chinese landscapes being covered cordeiro et al cordeiro et al 2018 have derived a soil dataset specifically for swat application in canada regarding the swat application in china soil data preprocessing is the biggest obstacle xu et al 2018 for soil data obtaining there are basically two kinds of data sources for chinese landscapes that are international harmonized world soil database hwsd fao iiasa isric isscas jrc and various domestic chinese soil databases csd hwsd and csd have different data formats and standards regarding the soil parameters like soil particle diameters number of soil layers depths of soil layers etc either of them also has different data formats and standards with swat currently there are no derived soil dataset especially for swat application in chinese landscapes like that in canada by cordeiro et al cordeiro et al 2018 therefore methods of soil data preprocessing from hwsd and or csd to swat soil dataset are highly demanded for chinese landscapes however there are barely systematic research for it to the knowledge of authors so far there are only rare materials which contribute to this aspect including huibin wei et al wei et al 2007 zhen et al zhen et al 2011 jiang et al jiang et al 2014 and xu et al xu et al 2018 these studies have shed lights on the aspect while the limitations of them are also obvious that are i the methods demonstrated are not systematic with some detailed but also critical procedures being quite vague to follow ii the studies consider only either hwsd or csd instead of both of them and the comparison of them iii they are usually described in localized language the aim of this study is to fill these described gaps we aim to develop two sets of systematic methods for soil data preprocessing from hwsd and csd respectively to swat soil dataset so that the swat application in chinese landscapes can be facilitated either of the two sets of methods will be developed to be generic to all kinds of landscapes in china however in this study both sets of methods will be demonstrated respectively with a same real chinese landscape of xin anjiang upstream watershed in china based on the developed methods we aim to further compare the two sets of them in order to give the possible differences between them regarding both data preprocessing process and results so that people can have reference to choose between hwsd and csd for swat application in china based on their specific situations we think it is significant to have this study to fill the knowledge gaps in order to facilitate the application of swat with chinese landscapes among the five critical datasets for swat application in china the most difficult one refers to the soil this hinders the application of swat for chinese landscapes especially for those who have less information regarding soil data preprocessing however along with the increasing emphasis of water resources management and watershed environmental conservation in china asian development bank 2016 benett and carroll 2014 the high demand of eh models with swat as a typical representative in china is rationally expected moreover we believe the developed methods in this study can also help for other eh models similar to swat with the chinese soil dataset preprocessing based on their similarity regarding the standards of soil dataset requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 study watershed the xin anjiang watershed crosses the boundary of two provinces of anhui and zhejiang in china with the xin anjiang upstream watershed 117 38 118 54 29 27 30 14 located in anhui province being selected as the study region here figure 1 the xin anjiang upstream watershed is about 5 872 km2 it has a subtropical monsoonal climate with the average annual temperature being 15 4 c 16 4 c and the average annual precipitation being 1280 mm 1700 mm zhai et al 2014 guo et al 2020 yiming et al 2019 the dominant land covers are forest and agriculture zhai et al 2014 it is meaningful to select the xin anjiang upstream watershed in anhui province as the study region the first pilot project of trans provincial eco compensation mechanism for water environmental compensation in china is practiced in the xin anjiang watershed ren et al 2020 yu and chen 2020 ren et al 2021 besides the watershed acts as the key drinking water source for the riverside residents in both anhui and zhejiang provinces zhai et al 2014 guo et al 2020 due to these the area is important and popular for different kinds of watershed modeling study especially for the upstream watershed in anhui province 2 2 soil database sources there are two types of soil data sources for chinese landscapes table 1 one source refers to the hwsd fao iiasa isric isscas jrc which is a global soil database with both spatial distribution and attribute information being matched together as a global scale soil database hwsd is based on the collaboration of fao iiasa isric world soil information institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences and the joint research centre of the european commission nachtergaele et al 2010 hwsd has a horizontal grid spacing of a 30 arc second 1 1 it refers to the resolution of approximately 1 km with the soil data being updated along with time another data source refers to the domestic csd with spatial data and attribute data from two different chinese agencies the spatial data here is from the resource and environmental science and data center chinese academy of sciences with a resolution of 1 km resources and environmental science data center in this spatial map the soil is classified based on the chinese standard of soil generic classification shi et al 2004 where we can only get the soil subgroups as the finest division based on the soil subgroups in this spatial map the corresponding soil attribute information is sourced from soil science database nanjing institute of soil science soil science database for chinese landscapes both hwsd and csd are based on the second national soil census in china at the end of the last century however both spatial maps and attribute information from the two kinds of data sources are different due to their different processing standards such as different soil classification systems and different soil particle size grading standards zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2007 2 3 methods and procedures for giving the soil dataset in swat with a landscape we need to have the spatial map of soil types distribution in the area followed with the attribute information obtaining for each of the soil types appeared in the soil distribution map comparing with the obtaining of soil spatial map distribution the attribution information acquisition for each soil type in the soil map is much more difficulty the attribute information of soil refers to a set of specific values of soil parameters corresponding to a soil type the set of soil parameters required in swat are different with those available either in hwsd or in csd therefore the soil data preprocessing is needed to transfer soil information from database sources to the swat dataset as illustrated in figure 2 for doing this we need first to analyze the soil parameters in swat to figure out the required ones for the model setup figure 2 box 1 second we need to figure out how to obtain the value of each required parameter in swat based on the available parameter values from hwsd and csd figure 2 box 2 and box 3 2 3 1 soil parameter analysis in swat soil attribute data needed in swat can be classified as two groups of chemical attribute data and physical attribute data chemical attribute data is used for setting the initial levels of the different chemicals in the soil while physical attribute data is adopted for governing the water and air movement and cycling in the soil profile and in the hydrological units for swat setup chemical attribute information is optional while physical attribute information is required arnold et al 2012 in this study we consider only the physical attribute data which refers to the parameters in the soil input file sol in swat 2 2 one can also refer to the usersoil table located within the database of swat2012 mdb of swat these parameters and their explanations are briefly described in table 2 in table 2 the parameters can be further classified as different groups parameters with codes from 1 to 6 are to give the soil identifier and classification for more details about these parameters one can refer to cordeiro et al 2018 parameters with codes from 7 to 12 are to give the general profile of the soil while parameters with codes from 13 to 26 are to give the detailed information for each layer of the soil respectively for more explanations about these parameter one can refer to arnold et al 2012 in the following for soil attribute data establishment in swat we focused on the required parameters with codes from 7 to 24 in table 2 as parameters with codes from 1 to 6 do not really affect the soil simulation process and parameters with codes of 25 and 26 are not active currently in swat 2 3 2 parameter value evaluation with hwsd the spatial map for soil distribution in the study region can be firstly obtained from hwsd as shown in figure 3 in figure 3 the different colors represent the different soil types in the map with the corresponding soil type code being marked it needs to be noticed that the soil types appeared in this very original spatial map might be further adjusted after the attribute data preprocessing followed based on the above the soil parameters in swat which require to be valued are listed in table 3 among them some parameters can get their values directly from hwsd while some parameters need to get their values with further evaluations based on the obtained parameter values with various methods table 3 therefore with hwsd there are different ways for obtaining the different parameter values first ten of parameters in table 3 can get their values directly according to the values of the corresponding parameters in hwsd which are shown in the third column in table 3 second with the parameter values obtained directly from hwsd values of four parameters codes of 12 14 15 and 16 in table 3 can be evaluated through the spaw soil plant air water model jiang et al 2014 saxton spaw needs inputs for getting the results of soil characteristics located in the upper right corner on the interface of spaw in figure 4 the inputs for sand clay gravel and salinity on the spaw interface are corresponding to the values of parameters with codes of 20 18 21 and 24 in table 3 respectively the input for organic matter refers to the value of parameter with code of 17 divided by 0 58 the input for compaction can be defaulted as 0 9 and the input for moisture calculator can follow with the system after these inputs and spaw running parameters with codes of 14 and 16 can find their values referring to the results of matric bulk density and sat hydraulic cond respectively from spaw the value of parameter with code of 15 refers to the resulted value of filed capacity minus that of wilting point in spaw regarding parameter with code of 12 one can set it according to the result of texture class in spaw for each soil layer or one can set it freely as it is optional in swat and does not impact much for swat simulation third for parameters with codes of 10 11 and 22 it is very hard to evaluate the values of them in china for more information especially the parameter with code of 22 one can refer to xu et al 2018 wei et al 2007 jiang et al 2014 parameters with codes of 10 and 11 are also optional in swat we here set them as default values of 0 5 respectively and we set parameter with code of 11 with default value of 0 01 fourth regarding the parameter with code 8 it needs to be identified as one of the four soil hydrological groups a b c or d one can refer to arnold et al 2012 for details it is mainly decided by the permeability of water in the soil while there are different methods existed for identifying it some studies e g xu et al 2018 wei et al 2007 jiang et al 2014 identify it directly by comparing the value of parameter 16 in table 3 with the hydrologic group rating criteria in the swat file of arnold et al 2012 some studies e g zhang and ren 2014 chen 2006 either adopt empirical formulas to calculate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil or adopt adjusted hydrologic group rating criteria considering local situations of the study region in this study we applied another straightforward method we first calculated the average soil particle size of all layers of soil y adopting eq 1 and further calculated the constant infiltration rate of soil x adopting eq 2 with the obtained x we can give the parameter 8 a soil hydrological group through comparing x with the final constant infiltration rate listed in hydrologic group rating criteria in arnold et al 2012 1 y m a s 10 0 03 0 002 2 x 20 y 1 8 where m a s refers to the average of sand contents in different layers of soil when the sand content is zero y should be valued as 0 01 mm when the sand content is 100 y should be 0 3 mm while when the clay content is 100 y should be 0 002 mm fifth for the parameter with code of 23 the erodibility factor of soil it is an important variable in swat here it is calculated with the typical williams equation eq 3 for detailed explanation on the parameter and the equation one can refer to arnold et al 2012 williams and singh 1995 3 k u s l e 0 2 0 3 e x p 0 256 m s 1 m s i l t 100 m s i l t m c m s i l t 0 3 1 0 25 ρ o r g c ρ o r g c e x p 3 72 2 95 ρ o r g c 1 0 7 1 m s 100 1 m s 100 e x p 5 51 22 9 1 m s 100 where m s refers to the percent sand content m s i l t is the percent silt content m c is the percent clay content and ρ o r g c indicates the percent organic carbon content in the corresponding soil layer 2 3 3 parameter value evaluation with csd the spatial map for soil distribution in the study region obtained from csd is shown in figure 5 like the soil spatial map based on hwsd in figure 3 the different colors in figure 5 represent the different soil types with the corresponding soil type code being marked it is noticeable that in the two original spatial maps of figure 3 based on hwsd and figure 5 based on csd with the same study region the number of soil types based on data source of hwsd is more 22 types in total than that based on the csd resources and environmental science data center 12 types in total however both of these two original spatial maps might be further adjusted after the further attribute data evaluation according to the spatial map above based on csd with the soil type code in the figure one can obtain its corresponding soil great group and subgroup in the attached file of the spatial map resources and environmental science data center however under one soil subgroup there are many different soil species for more information on the soil classification system in china one can refer to shi et al 2004 while the soil attribute information is offered for a specific soil species in the attribute database of soil science database due to this we need to first identify the specific soil species for each soil type code in the spatial map of figure 5 to do this for identifying the specific soil species under a soil subgroup or great group we made some principles in this study as follows i for all soil species under one soil subgroup or even the soil great group when the subgroup is unclear we select the one s that are located in the province of the study region ii if there are more than one soil species being selected in the previous step we further select among them the one that occupies the largest area proportion under the soil subgroup or great group iii if there is no soil species locating in the study province under the soil subgroup we then select directly the most typical with the largest area proportion soil species under the soil subgroup once the soil species is identified we can search the attribute information of identified soil species in the database of soil science database with which the swat soil parameters can be further valued with different methods similar with the situation with hwsd the parameter value assignment methods are classified as five groups as illustrated in table 4 first for the parameters in group 1 in table 4 they can be read either directly from the based database of soil science database or be obtained with simply calculation as explained in table 4 second regarding the parameters in group 2 in table 4 they refer to the content of the different soil particle sizes in the different soil layers in the csd of soil science database the information for them are also recorded however the soil particle size grading standard is different with that for swat in csd of soil science database it is based on the international standard international soil science society isss while in swat it is based on the us standard united states department of agriculture usda as shown in table 5 there are different methods for the conversion of soil particle size distribution from isss system to usda system wei et al 2007 shangguan et al 2014 takahashi et al 2020 in this study we adopted the method of cubic spline interpolation with the tool of matlab to do the conversion and obtained the values for parameters in group 2 with the detailed matlab codes being displayed in appendix 1 third after we obtained the parameter values in group 2 in table 4 then the parameters in group 3 can be simulated through the model of spaw referring to the explanation above with data source of hwsd parameters in group 4 are the ones that are hard to get values in china here they were set with default values respectively as shown in table 4 for parameters in group 5 they were evaluated with corresponding empirical formulas as the same for the situation with hwsd 3 results and analysis 3 1 result based on hwsd according to the methods described above for the data preprocessing from hwsd to swat soil dataset the needed parameter values are obtained for each soil type appeared in figure 3 the resulted soil attribute information a set of parameter values for each soil type in the soil map in the study region of xin anjiang watershed is shown in the table a1 in appendix 2 we give the results in the table a1 in appendix 2 as the same format and order as in swat model in this way one can input soil attribute dataset into swat with convenient operations referring to cordeiro et al cordeiro et al 2018 regarding the soil data preprocessing from hwsd to swat we can see from table 3 that almost half of the required parameters in swat can get their values from hwsd directly with another half of them demanding further evaluations among them a group of parameters can get their values through spaw model simulations while some parameters need very complex calculations to have values including parameters with codes of 8 and 23 in table 3 it needs to be noticed that for some of the soil parameters that are not required in swat like the ones that are beyond the existed soil layers which are not shown in appendix 2 they should be valued as zero in swat soil database based on the evaluated soil attribute information the soil spatial distribution map is also adjusted due to that some appeared soil type codes in the original soil map figure 3 are resulted as having the same values for each of the parameters therefore these soil type codes were merged as one soil type this situation happens only with the data source of hwsd which is demonstrated in table a1 in appendix 2 after merging the resulted soil spatial distribution maps is shown in figure 6 with the different colors representing the resulted different soil types along with different soil names being correspondingly described in figure 6 there are soil types which share the same soil name but have different resulted soil attribute data as demonstrated in table a1 in appendix 2 these soil types are further distinguished with number codes following the soil name the soil names in figure 6 are based on the us system hwsd besides in the soil spatial map there is one color that represents the water bodies in reality and would not have soil attribute information in swat therefore in total there are 15 different kinds of soil types resulted in the xin anjiang upstream watershed based on the soil database of hwsd with most of them having two soil layers as demonstrated in table a1 in appendix 2 3 2 result based on csd like the case with hwsd with the methods above for the data preprocessing from csd to swat we get the parameter values for each soil type appeared in figure 5 the resulted soil attribute information in the study region of xin anjiang watershed is demonstrated in the table a2 in appendix 2 in a format similar to that required in swat also like the situation with hwsd when doing the data preprocessing from csd to swat some parameter values can be read directly from database some parameters need spaw simulation while some one need particularly difficulty calculations however with the database of csd the additional difficulty work is to do the conversion of the soil particle size distribution from isss system system in csd to usda system system in swat before one can apply swaw simulation for the aimed parameter values this conservation is not straightforward with the tool of matlab being adopted in this study the adjusted spatial map of soil distribution is shown in figure 7 with different colors indicating different soil types as marked with different names it is noticeable that the soil names between figure 6 and figure 7 are quite different although they refer to the same landscape of xin anjiang upstream watershed this is because that with csd database we follow the chinese standard of soil name chinese name while in figure 6 with hwsd database it is english name for soils like in figure 6 with hwsd in figure 7 based on csd there is also one color that represents the water bodies in reality when comparing the original soil map in figure 5 and the final soil map in figure 7 with the database of csd we can see that the soil types are the same not like that with hwsd this is because with the csd soil map we need to match the soil types with the different soil categories in the very beginning which avoids the same soil type appear with different soil names like in hwsd in total with csd we have 11 different kinds of soil types resulted in the xin anjiang upstream watershed with most of them having more than two soil layers as demonstrated in table a2 in appendix 2 3 3 comparison between hwsd and csd we adopted two kinds of soil databases of hwsd and csd for soil preprocessing for swat soil dataset with each of the soil database sources we have given the detailed methods and procedures for adopting each of them to obtain the required swat soil dataset except that with the two of them we want to compare the possible differences among them for preprocessing swat soil dataset so that the clues can be provided for late people to do the choice between the two kinds of soil data sources as we focus on the methods for soil data preprocessing in this study we would give the comparison also more on the methods aspect and less on the results aspect regarding the methods and procedures for data establishment it is obvious that with the csd of resources and environmental science data center and soil science database it needs more work than that with hwsd it mainly reflects on two aspects one aspect refers to the joint between soil spatial map and soil attribute database with hwsd the soil type code shown in its spatial map can be searched in its attribute tables directly which acts as index to join the two kinds of soil information however with csd the soil type code in the spatial map from resources and environmental science data center refers to the soil subgroup or even the soil great group while the soil attribute information from the database of soil science database refers to a specific soil species therefore to identify the appropriate soil species in the attribute database to connect the soil subgroup great group in the spatial map it demands careful consideration which is time consuming and can be subjective the other aspect refers to the additional work of the conversion of the soil particle size distribution from isss system to usda system when adopting csd for the soil particle size grading standard hwsd and swat share the same standard while csd and swat have different standards it is important to do the conversion as parameters referring to the different soil particle size contents parameters with codes of 18 19 20 and 21 in table 2 are critical soil parameters in swat furthermore these parameter values are also the basis for the further evaluation of other soil parameters parameters with codes of 8 12 14 15 16 and 23 in table 2 in swat as to the data establishment results it is observable from figure 6 and figure 7 that with the same study region and also the same data resolution the number of resulted soil types with hwsd is more than that with csd however regarding the evaluated attribute data for each soil type in the resulted map generally it is coarser with hwsd than that with csd for soil attribute data with hwsd it generally has two soil layers with the depth of each layer being fixed for all soil types while with csd it usually has three or more soil layers with the depth of each soil layer being also different along with the different soil types see details in appendix 2 4 discussion and conclusion eh models have been applied widely in the world not only for hydrological management issues but also for environmental conservations with the typical representative of eh models of swat the well application and development of swat has been widely in the international world especially in the developed countries the application of swat in china appears to be relatively weak however the need for the swat application in china for either hydrological management issues or environmental conservation issues is high one obstacle for swat application in china is its data requirement for the model setup for chinese landscapes among the different categories of the data demands for swat setup in china the one with particular difficulty refers to the soil dataset given this this article gives the methods and procedures for the soil data preprocessing for swat application in chinese landscapes with two types of original database sources respectively with the demonstration in a real chinese watershed of xin anjiang upstream watershed the two soil database sources are hwsd and csd both of which are freely available and have the same data resolution of 1 km furthermore we compare the methods and procedures as well as the results of soil data preprocessing with the two kinds of database sources so that some clues can be given regarding soil data source selection for swat application in china we need to say that we methods we give for the soil data preprocessing for swat with both of the soil database source are not unique there might be other multiple methods regarding the details of the soil data preprocessing for swat application in china especially for those with complex calculation processes however we give the two sets of methods for people which can in the lowest level help to finish the swat soil dataset setup which is significant for facilitating swat application in china meanwhile we give the comparison of the two sets of methods and results with the two database sources only based on our special situation based on our selected study region of the xin anjiang upstream watershed we believe the comparison would have generic meanings in some extent while the particularity and uncertainty regarding details cannot be avoided there are limitations and shortages in this study first for soil attribute data preprocessing we only consider the swat requirement of the soil physical attribute data while we ignore the soil chemical attribute data which is optional for swat setup second we focused on the methods and procedures for evaluating the values of soil parameters in swat while gave less explanation for the meanings of the parameters themselves although we gave relevant references for interested ones to check for details third for some soil parameters in swat the evaluation methods for parameter values are not unique like the parameter with code 8 in table 2 with this situation we adopted the method that was considered as more generalized in wide landscapes instead of the methods considering more the special characteristics of the specific study region the purpose is to demonstrate a method that is generic to apply in various study regions in china it follows the aim of this study that is to increase the facility of swat application in china for different levels of swat modelers regarding various characteristics of watersheds however alternative methods which consider the special characteristics of study regions in further specific studies are highly encouraged we expect that further studies in the future can explore with these described limitations besides both of the two types of original data sources are based on the second national soil census in china at the end of the last century the third national soil census in china has been started in the beginning of 2022

914,ecohydrological eh models have been widely applied worldwide to investigate hydrological and environmental issues one obstacle for eh model application in china is the input data preparation especially the soil data this study aims to develop two sets of methods respectively for soil data preprocessing with two different soil database sources harmonized world soil database hwsd and domestic chinese soil databases csd for a typical eh model of swat in china with the two sets of developed methods we have resulted two sets of swat soil datasets for the study region of a real chinese landscape respectively both sets of methods with different database sources can be generalized for other landscapes in china we further compare the two sets of methods to give suggestions for the selection of the two database sources when applying swat in chinese landscapes with hwsd soil data preprocessing requires relatively less work while there are relatively more soil types being resulted with csd although soil data preprocessing require relatively more work and there are relatively less soil types the attribute information for each soil type is more detailed keywords ecohydrological model soil data preprocessing hwsd comparison watershed china swat 1 introduction ecohydrological eh models combine the mechanisms of both hydrological and ecological processes to consider interactions between water cycles and ecosystem issues zalewski 2021 the models are not only essential tools for hydrological and ecological patterns exploration but also significant tools for assessing the impacts of land activity changes on hydrological and ecological processes as well as providing solutions for decision makings on issues of water resources management and ecological conservation plunge et al 2022 nguyen et al 2019 chen et al 2015 due to this eh models have been widely and frequently adopted for a broad range of research and practical issues in various regions guswa et al 2020 ju et al 2022 nakayama and maksyutov 2018 the typical representative of eh models can refer to the soil and water assessment tool swat which is a physically based long term continuous and semi distributed model that operates on a daily time step in the river basin scale arnold et al 2012 one major benefit of swat among eh models is its applicability to the high demanded issue of decision making regarding land management that can have substantial impacts on water quality and quantity as well as relevant ecosystems within a watershed gassman et al 2014 combined with the robustness of the model swat is highly promising for the currently and upcoming global issues of water resources management and environmental conservation however the application of swat requires different types of input data which are spatially variable and difficult to obtain including the five critical aspects of weather topography soil land use and land management qi et al 2020 meanwhile the model of swat itself is initially designed based on the landscape situation in the united states with formats of input data being the united states standards for many other countries preprocessing of critical data to fit the swat formats can be laborious and time consuming cordeiro et al 2018 due to this some countries have developed the modified versions of swat for the facility of application under their specific national situations such as models of swat g and swat k for germany and korea respectively in addition some researchers dedicate to develop the specific database for a particular region regarding one of the five necessary aspects of swat input data for example meng et al meng et al 2017 have established a specific weather dataset for swat application in east asia with the whole chinese landscapes being covered cordeiro et al cordeiro et al 2018 have derived a soil dataset specifically for swat application in canada regarding the swat application in china soil data preprocessing is the biggest obstacle xu et al 2018 for soil data obtaining there are basically two kinds of data sources for chinese landscapes that are international harmonized world soil database hwsd fao iiasa isric isscas jrc and various domestic chinese soil databases csd hwsd and csd have different data formats and standards regarding the soil parameters like soil particle diameters number of soil layers depths of soil layers etc either of them also has different data formats and standards with swat currently there are no derived soil dataset especially for swat application in chinese landscapes like that in canada by cordeiro et al cordeiro et al 2018 therefore methods of soil data preprocessing from hwsd and or csd to swat soil dataset are highly demanded for chinese landscapes however there are barely systematic research for it to the knowledge of authors so far there are only rare materials which contribute to this aspect including huibin wei et al wei et al 2007 zhen et al zhen et al 2011 jiang et al jiang et al 2014 and xu et al xu et al 2018 these studies have shed lights on the aspect while the limitations of them are also obvious that are i the methods demonstrated are not systematic with some detailed but also critical procedures being quite vague to follow ii the studies consider only either hwsd or csd instead of both of them and the comparison of them iii they are usually described in localized language the aim of this study is to fill these described gaps we aim to develop two sets of systematic methods for soil data preprocessing from hwsd and csd respectively to swat soil dataset so that the swat application in chinese landscapes can be facilitated either of the two sets of methods will be developed to be generic to all kinds of landscapes in china however in this study both sets of methods will be demonstrated respectively with a same real chinese landscape of xin anjiang upstream watershed in china based on the developed methods we aim to further compare the two sets of them in order to give the possible differences between them regarding both data preprocessing process and results so that people can have reference to choose between hwsd and csd for swat application in china based on their specific situations we think it is significant to have this study to fill the knowledge gaps in order to facilitate the application of swat with chinese landscapes among the five critical datasets for swat application in china the most difficult one refers to the soil this hinders the application of swat for chinese landscapes especially for those who have less information regarding soil data preprocessing however along with the increasing emphasis of water resources management and watershed environmental conservation in china asian development bank 2016 benett and carroll 2014 the high demand of eh models with swat as a typical representative in china is rationally expected moreover we believe the developed methods in this study can also help for other eh models similar to swat with the chinese soil dataset preprocessing based on their similarity regarding the standards of soil dataset requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 study watershed the xin anjiang watershed crosses the boundary of two provinces of anhui and zhejiang in china with the xin anjiang upstream watershed 117 38 118 54 29 27 30 14 located in anhui province being selected as the study region here figure 1 the xin anjiang upstream watershed is about 5 872 km2 it has a subtropical monsoonal climate with the average annual temperature being 15 4 c 16 4 c and the average annual precipitation being 1280 mm 1700 mm zhai et al 2014 guo et al 2020 yiming et al 2019 the dominant land covers are forest and agriculture zhai et al 2014 it is meaningful to select the xin anjiang upstream watershed in anhui province as the study region the first pilot project of trans provincial eco compensation mechanism for water environmental compensation in china is practiced in the xin anjiang watershed ren et al 2020 yu and chen 2020 ren et al 2021 besides the watershed acts as the key drinking water source for the riverside residents in both anhui and zhejiang provinces zhai et al 2014 guo et al 2020 due to these the area is important and popular for different kinds of watershed modeling study especially for the upstream watershed in anhui province 2 2 soil database sources there are two types of soil data sources for chinese landscapes table 1 one source refers to the hwsd fao iiasa isric isscas jrc which is a global soil database with both spatial distribution and attribute information being matched together as a global scale soil database hwsd is based on the collaboration of fao iiasa isric world soil information institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences and the joint research centre of the european commission nachtergaele et al 2010 hwsd has a horizontal grid spacing of a 30 arc second 1 1 it refers to the resolution of approximately 1 km with the soil data being updated along with time another data source refers to the domestic csd with spatial data and attribute data from two different chinese agencies the spatial data here is from the resource and environmental science and data center chinese academy of sciences with a resolution of 1 km resources and environmental science data center in this spatial map the soil is classified based on the chinese standard of soil generic classification shi et al 2004 where we can only get the soil subgroups as the finest division based on the soil subgroups in this spatial map the corresponding soil attribute information is sourced from soil science database nanjing institute of soil science soil science database for chinese landscapes both hwsd and csd are based on the second national soil census in china at the end of the last century however both spatial maps and attribute information from the two kinds of data sources are different due to their different processing standards such as different soil classification systems and different soil particle size grading standards zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2007 2 3 methods and procedures for giving the soil dataset in swat with a landscape we need to have the spatial map of soil types distribution in the area followed with the attribute information obtaining for each of the soil types appeared in the soil distribution map comparing with the obtaining of soil spatial map distribution the attribution information acquisition for each soil type in the soil map is much more difficulty the attribute information of soil refers to a set of specific values of soil parameters corresponding to a soil type the set of soil parameters required in swat are different with those available either in hwsd or in csd therefore the soil data preprocessing is needed to transfer soil information from database sources to the swat dataset as illustrated in figure 2 for doing this we need first to analyze the soil parameters in swat to figure out the required ones for the model setup figure 2 box 1 second we need to figure out how to obtain the value of each required parameter in swat based on the available parameter values from hwsd and csd figure 2 box 2 and box 3 2 3 1 soil parameter analysis in swat soil attribute data needed in swat can be classified as two groups of chemical attribute data and physical attribute data chemical attribute data is used for setting the initial levels of the different chemicals in the soil while physical attribute data is adopted for governing the water and air movement and cycling in the soil profile and in the hydrological units for swat setup chemical attribute information is optional while physical attribute information is required arnold et al 2012 in this study we consider only the physical attribute data which refers to the parameters in the soil input file sol in swat 2 2 one can also refer to the usersoil table located within the database of swat2012 mdb of swat these parameters and their explanations are briefly described in table 2 in table 2 the parameters can be further classified as different groups parameters with codes from 1 to 6 are to give the soil identifier and classification for more details about these parameters one can refer to cordeiro et al 2018 parameters with codes from 7 to 12 are to give the general profile of the soil while parameters with codes from 13 to 26 are to give the detailed information for each layer of the soil respectively for more explanations about these parameter one can refer to arnold et al 2012 in the following for soil attribute data establishment in swat we focused on the required parameters with codes from 7 to 24 in table 2 as parameters with codes from 1 to 6 do not really affect the soil simulation process and parameters with codes of 25 and 26 are not active currently in swat 2 3 2 parameter value evaluation with hwsd the spatial map for soil distribution in the study region can be firstly obtained from hwsd as shown in figure 3 in figure 3 the different colors represent the different soil types in the map with the corresponding soil type code being marked it needs to be noticed that the soil types appeared in this very original spatial map might be further adjusted after the attribute data preprocessing followed based on the above the soil parameters in swat which require to be valued are listed in table 3 among them some parameters can get their values directly from hwsd while some parameters need to get their values with further evaluations based on the obtained parameter values with various methods table 3 therefore with hwsd there are different ways for obtaining the different parameter values first ten of parameters in table 3 can get their values directly according to the values of the corresponding parameters in hwsd which are shown in the third column in table 3 second with the parameter values obtained directly from hwsd values of four parameters codes of 12 14 15 and 16 in table 3 can be evaluated through the spaw soil plant air water model jiang et al 2014 saxton spaw needs inputs for getting the results of soil characteristics located in the upper right corner on the interface of spaw in figure 4 the inputs for sand clay gravel and salinity on the spaw interface are corresponding to the values of parameters with codes of 20 18 21 and 24 in table 3 respectively the input for organic matter refers to the value of parameter with code of 17 divided by 0 58 the input for compaction can be defaulted as 0 9 and the input for moisture calculator can follow with the system after these inputs and spaw running parameters with codes of 14 and 16 can find their values referring to the results of matric bulk density and sat hydraulic cond respectively from spaw the value of parameter with code of 15 refers to the resulted value of filed capacity minus that of wilting point in spaw regarding parameter with code of 12 one can set it according to the result of texture class in spaw for each soil layer or one can set it freely as it is optional in swat and does not impact much for swat simulation third for parameters with codes of 10 11 and 22 it is very hard to evaluate the values of them in china for more information especially the parameter with code of 22 one can refer to xu et al 2018 wei et al 2007 jiang et al 2014 parameters with codes of 10 and 11 are also optional in swat we here set them as default values of 0 5 respectively and we set parameter with code of 11 with default value of 0 01 fourth regarding the parameter with code 8 it needs to be identified as one of the four soil hydrological groups a b c or d one can refer to arnold et al 2012 for details it is mainly decided by the permeability of water in the soil while there are different methods existed for identifying it some studies e g xu et al 2018 wei et al 2007 jiang et al 2014 identify it directly by comparing the value of parameter 16 in table 3 with the hydrologic group rating criteria in the swat file of arnold et al 2012 some studies e g zhang and ren 2014 chen 2006 either adopt empirical formulas to calculate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil or adopt adjusted hydrologic group rating criteria considering local situations of the study region in this study we applied another straightforward method we first calculated the average soil particle size of all layers of soil y adopting eq 1 and further calculated the constant infiltration rate of soil x adopting eq 2 with the obtained x we can give the parameter 8 a soil hydrological group through comparing x with the final constant infiltration rate listed in hydrologic group rating criteria in arnold et al 2012 1 y m a s 10 0 03 0 002 2 x 20 y 1 8 where m a s refers to the average of sand contents in different layers of soil when the sand content is zero y should be valued as 0 01 mm when the sand content is 100 y should be 0 3 mm while when the clay content is 100 y should be 0 002 mm fifth for the parameter with code of 23 the erodibility factor of soil it is an important variable in swat here it is calculated with the typical williams equation eq 3 for detailed explanation on the parameter and the equation one can refer to arnold et al 2012 williams and singh 1995 3 k u s l e 0 2 0 3 e x p 0 256 m s 1 m s i l t 100 m s i l t m c m s i l t 0 3 1 0 25 ρ o r g c ρ o r g c e x p 3 72 2 95 ρ o r g c 1 0 7 1 m s 100

carbon content in the corresponding soil layer 2 3 3 parameter value evaluation with csd the spatial map for soil distribution in the study region obtained from csd is shown in figure 5 like the soil spatial map based on hwsd in figure 3 the different colors in figure 5 represent the different soil types with the corresponding soil type code being marked it is noticeable that in the two original spatial maps of figure 3 based on hwsd and figure 5 based on csd with the same study region the number of soil types based on data source of hwsd is more 22 types in total than that based on the csd resources and environmental science data center 12 types in total however both of these two original spatial maps might be further adjusted after the further attribute data evaluation according to the spatial map above based on csd with the soil type code in the figure one can obtain its corresponding soil great group and subgroup in the attached file of the spatial map resources and environmental science data center however under one soil subgroup there are many different soil species for more information on the soil classification system in china one can refer to shi et al 2004 while the soil attribute information is offered for a specific soil species in the attribute database of soil science database due to this we need to first identify the specific soil species for each soil type code in the spatial map of figure 5 to do this for identifying the specific soil species under a soil subgroup or great group we made some principles in this study as follows i for all soil species under one soil subgroup or even the soil great group when the subgroup is unclear we select the one s that are located in the province of the study region ii if there are more than one soil species being selected in the previous step we further select among them the one that occupies the largest area proportion under the soil subgroup or great group iii if there is no soil species locating in the study province under the soil subgroup we then select directly the most typical with the largest area proportion soil species under the soil subgroup once the soil species is identified we can search the attribute information of identified soil species in the database of soil science database with which the swat soil parameters can be further valued with different methods similar with the situation with hwsd the parameter value assignment methods are classified as five groups as illustrated in table 4 first for the parameters in group 1 in table 4 they can be read either directly from the based database of soil science database or be obtained with simply calculation as explained in table 4 second regarding the parameters in group 2 in table 4 they refer to the content of the different soil particle sizes in the different soil layers in the csd of soil science database the information for them are also recorded however the soil particle size grading standard is different with that for swat in csd of soil science database it is based on the international standard international soil science society isss while in swat it is based on the us standard united states department of agriculture usda as shown in table 5 there are different methods for the conversion of soil particle size distribution from isss system to usda system wei et al 2007 shangguan et al 2014 takahashi et al 2020 in this study we adopted the method of cubic spline interpolation with the tool of matlab to do the conversion and obtained the values for parameters in group 2 with the detailed matlab codes being displayed in appendix 1 third after we obtained the parameter values in group 2 in table 4 then the parameters in group 3 can be simulated through the model of spaw referring to the explanation above with data source of hwsd parameters in group 4 are the ones that are hard to get values in china here they were set with default values respectively as shown in table 4 for parameters in group 5 they were evaluated with corresponding empirical formulas as the same for the situation with hwsd 3 results and analysis 3 1 result based on hwsd according to the methods described above for the data preprocessing from hwsd to swat soil dataset the needed parameter values are obtained for each soil type appeared in figure 3 the resulted soil attribute information a set of parameter values for each soil type in the soil map in the study region of xin anjiang watershed is shown in the table a1 in appendix 2 we give the results in the table a1 in appendix 2 as the same format and order as in swat model in this way one can input soil attribute dataset into swat with convenient operations referring to cordeiro et al cordeiro et al 2018 regarding the soil data preprocessing from hwsd to swat we can see from table 3 that almost half of the required parameters in swat can get their values from hwsd directly with another half of them demanding further evaluations among them a group of parameters can get their values through spaw model simulations while some parameters need very complex calculations to have values including parameters with codes of 8 and 23 in table 3 it needs to be noticed that for some of the soil parameters that are not required in swat like the ones that are beyond the existed soil layers which are not shown in appendix 2 they should be valued as zero in swat soil database based on the evaluated soil attribute information the soil spatial distribution map is also adjusted due to that some appeared soil type codes in the original soil map figure 3 are resulted as having the same values for each of the parameters therefore these soil type codes were merged as one soil type this situation happens only with the data source of hwsd which is demonstrated in table a1 in appendix 2 after merging the resulted soil spatial distribution maps is shown in figure 6 with the different colors representing the resulted different soil types along with different soil names being correspondingly described in figure 6 there are soil types which share the same soil name but have different resulted soil attribute data as demonstrated in table a1 in appendix 2 these soil types are further distinguished with number codes following the soil name the soil names in figure 6 are based on the us system hwsd besides in the soil spatial map there is one color that represents the water bodies in reality and would not have soil attribute information in swat therefore in total there are 15 different kinds of soil types resulted in the xin anjiang upstream watershed based on the soil database of hwsd with most of them having two soil layers as demonstrated in table a1 in appendix 2 3 2 result based on csd like the case with hwsd with the methods above for the data preprocessing from csd to swat we get the parameter values for each soil type appeared in figure 5 the resulted soil attribute information in the study region of xin anjiang watershed is demonstrated in the table a2 in appendix 2 in a format similar to that required in swat also like the situation with hwsd when doing the data preprocessing from csd to swat some parameter values can be read directly from database some parameters need spaw simulation while some one need particularly difficulty calculations however with the database of csd the additional difficulty work is to do the conversion of the soil particle size distribution from isss system system in csd to usda system system in swat before one can apply swaw simulation for the aimed parameter values this conservation is not straightforward with the tool of matlab being adopted in this study the adjusted spatial map of soil distribution is shown in figure 7 with different colors indicating different soil types as marked with different names it is noticeable that the soil names between figure 6 and figure 7 are quite different although they refer to the same landscape of xin anjiang upstream watershed this is because that with csd database we follow the chinese standard of soil name chinese name while in figure 6 with hwsd database it is english name for soils like in figure 6 with hwsd in figure 7 based on csd there is also one color that represents the water bodies in reality when comparing the original soil map in figure 5 and the final soil map in figure 7 with the database of csd we can see that the soil types are the same not like that with hwsd this is because with the csd soil map we need to match the soil types with the different soil categories in the very beginning which avoids the same soil type appear with different soil names like in hwsd in total with csd we have 11 different kinds of soil types resulted in the xin anjiang upstream watershed with most of them having more than two soil layers as demonstrated in table a2 in appendix 2 3 3 comparison between hwsd and csd we adopted two kinds of soil databases of hwsd and csd for soil preprocessing for swat soil dataset with each of the soil database sources we have given the detailed methods and procedures for adopting each of them to obtain the required swat soil dataset except that with the two of them we want to compare the possible differences among them for preprocessing swat soil dataset so that the clues can be provided for late people to do the choice between the two kinds of soil data sources as we focus on the methods for soil data preprocessing in this study we would give the comparison also more on the methods aspect and less on the results aspect regarding the methods and procedures for data establishment it is obvious that with the csd of resources and environmental science data center and soil science database it needs more work than that with hwsd it mainly reflects on two aspects one aspect refers to the joint between soil spatial map and soil attribute database with hwsd the soil type code shown in its spatial map can be searched in its attribute tables directly which acts as index to join the two kinds of soil information however with csd the soil type code in the spatial map from resources and environmental science data center refers to the soil subgroup or even the soil great group while the soil attribute information from the database of soil science database refers to a specific soil species therefore to identify the appropriate soil species in the attribute database to connect the soil subgroup great group in the spatial map it demands careful consideration which is time consuming and can be subjective the other aspect refers to the additional work of the conversion of the soil particle size distribution from isss system to usda system when adopting csd for the soil particle size grading standard hwsd and swat share the same standard while csd and swat have different standards it is important to do the conversion as parameters referring to the different soil particle size contents parameters with codes of 18 19 20 and 21 in table 2 are critical soil parameters in swat furthermore these parameter values are also the basis for the further evaluation of other soil parameters parameters with codes of 8 12 14 15 16 and 23 in table 2 in swat as to the data establishment results it is observable from figure 6 and figure 7 that with the same study region and also the same data resolution the number of resulted soil types with hwsd is more than that with csd however regarding the evaluated attribute data for each soil type in the resulted map generally it is coarser with hwsd than that with csd for soil attribute data with hwsd it generally has two soil layers with the depth of each layer being fixed for all soil types while with csd it usually has three or more soil layers with the depth of each soil layer being also different along with the different soil types see details in appendix 2 4 discussion and conclusion eh models have been applied widely in the world not only for hydrological management issues but also for environmental conservations with the typical representative of eh models of swat the well application and development of swat has been widely in the international world especially in the developed countries the application of swat in china appears to be relatively weak however the need for the swat application in china for either hydrological management issues or environmental conservation issues is high one obstacle for swat application in china is its data requirement for the model setup for chinese landscapes among the different categories of the data demands for swat setup in china the one with particular difficulty refers to the soil dataset given this this article gives the methods and procedures for the soil data preprocessing for swat application in chinese landscapes with two types of original database sources respectively with the demonstration in a real chinese watershed of xin anjiang upstream watershed the two soil database sources are hwsd and csd both of which are freely available and have the same data resolution of 1 km furthermore we compare the methods and procedures as well as the results of soil data preprocessing with the two kinds of database sources so that some clues can be given regarding soil data source selection for swat application in china we need to say that we methods we give for the soil data preprocessing for swat with both of the soil database source are not unique there might be other multiple methods regarding the details of the soil data preprocessing for swat application in china especially for those with complex calculation processes however we give the two sets of methods for people which can in the lowest level help to finish the swat soil dataset setup which is significant for facilitating swat application in china meanwhile we give the comparison of the two sets of methods and results with the two database sources only based on our special situation based on our selected study region of the xin anjiang upstream watershed we believe the comparison would have generic meanings in some extent while the particularity and uncertainty regarding details cannot be avoided there are limitations and shortages in this study first for soil attribute data preprocessing we only consider the swat requirement of the soil physical attribute data while we ignore the soil chemical attribute data which is optional for swat setup second we focused on the methods and procedures for evaluating the values of soil parameters in swat while gave less explanation for the meanings of the parameters themselves although we gave relevant references for interested ones to check for details third for some soil parameters in swat the evaluation methods for parameter values are not unique like the parameter with code 8 in table 2 with this situation we adopted the method that was considered as more generalized in wide landscapes instead of the methods considering more the special characteristics of the specific study region the purpose is to demonstrate a method that is generic to apply in various study regions in china it follows the aim of this study that is to increase the facility of swat application in china for different levels of swat modelers regarding various characteristics of watersheds however alternative methods which consider the special characteristics of study regions in further specific studies are highly encouraged we expect that further studies in the future can explore with these described limitations besides both of the two types of original data sources are based on the second national soil census in china at the end of the last century the third national soil census in china has been started in the beginning of 2022
