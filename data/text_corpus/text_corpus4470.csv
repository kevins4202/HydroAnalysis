22350,effective design of ports harbours and marinas is a major challenge due to the utilization of available space material involvement and capital investment one of the major aspects of the design is the construction of cost effective breakwater for the creation of a tranquillity zone and an increase in the usable area within the harbour in the present study the interaction of regular waves with such barriers with the impermeable back wall is investigated experimentally and a numerical model based on the direct iterative boundary element method is validated in numerical modelling a quadratic pressure drop is considered for the slotted walls for wave past the porous barriers to account for the effect of wave height on energy dissipation effects of wave height wave period porosity and the number of walls on the reflection coefficient are investigated the study reveals that a number of optima are one less than the number of slotted barriers which occurs alternately and the number of minima is always one more than the number of maxima it is found that the reflection from the slotted wall barrier reduces with an increase in the number of slotted walls especially for longwave conditions and for porosity greater than 30 whilst for porosity less than 30 adding more number of slotted walls do not contribute to a reduction in wave reflections an array of slotted vertical barrier arranged in a zigzag manner is found to be an effective mechanism for enhancing the wave energy dissipation more space creation and a significant reduction in material requirement and

coefficient 1 introduction ports and harbours are the primary infrastructures needed for cargo handling of ocean going ships around the world such facilities are available with inner harbour water depths varying mostly from 5 to 15 m during normal met ocean climatic conditions the waves entering inside such harbours are with wave heights up to 1 0 m and period from 3 to 12 s during stormy conditions waves up to 2 0 3 0 m height and period up to 16 s enter inside such harbours marinas are built with water depths from 2 0 to 6 0 m in recent times there is a significant rise in harbour traffic with vessels ranging from tugboats to very large container carriers navigate in and out of harbours for loading and unloading of cargoes patrolling etc though the harbours and marinas are generally shielded from direct open water waves by means of breakwaters the waves entering into the harbour through the entrance and waves created due to the movement of vessels within the harbours gets reflected back and forth leading to harbour oscillations and reduces manoeuvring of vessels thus there is a dire need for mitigating wave energy resonating within the harbour dong et al 2010 generally the natural period of harbour oscillation ranges from many seconds to a few minutes this undesirable short and long period waves caused by ship motions could result in resonance and causes damage to parked vessels and adjacent structures the main factors that decide the selection of the type of breakwater for attenuating wave agitations inside the harbour are easy availability of raw materials project capital investment operational and maintenance cost and effective usage area of the inner harbour the most commonly adopted breakwaters are the rubble mound and caisson types however in many countries around the world for e g kuwait construction of rubble mound breakwaters are expensive as the raw materials are sparse as a result adoption of slotted vertical walls is considered as effective replacements moreover slotted barriers permit water circulation thus maintaining the water quality inside the harbour or marina and save the life of school of smaller fish from predators the volume of material required in the case of slotted barriers is less than 10 of materials required for the construction of the conventional rubble mound breakwaters neelamani et al 2017 early physical model studies on slotted barriers in front of the impermeable back wall started with jarlan 1961 over the years various new configurations are proposed by many researchers to study their efficiencies in attenuating wave energy depending upon the site needs kondo 1979 developed an analytical model for caisson type breakwater having two perforated barriers the study confirmed that the addition of the second barrier enhances the reduction of wave reflection as it increases the energy loss through the slots bennett et al 1992 analyzed the wave attenuation of the slotted wave screen with and without a back wall their theoretical formulation is an extension of the works by mei et al 1974 wherein the quadratic pressure drop involves the semi empirical relation for considering wave energy dissipation through head loss coefficient it is also discussed that in the presence of the back wall resonant behaviour is expected but this is prominent when the distance between the slotted wall and the impermeable back wall is sufficiently large and also on the number of slotted walls the results of numerical modelling matched quite well with experimental data twu and liu 1991 discussed mathematically the wave interaction of multiple porous barriers where the porosity is progressively decreased with lee side barriers the study reveals that a system of eight plate porous barrier performs well against the system of six plate porous barrier this is mainly due to the fact that increasing closely spaced porous walls improve wave energy dissipation considerably and reduces the wave reflection the study also demonstrates that minimum reflection occurs when the spacing between the barriers and the distance between the last one to end wall is 0 88 times the water depth on the other hand flexible porous membranes vertically erected in front of a back wall is studied by wang and ren 1994 to study the efficiency of the system their study illustrates that wave forces on the rear wall increase with a decrease in bending stiffness and an increase in porosity of the membrane suh and park 1995 analyzed the reflection coefficient of oblique incident waves on a perforated caisson breakwater placed on a rubble mound analytically and compared the results with experimental data yip and chwang 2000 developed an analytical model for a breakwater configuration consisting of a horizontally immersed porous plate inside the wave chamber their study reveals that the combination of horizontal and vertical slotted barriers improves the wave attenuation for certain wave and structural parameters the overall stability of the structure and also the chamber width can be reduced sahoo et al 2000 studied the oblique wave interaction of partially perforated breakwater wherein the linear pressure drop is used to compute for waves past the porous plate their study demonstrates that conditions of zero and pure reflection is feasible and also confirms that there exists a certain periodic behaviour of wave reflection when the distance between the wall and porous structure is an integer multiple of half of the wavelength of the incident wave li et al 2002 2003 investigated partially perforated caisson having single and double slotted barriers through physical modelling and matched eigenfunction method their study reveals that there are cases where the addition of the second barrier has a counter effect on wave reflection and the breakwater has to be carefully designed in all of the cases the main aim was to create a wave trapping zone to dissipate the energy thereby the wave reflected by the combined system and the wave forces on the structure is tuned to desired needs an excellent review of slotted barriers was summarized by huang et al 2011 lee and shin 2014 carried out experimental studies on partially perforated caissons having single and double chambers their study reveals that for a given chamber width having two barriers with the porosity of the second barrier around 20 is effective in reducing the wave reflections neelamani et al 2017 carried out an experimental study and measured the wave reflection characteristics of zigzag slotted barriers in random wave fields and showed that increasing the number of barriers is insignificant for shorter waves and slotted barriers save considerable space inside harbour and marinas they also proved that the performance of slotted wave barrier is better than slopped rubble mound breakwater for relatively long waves in the past many researchers have adopted a linear boundary condition using darcy s law for waves past porous structures the main drawback is the assumption of numerous small openings however in the case of slotted barriers where the slots are adequate flow separation due to sudden contraction and expansion is inevitable dissipation of wave energy is mainly caused due to friction occurring at the slots openings mei et al 2005 moreover it is to be highlighted that when darcy s law is used for slotted walls the effect of wave height on energy dissipation is ignored in order to include the effects of wave height a semi empirical quadratic discharge equation was developed by molin 2011 and molin and remy 2013 2015 liu et al 2017 analyzed and recommended values for the discharge coefficient of partially perforated caisson breakwater placed on a rubble mound foundation using analytical and iterative multi domain boundary element method the results are compared to the experimental results available in the literature recently zhao et al 2018 applied this methodology to understand the behaviour of waves past multiple vertical slotted barriers most of the results in the literature are restricted to multiple slotted barriers using darcy s law for flow past the porous structure moreover to the authors knowledge no study is available in the literature for physical modelling with zigzag arrangements of the multiple slotted barriers and numerical modelling with quadratic pressure drop on multiple slotted barriers is not analyzed in the present work keeping the main objective to increase the usable area inside a harbour marina efficiency of multiple slotted walls having a rear wall is studied through physical model having the zigzag arrangement of multiple slotted barriers further a numerical model is developed using boundary element method bem in the numerical model to account for the flow past the slotted barriers both linear and nonlinear pressure drops boundary conditions are considered separately to explore the reasons for satisfactory comparison and deviation which is needed for further improvement of the numerical model a comparative study has been made to understand the limitations of the numerical model based on the linear arrangement of the slotted barrier to account for the zigzag arrangement of the physical model the paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the theoretical formulation of the problem this section also elaborates the methodology to obtain a numerical solution using the boundary element method bem though the present theoretical problem could be tackled by analytical method we choose bem because it is convenient and efficient to handle domain modifications and undulated topography at ease section 3 details the experimental studies have been carried out using zigzag arrangements of the slotted barriers in the hydraulics and coastal engineering laboratory kuwait institute of scientific research kisr section 4 discusses various results for understanding the effect of wave height porosity and number of walls on wave reflection from the slotted barrier 2 mathematical formulation and numerical solution the interaction of multiple surface piercing slotted barriers having an impermeable opaque wall with normally incident monochromatic waves are analyzed within the framework of two dimensional linear diffraction theory in the cartesian coordinate system the x axis is taken along the horizontal axis and y axis is vertically positive upward with the origin 0 0 chosen at the mean free surface as shown in fig 1 structural dimensions and wave parameters are mentioned in the nomenclature for clarity it is assumed that the fluid is incompressible inviscid and motion is irrotational and simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω hence there exists a velocity potential φ x y t of the form φ x y t re φ x y e i ω t where the spatial velocity potential φ x y satisfies the laplace equation in the fluid region as given by 1 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 0 on the mean free surface the linearized boundary condition is given by 2 φ y ω 2 g φ 0 on y 0 x the uniform rigid bottom boundary condition is given by 3 φ y 0 x and y h the impermeable opaque wall boundary condition is given by 4 φ x 0 at x 6 s using the method of separation of variables the velocity potential in the outer region 0 satisfying the eq 1 3 is written as 5 φ 0 i g h 2 ω e i k 0 x l y 0 y r 0 e i k 0 x l y 0 y it is to be noted that in eq 5 the summation term corresponding to evanescent modes is ignored as the fictitious boundary i e at x l is sufficiently far away from the structure on the fictitious boundary the velocity potential and the horizontal fluid velocity potential must be continuous in eq 5 the eigenfunction y 0 y is given by 6 y 0 y cosh k 0 y h cosh k 0 h multiplying both sides of eq 5 by y 0 y and integrating from h to 0 at x l yields 7 r 0 2 i ω g h n 0 2 h 0 φ 1 y 0 y d y 1 where n 0 2 h 0 y 0 2 y d y the reflection coefficient k r is defined as the ratio of reflected wave height to incident wave height and is given as 8 k r r 0 differentiating eq 5 and then inserting eq 8 yields 9 φ 1 x g h k 0 ω 1 i ω g h n 0 2 h 0 φ 1 y 0 y d y y 0 y the linear pressure drop on the slotted walls as in koley and sahoo 2017 is given by 10 φ j x φ j 1 x i g s h φ j φ j 1 j 1 2 6 where g s h b μ f i m is the porous effect parameter independent of wave frequency on the other hand for the flow past porous barriers molin and remy 2015 considered the pressure difference to be proportional to the square of the normal velocity of the fluid with the linearized hydrodynamic pressure and applying the lorentz linearization the boundary condition on the slotted barrier is deduced as 11 φ j φ j 1 8 i 3 π ω 1 μ 2 α μ 2 φ j x φ j x 2 c φ j x j 1 2 6 the coefficients of quadratic term in eq 11 denote the energy dissipation and that of velocity term denotes the inertial effects moreover the horizontal fluid velocity is assumed to be continuous on the slotted walls which yield 12 φ j x φ j 1 x j 1 2 6 the blockage coefficient for the horizontal slotted barrier given by 13 c b 2 1 μ 1 c π 4 ln 4 μ μ 2 3 281 180 μ 4 where b and c are barrier thickness and distance between the centerline of two slats respectively the blockage coefficient given by mei et al 1974 is 14 c c π ln sin π 2 μ based on a series of experiments suh et al 2011 and huang et al 2011 gave an empirical relation for blockage coefficient as 15 c b 2 μ the methodology adopted to solve the present boundary value problem is the boundary element method the basis for the bem formulation is green s second identity or green s reciprocal identity the boundary integral equation employed on each boundary of the computation domain is given by 16 α j x 0 y 0 φ j x 0 y 0 γ j φ j x y g j x y x 0 y 0 n j g j x y x 0 y 0 φ j x y n j d γ j x y j 1 2 7 where α j x 0 y 0 is the free term coefficient given by 17 α j x 0 y 0 1 x 0 y 0 ω 0 5 x 0 y 0 on γ 0 x 0 y 0 ω x 0 y 0 γ the fundamental solution g j also called free space green s function and its normal derivative g j n j are given by 18 g j 1 2 π ln r g j n j 1 2 π r r n where r is the distance between the field point x y and the source point x 0 y 0 and is given as 19 r x x 0 2 y y 0 2 each boundary of the domain is discretized into n j elements the boundary numbering is carried out in the anticlockwise direction to have a positive outward normal by assuming velocity potential and it s derivate as constants over each element and using eq 2 11 s eq 13 yields a system of linear algebraic equations this gives rise to matrix collocation of the form 20 p 1 n j q 1 n j φ q j x y n j γ q j g q j x y x 0 y 0 d γ q j x y p 1 n j q 1 n j φ q j x y γ q j g q j x y x 0 y 0 n j d γ q j x y α q j x 0 y 0 n r n r the superscripts denote the domain whereas the subscripts denote the boundary element of the j t h domain on the slotted walls due to quadratic pressure drop boundary condition obtaining a solution is not straight forward and thus the iterative solution is sought the iteration procedure is carried out as described by liu et al 2017 and is deferred here the slotted walls are numbered sequentially as shown in fig 1 2 1 validation of the numerical model before comparing the numerical model predicted reflection results with the measurements on different slotted barrier configurations validation of the numerical code developed in matlab is carried out for few typical conditions as studied by liu et al 2017 then the present numerical model results are compared with the measured reflection coefficient obtained from the model test for different input conditions with a focus to understand the effect of wave height wave period the number of slotted walls porosity and slotted barrier configuration on the coefficient of reflection the validation of numerical code is carried out by comparing the present quadratic model to that of the available results with a single barrier in the literature further it may be noted that the wave interaction with multiple slotted barriers with the linear arrangement is well studied by twu and liu 1991 1992 for validating the present model the porosity of walls barriers 2 to 6 is kept as unity it is obvious that when the porosity of slotted barriers approaches to unity it is invisible transparent to waves on the other hand when porosity tends to zero the structure behaves like an impermeable wall with zero energy losses for both cases pure reflection is observed fig 2 demonstrates the validation of the numerical results obtained using multi domain boundary element method against the analytical results of liu et al 2017 the values of various physical parameters used for the purpose of validation are b 0 01 m μ 0 333 α 0 40 s h 1 50 the far field radiation distance in the present analysis is chosen to be 10 times the total width of six plates a discharge coefficient α 0 50 is considered to be fixed unless otherwise it is mentioned the porosities of all the slotted barriers are assumed to be uniform throughout its submerged length fig 2 reveals that with an increase in wave height results in the reduction of the reflection coefficient this trend is good for the designers since when higher waves enter into the marina or harbour it will result in smaller k r which will in turn reduce the risk of marine operation inside the marina port 3 experimental setup the physical model study is carried out by using the glass wave flume facility available in the hydraulics and coastal engineering laboratory kuwait institute for scientific research kuwait the wave flume is 60 m long and 0 6 m wide and 1 2 m high the wave flume is fixed with a piston type wave maker and has an active wave absorption system for absorbing any reflecting wave from the model this helps for quality data collection without any reflection from the wave maker a total of 30 perforated barriers were investigated by selecting the number of perforated walls as 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 and porosity as 10 20 30 40 and 50 the spacing between the barriers is 0 2 m hence when 6 perforated walls are used the total width is 1 2 m wp1 wp2 and wp3 indicated the wave probes to measure the wave conditions during the experimental work and for further analysis for extracting reflected wave height the front view of the experimental set up is shown in fig 4 the model is fabricated using perspex sheet of 10 cm 1 cm table 1 shows the model description and configuration number it is necessary to give a configuration number to each model in order to refer it when the plots are described in the performance of the entire configuration in a single plot the wave reflection characteristics of configuration 1 to 7 involving different conventional breakwaters are carried out in the wave flume as a reference case and are compared with slotted vertical barrier by neelamani et al 2017 to maintain the continuity of the reader with the previously published results of the author the configuration numbers are started from 8 to 37 the measured results from conventional breakwater are not utilized for the present paper since the aim of the present paper is to compare the results from numerical modelling and experimental measurements of wave reflection from the slotted vertical barrier of different configurations table 1 regular waves of different combinations of wave heights and periods are generated the incident wave and the reflected waves are measured using conductivity type wave probes and the reflection coefficients are assessed using the analysis package of the wave synthesizer software available with mikezero 2000 the wave probe locations in the wave flume are shown in fig 3 physical modelling was completed for different model configurations as given in table 1 for each configuration 36 regular wave runs were conducted using different combinations of wave height and wave period a total of 1080 runs were conducted for the 30 different wave barrier models incident waves were measured without the model in the wave flume complete investigations were carried out with water depth h of 0 70 m the experimental work on the different wave barrier models for a wide range of regular waves took many months and hence further physical modelling of different water depths could not be conducted further investigation is recommended in the future the wave heights used for the study are 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm for each wave height wave periods of 1 0 s 1 2 s 1 4 s 1 6 s 1 8 s 2 0 s 2 2 s 2 4 s 2 6 s 2 8 s 3 0 s and 3 5 s are used the data for regular wave tests are collected for 30 s the data acquisition speed is 40 samples sec the normalized input parameters for regular waves are provided in table 2 the present investigation covered a wide range of input conditions so the results can be used for a wide range of field conditions as indicated by the normalized input parameters the normalized input parameters for regular waves related to the present study were h h relative wave height h λ incident wave steepness u r h λ 2 h 3 ursell parameter h λ relative water depth the range of incident wave steepness h λ was from 0 006 to 0 097 which is commonly observed within the marina the relative water depth h λ ranges from 0 079 to 0 452 and the relative water depth k 0 h ranges from 0 499 to 2 841 which demonstrate that the study covers a large range of shallow to intermediate water depth conditions as mentioned in the introduction section 4 results and discussions 4 1 effect of wave height and wave period on reflection coefficient it is essential to understand the effect of wave height and wave period on the reflection coefficient figs 5 and 6 demonstrate the variation of k r as a function of relative water depth h λ for different values of relative wave height h h in the case of two slotted walls with 10 porosity and three walls with 30 porosity respectively fig 5 reveals that in the case of two slotted walls with 10 porosity as wave height increases the wave reflection increases it is apparent from the figure that a very good correlation is observed between the numerical and experimental measurements in the case of fig 6 the trend of the reflection coefficient k r is predicted correctly by the numerical model in the case of fig 6 the trend of the reflection coefficient k r obtained from numerical and experimental observations are similar in nature however the numerical model underpredict for h λ 0 25 which is due to the inability of the numerical model to account for the zigzag arrangements made in the physical modelling and also the collective interaction between the closely spaced increasing numbers of slotted barriers this reveals the linear water wave theory is not able to account for the flow within the confined zone due to the zigzag arrangement of the slotted barriers when the number of barriers greater than 2 with h h 0 071 and μ 20 further it may be noted that for more than two slotted barriers with zigzag arrangements the flow becomes more irregular in nature as the path of fluid particles traverses up and down within the slotted barriers moreover with an increase in wave height results in a slight reduction of the reflection coefficient for h λ 0 20 whilst a significant increase of reflection coefficient occurs for h λ 0 20 increase in wave height is very sensitive for higher values of h λ corresponding to deep water where wave energy concentration is nearer to the free surface when water depth h is 0 85 times the wavelength of the incident waves in case of three slotted walls with 30 porosity reflection coefficient becomes close to zero which demonstrates that almost all of the incoming waves are trapped in the confined zones between the back wall and slotted barriers this phenomenon is referred to as wave trapping see twu and lin 1991 4 2 effect of number of slotted walls on reflection coefficient in this subsection for understanding the role of the number of slotted barriers variation in the reflection coefficients are analyzed as a function of relative water depth h λ fig 7 a demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficient versus h λ in case of one three and five walls with h h 0 071 and μ 10 fig 7b is provided for the same wave input and porosity condition but for two four and six slotted walls it is found that both the trends as well as the comparisons of numerical and measured k r values are satisfactory further these results reveal that as the number of walls increases there is a reduction in k r in the case of long waves corresponding to smaller h λ values which is due to the interaction of waves with the slotted barriers and energy loss within the barriers however for higher h λ values corresponding to deep water waves it is not advisable to increase the number of slotted walls since they do not contribute much for wave energy dissipation especially for 10 porosity similar results are plotted in fig 8 a and b to study the effect of a number of slotted walls with 20 porosity and the study reveal that the pattern in the experimental and theoretical observations correlate well here the variation in the reflection coefficient is oscillatory in nature with an increase in the number of walls with an increase in the number of barriers the number of optima in wave reflection increases with a reduction in the amplitude of the oscillatory pattern moreover both the figures reveal that the number of optima is one less than the number of slotted barriers which occurs alternately and a number of minima is always one more than the number of maxima further the certain phase shift in the oscillatory pattern of the reflection coefficient is observed with an increase in the number of slotted barriers which is due to the formation of partial standing waves within the confined zone between each of the two slotted barriers a comparison with fig 7a and 7b reveal that 20 porosity is more effective in trapping a major part of the wave energy with a significant reduction in wave reflection however for 0 175 h λ 0 30 the addition of slotted walls is marginally increasing the reflection coefficient k r which reveals that the addition of walls does not necessarily always enhances the wave dissipation and reduce wave reflection for all ratios of h λ which is similar to that of fig 7 a comparison of the experimental results along with the two numerical models based on the quadratic pressure drop as in molin and remy 2013 and the well known darcy law yu 1995 are given in fig 9 a and fig 9b it is observed that both the numerical models predict the trend in wave reflection approximately moreover for the given physical parameters a linear model with friction coefficient within 8 10 gives a good estimate interestingly this friction coefficient is close to the value obtained from the empirical relation given by li et al 2006 which was based on a physical model study however one of the main drawbacks of the linear model is its inadequacy to accommodate the increase in the wave height as discussed by molin and remy 2013 thus in the subsequent discussion the numerical study is devoted to results based on quadratic pressure drop alone 4 3 effect of porosity on reflection coefficient it is important to understand how the porosity of the slotted barrier affects the wave reflection to select suitable porosity for minimizing the wave reflection fig 10 a and 10b demonstrate the variation of k r as a function of relative water depth h λ for different values of porosity in the case of two slotted walls and six slotted walls respectively with h h 0 071 in fig 10a a reasonably good agreement between the numerical and experimental results are observed moreover fig 10b reveals a decreasing trend in the oscillatory pattern of wave reflection with an increase in relative water depth h λ this demonstrates that for a higher number of barriers wave reflection decreases in case of short waves compared to that of long waves this is due to the fact that wave energy which concentrates near the free surface in case of short waves is dissipated in the presence of multiple barriers for barriers having 30 porosity table 3 summarizes the root mean square error rmse values that indicate when the number of walls is less along with reduced porosity the zigzag arrangement has less improvement in the energy dissipation compared to the linear arrangements with simultaneous increase in the barrier porosity and the number of walls there is a large deviation in wave reflection due to combinations of flow contraction the formation of vortices flow separation etc neelamani and vedagiri 2002 koraim et al 2011 for such scenarios further investigation is needed using cfd to understand the fluid dynamics within the confined zone between the slotted barriers 4 4 effect of the configuration of slotted walls on reflection coefficient for designers interested in the creation of tranquillity zone in harbour marina using slotted barriers the most important requirement is to select the appropriate barrier configuration that will provide minimum wave reflection for a given wave climate fig 11 demonstrates the variation of the reflection coefficient k r for configurations 8 to 37 as shown in table 2 for two different relative wave heights the comparison between measurements and numerical results are in good agreement except for configurations 32 to 37 corresponding to 50 porosity moreover both the figures reveal that for smaller relative water depth the correlation between experimental and numerical results is very good whilst certain variation is observed for higher values of relative water depth further in the case of long waves an increase in the number of barriers having high porosity dissipate more energy leading to smaller reflection coefficient for k r closer to 0 2 configurations 22 28 29 34 and 35 can be selected among these configurations configuration 34 3 wall and 50 porosity is the optimized one since the quantity of material consumed for its fabrication is the least among these 5 configurations 5 conclusions the wave reflection characteristics of an array of slotted vertical barriers were assessed based on both physical model test and numerical modelling using both darcy law and quadratic pressure drop primarily in the present work to account for the effect of wave height on energy dissipation a quadratic pressure drop condition is adopted instead of darcy s law for analyzing waves moving past a porous structure known results in the literature are reproduced using the developed numerical model liu and li 2017 the efficiency of the breakwater system is analyzed by varying relative wave height water depth number of slotted barriers and porosity ranging from 10 to 50 in the case of relatively long waves increasing the wave height increases the wave reflection moreover it is not advisable to increase the number of slotted walls since they do not contribute much for wave energy dissipation for h λ 0 25 especially for 10 porosity as most of the waves are reflected by the first slotted wall itself for μ 20 the variation in the reflection coefficient is oscillatory in nature with an increase in the number of walls whose amplitude reduces for higher h λ further the certain phase shift in the oscillatory pattern of the reflection coefficient is observed with an increase in the number of slotted barriers which is due to the formation of partial standing waves within the confined zone between each of the two slotted barriers both experimental and numerical study confirms the occurrence of multiple optima in wave reflection and the number of optima is one less than the number of slotted barriers which occurs alternately whilst a number of minima are always one more than the number of slotted barriers from this investigation depending on the most frequent wave climate at a site it is possible to select the wave barrier configuration for optimum performance acknowledgement the experimental investigations were conducted in the coastal engineering laboratory at kuwait

22350,effective design of ports harbours and marinas is a major challenge due to the utilization of available space material involvement and capital investment one of the major aspects of the design is the construction of cost effective breakwater for the creation of a tranquillity zone and an increase in the usable area within the harbour in the present study the interaction of regular waves with such barriers with the impermeable back wall is investigated experimentally and a numerical model based on the direct iterative boundary element method is validated in numerical modelling a quadratic pressure drop is considered for the slotted walls for wave past the porous barriers to account for the effect of wave height on energy dissipation effects of wave height wave period porosity and the number of walls on the reflection coefficient are investigated the study reveals that a number of optima are one less than the number of slotted barriers which occurs alternately and the number of minima is always one more than the number of maxima it is found that the reflection from the slotted wall barrier reduces with an increase in the number of slotted walls especially for longwave conditions and for porosity greater than 30 whilst for porosity less than 30 adding more number of slotted walls do not contribute to a reduction in wave reflections an array of slotted

coefficient 1 introduction ports and harbours are the primary infrastructures needed for cargo handling of ocean going ships around the world such facilities are available with inner harbour water depths varying mostly from 5 to 15 m during normal met ocean climatic conditions the waves entering inside such harbours are with wave heights up to 1 0 m and period from 3 to 12 s during stormy conditions waves up to 2 0 3 0 m height and period up to 16 s enter inside such harbours marinas are built with water depths from 2 0 to 6 0 m in recent times there is a significant rise in harbour traffic with vessels ranging from tugboats to very large container carriers navigate in and out of harbours for loading and unloading of cargoes patrolling etc though the harbours and marinas are generally shielded from direct open water waves by means of breakwaters the waves entering into the harbour through the entrance and waves created due to the movement of vessels within the harbours gets reflected back and forth leading to harbour oscillations and reduces manoeuvring of vessels thus there is a dire need for mitigating wave energy resonating within the harbour dong et al 2010 generally the natural period of harbour oscillation ranges from many seconds to a few minutes this undesirable short and long period waves caused by ship motions could result in resonance and causes damage to parked vessels and adjacent structures the main factors that decide the selection of the type of breakwater for attenuating wave agitations inside the harbour are easy availability of raw materials project capital investment operational and maintenance cost and effective usage area of the inner harbour the most commonly adopted breakwaters are the rubble mound and caisson types however in many countries around the world for e g kuwait construction of rubble mound breakwaters are expensive as the raw materials are sparse as a result adoption of slotted vertical walls is considered as effective replacements moreover slotted barriers permit water circulation thus maintaining the water quality inside the harbour or marina and save the life of school of smaller fish from predators the volume of material required in the case of slotted barriers is less than 10 of materials required for the construction of the conventional rubble mound breakwaters neelamani et al 2017 early physical model studies on slotted barriers in front of the impermeable back wall started with jarlan 1961 over the years various new configurations are proposed by many researchers to study their efficiencies in attenuating wave energy depending upon the site needs kondo 1979 developed an analytical model for caisson type breakwater having two perforated barriers the study confirmed that the addition of the second barrier enhances the reduction of wave reflection as it increases the energy loss through the slots bennett et al 1992 analyzed the wave attenuation of the slotted wave screen with and without a back wall their theoretical formulation is an extension of the works by mei et al 1974 wherein the quadratic pressure drop involves the semi empirical relation for considering wave energy dissipation through head loss coefficient it is also discussed that in the presence of the back wall resonant behaviour is expected but this is prominent when the distance between the slotted wall and the impermeable back wall is sufficiently large and also on the number of slotted walls the results of numerical modelling matched quite well with experimental data twu and liu 1991 discussed mathematically the wave interaction of multiple porous barriers where the porosity is progressively decreased with lee side barriers the study reveals that a system of eight plate porous barrier performs well against the system of six plate porous barrier this is mainly due to the fact that increasing closely spaced porous walls improve wave energy dissipation considerably and reduces the wave reflection the study also demonstrates that minimum reflection occurs when the spacing between the barriers and the distance between the last one to end wall is 0 88 times the water depth on the other hand flexible porous membranes vertically erected in front of a back wall is studied by wang and ren 1994 to study the efficiency of the system their study illustrates that wave forces on the rear wall increase with a decrease in bending stiffness and an increase in porosity of the membrane suh and park 1995 analyzed the reflection coefficient of oblique incident waves on a perforated caisson breakwater placed on a rubble mound analytically and compared the results with experimental data yip and chwang 2000 developed an analytical model for a breakwater configuration consisting of a horizontally immersed porous plate inside the wave chamber their study reveals that the combination of horizontal and vertical slotted barriers improves the wave attenuation for certain wave and structural parameters the overall stability of the structure and also the chamber width can be reduced sahoo et al 2000 studied the oblique wave interaction of partially perforated breakwater wherein the linear pressure drop is used to compute for waves past the porous plate their study demonstrates that conditions of zero and pure reflection is feasible and also confirms that there exists a certain periodic behaviour of wave reflection when the distance between the wall and porous structure is an integer multiple of half of the wavelength of the incident wave li et al 2002 2003 investigated partially perforated caisson having single and double slotted barriers through physical modelling and matched eigenfunction method their study reveals that there are cases where the addition of the second barrier has a counter effect on wave reflection and the breakwater has to be carefully designed in all of the cases the main aim was to create a wave trapping zone to dissipate the energy thereby the wave reflected by the combined system and the wave forces on the structure is tuned to desired needs an excellent review of slotted barriers was summarized by huang et al 2011 lee and shin 2014 carried out experimental studies on partially perforated caissons having single and double chambers their study reveals that for a given chamber width having two barriers with the porosity of the second barrier around 20 is effective in reducing the wave reflections neelamani et al 2017 carried out an experimental study and measured the wave reflection characteristics of zigzag slotted barriers in random wave fields and showed that increasing the number of barriers is insignificant for shorter waves and slotted barriers save considerable space inside harbour and marinas they also proved that the performance of slotted wave barrier is better than slopped rubble mound breakwater for relatively long waves in the past many researchers have adopted a linear boundary condition using darcy s law for waves past porous structures the main drawback is the assumption of numerous small openings however in the case of slotted barriers where the slots are adequate flow separation due to sudden contraction and expansion is inevitable dissipation of wave energy is mainly caused due to friction occurring at the slots openings mei et al 2005 moreover it is to be highlighted that when darcy s law is used for slotted walls the effect of wave height on energy dissipation is ignored in order to include the effects of wave height a semi empirical quadratic discharge equation was developed by molin 2011 and molin and remy 2013 2015 liu et al 2017 analyzed and recommended values for the discharge coefficient of partially perforated caisson breakwater placed on a rubble mound foundation using analytical and iterative multi domain boundary element method the results are compared to the experimental results available in the literature recently zhao et al 2018 applied this methodology to understand the behaviour of waves past multiple vertical slotted barriers most of the results in the literature are restricted to multiple slotted barriers using darcy s law for flow past the porous structure moreover to the authors knowledge no study is available in the literature for physical modelling with zigzag arrangements of the multiple slotted barriers and numerical modelling with quadratic pressure drop on multiple slotted barriers is not analyzed in the present work keeping the main objective to increase the usable area inside a harbour marina efficiency of multiple slotted walls having a rear wall is studied through physical model having the zigzag arrangement of multiple slotted barriers further a numerical model is developed using boundary element method bem in the numerical model to account for the flow past the slotted barriers both linear and nonlinear pressure drops boundary conditions are considered separately to explore the reasons for satisfactory comparison and deviation which is needed for further improvement of the numerical model a comparative study has been made to understand the limitations of the numerical model based on the linear arrangement of the slotted barrier to account for the zigzag arrangement of the physical model the paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the theoretical formulation of the problem this section also elaborates the methodology to obtain a numerical solution using the boundary element method bem though the present theoretical problem could be tackled by analytical method we choose bem because it is convenient and efficient to handle domain modifications and undulated topography at ease section 3 details the experimental studies have been carried out using zigzag arrangements of the slotted barriers in the hydraulics and coastal engineering laboratory kuwait institute of scientific research kisr section 4 discusses various results for understanding the effect of wave height porosity and number of walls on wave reflection from the slotted barrier 2 mathematical formulation and numerical solution the interaction of multiple surface piercing slotted barriers having an impermeable opaque wall with normally incident monochromatic waves are analyzed within the framework of two dimensional linear diffraction theory in the cartesian coordinate system the x axis is taken along the horizontal axis and y axis is vertically positive upward with the origin 0 0 chosen at the mean free surface as shown in fig 1 structural dimensions and wave parameters are mentioned in the nomenclature for clarity it is assumed that the fluid is incompressible inviscid and motion is irrotational and simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω hence there exists a velocity potential φ x y t of the form φ x y t re φ x y e i ω t where the spatial velocity potential φ x y satisfies the laplace equation in the fluid region as given by 1 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 0 on the mean free surface the linearized boundary condition is given by 2 φ y ω 2 g φ 0 on y 0 x the uniform rigid bottom boundary condition is given by 3 φ y 0 x and y h the impermeable opaque wall boundary condition is given by 4 φ x 0 at x 6 s using the method of separation of variables the velocity potential in the outer region 0 satisfying the eq 1 3 is written as 5 φ 0 i g h 2 ω e i k 0 x l y 0 y r 0 e i k 0 x l y 0 y it is to be noted that in eq 5 the summation term corresponding to evanescent modes is ignored as the fictitious boundary i e at x l is sufficiently far away from the structure on the fictitious boundary the velocity potential and the horizontal fluid velocity potential must be continuous in eq 5 the eigenfunction y 0 y is given by 6 y 0 y cosh k 0 y h cosh k 0 h multiplying both sides of eq 5 by y 0 y and integrating from h to 0 at x l yields 7 r 0 2 i ω g h n 0 2 h 0 φ 1 y 0 y d y 1 where n 0 2 h 0 y 0 2 y d y the reflection coefficient k r is defined as the ratio of reflected wave height to incident wave height and is given as 8 k r r 0 differentiating eq 5 and then inserting eq 8 yields 9 φ 1 x g h k 0 ω 1 i ω g h n 0 2 h 0 φ 1 y 0 y d y y 0 y the linear pressure drop on the slotted walls as in koley and sahoo 2017 is given by 10 φ j x φ j 1 x i g s h φ j φ j 1 j 1 2 6 where g s h b μ f i m is the porous effect parameter independent of wave frequency on the other hand for the flow past porous barriers molin and remy 2015 considered the pressure difference to be proportional to the square of the normal velocity of the fluid with the linearized hydrodynamic pressure and applying the lorentz linearization the boundary condition on the slotted barrier is deduced as 11 φ j φ j 1 8 i 3 π ω 1 μ 2 α μ 2 φ j x φ j x 2 c φ j x j 1 2 6 the coefficients of quadratic term in eq 11 denote the energy dissipation and that of velocity term denotes the inertial effects moreover the horizontal fluid velocity is assumed to be continuous on the slotted walls which yield 12 φ j x φ j 1 x j 1 2 6 the blockage coefficient for the horizontal slotted barrier given by 13 c b 2 1 μ 1 c π 4 ln 4 μ μ 2 3 281 180 μ 4 where b and c are barrier thickness and distance between the centerline of two slats respectively the blockage coefficient given by mei et al 1974 is 14 c c π ln sin π 2 μ based on a series of experiments suh et al 2011 and huang et al 2011 gave an empirical relation for blockage coefficient as 15 c b 2 μ the methodology adopted to solve the present boundary value problem is the boundary element method the basis for the bem formulation is green s second identity or green s reciprocal identity the boundary integral equation employed on each boundary of the computation domain is given by 16 α j x 0 y 0 φ j x 0 y 0 γ j φ j x y g j x y x 0 y 0 n j g j x y x 0 y 0 φ j x y n j d γ j x y j 1 2 7 where α j x 0 y 0 is the free term coefficient given by 17 α j x 0 y 0 1 x 0 y 0 ω 0 5 x 0 y 0 on γ 0 x 0 y 0 ω x 0 y 0 γ the fundamental solution g j also called free space green s function and its normal derivative g j n j are given by 18 g j 1 2 π ln r g j n j 1 2 π r r n where r is the distance between the field point x y and the source point x 0 y 0 and is given as 19 r x x 0 2 y y 0 2 each boundary of the domain is discretized into n j elements the boundary numbering is carried out in the anticlockwise direction to have a positive outward normal by assuming velocity potential and it s derivate as constants over each element and using eq 2 11 s eq 13 yields a system of linear algebraic equations this gives rise to matrix collocation of the form 20 p 1 n j q 1 n j φ q j x y n j γ q j g q j x y x 0 y 0 d γ q j x y p 1 n j q 1 n j φ q j x y γ q j g q j x y x 0 y 0 n j d γ q j x y α q j x 0 y 0 n r n r the superscripts denote the domain whereas the subscripts denote the boundary element of the j t h domain on the slotted walls due to quadratic pressure drop boundary condition obtaining a solution is not straight forward and thus the iterative solution is sought the iteration procedure is carried out as described by liu et al 2017 and is deferred here the slotted walls are numbered sequentially as shown in fig 1 2 1 validation of the numerical model before comparing the numerical model predicted reflection results with the measurements on different slotted barrier configurations validation of the numerical code developed in matlab is carried out for few typical conditions as studied by liu et al 2017 then the present numerical model results are compared with the measured reflection coefficient obtained from the model test for different input conditions with a focus to understand the effect of wave height wave period the number of slotted walls porosity and slotted barrier configuration on the coefficient of reflection the validation of numerical code is carried out by comparing the present quadratic model to that of the available results with a single barrier in the literature further it may be noted that the wave interaction with multiple slotted barriers with the linear arrangement is well studied by twu and liu 1991 1992 for validating the present model the porosity of walls barriers 2 to 6 is kept as unity it is obvious that when the porosity of slotted barriers approaches to unity it is invisible transparent to waves on the other hand when porosity tends to zero the structure behaves like an impermeable wall with zero energy losses for both cases pure reflection is observed fig 2 demonstrates the validation of the numerical results obtained using multi domain boundary element method against the analytical results of liu et al 2017 the values of various physical parameters used for the purpose of validation are b 0 01 m μ 0 333 α 0 40 s h 1 50 the far field radiation distance in the present analysis is chosen to be 10 times the total width of six plates a discharge coefficient α 0 50 is considered to be fixed unless otherwise it is mentioned the porosities of all the slotted barriers are assumed to be uniform throughout its submerged length fig 2 reveals that with an increase in wave height results in the reduction of the reflection coefficient this trend is good for the designers since when higher waves enter into the marina or harbour it will result in smaller k r which will in turn reduce the risk of marine operation inside the marina port 3 experimental setup the physical model study is carried out by using the glass wave flume facility available in the hydraulics and coastal engineering laboratory kuwait institute for scientific research kuwait the wave flume is 60 m long and 0 6 m wide and 1 2 m high the wave flume is fixed with a piston type wave maker and has an active wave absorption system for absorbing any reflecting wave from the model this helps for quality data collection without any reflection from the wave maker a total of 30 perforated barriers were investigated by selecting the number of perforated walls as 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 and porosity as 10 20 30 40 and 50 the spacing between the barriers is 0 2 m hence when 6 perforated walls are used the total width is 1 2 m wp1 wp2 and wp3 indicated the wave probes to measure the wave conditions during the experimental work and for further analysis for extracting reflected wave height the front view of the experimental set up is shown in fig 4 the model is fabricated using perspex sheet of 10 cm 1 cm table 1 shows the model description and configuration number it is necessary to give a configuration number to each model in order to refer it when the plots are described in the performance of the entire configuration in a single plot the wave reflection characteristics of configuration 1 to 7 involving different conventional breakwaters are carried out in the wave flume as a reference case and are compared with slotted vertical barrier by neelamani et al 2017 to maintain the continuity of the reader with the previously published results of the author the configuration numbers are started from 8 to 37 the measured results from conventional breakwater are not utilized for the present paper since the aim of the present paper is to compare the results from numerical modelling and experimental measurements of wave reflection from the slotted vertical barrier of different configurations table 1 regular waves of different combinations of wave heights and periods are generated the incident wave and the reflected waves are measured using conductivity type wave probes and the reflection coefficients are assessed using the analysis package of the wave synthesizer software available with mikezero 2000 the wave probe locations in the wave flume are shown in fig 3 physical modelling was completed for different model configurations as given in table 1 for each configuration 36 regular wave runs were conducted using different combinations of wave height and wave period a total of 1080 runs were conducted for the 30 different wave barrier models incident waves were measured without the model in the wave flume complete investigations were carried out with water depth h of 0 70 m the experimental work on the different wave barrier models for a wide range of regular waves took many months and hence further physical modelling of different water depths could not be conducted further investigation is recommended in the future the wave heights used for the study are 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm for each wave height wave periods of 1 0 s 1 2 s 1 4 s 1 6 s 1 8 s 2 0 s 2 2 s 2 4 s 2 6 s 2 8 s 3 0 s and 3 5 s are used the data for regular wave tests are collected for 30 s the data acquisition speed is 40 samples sec the normalized input parameters for regular waves are provided in table 2 the present investigation covered a wide range of input conditions so the results can be used for a wide range of field conditions as indicated by the normalized input parameters the normalized input parameters for regular waves related to the present study were h h relative wave height h λ incident wave steepness u r h λ 2 h 3 ursell parameter h λ relative water depth the range of incident wave steepness h λ was from 0 006 to 0 097 which is commonly observed within the marina the relative water depth h λ ranges from 0 079 to 0 452 and the relative water depth k 0 h ranges from 0 499 to 2 841 which demonstrate that the study covers a large range of shallow to intermediate water depth conditions as mentioned in the introduction section 4 results and discussions 4 1 effect of wave height and wave period on reflection coefficient it is essential to understand the effect of wave height and wave period on the reflection coefficient figs 5 and 6 demonstrate the variation of k r as a function of relative water depth h λ for different values of relative wave height h h in the case of two slotted walls with 10 porosity and three walls with 30 porosity respectively fig 5 reveals that in the case of two slotted walls with 10 porosity as wave height increases the wave reflection increases it is apparent from the figure that a very good correlation is observed between the numerical and experimental measurements in the case of fig 6 the trend of the reflection coefficient k r is predicted correctly by the numerical model in the case of fig 6 the trend of the reflection coefficient k r obtained from numerical and experimental observations are similar in nature however the numerical model underpredict for h λ 0 25 which is due to the inability of the numerical model to account for the zigzag arrangements made in the physical modelling and also the collective interaction between the closely spaced increasing numbers of slotted barriers this reveals the linear water wave theory is not able to account for the flow within the confined zone due to the zigzag arrangement of the slotted barriers when the number of barriers greater than 2 with h h 0 071 and μ 20 further it may be noted that for more than two slotted barriers with zigzag arrangements the flow becomes more irregular in nature as the path of fluid particles traverses up and down within the slotted barriers moreover with an increase in wave height results in a slight reduction of the reflection coefficient for h λ 0 20 whilst a significant increase of reflection coefficient occurs for h λ 0 20 increase in wave height is very sensitive for higher values of h λ corresponding to deep water where wave energy concentration is nearer to the free surface when water depth h is 0 85 times the wavelength of the incident waves in case of three slotted walls with 30 porosity reflection coefficient becomes close to zero which demonstrates that almost all of the incoming waves are trapped in the confined zones between the back wall and slotted barriers this phenomenon is referred to as wave trapping see twu and lin 1991 4 2 effect of number of slotted walls on reflection coefficient in this subsection for understanding the role of the number of slotted barriers variation in the reflection coefficients are analyzed as a function of relative water depth h λ fig 7 a demonstrates the variation of reflection coefficient versus h λ in case of one three and five walls with h h 0 071 and μ 10 fig 7b is provided for the same wave input and porosity condition but for two four and six slotted walls it is found that both the trends as well as the comparisons of numerical and measured k r values are satisfactory further these results reveal that as the number of walls increases there is a reduction in k r in the case of long waves corresponding to smaller h λ values which is due to the interaction of waves with the slotted barriers and energy loss within the barriers however for higher h λ values corresponding to deep water waves it is not advisable to increase the number of slotted walls since they do not contribute much for wave energy dissipation especially for 10 porosity similar results are plotted in fig 8 a and b to study the effect of a number of slotted walls with 20 porosity and the study reveal that the pattern in the experimental and theoretical observations correlate well here the variation in the reflection coefficient is oscillatory in nature with an increase in the number of walls with an increase in the number of barriers the number of optima in wave reflection increases with a reduction in the amplitude of the oscillatory pattern moreover both the figures reveal that the number of optima is one less than the number of slotted barriers which occurs alternately and a number of minima is always one more than the number of maxima further the certain phase shift in the oscillatory pattern of the reflection coefficient is observed with an increase in the number of slotted barriers which is due to the formation of partial standing waves within the confined zone between each of the two slotted barriers a comparison with fig 7a and 7b reveal that 20 porosity is more effective in trapping a major part of the wave energy with a significant reduction in wave reflection however for 0 175 h λ 0 30 the addition of slotted walls is marginally increasing the reflection coefficient k r which reveals that the addition of walls does not necessarily always enhances the wave dissipation and reduce wave reflection for all ratios of h λ which is similar to that of fig 7 a comparison of the experimental results along with the two numerical models based on the quadratic pressure drop as in molin and remy 2013 and the well known darcy law yu 1995 are given in fig 9 a and fig 9b it is observed that both the numerical models predict the trend in wave reflection approximately moreover for the given physical parameters a linear model with friction coefficient within 8 10 gives a good estimate interestingly this friction coefficient is close to the value obtained from the empirical relation given by li et al 2006 which was based on a physical model study however one of the main drawbacks of the linear model is its inadequacy to accommodate the increase in the wave height as discussed by molin and remy 2013 thus in the subsequent discussion the numerical study is devoted to results based on quadratic pressure drop alone 4 3 effect of porosity on reflection coefficient it is important to understand how the porosity of the slotted barrier affects the wave reflection to select suitable porosity for minimizing the wave reflection fig 10 a and 10b demonstrate the variation of k r as a function of relative water depth h λ for different values of porosity in the case of two slotted walls and six slotted walls respectively with h h 0 071 in fig 10a a reasonably good agreement between the numerical and experimental results are observed moreover fig 10b reveals a decreasing trend in the oscillatory pattern of wave reflection with an increase in relative water depth h λ this demonstrates that for a higher number of barriers wave reflection decreases in case of short waves compared to that of long waves this is due to the fact that wave energy which concentrates near the free surface in case of short waves is dissipated in the presence of multiple barriers for barriers having 30 porosity table 3 summarizes the root mean square error rmse values that indicate when the number of walls is less along with reduced porosity the zigzag arrangement has less improvement in the energy dissipation compared to the linear arrangements with simultaneous increase in the barrier porosity and the number of walls there is a large deviation in wave reflection due to combinations of flow contraction the formation of vortices flow separation etc neelamani and vedagiri 2002 koraim et al 2011 for such scenarios further investigation is needed using cfd to understand the fluid dynamics within the confined zone between the slotted barriers 4 4 effect of the configuration of slotted walls on reflection coefficient for designers interested in the creation of tranquillity zone in harbour marina using slotted barriers the most important requirement is to select the appropriate barrier configuration that will provide minimum wave reflection for a given wave climate fig 11 demonstrates the variation of the reflection coefficient k r for configurations 8 to 37 as shown in table 2 for two different relative wave heights the comparison between measurements and numerical results are in good agreement except for configurations 32 to 37 corresponding to 50 porosity moreover both the figures reveal that for smaller relative water depth the correlation between experimental and numerical results is very good whilst certain variation is observed for higher values of relative water depth further in the case of long waves an increase in the number of barriers having high porosity dissipate more energy leading to smaller reflection coefficient for k r closer to 0 2 configurations 22 28 29 34 and 35 can be selected among these configurations configuration 34 3 wall and 50 porosity is the optimized one since the quantity of material consumed for its fabrication is the least among these 5 configurations 5 conclusions the wave reflection characteristics of an array of slotted vertical barriers were assessed based on both physical model test and numerical modelling using both darcy law and quadratic pressure drop primarily in the present work to account for the effect of wave height on energy dissipation a quadratic pressure drop condition is adopted instead of darcy s law for analyzing waves moving past a porous structure known results in the literature are reproduced using the developed numerical model liu and li 2017 the efficiency of the breakwater system is analyzed by varying relative wave height water depth number of slotted barriers and porosity ranging from 10 to 50 in the case of relatively long waves increasing the wave height increases the wave reflection moreover it is not advisable to increase the number of slotted walls since they do not contribute much for wave energy dissipation for h λ 0 25 especially for 10 porosity as most of the waves are reflected by the first slotted wall itself for μ 20 the variation in the reflection coefficient is oscillatory in nature with an increase in the number of walls whose amplitude reduces for higher h λ further the certain phase shift in the oscillatory pattern of the reflection coefficient is observed with an increase in the number of slotted barriers which is due to the formation of partial standing waves within the confined zone between each of the two slotted barriers both experimental and numerical study confirms the occurrence of multiple optima in wave reflection and the number of optima is one less than the number of slotted barriers which occurs alternately whilst a number of minima are always one more than the number of slotted barriers from this investigation depending on the most frequent wave climate at a site it is possible to select the wave barrier configuration for optimum performance acknowledgement the experimental investigations were conducted in the coastal engineering laboratory at kuwait

22351,underwater docking is currently a key technology for supplementing energy and self recovery of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs three types of docking methods are introduced first the captured rod docking method is selected for this research effort and its mechanical properties are analyzed a remus100 and a captured rod with a radius of 50 mm are used to simulate the dynamic underwater docking and collision processes the theoretical model analysis of deformation and collision of the captured rod is carried out finally a portable auv is tested for collisions under different conditions through simulation and test we found that there is a karman vortex behind the captured rod when remus100 approaches the captured rod and the distance between them is less than a certain value the captured rod s wake will have an influence on the forces on the remus100 the degree of influence positively correlates with the current s velocity the lateral and vertical forces on the remus100 are more susceptible to the captured rod s wake and are affected by the captured rod s wake earlier the collision force increases as the collision velocity increases but the collision time is the opposite we analyze and compare the results obtained by simulations tests and theoretical model keywords captured rod underwater docking computational fluid dynamics cfd hydrodynamics deformation and collision 1 introduction auvs are underwater robots that operate on their own and carry their own energy auvs have many potential scientific and military applications and are the primary focus for the development of underwater robots nouri et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2013 nicholson and healey 2008 in order to meet increasingly demanding application requirements auv s technological advancements must consider improvements in underwater operation time work efficiency and endurance yan and wu 2007 when an auv completes one task it usually needs to be sent to the surface support platform to be recycled to replenish energy transfer data and download new mission tasks when working in the deep sea it takes a long time to launch and recover an auv if the sea conditions in the working area are poor there are increased risks during the recycling process in order to solve these problems scientists have developed various underwater docking systems jantapremjit and wilson 2007 stokey et al 2001 which enable an auv to actively dock with underwater stationary platform or mobile platform target to complete the recycling process therefore underwater docking technology could greatly enhance the long term and long distance working capabilities of an auv underwater docking technology is a research frontier and a key technology for auvs it is also the basis for studying subsea base stations and deep sea long term observational systems for the subsea base stations and deep sea long term observational systems the auv is the physical connection between submarine observational system and a surface support platform for this underwater system docking technology is very important scholars have designed different underwater docking methods which can be roughly divided into three categories zhang 2013 yang and gu 2013 wu et al 2014 captured docking guided docking and seated docking as shown in fig 1 each docking method has its own advantages and disadvantages meng et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 fukasawa et al 2003 yu et al 1996 of these methods the most commonly used are the first two currently with the rapid development of unmanned mobile platforms zaghi et al 2016 peng et al 2017 yan et al 2010 park et al 2017 there is growing interest for mutual cooperation and support between unmanned platforms this has greatly promoted the emergence of autonomous launch and recovery auv technology of the unmanned surface vehicle usv sarda 2016 brizzolara and chryssostomidis 2012 generally the recovery process is more difficult than the launch process sarda and dhanak 2016 sarda et al 2014 used a catamaran usv to recover a remus100 auv through a thin line with a depressor wing from a winch on the usv advanced technology research corporation made two schemes both of which are towed from a single boat one of them features a guided style docking recovery form which is mainly for torpedo shaped auvs the other is a captured style docking recovery form mainly for auvs with a v type capture mechanism the eca group just developed a usv with a self recovering auv system which is a kind of underwater towing recycling method and can complete the recycling of the auv towed sonar and other equipment much like the eca group s recycling method odim brooke ocean used a towing system mounted on the a frame to complete the recovery of auvs circle 2012 recycled an auv using a captured recovery device and recently designed a slotted usv for recycling auvs however successful underwater docking is a prerequisite for the autonomous recovery process underwater docking can also provide technical support for future military operation and unmanned underwater warfare platform therefore in recent years underwater docking technology especially dynamic methods has attracted global attention in the underwater docking process no matter which underwater docking method is used the auv and the docking device will collide how to effectively use or avoid collisions is of great significance for studying underwater docking or self recovery of auvs collision is usually the phenomenon of two objects moving relative to each other touching and rapidly changing their motion state it can be a collision of macroscopic objects or it can be a collision between microscopic particles such as atoms nuclei and subatomic particles from an energy point of view collisions can be divided into full elastic collisions completely inelastic collisions and partially inelastic collisions most collision processes are partially inelastic collisions at present many scholars are studying the collision problem but most of them analyze the collision between the ship and the bridge a car and a pier or a car and a car and a collision between balls as shown in fig 2 zhou et al 2017 analyzed the impact behavior of bridge piers for the vehicle pier collision accidents and developed a vehicle double pier collision numerical model zhou et al 2019 studied the collision force of reinforced concrete piers under cumulative ship collision by using the combining theoretical deduction with numerical analysis tobias and jochen 2012 studied the particle particle and particle wall collisions during interface resolving numerical simulations of particle laden flows and a collision model for the interface resolved simulation of spherical particles in viscous fluids julian 2016 studied the unsteady hydrodynamic force during the collision of two spheres in a viscous fluid aleksandrowicz 2017 verified the application of the models of crash and collision detection of incompatible vehicles liu et al 2010 analyzed the ship collision and studied the influence of bow shape to the side structure during ship collision xie et al 2018 did the simulation analysis of a multiple vehicle high speed train collision using a simplified model in this paper the collision problem between auvs and a captured rod during the docking process was studied unlike ships and vehicles which avoid collisions as much as possible captured rod docking uses the collision force generated during the collision to complete the underwater docking firstly the docking method and collision are briefly introduced and the captured rod docking method and its mechanical characteristics are analyzed then the collision numerical simulation between remus100 and the captured rod is carried out and the mechanical properties of remus100 gradually approaching the captured rod and colliding were analyzed finally the portable auv was tested for collision at different velocities the above work has important guidance for in depth research and engineering design of the captured rod docking system 2 captured rod docking and its mechanical properties captured rod docking requires the auv to have a mechanism capable of capturing a target such as a cable or a rod to complete the docking process advantages include its ability to accommodate 360 all round docking a strong anti flow field and magnetic field interference capabilities and the ability to communicate with the water surface system in addition the success rate of this docking method is high and the structure of the docking device is relatively simple in addition to the advantages noted above this docking mode also can be applied to subsea base stations when a usv or submarine uses this method to independently recycle auvs the schematic diagram is as shown in fig 3 we know that if the recovery process is transferred from the surface to underwater it can effectively reduce the influence of the surface wave make the recycling process easier decrease the labor intensity improve the level of automation and realize unmanned operation captured rod docking technology is very similar to boom aerial refueling technology for boom aerial refueling success primarily depends on smooth docking between the probe and the drogue the main parameters constraining the success of docking are the initial relative velocity the pitch angle of the boom and the relative offset compared to the velocity of an aircraft an auv s velocity is very slow especially during underwater docking for captured rod docking the front section of the auv is usually equipped with a v shaped capture device within a certain horizontal offset auv can be in contact with the captured rod and the captured rod s position is usually vertically downward therefore the key factor of captured rod docking is the initial relative velocity and whether the collision force generated at this velocity can open the capture mechanism and damage the auv or docking device during movement the captured rod will face interference from its own drag and external factors and this will inevitably cause certain torque on the usv or submarine however compared with the usv and submarine the captured rod is small so its influence on the usv or submarine can be ignored in the following we analyze the mechanical characteristics of the captured rod itself during the docking process the captured rod has two force statuses collision and no collision before collision a captured rod moves at a fixed velocity under the action of the moving platform and is only under the action of its own drag which can be regarded as a uniform load at this time the shear force and bending moment on the captured rod is shown in fig 4 a when an auv collides with the captured rod the captured rod will be affected by the collision force which can be regarded as a concentrated force and the acting point of the concentrated force is the collision position of auv with the captured rod the shear force and bending moment on the captured rod at this moment is shown in fig 4 b note l is the total length of the captured rod which is constant ɑ is the distance from the collision point to the top of the captured rod which is a variable and f is the collision force 3 simulation in recent years due to the rapid development of computer technology and computational fluid dynamics cfd theory cfd technology has been increasingly used for the research of various types of hydrodynamic performance metrics hu 2013 jagadeesh et al 2009 compared with traditional calculation methods cfd technology can not only obtain the hydrodynamic value of the underwater object efficiently and inexpensively it can also obtain flow details in the flow field star ccm stoll and aviation 2015 is used to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the docking process and the collision problem in the current research in the simulations the underwater vehicle used is the remus100 remus100 is an autonomous underwater vehicle made by the woods hole oceanographic institution and designed by their oceanographic systems lab osl due to the captured rod docking method some changes to remus100 needed to be made a v shaped device was added at the front of a remus100 as shown in fig 5 because of the dimensions of the remus100 the diameter of the captured rod was initially set to 50 mm in order to verify the accuracy of the cfd simulation calculation a static and dynamic simulation verification of the remus100 was carried out the simulation parameter settings and results are shown in table 1 the simulation errors of static and dynamic verification are both within 5 which meets the engineering application accuracy requirements it also indicates that the simulation parameter settings and the grid setting are reasonable therefore the same parameter and grid settings are adopted in the subsequent numerical simulation as shown in fig 6 in order to make the simulation data have certain contrast with the test data the mass of remus100 is set to 96 kg in the numerical simulation process 3 1 the captured rod s wake karman vortex under certain conditions when the constant flow flows around certain objects double row vortices with opposite directions of rotation and regular alignment will periodically fall off from both sides of the object at the beginning the movements of two columns of vortices go forward and then they interfere with each other attract each other and the interference becomes larger and larger eventually forming a nonlinear vortex known as a karman vortex a karman vortex is a phenomenon studied in viscous incompressible fluid dynamics many people believe that a karman vortex is only produced when fluid flows around a cylinder in actuality as long as the boundary layer is detached a karman vortex phenomenon may appear karman vortices are typically generated when fluid flows around tall chimneys high rise buildings wires oil pipes and heat exchanger tubes finnemore 2013 when the captured rod moves at 0 15 m s or the velocity of the fluid flow is 0 15 m s the tail flow field of the captured rod is shown in fig 7 the karmen vortex can be clearly seen during the underwater docking process when an auv is sailing directly behind the captured rod the captured rod s wake will inevitably affect the auv s dynamic characteristics the captured rod s wake has a certain relationship with the captured rod s diameter 3 2 the effect of a captured rod on a remus100 under dynamic docking conditions before analyzing the dynamic docking process we first compare the mechanical properties of a remus100 with and without the v shaped device as shown in fig 8 regardless of whether the remus100 has the v shaped device its drag increases as velocity increases which is consistent with the hydrodynamic theory further when the remus100 is fitted with a v shaped device its drag is greater than a remus100 without one as the velocity increases the drag of the remus100 with the v shaped device increases more obviously when the remus100 s equipped with the device hits a velocity greater than 1 m s its drag will increase by 70 therefore it is recommended that the v shaped device be designed to be foldable and only open during the underwater docking process dynamic docking occurs when the moving platform usv or submarine sails at a certain velocity while extending the captured rod and the auv chases the moving platform at a higher velocity obviously when the auv is close to the captured rod the captured rod s wake will affect its hydrodynamic characteristics the following is an analysis of the hydrodynamic numerical simulation of remus100 fitted with an v shaped device approaching the captured rod at different velocities 0 15 m s 0 25 m s 0 35 m s under different current s velocities fig 9 shows the hydrodynamic characteristic curve of a remus100 when it approaches the captured rod at 0 35 m s from a position 5 m away in the case of different currents when the current s velocity is 0 5 m s the drag change of the remus100 is not obvious before 12 5s after 12 5s the drag fluctuates strongly and the amplitude of the fluctuation is about 20 5 of the remus100 s drag at this time the remus100 is about 0 6m away from the captured rod the lateral and vertical forces change very little before 5s after 5s the lateral and vertical forces begin to fluctuate strongly and within the range of 0 07n 0 05n and 0 07n 0 04n respectively as shown in fig 9 a at this time the remus100 is about 2 1 m away from the captured rod when the current s velocity is 1 m s the drag change of the remus100 is similar to that when the current s velocity is 0 5 m s the drag change of the remus100 is also not obvious before 12 5s after 12 5s the drag begins to fluctuate strongly the amplitude of the fluctuation is about 27 5 at this time the remus100 is also about 0 6m away from the captured rod the lateral and vertical forces change very little between 0 and 3s after 3s the lateral and vertical forces begin to fluctuate within the range of 0 3n 0 1n and 0 2n 0 3n respectively as shown in fig 9 b at this time the remus100 is about 4m away from the captured rod through analysis and comparison when the remus100 gradually approaches the captured rod and the distance between them is below a certain value the captured rod s wake will influence the remus100 s drag the degree of influence is positively correlated with the current s velocity when the captured rod s wake has a strong influence on the remus100 s drag the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod is irrelevant to the current s velocity however for the lateral force and vertical force they are more susceptible to the captured rod s wake which means that the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces are affected by the captured rod s wake earlier than remus100 s drag in addition unlike the relationship between the remus100 s drag and the current s velocity when the captured rod s wake has a strong influence on the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod is related to the current s velocity the greater the current s velocity the greater the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod when the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces are strongly affected by the captured rod s wake for example when the current s velocity is 0 5 m s the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces will be strongly affected by the captured rod s wake if the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod is less than 2 1m when the current s velocity is 1 m s the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces will be strongly affected by the captured rod s wake if the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod is less than 4m at the same current s velocity when the remus100 approaches the captured rod at other velocities the effect of the captured rod on the remus100 s dynamics is similar fig 10 is the vorticity and pressure cloud diagram of a remus100 approaching the captured rod at 0 35 m s when the current s velocity is 0 5 m s and 1 m s it is demonstrated that when the remus100 is far away from the captured rod the captured rod s wake does not affect the remus100 s hydrodynamic characteristic which also verifies the correctness of fig 9 by comparing fig 10 a and 10 b when the current s velocity increases the area of the captured rod s wake becomes larger therefore in order to reduce the impact of the captured rod s wake on the remus100 and improve the success rate during the dynamic underwater docking process the docking device should be dragged as slowly as possible by the moving platform 3 3 numerical simulation of collision process between the remus100 and the captured rod independent of underwater docking method an auv usually collides with the docking device during underwater docking shi et al 2015 and the captured rod docking method is no exception the following is an analysis of the collision process between remus100 and the captured rod under different working conditions since the front end of auv and the capture rod are made of plexiglass during the test the properties of the contact surface material are set to the properties of plexiglass in the collision simulation process fig 11 shows the variation of the remus100 s force when remus 100 collides with the captured rod under the current of 0 5 m s before the collision remus100 s drag is about 2 3n and the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces are 0n when the collision occurs remus100 s force in the x direction will abruptly change at the same time remus100 s lateral and vertical forces also undergo large fluctuations the collision process takes milliseconds after the collision is completed remus100 s force in the x direction becomes 2n and the fluctuation range of the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces will also be significantly reduced when the remus100 collides with the captured rod at 0 35 m s remus100 s maximum force in the x direction is 483n the remus100 s lateral and vertical force fluctuation ranges are 4n 10n and 64n 60n respectively when the remus100 collides with the captured rod at other velocities remus100 s forces are as shown in table 2 it can be found that as the velocity increases remus100 s forces in xyz directions also increases and the forces has a certain linear relationship with the remus100 s velocity in order to prevent collision damage to the captured rod or the v shape device the auv should complete the docking process at a low velocity fig 12 is a pressure cloud diagram of a remus100 colliding with the captured rod at 0 35 m s before the collision remus100 sails forward and gradually closes to the captured rod according to the theory of fluid mechanics the pressure of the flow field near remus100 s front is the largest as shown in fig 12 a when remus100 collides with the captured rod the remus100 s velocity becomes 0 m s therefore the pressure at remus100 s front end will drop immediately as shown in fig 12 b after the collision remus100 will retreat under the action of the collision force therefore high pressure will appear at the end of remus100 and the pressure at remus100 s front end will decrease as shown in fig 12 c 4 deformation and collision analysis from section 2 and section 3 we know that the captured rod is under the influence of hydrodynamic forces during the underwater docking process under the combined effect of external factors the captured rod will be deformed the law of deflection of each point on the captured rod with position and time is called deflection function or displacement function ω z jones 1971 yang et al 2011 meng et al 2018 in addition during the docking process the remus100 and the captured rod will also have a certain collision the deformation of the captured rod and the collision between a remus100 and the captured rod are analyzed below 4 1 deflection analysis of the captured rod fig 13 a shows the deformation diagram during static docking with no current flow only considering the collision force of a remus100 and the captured rod fig 13 b shows the captured rod s deformation diagram when there is current or dynamic docking the difference between these two conditions is that the captured rod needs to consider its own drag during dynamic docking during the analysis we can treat the captured rod as a cantilever beam one end of the captured rod is fixed to the moving platform or docking station and the other end is in a free cantilever state according to the cantilever deflection formula in the material mechanics we can obtain 1 e i y ϖ z m z where ei y is the bending stiffness of the captured rod m z is the bending moment of captured rod i y is the moment of inertia of the cross section to the y axis z is the distance from one point to the upper end of captured rod from the above analysis we can see that the captured rod s drag is due to the uniform load the collision force is the concentrated force and the deflection produced by the two forces can be superimposed when considering the captured rod s drag alone the bending moment is 2 m z 1 2 q l z 2 where q is the drag of unit length of the captured rod and l is the captured rod s length the constraints are as follows z 0 w z 0 w z 0 we can get 3 w 1 z q z 2 24 e i y z 2 4 l z 6 l 2 when considering the collision force f on the captured rod alone the similar method is used and the captured rod s deflection is 4 w 2 z f z 2 6 e i y 3 l z 0 z l f z 2 6 e i y 3 z l l z l applying the principle of superposition the total deflection of the captured rod is 5 w z z 2 24 e i y q z 2 4 q l z 6 q l 2 12 f l 4 f z 0 z l z 2 24 e i y q z 2 4 q l z 6 q l 2 12 f z 4 f l l z l the normal bending stress and shear stress formulae of the captured rod are as follows 6 σ x m x i y l z 2 f q l z 2 w y 0 z l q l z 2 2 w y l z l 7 τ x f q l z s y b i y 0 z l q l z s y b i y l z l equation 6 illustrates that the normal stress is not only related to m but also related to x i y that is to the shape and size of the section w y i y x is the flexural modulus for a circular cross section with diameter d then w y π d 3 32 in equation 7 s y is the static moment of the cross section area outside the x position of the captured rod to the neutral axis b is the width of cross section at x position for a circular cross section the maximum shear stress is on the neutral axis according to the captured rod s normal stress formula the captured rod can be checked and calculated 4 2 collision analysis the phenomenon of collision is very common in real life for example in basketball table tennis and nailing collision theory studies the interaction between objects for the sake of research people usually simplify the models involved in collision and abstract the typical collision types which can be divided into curved surface curved surface collision curved surface flat plane collision and flat plane flat plane collision the front end of a remus100 is a flat plane and the captured rod s surface is curved surface so the collision model of a remus100 and the captured rod can be abstracted into a curved surface flat plane collision model the following is the theoretical analysis of the collision problem between the remus100 and the captured rod assuming that the remus100 with a velocity v 1 collides with the captured rod with a velocity of v 2 and rebounds the remus100 s mass is m 1 and since the captured rod is fixed with the usv the total mass of the captured rod and usv is set to m 2 as shown in fig 14 4 2 1 the remus100 s velocity after collision according to the momentum theorem the motion state of the object before and after the collision can be analyzed the formula is as follows 8 m v m v 0 t f d t δ p where f collision force approximate is mean value δt collision duration m object s mass v instantaneous velocity before the collision v instantaneous velocity after the collision the instantaneous velocity of the object after collision can be calculated by the recovery coefficient method and the recovery coefficient e of common materials is shown in table 3 the formula is as follows huang 2018 9 e v u v u where v u are the instantaneous velocity of the remus100 and usv before the collision respectively and v u are the instantaneous velocity of the remus100 and usv after the collision respectively for the research content of this paper during static docking the velocity of the captured rod before and after the collision is always 0 m s because the remus100 s mass can be neglected compared with the total mass of the usv and the captured rod we assume that after the collision the velocity change of the usv and the captured rod is 0 m s for dynamic docking in fact the calculation process for dynamic docking and static docking are basically the same therefore static docking is taken as an example to analyze the collision process of a remus100 and a captured rod when the remus100 sails at 0 35 m s after the collision the remus100 s velocity can be calculated by equation 9 and the material recovery coefficient e v e v 0 35 0 35 0 1225 m s 4 2 2 collision force calculation the collision objects are rigid and the collision process is completed in an instant so hertz theory combined with momentum can be used to calculate and analyze the collision force in the docking process 10 f δ t m v m v δ p when the collision duration δt is obtained the collision force during the docking process can be calculated and the collision duration δt can be calculated according to the theory of elastic mechanics generally the collision process can be divided into two phases of compression and recovery the collision force f gradually increases from zero to the maximum value and then gradually decreases to zero obviously f is related to the compression distance δ when the two cylinders whose axes are parallel collide with each other and the width value of the contact surface is s their radii elastic modulus and poisson ratio are r1 e1 u1 and r2 e2 u2 the contacting stress is as follows zhang et al 2000 11 σ f π s 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 μ 1 2 e 1 1 μ 2 2 e 2 δ σ e 1 σ e 2 from equation 11 we get 12 f c δ 2 where c e 1 e 2 π s r 1 r 2 e 1 1 μ 2 2 e 2 1 μ 1 2 e 1 e 2 2 r 1 r 2 after collision the collision force f will cause the remus100 to decelerate at this time the velocities of the two objects are v 1 and v 2 respectively and the differential equation of motion is established 13 m 1 d v 1 d t f m 2 d v 2 d t f the relative velocity of the two objects should be equal to the shortening speed of the center distance between the two objects 14 v 1 v 2 d δ d t differentiating equation 14 and combining it with equation 13 yields 15 d 2 δ d t 2 d v 1 d t d v 2 d t f m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 f m where m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 m substituting equation 12 into equation 15 yields 16 d 2 δ d t 2 c δ 2 m multiply both sides of equation 16 by dδ to get 17 1 2 d d δ d t 2 c δ 2 m d δ at the beginning of the collision the compression distance is zero and the relative velocity is v r0 when the compression phase is to a certain compression distance δ the relative velocity is v r dδ dt and we integrate equation 17 we get 18 1 2 d δ d t 2 v r 0 2 c δ 3 3 m at the end of compression the relative speed is zero and the maximum compression distance δ max can be calculated by equation 18 δ max 3 m 2 c v r 0 2 1 3 integrate equation 18 to get the

model into equation 25 the collision duration δt can be obtained and then the collision force f can be solved by combining equation 10 5 test in order to verify the accuracy of numerical simulation and the validity of theoretical analysis we conducted a simple collision test on a portable auv the parameters of the portable auv are shown in table 4 in order to simulate the collision between the plane and the captured rod we installed a plexiglass plate measuring 150 mm 150 mm at the front end of the auv and a plexiglass cylinder with a radius of 25 mm on the sensor the sensor used is ati nano25 the force range in the x and y directions is 250n 250n and the force range in the z direction is 1000n 1000n we use the z direction during the test we used the z direction we fixed the sensor on the aluminum alloy frame and adjusted the height of the sensor so that the plexiglass plate hits the plexiglass cylinder on the sensor as shown in fig 15 since auv s velocity is usually small during underwater recycling in addition in order to protect the sensor the collision speed should not be too large therefore we tested the collision force when auv s velocities are 0 15 m s 0 25 m s and 0 35 m s respectively the test results are shown in fig 16 the test results show that when collision velocities are 0 15 m s 0 25 m s and 0 35 m s the maximum collision force is 279n 509n 790n and the collision time is 0 0795s 0 0625s and 0 056s respectively the collision force increases as auv s velocity increases and the collision time decreases as the collision velocity increases by bringing the relevant parameters into equation 10 and equation 22 we can obtain that when the collision velocity is 0 15 m s 0 25 m s and 0 35 m s the theoretical collision time is 0 108s 0 09s 0 082s and the average collision force is 201n 397n and 622n respectively the trapz function in matlab is used to analyze the momentum change of the collision process from the data obtained from the test that is the area of the collision force curve in the collision time and then the relevant parameters are substituted into the equation 10 to obtain the average collision force in the real collision test the average collision forces are calculated to be 136n 313n and 631n when the collision velocity is 0 15 m s 0 25 m s and 0 35 m s respectively although there is a certain gap between the theoretical calculation and the experimental data it can meet the engineering requirements and provide some guidance for the analysis of the collision force in the underwater docking process 6 conclusion in this paper captured rod mechanical properties and its docking method are analyzed the hydrodynamic characteristics of a remus100 docking with a captured rod and the collision process with the captured rod under different working conditions are numerically simulated finally we performed a collision test verification using a portable auv through the simulations and test it is found that 1 karman vortices will occur behind the capture rod and when the remus100 gradually approaches the captured rod and the distance between them is less than a certain value the captured rod s wake will have an influence on the remus100 s drag and the degree of influence is positively correlated with the current s velocity when the captured rod s wake has a strong influence on the remus100 s drag the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod is basically irrelevant to the current s velocity 2 a remus100 s lateral and vertical forces are more susceptible to the captured rod s wake and they are affected by the captured rod s wake earlier than remus100 s drag when the captured rod s wake just has a strong influence on the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod is related to the current s velocity the greater the current s velocity the greater the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod when the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces are strongly affected by the captured rod s wake 3 when the collision occurs the collision force will abruptly change and remus100 s lateral and vertical forces also have a large fluctuation for example when the remus100 s velocity is 0 5 m s the collision force is 30247n the lateral and vertical force fluctuation ranges of the remus100 are 2 5n 2 8n 11n 11n respectively after the collision is completed the collision force becomes 0n and the lateral and vertical force fluctuation ranges of the remus100 will also be significantly reduced 4 the collision force increases as the collision velocity increases and the collision time gradually decreases as the collision velocity increases the collision process is very short a matter of milliseconds acknowledgments grateful acknowledgement

22351,underwater docking is currently a key technology for supplementing energy and self recovery of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs three types of docking methods are introduced first the captured rod docking method is selected for this research effort and its mechanical properties are analyzed a remus100 and a captured rod with a radius of 50 mm are used to simulate the dynamic underwater docking and collision processes the theoretical model analysis of deformation and collision of the captured rod is carried out finally a portable auv is tested for collisions under different conditions through simulation and test we found that there is a karman vortex behind the captured rod when remus100 approaches the captured rod and the distance between them is less than a certain value the captured rod s wake will have an influence on the forces on the remus100 the degree of influence positively correlates with the current s velocity the lateral and vertical forces on the remus100 are more susceptible to the captured rod s wake and are affected by the captured rod s wake earlier the collision force increases as the collision velocity increases but the collision time is the opposite we analyze and compare the results obtained by simulations tests and theoretical model keywords captured rod underwater docking computational fluid dynamics cfd hydrodynamics deformation and collision 1 introduction auvs are underwater robots that operate on their own and carry their own energy auvs have many potential scientific and military applications and are the primary focus for the development of underwater robots nouri et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2013 nicholson and healey 2008 in order to meet increasingly demanding application requirements auv s technological advancements must consider improvements in underwater operation time work efficiency and endurance yan and wu 2007 when an auv completes one task it usually needs to be sent to the surface support platform to be recycled to replenish energy transfer data and download new mission tasks when working in the deep sea it takes a long time to launch and recover an auv if the sea conditions in the working area are poor there are increased risks during the recycling process in order to solve these problems scientists have developed various underwater docking systems jantapremjit and wilson 2007 stokey et al 2001 which enable an auv to actively dock with underwater stationary platform or mobile platform target to complete the recycling process therefore underwater docking technology could greatly enhance the long term and long distance working capabilities of an auv underwater docking technology is a research frontier and a key technology for auvs it is also the basis for studying subsea base stations and deep sea long term observational systems for the subsea base stations and deep sea long term observational systems the auv is the physical connection between submarine observational system and a surface support platform for this underwater system docking technology is very important scholars have designed different underwater docking methods which can be roughly divided into three categories zhang 2013 yang and gu 2013 wu et al 2014 captured docking guided docking and seated docking as shown in fig 1 each docking method has its own advantages and disadvantages meng et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 fukasawa et al 2003 yu et al 1996 of these methods the most commonly used are the first two currently with the rapid development of unmanned mobile platforms zaghi et al 2016 peng et al 2017 yan et al 2010 park et al 2017 there is growing interest for mutual cooperation and support between unmanned platforms this has greatly promoted the emergence of autonomous launch and recovery auv technology of the unmanned surface vehicle usv sarda 2016 brizzolara and chryssostomidis 2012 generally the recovery process is more difficult than the launch process sarda and dhanak 2016 sarda et al 2014 used a catamaran usv to recover a remus100 auv through a thin line with a depressor wing from a winch on the usv advanced technology research corporation made two schemes both of which are towed from a single boat one of them features a guided style docking recovery form which is mainly for torpedo shaped auvs the other is a captured style docking recovery form mainly for auvs with a v type capture mechanism the eca group just developed a usv with a self recovering auv system which is a kind of underwater towing recycling method and can complete the recycling of the auv towed sonar and other equipment much like the eca group s recycling method odim brooke ocean used a towing system mounted on the a frame to complete the recovery of auvs circle 2012 recycled an auv using a captured recovery device and recently designed a slotted usv for recycling auvs however successful underwater docking is a prerequisite for the autonomous recovery process underwater docking can also provide technical support for future military operation and unmanned underwater warfare platform therefore in recent years underwater docking technology especially dynamic methods has attracted global attention in the underwater docking process no matter which underwater docking method is used the auv and the docking device will collide how to effectively use or avoid collisions is of great significance for studying underwater docking or self recovery of auvs collision is usually the phenomenon of two objects moving relative to each other touching and rapidly changing their motion state it can be a collision of macroscopic objects or it can be a collision between microscopic particles such as atoms nuclei and subatomic particles from an energy point of view collisions can be divided into full elastic collisions completely inelastic collisions and partially inelastic collisions most collision processes are partially inelastic collisions at present many scholars are studying the collision problem but most of them analyze the collision between the ship and the bridge a car and a pier or a car and a car and a collision between balls as shown in fig 2 zhou et al 2017 analyzed the impact behavior of bridge piers for the vehicle pier collision accidents and developed a vehicle double pier collision numerical model zhou et al 2019 studied the collision force of reinforced concrete piers under cumulative ship collision by using the combining theoretical deduction with numerical analysis tobias and jochen 2012 studied the particle particle and particle wall collisions during interface resolving numerical simulations of particle laden flows and a collision model for the interface resolved simulation of spherical particles in viscous fluids julian 2016 studied the unsteady hydrodynamic force during the collision of two spheres in a viscous fluid aleksandrowicz 2017 verified the application of the models of crash and collision detection of incompatible vehicles liu et al 2010 analyzed the ship collision and studied the influence of bow shape to the side structure during ship collision xie et al 2018 did the simulation analysis of a multiple vehicle high speed train collision using a simplified model in this paper the collision problem between auvs and a captured rod during the docking process was studied unlike ships and vehicles which avoid collisions as much as possible captured rod docking uses the collision force generated during the collision to complete the underwater docking firstly the docking method and collision are briefly introduced and the captured rod docking method and its mechanical characteristics are analyzed then the collision numerical simulation between remus100 and the captured rod is carried out and the mechanical properties of remus100 gradually approaching the captured rod and colliding were analyzed finally the portable auv was tested for collision at different velocities the above work has important guidance for in depth research and engineering design of the captured rod docking system 2 captured rod docking and its mechanical properties captured rod docking requires the auv to have a mechanism capable of capturing a target such as a cable or a rod to complete the docking process advantages include its ability to accommodate 360 all round docking a strong anti flow field and magnetic field interference capabilities and the ability to communicate with the water surface system in addition the success rate of this docking method is high and the structure of the docking device is relatively simple in addition to the advantages noted above this docking mode also can be applied to subsea base stations when a usv or submarine uses this method to independently recycle auvs the schematic diagram is as shown in fig 3 we know that if the recovery process is transferred from the surface to underwater it can effectively reduce the influence of the surface wave make the recycling process easier decrease the labor intensity improve the level of automation and realize unmanned operation captured rod docking technology is very similar to boom aerial refueling technology for boom aerial refueling success primarily depends on smooth docking between the probe and the drogue the main parameters constraining the success of docking are the initial relative velocity the pitch angle of the boom and the relative offset compared to the velocity of an aircraft an auv s velocity is very slow especially during underwater docking for captured rod docking the front section of the auv is usually equipped with a v shaped capture device within a certain horizontal offset auv can be in contact with the captured rod and the captured rod s position is usually vertically downward therefore the key factor of captured rod docking is the initial relative velocity and whether the collision force generated at this velocity can open the capture mechanism and damage the auv or docking device during movement the captured rod will face interference from its own drag and external factors and this will inevitably cause certain torque on the usv or submarine however compared with the usv and submarine the captured rod is small so its influence on the usv or submarine can be ignored in the following we analyze the mechanical characteristics of the captured rod itself during the docking process the captured rod has two force statuses collision and no collision before collision a captured rod moves at a fixed velocity under the action of the moving platform and is only under the action of its own drag which can be regarded as a uniform load at this time the shear force and bending moment on the captured rod is shown in fig 4 a when an auv collides with the captured rod the captured rod will be affected by the collision force which can be regarded as a concentrated force and the acting point of the concentrated force is the collision position of auv with the captured rod the shear force and bending moment on the captured rod at this moment is shown in fig 4 b note l is the total length of the captured rod which is constant ɑ is the distance from the collision point to the top of the captured rod which is a variable and f is the collision force 3 simulation in recent years due to the rapid development of computer technology and computational fluid dynamics cfd theory cfd technology has been increasingly used for the research of various types of hydrodynamic performance metrics hu 2013 jagadeesh et al 2009 compared with traditional calculation methods cfd technology can not only obtain the hydrodynamic value of the underwater object efficiently and inexpensively it can also obtain flow details in the flow field star ccm stoll and aviation 2015 is used to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the docking process and the collision problem in the current research in the simulations the underwater vehicle used is the remus100 remus100 is an autonomous underwater vehicle made by the woods hole oceanographic institution and designed by their oceanographic systems lab osl due to the captured rod docking method some changes to remus100 needed to be made a v shaped device was added at the front of a remus100 as shown in fig 5 because of the dimensions of the remus100 the diameter of the captured rod was initially set to 50 mm in order to verify the accuracy of the cfd simulation calculation a static and dynamic simulation verification of the remus100 was carried out the simulation parameter settings and results are shown in table 1 the simulation errors of static and dynamic verification are both within 5 which meets the engineering application accuracy requirements it also indicates that the simulation parameter settings and the grid setting are reasonable therefore the same parameter and grid settings are adopted in the subsequent numerical simulation as shown in fig 6 in order to make the simulation data have certain contrast with the test data the mass of remus100 is set to 96 kg in the numerical simulation process 3 1 the captured rod s wake karman vortex under certain conditions when the constant flow flows around certain objects double row vortices with opposite directions of rotation and regular alignment will periodically fall off from both sides of the object at the beginning the movements of two columns of vortices go forward and then they interfere with each other attract each other and the interference becomes larger and larger eventually forming a nonlinear vortex known as a karman vortex a karman vortex is a phenomenon studied in viscous incompressible fluid dynamics many people believe that a karman vortex is only produced when fluid flows around a cylinder in actuality as long as the boundary layer is detached a karman vortex phenomenon may appear karman vortices are typically generated when fluid flows around tall chimneys high rise buildings wires oil pipes and heat exchanger tubes finnemore 2013 when the captured rod moves at 0 15 m s or the velocity of the fluid flow is 0 15 m s the tail flow field of the captured rod is shown in fig 7 the karmen vortex can be clearly seen during the underwater docking process when an auv is sailing directly behind the captured rod the captured rod s wake will inevitably affect the auv s dynamic characteristics the captured rod s wake has a certain relationship with the captured rod s diameter 3 2 the effect of a captured rod on a remus100 under dynamic docking conditions before analyzing the dynamic docking process we first compare the mechanical properties of a remus100 with and without the v shaped device as shown in fig 8 regardless of whether the remus100 has the v shaped device its drag increases as velocity increases which is consistent with the hydrodynamic theory further when the remus100 is fitted with a v shaped device its drag is greater than a remus100 without one as the velocity increases the drag of the remus100 with the v shaped device increases more obviously when the remus100 s equipped with the device hits a velocity greater than 1 m s its drag will increase by 70 therefore it is recommended that the v shaped device be designed to be foldable and only open during the underwater docking process dynamic docking occurs when the moving platform usv or submarine sails at a certain velocity while extending the captured rod and the auv chases the moving platform at a higher velocity obviously when the auv is close to the captured rod the captured rod s wake will affect its hydrodynamic characteristics the following is an analysis of the hydrodynamic numerical simulation of remus100 fitted with an v shaped device approaching the captured rod at different velocities 0 15 m s 0 25 m s 0 35 m s under different current s velocities fig 9 shows the hydrodynamic characteristic curve of a remus100 when it approaches the captured rod at 0 35 m s from a position 5 m away in the case of different currents when the current s velocity is 0 5 m s the drag change of the remus100 is not obvious before 12 5s after 12 5s the drag fluctuates strongly and the amplitude of the fluctuation is about 20 5 of the remus100 s drag at this time the remus100 is about 0 6m away from the captured rod the lateral and vertical forces change very little before 5s after 5s the lateral and vertical forces begin to fluctuate strongly and within the range of 0 07n 0 05n and 0 07n 0 04n respectively as shown in fig 9 a at this time the remus100 is about 2 1 m away from the captured rod when the current s velocity is 1 m s the drag change of the remus100 is similar to that when the current s velocity is 0 5 m s the drag change of the remus100 is also not obvious before 12 5s after 12 5s the drag begins to fluctuate strongly the amplitude of the fluctuation is about 27 5 at this time the remus100 is also about 0 6m away from the captured rod the lateral and vertical forces change very little between 0 and 3s after 3s the lateral and vertical forces begin to fluctuate within the range of 0 3n 0 1n and 0 2n 0 3n respectively as shown in fig 9 b at this time the remus100 is about 4m away from the captured rod through analysis and comparison when the remus100 gradually approaches the captured rod and the distance between them is below a certain value the captured rod s wake will influence the remus100 s drag the degree of influence is positively correlated with the current s velocity when the captured rod s wake has a strong influence on the remus100 s drag the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod is irrelevant to the current s velocity however for the lateral force and vertical force they are more susceptible to the captured rod s wake which means that the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces are affected by the captured rod s wake earlier than remus100 s drag in addition unlike the relationship between the remus100 s drag and the current s velocity when the captured rod s wake has a strong influence on the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod is related to the current s velocity the greater the current s velocity the greater the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod when the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces are strongly affected by the captured rod s wake for example when the current s velocity is 0 5 m s the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces will be strongly affected by the captured rod s wake if the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod is less than 2 1m when the current s velocity is 1 m s the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces will be strongly affected by the captured rod s wake if the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod is less than 4m at the same current s velocity when the remus100 approaches the captured rod at other velocities the effect of the captured rod on the remus100 s dynamics is similar fig 10 is the vorticity and pressure cloud diagram of a remus100 approaching the captured rod at 0 35 m s when the current s velocity is 0 5 m s and 1 m s it is demonstrated that when the remus100 is far away from the captured rod the captured rod s wake does not affect the remus100 s hydrodynamic characteristic which also verifies the correctness of fig 9 by comparing fig 10 a and 10 b when the current s velocity increases the area of the captured rod s wake becomes larger therefore in order to reduce the impact of the captured rod s wake on the remus100 and improve the success rate during the dynamic underwater docking process the docking device should be dragged as slowly as possible by the moving platform 3 3 numerical simulation of collision process between the remus100 and the captured rod independent of underwater docking method an auv usually collides with the docking device during underwater docking shi et al 2015 and the captured rod docking method is no exception the following is an analysis of the collision process between remus100 and the captured rod under different working conditions since the front end of auv and the capture rod are made of plexiglass during the test the properties of the contact surface material are set to the properties of plexiglass in the collision simulation process fig 11 shows the variation of the remus100 s force when remus 100 collides with the captured rod under the current of 0 5 m s before the collision remus100 s drag is about 2 3n and the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces are 0n when the collision occurs remus100 s force in the x direction will abruptly change at the same time remus100 s lateral and vertical forces also undergo large fluctuations the collision process takes milliseconds after the collision is completed remus100 s force in the x direction becomes 2n and the fluctuation range of the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces will also be significantly reduced when the remus100 collides with the captured rod at 0 35 m s remus100 s maximum force in the x direction is 483n the remus100 s lateral and vertical force fluctuation ranges are 4n 10n and 64n 60n respectively when the remus100 collides with the captured rod at other velocities remus100 s forces are as shown in table 2 it can be found that as the velocity increases remus100 s forces in xyz directions also increases and the forces has a certain linear relationship with the remus100 s velocity in order to prevent collision damage to the captured rod or the v shape device the auv should complete the docking process at a low velocity fig 12 is a pressure cloud diagram of a remus100 colliding with the captured rod at 0 35 m s before the collision remus100 sails forward and gradually closes to the captured rod according to the theory of fluid mechanics the pressure of the flow field near remus100 s front is the largest as shown in fig 12 a when remus100 collides with the captured rod the remus100 s velocity becomes 0 m s therefore the pressure at remus100 s front end will drop immediately as shown in fig 12 b after the collision remus100 will retreat under the action of the collision force therefore high pressure will appear at the end of remus100 and the pressure at remus100 s front end will decrease as shown in fig 12 c 4 deformation and collision analysis from section 2 and section 3 we know that the captured rod is under the influence of hydrodynamic forces during the underwater docking process under the combined effect of external factors the captured rod will be deformed the law of deflection of each point on the captured rod with position and time is called deflection function or displacement function ω z jones 1971 yang et al 2011 meng et al 2018 in addition during the docking process the remus100 and the captured rod will also have a certain collision the deformation of the captured rod and the collision between a remus100 and the captured rod are analyzed below 4 1 deflection analysis of the captured rod fig 13 a shows the deformation diagram during static docking with no current flow only considering the collision force of a remus100 and the captured rod fig 13 b shows the captured rod s deformation diagram when there is current or dynamic docking the difference between these two conditions is that the captured rod needs to consider its own drag during dynamic docking during the analysis we can treat the captured rod as a cantilever beam one end of the captured rod is fixed to the moving platform or docking station and the other end is in a free cantilever state according to the cantilever deflection formula in the material mechanics we can obtain 1 e i y ϖ z m z where ei y is the bending stiffness of the captured rod m z is the bending moment of captured rod i y is the moment of inertia of the cross section to the y axis z is the distance from one point to the upper end of captured rod from the above analysis we can see that the captured rod s drag is due to the uniform load the collision force is the concentrated force and the deflection produced by the two forces can be superimposed when considering the captured rod s drag alone the bending moment is 2 m z 1 2 q l z 2 where q is the drag of unit length of the captured rod and l is the captured rod s length the constraints are as follows z 0 w z 0 w z 0 we can get 3 w 1 z q z 2 24 e i y z 2 4 l z 6 l 2 when considering the collision force f on the captured rod alone the similar method is used and the captured rod s deflection is 4 w 2 z f z 2 6 e i y 3 l z 0 z l f z 2 6 e i y 3 z l l z l applying the principle of superposition the total deflection of the captured rod is 5 w z z 2 24 e i y q z 2 4 q l z 6 q l 2 12 f l 4 f z 0 z l z 2 24 e i y q z 2 4 q l z 6 q l 2 12 f z 4 f l l z l the normal bending stress and shear stress formulae of the captured rod are as follows 6 σ x m x i y l z 2 f q l z 2 w y 0 z l q l z 2 2 w y l z l 7 τ x f q l z s y b i y 0 z l q l z s y b i y l z l equation 6 illustrates that the normal stress is not only related to m but also related to x i y that is to the shape and size of the section w y i y x is the flexural modulus for a circular cross section with diameter d then w y π d 3 32 in equation 7 s y is the static moment of the cross section area outside the x position of the captured rod to the neutral axis b is the width of cross section at x position for a circular cross section the maximum shear stress is on the neutral axis according to the captured rod s normal stress formula the captured rod can be checked and calculated 4 2 collision analysis the phenomenon of collision is very common in real life for example in basketball table tennis and nailing collision theory studies the interaction between objects for the sake of research people usually simplify the models involved in collision and abstract the typical collision types which can be divided into curved surface curved surface collision curved surface flat plane collision and flat plane flat plane collision the front end of a remus100 is a flat plane and the captured rod s surface is curved surface so the collision model of a remus100 and the captured rod can be abstracted into a curved surface flat plane collision model the following is the theoretical analysis of the collision problem between the remus100 and the captured rod assuming that the remus100 with a velocity v 1 collides with the captured rod with a velocity of v 2 and rebounds the remus100 s mass is m 1 and since the captured rod is fixed with the usv the total mass of the captured rod and usv is set to m 2 as shown in fig 14 4 2 1 the remus100 s velocity after collision according to the momentum theorem the motion state of the object before and after the collision can be analyzed the formula is as follows 8 m v m v 0 t f d t δ p where f collision force approximate is mean value δt collision duration m object s mass v instantaneous velocity before the collision v instantaneous velocity after the collision the instantaneous velocity of the object after collision can be calculated by the recovery coefficient method and the recovery coefficient e of common materials is shown in table 3 the formula is as follows huang 2018 9 e v u v u where v u are the instantaneous velocity of the remus100 and usv before the collision respectively and v u are the instantaneous velocity of the remus100 and usv after the collision respectively for the research content of this paper during static docking the velocity of the captured rod before and after the collision is always 0 m s because the remus100 s mass can be neglected compared with the total mass of the usv and the captured rod we assume that after the collision the velocity change of the usv and the captured rod is 0 m s for dynamic docking in fact the calculation process for dynamic docking and static docking are basically the same therefore static docking is taken as an example to analyze the collision process of a remus100 and a captured rod when the remus100 sails at 0 35 m s after the collision the remus100 s velocity can be calculated by equation 9 and the material recovery coefficient e v e v 0 35 0 35 0 1225 m s 4 2 2 collision force calculation the collision objects are rigid and the collision process is completed in an instant so hertz theory combined with momentum can be used to calculate and analyze the collision force in the docking process 10 f δ t m v m v δ p when the collision duration δt is obtained the collision force during the docking process can be calculated and the collision duration δt can be calculated according to the theory of elastic mechanics generally the collision process can be divided into two phases of compression and recovery the collision force f gradually increases from zero to the maximum value and then gradually decreases to zero obviously f is related to the compression distance δ when the two cylinders whose axes are parallel collide with each other and the width value of the contact surface is s their radii elastic modulus and poisson ratio are r1 e1 u1 and r2 e2 u2 the contacting stress is as follows zhang et al 2000 11 σ f π s 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 μ 1 2 e 1 1 μ 2 2 e 2 δ σ e 1 σ e 2 from equation 11 we get 12 f c δ 2 where c e 1 e 2 π s r 1 r 2 e 1 1 μ 2 2 e 2 1 μ 1 2 e 1 e 2 2 r 1 r 2 after collision the collision force f will cause the remus100 to decelerate at this time the velocities of the two objects are v 1 and v 2 respectively and the differential equation of motion is established 13 m 1 d v 1 d t f m 2 d v 2 d t f the relative velocity of the two objects should be equal to the shortening speed of the center distance between the two objects 14 v 1 v 2 d δ d t differentiating equation 14 and combining it with equation 13 yields 15 d 2 δ d t 2 d v 1 d t d v 2 d t f m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 f m where m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 m substituting equation 12 into equation 15 yields 16 d 2 δ d t 2 c δ 2 m multiply both sides of equation 16 by dδ to get 17 1 2 d d δ d t 2 c δ 2 m d δ at the beginning of the collision the compression distance is zero and the relative velocity is v r0 when the compression phase is to a certain compression distance δ the relative velocity is v r dδ dt and we integrate equation 17 we get 18 1 2 d δ d t 2 v r 0 2 c δ 3 3 m at the end of compression the relative speed is zero and the maximum compression distance δ max can be calculated by equation 18 δ max 3 m 2 c v r 0 2 1 3 integrate equation 18 to get the

model into equation 25 the collision duration δt can be obtained and then the collision force f can be solved by combining equation 10 5 test in order to verify the accuracy of numerical simulation and the validity of theoretical analysis we conducted a simple collision test on a portable auv the parameters of the portable auv are shown in table 4 in order to simulate the collision between the plane and the captured rod we installed a plexiglass plate measuring 150 mm 150 mm at the front end of the auv and a plexiglass cylinder with a radius of 25 mm on the sensor the sensor used is ati nano25 the force range in the x and y directions is 250n 250n and the force range in the z direction is 1000n 1000n we use the z direction during the test we used the z direction we fixed the sensor on the aluminum alloy frame and adjusted the height of the sensor so that the plexiglass plate hits the plexiglass cylinder on the sensor as shown in fig 15 since auv s velocity is usually small during underwater recycling in addition in order to protect the sensor the collision speed should not be too large therefore we tested the collision force when auv s velocities are 0 15 m s 0 25 m s and 0 35 m s respectively the test results are shown in fig 16 the test results show that when collision velocities are 0 15 m s 0 25 m s and 0 35 m s the maximum collision force is 279n 509n 790n and the collision time is 0 0795s 0 0625s and 0 056s respectively the collision force increases as auv s velocity increases and the collision time decreases as the collision velocity increases by bringing the relevant parameters into equation 10 and equation 22 we can obtain that when the collision velocity is 0 15 m s 0 25 m s and 0 35 m s the theoretical collision time is 0 108s 0 09s 0 082s and the average collision force is 201n 397n and 622n respectively the trapz function in matlab is used to analyze the momentum change of the collision process from the data obtained from the test that is the area of the collision force curve in the collision time and then the relevant parameters are substituted into the equation 10 to obtain the average collision force in the real collision test the average collision forces are calculated to be 136n 313n and 631n when the collision velocity is 0 15 m s 0 25 m s and 0 35 m s respectively although there is a certain gap between the theoretical calculation and the experimental data it can meet the engineering requirements and provide some guidance for the analysis of the collision force in the underwater docking process 6 conclusion in this paper captured rod mechanical properties and its docking method are analyzed the hydrodynamic characteristics of a remus100 docking with a captured rod and the collision process with the captured rod under different working conditions are numerically simulated finally we performed a collision test verification using a portable auv through the simulations and test it is found that 1 karman vortices will occur behind the capture rod and when the remus100 gradually approaches the captured rod and the distance between them is less than a certain value the captured rod s wake will have an influence on the remus100 s drag and the degree of influence is positively correlated with the current s velocity when the captured rod s wake has a strong influence on the remus100 s drag the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod is basically irrelevant to the current s velocity 2 a remus100 s lateral and vertical forces are more susceptible to the captured rod s wake and they are affected by the captured rod s wake earlier than remus100 s drag when the captured rod s wake just has a strong influence on the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod is related to the current s velocity the greater the current s velocity the greater the distance between the remus100 and the captured rod when the remus100 s lateral and vertical forces are strongly affected by the captured rod s wake 3 when the collision occurs the collision force will abruptly change and remus100 s lateral and vertical forces also have a large fluctuation for example when the remus100 s velocity is 0 5 m s the collision force is 30247n the lateral and vertical force fluctuation ranges of the remus100 are 2 5n 2 8n 11n 11n respectively after the collision is completed the collision force becomes 0n and the lateral and vertical force fluctuation ranges of the remus100 will also be significantly reduced 4 the collision force increases as the collision velocity increases and the collision time gradually decreases as the collision velocity increases the collision process is very short a matter of milliseconds acknowledgments grateful acknowledgement

polypropylene and concrete respectively their different stresses internal external and thermal were assessed individually thereafter a combined analysis was carried out using the finite element method

introduction submerged pipes which often operate under extreme temperatures and pressures are becoming increasingly advanced for several reasons including improvements in the materials used in their manufacture these high pressure vessels are also used as separators reactors and heat exchangers sometimes they are built with pressure capacities of up to 350 mpa given these complexities advanced methods for the engineering analyses of such pipes and vessels need to be developed over the last few years several approaches have been established to analyse the behaviour of submerged pipes these approaches used either empirical or analytical based models el megharbel 2010 el megharbel 2016 magda 1996 proposed a two dimensional finite element model to simulate the wave induced hydrodynamic uplift force acting on a submarine pipeline this pipeline was buried in sandy seabed sediments and subjected to continuous loading due to sinusoidal surface waves four different models of the relative compressibility of the two phase system were assumed several problems were used to verify the proposed model and to check its numerical accuracy as influenced by time and space discretisation and by the quadrature rule of numerical integration shou and chen 2018 established numerical models for typical full scale cases of submerged pipelines after calibration with small scale physical models the numerical models were used to conduct a parametric study on the effect of major control factors such as surface loading internal pressure geometry of the pipe and severity of damage on the distributions of stress and displacement of damaged pipelines a finite element analysis of a pressure vessel and pipeline design was conducted by praneeth and rao 2012 furthermore several parameters of multilayer pressure vessels were designed and checked according to the principles specified by the american society of mechanical engineers asme the stresses developed in solid wall and multilayer pressure vessels were analysed using ansys software the theoretical and ansys values were then compared mackerle 2005 reviewed the finite element methods used to analyse pressure vessel structures and components as well pipelines both from theoretical and practical points of view meanwhile bhakhar et al 2015 investigated the effect of dent under fatigue loading in pressurised pipelines they presented a fatigue life assessment review considering failure of steel pipelines and established a benchmark model of fatigue assessment through the stress life strain life and linear elastic fracture mechanics crack propagation methods they revealed that choosing a suitable and accurate method of fatigue assessment was important particularly for quantifying the range to which the fatigue

they conducted a three dimensional finite element analysis with respect to the elastic properties of the materials used the outcomes of their investigation contributed to the design of optimal and sustainable pipes with circular cross sections to determine and estimate the safe wall thickness in the design of subsea pipelines koto et al 2015 utilised subsea pro simulation they considered internal and external pressures as the two parameters necessary in selecting an appropriate wall thickness they also determined the safe zone of the wall thickness based on the burst pressure and revealed that predicting wall thickness using the results of simulation could enable a safe zone of wall thickness to be established at every water depth erkal et al 2010 studied fatigue damage in composite cylinders trials to investigate the optimal angle ply orientations of symmetric shells designed for fatigue burst pressure were conducted and prediction of the service life of close ended composite pressure vessels under alternating loading was attempted moreover the optimal winding angles of composite pressure vessels under fatigue tests were determined and concerns regarding the observation damage process on fatigue life were also revealed this study aimed to investigate the thermal and fatigue stresses in submerged compound pipes which located in the gas field that are afflicted with different environmental and operational issues a series of simulation trials were conducted using ansys apdl software throughout the course of the experiment the following parameters and assumptions were considered in static loading the external pressure was defined as the pressure due to the column of the water head the internal pressure was attributed to the carrier fluid while the thermal stresses were considered to be due to differences between the internal temperature i e of the carried fluid and external temperature i e of sea water the deformation in the x y and z directions von mises stresses and thermal distribution of each previous event and the combined loading were measured 2 benchmarking benchmarking is very important in verifying and comparing the theoretical and ansys results as explained by el hadek 2018 therefore this study first analyses a thick hollow steel cylinder with pressure acting on its external surface el sayed et al 2019 the inner and outer radii of the cylinder were 295 4 mm and 330 mm respectively as shown in fig 1 the material properties boundary conditions and geometric parameters are listed in table 1 theoretical values

3 3 methods and materials 3 1 concept and formulation an experiment was conducted on three layered pipes that were submerged under the sea the pipes carried a pressurised fluid and were supported from both ends of the sea beds each pipe exhibits different types of stresses internal pressure due to the fluid transported external pressure due to the column head of the water of the mediterranean thermal stress due to the difference in the temperatures between the fluid transported and the seawater and fatigue due to the wave current the initial parameters were assumed to be as follows the pipes are approximately 1450 m deep under seawater and the density of the mediterranean sea is equal to 1 0289 g cm3 the wave current applied to the pipes is in the form of sine wave cycles which is explained in section 3 2 a 3d analysis was carried out using solid 5 elements the meshes used are described in section 2 where the mesh size that resulted in a minimum error ratio r n 10 l n 60 peri n

internal pressure due to the transported fluid and combination of all three cases together el hadek 2014 ansys software as a post processing result viewer program illustrated similar results in the same scale quarter pipe front views are shown in fig 7 to present a more obvious comparison of the thermal loading external pressure internal pressure and combined loadings as seen in fig 8 furthermore a unique legend was created with temperature c deflection m and stress pa the corresponding api standards used are api rp 16q api rp 17 api rp 75 and api 5l 4 1 1 temperature distribution the thermal conductivities of steel 3lpp and concrete are 52 w m c 0 16 w m c and 2 w m c respectively as shown in fig 8 a and b and fig 9 the temperature of the steel layer did not drop sharply decreasing by only 3 c through the 35 mm thickness of the layer in contrast the temperature of the 3lpp layer dropped sharply decreasing by 13 c through its 3 mm thickness because of its low heat conductivity and high heat resistance whereas the temperature through the outer layer dropped gradually 4 1 2 deflection according to fig 8 c and d e f and fig 10 the maximum deflection occurred under internal pressure loading with a value of 266 μm while the minimum deflection was observed under thermal stress loading by a decrease of 63 and under external pressure loading by a decrease of 44 with respect to deflection under internal loading finally the decrease in deflection between the internal loading and the combined loading was 21 4 1 3 radial stress the radial stress is shown in fig 8 g and h i j the maximum stress occurred under the internal pressure loading step with a value of 219 mpa which reduced by 44 under external pressure loading and reduced by 69 and 96 under the combined and thermal loadings respectively 4 1 4 hoop stress the hoop stress is at the maximum under internal loading fig 8 k and l m n with a value of 219 mpa and reduced by 44 69 and 96 under external combined and thermal load steps respectively the stresses in the y and z directions are considered as hoop stresses thus these values are the same but are represented with a sectioned view 4 1 5

and von mises stresses during each second of the wave cycle as shown in fig 14 and fig 15 the maximum deformation occurred at the 4th and 5th steps with a value of 0 0000141 mm while the minimum deformation was observed at the 12th and the 21st steps with a value of 0 mm furthermore the maximum stress intensity tension was observed at the 12th step with a value of 1 18 kpa while the maximum stress intensity compression developed at the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th and 25th steps with a value of 9 95 kpa these results were obtained using the maximum initial parameters of the mediterranean sea 5 conclusion this study aimed to investigate the deflection maximum equivalent stress fatigue and allowable operation cycles of submerged compound pipelines used in the petrochemical oil and gas industries several conclusions were drawn high yield strength steel api 5l x 70 is typically used as the core to transport fluid the concrete section of the pipeline is very important as it provides additional strength to the compound pipe polypropylene reduces the heat intensity as it absorbs heat in the compound pipe and dampens the pressure between the steel and concrete section the highest stress in the compound pipe occurred under the application of internal pressure only during the hydro test which the pipe was able to withstand the contact pressure between the compound pipe sections plays an important role in the deformation of the polypropylene section when external and internal pressure are applied together they reduce the stress and deformation of the compound pipe to a greater extent than when only one load is applied the pipe can be safely constructed and operated because the maximum stress does not exceed the allowable stress the angle of the wave controls the pressure applied to the pipeline the pipe is safe when it is subjected to the most severe environmental conditions for long years unless denting cracking corrosion or buckling occurs in the future research will be conducted to study the behaviour of three layer pipes with respect to the maximum span length and the actual pipeline profile on the seabed moreover this study and other future works will be useful for engineers and manufacturers who can use steel layers of a smaller thickness and a concrete layer of a greater thickness with an additional hpde layer acting as a safety layer between the concrete and the polypropylene funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declarations of competing

conclusion this study aimed to investigate the deflection maximum equivalent stress fatigue and allowable operation cycles of submerged compound pipelines used in the petrochemical oil and gas

22353,in this study we performed two dimensional hydraulic experiments to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics of wave height surface elevation and flow around single submerged breakwater with a drainage channel under regular waves corresponding to storm and normal conditions on the basis of the two dimensional experimental results we also performed three dimensional numerical simulations to specifically analyze hydrodynamic characteristics around double submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel and compare the numerical results with the experimental results compared the numerical results with the experimental results the numerical results agree well with the experimental results the numerical and experimental results reveal that the proposed single and double submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel reduces the surface elevation behind the submerged breakwater and rip currents flowing offshore through the open inlet between double submerged breakwaters therefore we see that the rip currents that cause scour around the lower part of the open inlet and affect the stability of the submerged breakwaters can be reduced by installing a drainage channel keywords 2d hydraulic experiment 3d numerical analysis submerged breakwater mean surface elevation rip current drainage channel 1 introduction various coastal structures are employed to reduce incoming wave energy in coastal regions recently there has been a focus on the development of environment friendly submerged breakwaters that are located beneath the sea surface and that do not detract from the natural beauty of the surroundings however because of the increased water surface elevation behind the submerged breakwaters a characteristic circulating current is generated around the submerged breakwater to facilitate seawater circulation but a scour was sometimes caused by the rip current in the open inlet this results in a serious problem with respect to the stability of the submerged breakwaters and affects the process of sediment transport around them fig 1 a shows the field survey points around the submerged breakwaters at the songdo beach in busan south korea in the figure b and c show the sediment condition after beach nourishment at the rear edge of the submerged breakwaters and at the end edge in the open inlet between adjacent submerged breakwaters respectively as seen in the figure the nourished sand is almost removed at the open inlet while it is well preserved at the rear side of the submerged breakwaters many experimental and numerical studies have been performed on the hydrodynamic flow characteristics around submerged breakwaters however these studies have been limited to the two dimensional 2d wave field losada et al 1997 garcia et al 2004 hsu et al 2004 johnson et al 2005 zysermana et al 2005 johnson 2006 martinelli et al 2006 zanuttigh 2007 hur et al 2011 in addition three dimensional 3d numerical studies hur 2004 kramer et al 2005 have also been performed however they focused on analyzing the wave deformation by submerged breakwater and no investigation on peripheral flow distribution was performed particularly not regarding the occurrence of rip current in the open inlet in the meantime sumer et al 2005 analyzed the scouring mechanism by carrying out a hydraulic experiment for local scour around a roundhead which is an open inlet of a submerged breakwater low crested structure lcs they reported that scour at the onshore side of a roundhead is generated directly by breakers and the overtopping of waves and scour at the open inlets are generated by a steady stream around the bottom that flows out to the offshore it can be understood in the same context as the scouring mechanism around a roundhead of an emerged breakwater as previously reported by fredsøe and sumer 1997 and sumer and fredsøe 2002 as confirmed by the result of this experiment and the site survey shown in fig 1 we see that scour is induced by the steady stream that flows from the open inlet accordingly if we can reduce the difference between the water surface elevations of the onshore and the offshore which is the main cause of rip currents the flow speed of the rip current will decrease and we may thus be able to reduce the possibility of scour at the open inlet recently hur et al 2012a developed a new 3d numerical model with large eddy simulation which is able to directly simulate wave structure sandy beach interactions hereafter les wass 3d and they carried out 3d numerical studies on the 3d flow characteristics around permeable submerged breakwaters with an open inlet hur et al 2012a the characteristics of the wave runup height on a sandy beach behind dual submerged breakwaters hur et al 2012b and the beach stabilization by the laying of a drainage layer hur et al 2012c however these studies focused only on the flow characteristics and not on the flow control around the submerged breakwaters in this study we analyze the flow characteristics water surface elevation around the submerged breakwaters and control function of rip currents at the open inlet by developing a new type of submerged breakwater with a drainage channel that can reduce the difference between the surface elevations of an onshore and the adjacent offshore by lowering the surface elevations behind the submerged breakwater for the study we performed 2d hydraulic experiments and 3d numerical simulations first in an antecedent 2d experimental analysis we investigate the effect of the proposed submerged breakwater on wave control and the surface elevation reduction next in the 3d numerical analysis we determine the effect of reducing the surface elevation which is achieved by installing the proposed submerged breakwater to control the rip current at the open inlet by performing the above process we can understand the hydraulic characteristics of the proposed submerged breakwater as well as its useful functional features 2 hydraulic experiments a 1 40 scale was selected for the hydraulic experiment considering the site conditions hydraulic wave tank specification and wave generation capacity and the model size for the submerged breakwater initial depths and incident wave conditions were determined in compliance with the froude similitude law the effects of surface roughness on submerged breakwater and tank bottom were not considered 2 1 two dimensional test models to measure the water surface elevation we performed 2d hydraulic experiments installing the typical trapezoidal submerged breakwater and proposed submerged breakwater with a horizontal drainage channel fig 2 shows the wave channel and wave gauges used in our experiment the wave channel is 35 m long 0 8 m wide and 1 2 m high we installed the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters with a slope of 1 2 on the flat seabed an added fictitious dissipation zone is set at the end of the wave channel in order to prevent wave reflection the wave gauge no 1 is set 12 m apart from the wave generator for the crest depth of 2 cm because the wave gauges no 7 and no 9 are placed above the water surface and are sometimes exposed to the air at the wave trough wave gauges no 7 and no 9 are respectively set 50 cm offshore and 40 cm onshore apart from wave gauge no 8 which is set at the center of the submerged breakwater other wave gauges no 1 6 and no 10 15 are set offshore and onshore at intervals of 30 cm from wave gauges no 7 and no 9 respectively each wave gauge records 1024 surface elevation data at intervals of 25 hz fig 3 shows the typical submerged breakwater and proposed submerged breakwater test models used in our experiment after stabilization of the wave field we dropped blue ink on the water surface at the rear side entrance of the drainage channel and took pictures inside the drainage channel using a video camera with 30 fps from those pictures we analyzed the flow from the rear side to the front side of the submerged breakwater through the drainage channel for every incident wave condition 2 2 experimental conditions we performed hydraulic experiments to investigate the water surface elevation around the submerged breakwater and the flow movement inside the drainage channel for incident wave heights of 4 and 7 cm incident wave periods of 1 0 1 5 and 1 8 s and crest depths of 2 and 8 cm above the submerged breakwater with respect to the water depths of 27 and 33 cm as shown in table 1 with the prototype conditions in table 1 the depth 33 cm corresponds to high tide and 27 cm to low tide and the incident wave heights of 7 cm and 4 cm model a storm wave and normal wave respectively 3 experimental results 3 1 distribution of surface elevation figs 4 7 show the distributions of the non dimensional surface elevation in time figs 4 7 show the surface elevations for case 2 h i 7 cm t i 1 5 s h 33 cm case 5 h i 4 cm t i 1 5 s h 33 cm case 8 h i 7 cm t i 1 5 s h 27 cm and case 11

breakwater and wave gauge no 3 onshore side wave gauge respectively the red circle and black solid line represent the surface elevations for the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters respectively as seen in figs 4 7 the surface elevations for case 8 fig 6 and case 11 fig 7 with relatively small water depth appear larger than those for case 2 fig 4 and case 4 fig 5 and the surface elevations for case 4 fig 5 and case 11 fig 7 with relatively small incident wave height appear larger than those for case 2 fig 4 and case 8 fig 6 these result from stronger wave breaking and larger wave energy dissipation which occurs behind the submerged breakwater as the crest depth incident wave height r h i or the crest depth or incident wave height becomes smaller from figs 4 7 for the typical submerged breakwater it is also observed that the phase of wave train is retarded from the wave gauge 8 it is inferred that it results from strong fluid resistance and it consequently increased the wave reflection rate and decreased the wave transmission rate 3 1 1 wave reflection transmission and energy dissipation coefficients the wave reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated by the goda and suzuki 1976 method using the surface elevation records at the offshore side wave gauges no 2 and no 3 and the onshore side wave gauge no 14 fig 8 and fig 9 show the wave reflection transmission and energy dissipation coefficients with the crest depth incident wave height for the typical fig 8 and proposed fig 9 submerged breakwaters the black circle blue triangle and red square indicate incident wave periods of 1 s 1 5 s and 1 8 s respectively from figs 8 and 9 as the crest depth incident wave height r h i becomes smaller the wave reflection coefficient k r increases and wave transmission coefficient k t decreases owing to the increased fluid resistance on the submerged breakwater in addition as r h i becomes smaller k t decreases significantly and the energy dissipation coefficient e l increases because of stronger wave breaking over the crest of the submerged breakwater from these results we see that k r and k t increase as the incident wave period becomes longer and e l increases as the incident wave period becomes smaller we compared k r and k t of the proposed submerged breakwater with those of the typical submerged breakwater in table 2 k r of the proposed submerged breakwater is a little smaller than that of the typical submerged breakwater while k t of the proposed submerged breakwater is a little larger than that of the typical submerged breakwater this indicates that for the proposed submerged breakwater the wave reflection is reduced by the exit of the drainage channel on the front face of the proposed submerged breakwater and the wave transmission increases through the drainage channel this is clearly seen in the cases of r h i 0 5 from the results above although the wave transmission coefficient of the proposed submerged breakwater is a little larger than that of the typical submerged breakwater we can control this problem by adjusting the crest depth crest width and slope of the submerged breakwater etc however because the proposed submerged breakwater with the drainage channel is excellent with regards to exchanging the sea water it is recommended from an environmental perspective 3 1 2 flow characteristics in the drainage channel fig 10 shows the distributions of the flow in the drainage channel of the proposed submerged breakwater in time for case 8 h i 7 cm t i 1 5 s h 27 cm to investigate the characteristics of the flow in the drainage channel we dropped blue ink on the water surface at the rear side entrance of the drainage channel after the wave field became steady state and we took pictures at intervals of t t i 5 45 and watched the flow movement through the drainage channel the red arrows indicate the flow movements from the pictures we confirmed that the flow is from the rear side to the front side of the drainage channel owing to the hydraulic gradient across the rear side and the front side of the submerged breakwater from this result we can reduce the surface elevation on the onshore side of the submerged breakwater 3 1 3 spatial distributions of the mean surface elevation fig 11 and fig 12 show the spatial distributions of the mean surface elevation around the submerged breakwater in the horizontal axis and indicate the offshore and onshore distances from the center of the submerged breakwater at x 0 respectively the black triangle and red circle indicate the mean surface elevations for the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters respectively from figs 11 and 12 we see that in all cases the mean surface elevations increase on the onshore side of the submerged breakwater after the wave breaks over the crest we also see that smaller mean surface elevation differences appear between the onshore and offshore sides of the proposed submerged breakwater with the drainage channel and large surface elevation differences appear between the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters in small r h i fig 12 owing to stronger wave breaking these result from the drain effect through the drainage channel and the surface elevations on the onshore side of the proposed submerged breakwater decrease while the surface elevations on the offshore side of the proposed submerged breakwater increase table 3 shows the mean surface elevation differences between the front and rear sides of the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters the values are the averaged surface elevations at wave gauges no 1 5 for the front side and at the wave gauges no 11 15 for the rear side and are the values above and below the still water level respectively see table 4 from table 3 it appears that the surface elevation differences of the proposed submerged breakwater with the drainage channel are smaller than those of the typical submerged breakwater owing to the drain effect as previously mentioned for cases 7 9 generating strong wave breaking over the crest the surface elevations at the front side descend and large surface elevation differences are shown this means that a relatively large mass is transported to the rear side of the submerged breakwaters and a large hydraulic gradient is always maintained because of the effect of the submerged breakwater it can also be inferred that in the case involving the installation of two submerged breakwaters with an open inlet rip currents moving offshore through the open inlet are always generated by the large hydraulic gradient furthermore table 3 shows that there is a minimum of 54 5 maximum of 91 6 and average of 70 9 of the reduction ratio of the surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the proposed submerged breakwater this means that the proposed submerged breakwater with the drainage channel is very effective in reducing the surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater from the results above the submerged breakwater proposed in this study can partly solve scour and stabilization problems that exist around the open inlet between two submerged breakwaters because of rip currents that are generated by the large surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater 3 1 4 analysis of the reduction mechanism of surface elevation at the rear side of the proposed submerged breakwater fig 13 shows the schematic diagram of the reduction mechanism of the surface elevation at the rear side of the proposed submerged breakwater the surface elevation at the rear side of the submerged breakwater generally increases because of the reduced speed of the wave motion which results from the wave breaking over the crest of the submerged breakwater and the mass transport to the rear side of the submerged breakwater however if we install a drainage channel inside the submerged breakwater a flow is generated from the rear side to the front side because of the hydraulic gradient between the rear and front sides of the submerged breakwater as shown in fig 13 consequently this induces a decrease in the surface elevation at the rear side and an increase in the surface elevation at the front side of the submerged breakwater the flow moving out from the exit on the front face of the submerged breakwater converges to incoming waves and moves back to the rear side of the submerged breakwater over the crest subsequently it again moves from the rear side to the front side through the drainage channel considering this recirculation the submerged breakwater proposed in this study is expected to be much better than the typical submerged breakwater from an environmental perspective 4 numerical analysis method we used the 3d numerical model les wass 3d to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the 3d flow field around submerged breakwaters that result from the interactions between the waves submerged breakwaters and sea bed we adopted the smagorinsky sub grid scale model smagorinsky 1963 to determine the eddy viscosity furthermore we used the inertia resistance sakakiyama and kajima 1992 turbulence resistance ergun 1952 van gent 1995 and laminar resistance van gent 1995 liu and masliyah 1999 in our model as fluid resistances for the submerged breakwaters we adopted the quadrilateral mesh system using the finite difference method fdm for the discretization of the governing equations in les wass 3d furthermore in this model we used the reasonable boundary conditions for inclined seabed beach structure to make up the quadrilateral mesh system 4 1 governing equations the basic equations are composed of the continuity equation eq 1 including the wave generation source for non reflected waves and the modified navier stokes n s momentum equations eq 2 4 including fluid resistances in porous media for 3d fluid fields the numerical simulation of fluid flow on a free surface requires not only the solutions to the governing equations eq 1 4 but also special treatment of the free surface i e tracking of the fluid interface in this study the free surface is governed by eq 5 in terms of the volume of fluid vof function and f the ratio of the fluid volume in the cell to that of the whole cell volume

is not possible for a numerical model that adopts a rectangular grid system to express accurately a structure with a slope or curvature and we therefore used a staircase approximation then in this case the fluid resistance increases according to the shape of the structure so that a result that is different from the actual phenomenon is drawn in the surface grid of the structure therefore the numerical wave basin is organized the method to apply fluid resistance with the ratio of structure in cell 4 2 1 impermeable slope for boundary conditions on an impermeable slope the impermeable condition eq 6 is subjected in the normal direction and the slip condition eq 7 is subjected in a tangential force for the whole structure including the slope by applying the condition proposed by petit et al 1994 6 u n 0 7 u s n 0 where n and s represent the normal direction and tangential direction on the surface of an impermeable structure respectively eq 6 and eq 7 can be expressed as eq 8 and eq 9 respectively according to the theorem using unit vectors n x and n z 8 n x 2 u x n z 2 w z n x n z u x w z 0 9 n x u n z w 0 for the black circle on the slope shown in fig 14 the velocity component marked in the figure is necessary to calculate the applied slip condition in the tangential direction and the impermeable condition in the normal condition in other words two unknown virtual velocity components within the structure which are marked with a dotted line arrow and in the figure can be solved by eq 8 and eq 9 in the case of fig 14 b when only fluid exists inside the grid the fluid resistance is not required however if there exists a proportion of the impermeable structure inside the grid we need to adopt the fluid resistance in the grid so that the inertial resistance is applied for the volume ratio of the structure that is the impact of the inertial resistance is considered in the calculation by substituting the volume ratio of the impermeable structure in the inertial resistance term of the fluid resistance in such a case the horizontal velocity components in the surface cell of the impermeable sloping structure are calculated by substituting the modified volume porosity γ v of the impermeable structure according to eq 10 10 γ v 1 s i δ z where s i is the ratio of the impermeable structure at the right boundary in a surface cell of the impermeable sloping structure and δz is the grid size in the z direction 4 2 2 permeable slope in fig 15 a velocity components and of the inner grid boundary of the permeable structure are determined considering the effect of the surface permeability given in each fluid resistance equation however if there is an inclining permeable structure inside the grid as shown in fig 15 b the areal penetration ratio of the left and right boundaries and of the cell is smaller than the given value and the areal occupied ratio of the velocity component of the above mentioned boundary becomes 1 0 because of the absence of a structure in this case horizontal velocity components of boundary can be calculated by substituting the modified surface permeability γ x which is determined according to eq 11 in the fluid resistance 11 γ x 1 s p γ x s p where s p is the ratio of the permeable structure at the right boundary in a surface cell of the permeable sloping structure γ x is the surface permeability in the x direction 5 three dimensional numerical analysis 5 1 verification of the numerical analysis method the three dimensional hydraulic phenomenon around submerged breakwater was verified in a prior study using les wass 3d hur et al 2012a hur et al 2014 lee et al 2014 the numerical results were compared with the wave height and time waveform around submerged breakwater measured by kramer et al 2005 and also with flow speed time series by depth and time waveform at the gap between submerged breakwater measured by osanai and minami 2003 and were proven to show high accuracy for a numerical analysis of the effect of installation of a drainage channel on the hydraulic characteristics around submerged breakwater the numerical model is verified by comparing hydraulic experiment results in this study we compared the waveforms and surface elevations obtained from the numerical analysis with those obtained from experiments involving the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters for the numerical analysis we used the numerical wave basin presented in fig 2 fig 16 and fig 17 compare the measured and calculated waveforms for the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters for case 8 h i 7 cm t i 1 5 s h 27 cm respectively the waveforms were acquired at the wave gauges no 8 10 11 12 13 and 15 the red circle and solid black line indicate the measured and calculated waveforms respectively from figs 17 and 18 we see that there are clear characteristics of the wave transform for the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters fig 18 shows a comparison of the measured and calculated surface elevations for the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters for case 8 respectively the red circle and solid black line indicate the measured and calculated surface elevations respectively from fig 18 a for the typical submerged breakwater the mean surface elevation rapidly increases over the crest because of strong wave breaking and the increased surface elevation is maintained on the onshore side of the submerged breakwater because of the continuous mass transport by the wave train from fig 18 b for the proposed submerged breakwater the mean surface elevation increases a little over the crest and on the onshore side of the submerged breakwater because of the drain effect through the drainage channel the numerical results in figs 16 18 show excellent agreement with the measured results obtained from the experiment therefore these results verify the validity of the 3d numerical model les wass 3d 5 2 three dimensional numerical wave basin and incident wave conditions we used a 3d numerical wave basin to investigate characteristics of the wave height water surface elevation and flow around the submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel as shown in fig 19 we installed two submerged breakwaters with a height of 25 cm length of l r 1l i and the opening rate between two submerged breakwaters of w l r 0 5 the crest depth is 2 cm and the drainage channel connecting the inner and outer side waters was installed 5 cm 10 cm under the top of submerged breakwater depth 7 cm 12 cm its length is the same as the tip length of submerged breakwater 0 5 l i and the side end to the gap is sealed we considered a source for generating waves and an added fictitious dissipation zone in order to prevent wave reflection at the open boundary the slope of the impermeable seabed is 1 100 and the slope and volume porosity of sandy beach with a median grain size of 0 02 mm are 1 10 and 0 3 respectively the submerged breakwater is installed numerically with a slope of 1 2 and is composed of one layer with median grain sizes of 4 cm and a volume porosity of 0 4 for stones for convenience we used the slip condition at each end of the submerged breakwaters at the wave basin wall 5 3 three dimensional numerical analysis results 5 3 1 spatial distribution of wave height fig 20 shows the spatial distributions of the non dimensional wave height wave height incident wave height around the submerged breakwaters with without the drainage channel for incident wave heights of 4 cm and 7 cm wave period 1 5 s and water depths of 30 cm and 36 cm the dotted and solid lines represent the bottom and the crest of the submerged breakwaters respectively the upper and lower figures on the left show the wave heights without and with the drainage channel respectively the red and blue in the figures on the left indicate wave heights larger and smaller than the incident wave height respectively the figures on the right show the non dimensional wave heights above the middle of the submerged breakwater between a b in fig 19 fig 20 a and b show the spatial distributions of the wave height for permeable submerged breakwaters and those for impermeable submerged breakwaters respectively fig 20 a shows a comparison of the wave heights around permeable breakwaters with the drainage channel with those without the drainage channel for an incident wave height of 7 cm and water depth of 30 cm fig 20 b shows a comparison of the wave heights around impermeable breakwaters with the drainage channel with those without the drainage channel for an incident wave height of 7 cm and a water depth of 30 cm as shown in the figures on the left in fig 20 in all comparative cases with without the drainage channel there are similar patterns of the partial standing waves in front of the submerged breakwaters and this is caused by the effect of wave reflection it is expected that small standing waves will form in front of the submerged breakwaters because of the effect of the drainage channel but there is not a large difference in all comparative cases for permeable submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel case 5 relatively small standing waves form in front of the submerged breakwaters because of the effect of the drainage channel and similar patterns of the wave height distributions appear on the onshore side of the submerged breakwaters compared the wave heights on the onshore side of the submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel with those without the drainage channel in the figures on the right the wave heights on the onshore side of the submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel are relatively larger than those without the drainage channel for the submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel we deduce that there is no wave breaking over the crest of the submerged breakwaters because of the effect of the drainage channel and thus waves continuously grow by moving over and behind the submerged breakwaters 5 3 2 spatial distribution of the mean surface elevation fig 21 shows the spatial distributions of the mean surface elevation around the submerged breakwaters with without the drainage channel the red and blue in the figures on the left indicate the mean surface elevations larger and smaller than the still water level respectively fig 22 shows mean surface elevation differences between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwaters we obtained the mean surface elevations by averaging the integrated surface elevation at each point for three wave periods within the range from the offshore and onshore edges of the crest of the submerged breakwater to one wavelength offshore and onshore such as in fig 19 respectively in fig 22 the red square and blue triangle represent the mean surface elevations at the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater respectively and the black circle represents the mean surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater as shown in the figures on the left in fig 22 the mean surface elevations at the rear side of the submerged breakwater with the drainage channel decrease overall this is clearly seen in the impermeable submerged breakwater and for a larger incident wave from fig 22 we see that the mean surface elevations at the rear side of the submerged breakwater increase in the impermeable submerged breakwater rather than in the permeable submerged breakwater especially in case 8 and case 11 with larger incident wave heights because more intense wave breaking occurs over the crest of the submerged breakwater for the submerged breakwater with the drainage channel the mean surface elevations at the rear side of the submerged breakwater shows an overall decline especially in the impermeable submerged breakwater from the results obtained we see that the mean surface elevation at the rear side of the submerged breakwater decreases because of a flow moving offshore through the drainage channel 5 3 3 spatial distribution of the mean flow fig 23 shows the spatial distributions of the mean flow with without the drainage channel we obtained the mean flow u x y z using eq 12 by averaging the integrated mean flow calculated at each vertical point in the x y plane for three wave periods the red and blue in the figures on the left indicate large and small mean flows respectively fig 24 shows the flow velocities along the z direction at point p 1 p 2 and p 3 in fig 19 the red and blue indicate the flow velocities with and without the drainage channel respectively 12 u x y z 1 3 t t h η t i t i 3 t i u 2 v 2 d t d z as shown in fig 23 for both the submerged breakwaters with without the drainage channel the circular flows around the open inlet at the rear side of the submerged breakwaters and the rip currents flowing offshore through the open inlet are generated by the interaction between the flows moving offshore which results from the mean surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwaters as well as the incident wave propagating onshore in fig 24 compared the rip currents for the impermeable submerged breakwaters with those for the permeable submerged breakwaters larger rip currents are generated for the impermeable submerged breakwaters because of the larger surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwaters we also see that the rip currents are significantly reduced by installing the drainage channel inside the impermeable submerged breakwaters in fig 24 b further compared the rip currents for the submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel with those for the submerged breakwaters without the drainage channel the former are relatively small because of the flow that is generated by the increased surface elevation at the rear side which moves offshore through the drainage channel therefore rip currents can be reduced by installing a drainage channel inside the submerged breakwaters 6 summary and conclusions we performed a study to develop a newly proposed submerged breakwater with a drainage channel that can control flow at the open inlet between two submerged breakwaters while efficiently controlling waves without increasing the surface elevation at the rear side of the submerged breakwater first we investigated the hydraulic characteristics of the proposed submerged breakwater that was being developed by carrying out a 2d hydraulic experiment to which an effective drainage channel arrangement was applied next for a 3d numerical simulation we configured the proposed submerged breakwaters in a wave basin together with a realistic beach and we reviewed its effect on the rip current reduction at the open inlet the main findings obtained in this study can be described as follows in the 2d experimental analysis we performed 2d hydraulic experiments by applying the optimum layout and the effects on the wave control and surface elevation reduction at the rear side of the proposed submerged breakwater were closely investigated compared to the typical submerged breakwater 1 in the investigation on the reflectivity transmissibility and energy loss resulting from the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters the results show that the reflectivity and energy loss of the proposed submerged breakwater are a little smaller than those of the typical submerged breakwater and the transmissibility is found to be a little larger 2 for the proposed submerged breakwater the surface elevation on the onshore side of the submerged breakwater decreases because the flow moved offshore through the drainage channel and thus there is a decreased surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater 3 a flow moving offshore through the drainage channel is generated in the proposed submerged breakwater and the mean surface elevation on the onshore side of the submerged breakwater decreases by about 70 9 compared with that for the submerged breakwater without a drainage channel 4 synthetically analyzing the characteristics of the flow field investigated in the experiment as the flow structure circulating current of the newly proposed submerged breakwater shows superior sea water circulation than that of the existing submerged breakwater it is believed to be advantageous from an environmental perspective in the 3d numerical analysis we performed 3d numerical simulations applying the proposed submerged breakwater which was very effective in terms of surface elevation reduction at the rear side of submerged breakwater while its wave control effect was similar to that of the typical submerged breakwater as investigated in the 2d hydraulic experiment in the 3d numerical wave basin we configured two proposed submerged breakwaters that were reviewed in the hydraulic experiment in addition we considered the dimensions of the submerged breakwater and the calculation conditions together with the hydraulic experiment the results of the 3d numerical analysis carried out for the proposed submerged breakwater are as follows 1 in verification of the validity and effectiveness of the 3d numerical model that used the hydraulic experiment conditions 3d numerical model generates suitable time waveforms as measured by the wave gauges on the crest and at the rear side of the proposed submerged breakwater as well as the typical submerged breakwater 2 the wave control function of the proposed submerged breakwater does not show any significant difference compared to that of the typical submerged breakwater even in a 3d wave field where both an open inlet and a beach exist 3 the difference between the surface elevation at the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater is larger in the case of an impermeable submerged breakwater compared to that in the case of a permeable submerged breakwater moreover the smaller ratio of the crest depth to the incident wave height r h i the larger was the increase in the mean surface elevation and the decrease in the mean surface elevation at the rear side of the proposed submerged breakwater is more effective 4 with respect to the effect of the proposed submerged breakwater installation on the control of the rip current at the open inlet it is effective in the condition where there is a large difference between the surface elevation at the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater for a smaller r h i of the impermeable submerged breakwater therefore we infer that the flow around two submerged breakwaters which can cause scour and affect the stability of the submerged breakwater can be controlled as we reduce the mean surface elevation at the rear side of the submerged breakwater by installing a drainage channel furthermore rip currents flowing offshore through the open inlet between two submerged breakwaters which are generated by the difference in the mean surface elevation between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwaters can be reduced and subsequently scour around the open inlet can also be reduced acknowledgements this research was a part of the project titled practical technologies for coastal erosion control and countermeasure funded by the ministry of oceans and fisheries republic of korea 
22353,in this study we performed two dimensional hydraulic experiments to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics of wave height surface elevation and flow around single submerged breakwater with a drainage channel under regular waves corresponding to storm and normal conditions on the basis of the two dimensional experimental results we also performed three dimensional numerical simulations to specifically analyze hydrodynamic characteristics around double submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel and compare the numerical results with the experimental results compared the numerical results with the experimental results the numerical results agree well with the experimental results the numerical and experimental results reveal that the proposed single and double submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel reduces the surface elevation behind the submerged breakwater and rip currents flowing offshore through the open inlet between double submerged breakwaters therefore we see that the rip currents that cause scour around the lower part of the open inlet and affect the stability of the submerged breakwaters can be reduced by installing a drainage channel keywords 2d hydraulic experiment 3d numerical analysis submerged breakwater mean surface elevation rip current drainage channel 1 introduction various coastal structures are employed to reduce incoming wave energy in coastal regions recently there has been a focus on the development of environment friendly submerged breakwaters that are located beneath the sea surface and that do not detract from the natural beauty of the surroundings however because of the increased water surface elevation behind the submerged breakwaters a characteristic circulating current is generated around the submerged breakwater to facilitate seawater circulation but a scour was sometimes caused by the rip current in the open inlet this results in a serious problem with respect to the stability of the submerged breakwaters and affects the process of sediment transport around them fig 1 a shows the field survey points around the submerged breakwaters at the songdo beach in busan south korea in the figure b and c show the sediment condition after beach nourishment at the rear edge of the submerged breakwaters and at the end edge in the open inlet between adjacent submerged breakwaters respectively as seen in the figure the nourished sand is almost removed at the open inlet while it is well preserved at the rear side of the submerged breakwaters many experimental and numerical studies have been performed on the hydrodynamic flow characteristics around submerged breakwaters however these studies have been limited to the two dimensional 2d wave field losada et al 1997 garcia et al 2004 hsu et al 2004 johnson et al 2005 zysermana et al 2005 johnson 2006 martinelli et al 2006 zanuttigh 2007 hur et al 2011 in addition three dimensional 3d numerical studies hur 2004 kramer et al 2005 have also been performed however they focused on analyzing the wave deformation by submerged breakwater and no investigation on peripheral flow distribution was performed particularly not regarding the occurrence of rip current in the open inlet in the meantime sumer et al 2005 analyzed the scouring mechanism by carrying out a hydraulic experiment for local scour around a roundhead which is an open inlet of a submerged breakwater low crested structure lcs they reported that scour at the onshore side of a roundhead is generated directly by breakers and the overtopping of waves and scour at the open inlets are generated by a steady stream around the bottom that flows out to the offshore it can be understood in the same context as the scouring mechanism around a roundhead of an emerged breakwater as previously reported by fredsøe and sumer 1997 and sumer and fredsøe 2002 as confirmed by the result of this experiment and the site survey shown in fig 1 we see that scour is induced by the steady stream that flows from the open inlet accordingly if we can reduce the difference between the water surface elevations of the onshore and the offshore which is the main cause of rip currents the flow speed of the rip current will decrease and we may thus be able to reduce the possibility of scour at the open inlet recently hur et al 2012a developed a new 3d numerical model with large eddy simulation which is able to directly simulate wave structure sandy beach interactions hereafter les wass 3d and they carried out 3d numerical studies on the 3d flow characteristics around permeable submerged breakwaters with an open inlet hur et al 2012a the characteristics of the wave runup height on a sandy beach behind dual submerged breakwaters hur et al 2012b and the beach stabilization by the laying of a drainage layer hur et al 2012c however these studies focused only on the flow characteristics and not on the flow control around the submerged breakwaters in this study we analyze the flow characteristics water surface elevation around the submerged breakwaters and control function of rip currents at the open inlet by developing a new type of submerged breakwater with a drainage channel that can reduce the difference between the surface elevations of an onshore and the adjacent offshore by lowering the surface elevations behind the submerged breakwater for the study we performed 2d hydraulic experiments and 3d numerical simulations first in an antecedent 2d experimental analysis we investigate the effect of the proposed submerged breakwater on wave control and the surface elevation reduction next in the 3d numerical analysis we determine the effect of reducing the surface elevation which is achieved by installing the proposed submerged breakwater to control the rip current at the open inlet by performing the above process we can understand the hydraulic characteristics of the proposed submerged breakwater as well as its useful functional features 2 hydraulic experiments a 1 40 scale was selected for the hydraulic experiment considering the site conditions hydraulic wave tank specification and wave generation capacity and the model size for the submerged breakwater initial depths and incident wave conditions were determined in compliance with the froude similitude law the effects of surface roughness on submerged breakwater and tank bottom were not considered 2 1 two dimensional test models to measure the water surface elevation we performed 2d hydraulic experiments installing the typical trapezoidal submerged breakwater and proposed submerged breakwater with a horizontal drainage channel fig 2 shows the wave channel and wave gauges used in our experiment the wave channel is 35 m long 0 8 m wide and 1 2 m high we installed the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters with a slope of 1 2 on the flat seabed an added fictitious dissipation zone is set at the end of the wave channel in order to prevent wave reflection the wave gauge no 1 is set 12 m apart from the wave generator for the crest depth of 2 cm because the wave gauges no 7 and no 9 are placed above the water surface and are sometimes exposed to the air at the wave trough wave gauges no 7 and no 9 are respectively set 50 cm offshore and 40 cm onshore apart from wave gauge no 8 which is set at the center of the submerged breakwater other wave gauges no 1 6 and no 10 15 are set offshore and onshore at intervals of 30 cm from wave gauges no 7 and no 9 respectively each wave gauge records 1024 surface elevation data at intervals of 25 hz fig 3 shows the typical submerged breakwater and proposed submerged breakwater test models used in our experiment after stabilization of the wave field we dropped blue ink on the water surface at the rear side entrance of the drainage channel and took pictures inside the drainage channel using a video camera with 30 fps from those pictures we analyzed the flow from the rear side to the front side of the submerged breakwater through the drainage channel for every incident wave condition 2 2 experimental conditions we performed hydraulic experiments to investigate the water surface elevation around the submerged breakwater and the flow movement inside the drainage channel for incident wave heights of 4 and 7 cm incident wave periods of 1 0 1 5 and 1 8 s and crest depths of 2 and 8 cm above the submerged breakwater with respect to the water depths of 27 and 33 cm as shown in table 1 with the prototype conditions in table 1 the depth 33 cm corresponds to high tide and 27 cm to low tide and the incident wave heights of 7 cm and 4 cm model a storm wave and normal wave respectively 3 experimental results 3 1 distribution of surface elevation figs 4 7 show the distributions of

h i 4 cm t i 1 5 s h 27 cm respectively in these figures a b and c show the surface elevations at wave gauge no 1 offshore side wave gauge wave gauge no 2 wave gauge above the center of the submerged breakwater and wave gauge no 3 onshore side wave gauge respectively the red circle and black solid line represent the surface elevations for the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters respectively as seen in figs 4 7 the surface elevations for case 8 fig 6 and case 11 fig 7 with relatively small water depth appear larger than those for case 2 fig 4 and case 4 fig 5 and the surface elevations for case 4 fig 5 and case 11 fig 7 with relatively small incident wave height appear larger than those for case 2 fig 4 and case 8 fig 6 these result from stronger wave breaking and larger wave energy dissipation which occurs behind the submerged breakwater as the crest depth incident wave height r h i or the crest depth or incident wave height becomes smaller from figs 4 7 for the typical submerged breakwater it is also observed that the phase of wave train is retarded from the wave gauge 8 it is inferred that it results from strong fluid resistance and it consequently increased the wave reflection rate and decreased the wave transmission rate 3 1 1 wave reflection transmission and energy dissipation coefficients the wave reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated by the goda and suzuki 1976 method using the surface elevation records at the offshore side wave gauges no 2 and no 3 and the onshore side wave gauge no 14 fig 8 and fig 9 show the wave reflection transmission and energy dissipation coefficients with the crest depth incident wave height for the typical fig 8 and proposed fig 9 submerged breakwaters the black circle blue triangle and red square indicate incident wave periods of 1 s 1 5 s and 1 8 s respectively from figs 8 and 9 as the crest depth incident wave height r h i becomes smaller the wave reflection coefficient k r increases and wave transmission coefficient k t decreases owing to the increased fluid resistance on the submerged breakwater in addition as r h i becomes smaller k t decreases significantly and the energy dissipation coefficient e l increases because of stronger wave breaking over the crest of the submerged breakwater from these results we see that k r and k t increase as the incident wave period becomes longer and e l increases as the incident wave period becomes smaller we compared k r and k t of the proposed submerged breakwater with those of the typical submerged breakwater in table 2 k r of the proposed submerged breakwater is a little smaller than that of the typical submerged breakwater while k t of the proposed submerged breakwater is a little larger than that of the typical submerged breakwater this indicates that for the proposed submerged breakwater the wave reflection is reduced by the exit of the drainage channel on the front face of the proposed submerged breakwater and the wave transmission increases through the drainage channel this is clearly seen in the cases of r h i 0 5 from the results above although the wave transmission coefficient of the proposed submerged breakwater is a little larger than that of the typical submerged breakwater we can control this problem by adjusting the crest depth crest width and slope of the submerged breakwater etc however because the proposed submerged breakwater with the drainage channel is excellent with regards to exchanging the sea water it is recommended from an environmental perspective 3 1 2 flow characteristics in the drainage channel fig 10 shows the distributions of the flow in the drainage channel of the proposed submerged breakwater in time for case 8 h i 7 cm t i 1 5 s h 27 cm to investigate the characteristics of the flow in the drainage channel we dropped blue ink on the water surface at the rear side entrance of the drainage channel after the wave field became steady state and we took pictures at intervals of t t i 5 45 and watched the flow movement through the drainage channel the red arrows indicate the flow movements from the pictures we confirmed that the flow is from the rear side to the front side of the drainage channel owing to the hydraulic gradient across the rear side and the front side of the submerged breakwater from this result we can reduce the surface elevation on the onshore side of the submerged breakwater 3 1 3 spatial distributions of the mean surface elevation fig 11 and fig 12 show the spatial distributions of the mean surface elevation around the submerged breakwater in the horizontal axis and indicate the offshore and onshore distances from the center of the submerged breakwater at x 0 respectively the black triangle and red circle indicate the mean surface elevations for the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters respectively from figs 11 and 12 we see that in all cases the mean surface elevations increase on the onshore side of the submerged breakwater after the wave breaks over the crest we also see that smaller mean surface elevation differences appear between the onshore and offshore sides of the proposed submerged breakwater with the drainage channel and large surface elevation differences appear between the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters in small r h i fig 12 owing to stronger wave breaking these result from the drain effect through the drainage channel and the surface elevations on the onshore side of the proposed submerged breakwater decrease while the surface elevations on the offshore side of the proposed submerged breakwater increase table 3 shows the mean surface elevation differences between the front and rear sides of the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters the values are the averaged surface elevations at wave gauges no 1 5 for the front side and at the wave gauges no 11 15 for the rear side and are the values above and below the still water level respectively see table 4 from table 3 it appears that the surface elevation differences of the proposed submerged breakwater with the drainage channel are smaller than those of the typical submerged breakwater owing to the drain effect as previously mentioned for cases 7 9 generating strong wave breaking over the crest the surface elevations at the front side descend and large surface elevation differences are shown this means that a relatively large mass is transported to the rear side of the submerged breakwaters and a large hydraulic gradient is always maintained because of the effect of the submerged breakwater it can also be inferred that in the case involving the installation of two submerged breakwaters with an open inlet rip currents moving offshore through the open inlet are always generated by the large hydraulic gradient furthermore table 3 shows that there is a minimum of 54 5 maximum of 91 6 and average of 70 9 of the reduction ratio of the surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the proposed submerged breakwater this means that the proposed submerged breakwater with the drainage channel is very effective in reducing the surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater from the results above the submerged breakwater proposed in this study can partly solve scour and stabilization problems that exist around the open inlet between two submerged breakwaters because of rip currents that are generated by the large surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater 3 1 4 analysis of the reduction mechanism of surface elevation at the rear side of the proposed submerged breakwater fig 13 shows the schematic diagram of the reduction mechanism of the surface elevation at the rear side of the proposed submerged breakwater the surface elevation at the rear side of the submerged breakwater generally increases because of the reduced speed of the wave motion which results from the wave breaking over the crest of the submerged breakwater and the mass transport to the rear side of the submerged breakwater however if we install a drainage channel inside the submerged breakwater a flow is generated from the rear side to the front side because of the hydraulic gradient between the rear and front sides of the submerged breakwater as shown in fig 13 consequently this induces a decrease in the surface elevation at the rear side and an increase in the surface elevation at the front side of the submerged breakwater the flow moving out from the exit on the front face of the submerged breakwater converges to incoming waves and moves back to the rear side of the submerged breakwater over the crest subsequently it again moves from the rear side to the front side through the drainage channel considering this recirculation the submerged breakwater proposed in this study is expected to be much better than the typical submerged breakwater from an environmental perspective 4 numerical analysis method we used the 3d numerical model les wass 3d to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the 3d flow field around submerged breakwaters that result from the interactions between the waves submerged breakwaters and sea bed we adopted the smagorinsky sub grid scale model smagorinsky 1963 to determine the eddy viscosity furthermore we used the inertia resistance sakakiyama and kajima 1992 turbulence resistance ergun 1952 van gent 1995 and laminar resistance van gent 1995 liu and masliyah 1999 in our model as fluid resistances for the submerged breakwaters we adopted the quadrilateral mesh system using the finite difference method fdm for the discretization of the governing equations in les wass 3d furthermore in this model we used the reasonable boundary conditions for inclined seabed beach structure to make up the quadrilateral mesh system 4 1 governing equations the basic equations are composed of the continuity equation eq 1 including the wave generation source for non reflected waves and the modified navier stokes n s momentum equations eq 2 4 including fluid resistances in porous media for 3d fluid fields the numerical simulation of fluid flow on a free surface requires not only the solutions to the governing equations eq 1 4 but also special treatment of the free surface i e tracking of the fluid interface in this study the free surface is governed by eq 5 in terms of the volume of fluid vof function and f the ratio of the fluid volume in the cell to that of the whole cell volume

is not possible for a numerical model that adopts a rectangular grid system to express accurately a structure with a slope or curvature and we therefore used a staircase approximation then in this case the fluid resistance increases according to the shape of the structure so that a result that is different from the actual phenomenon is drawn in the surface grid of the structure therefore the numerical wave basin is organized the method to apply fluid resistance with the ratio of structure in cell 4 2 1 impermeable slope for boundary conditions on an impermeable slope the impermeable condition eq 6 is subjected in the normal direction and the slip condition eq 7 is subjected in a tangential force for the whole structure including the slope by applying the condition proposed by petit et al 1994 6 u n 0 7 u s n 0 where n and s represent the normal direction and tangential direction on the surface of an impermeable structure respectively eq 6 and eq 7 can be expressed as eq 8 and eq 9 respectively according to the theorem using unit vectors n x and n z 8 n x 2 u x n z 2 w z n x n z u x w z 0 9 n x u n z w 0 for the black circle on the slope shown in fig 14 the velocity component marked in the figure is necessary to calculate the applied slip condition in the tangential direction and the impermeable condition in the normal condition in other words two unknown virtual velocity components within the structure which are marked with a dotted line arrow and in the figure can be solved by eq 8 and eq 9 in the case of fig 14 b when only fluid exists inside the grid the fluid resistance is not required however if there exists a proportion of the impermeable structure inside the grid we need to adopt the fluid resistance in the grid so that the inertial resistance is applied for the volume ratio of the structure that is the impact of the inertial resistance is considered in the calculation by substituting the volume ratio of the impermeable structure in the inertial resistance term of the fluid resistance in such a case the horizontal velocity components in the surface cell of the impermeable sloping structure are calculated by substituting the modified volume porosity γ v of the impermeable structure according to eq 10 10 γ v 1 s i δ z where s i is the ratio of the impermeable structure at the right boundary in a surface cell of the impermeable sloping structure and δz is the grid size in the z direction 4 2 2 permeable slope in fig 15 a velocity components and of the inner grid boundary of the permeable structure are determined considering the effect of the surface permeability given in each fluid resistance equation however if there is an inclining permeable structure inside the grid as shown in fig 15 b the areal penetration ratio of the left and right boundaries and of the cell is smaller than the given value and the areal occupied ratio of the velocity component of the above mentioned boundary becomes 1 0 because of the absence of a structure in this case horizontal velocity components of boundary can be calculated by substituting the modified surface permeability γ x which is determined according to eq 11 in the fluid resistance 11 γ x 1 s p γ x s p where s p is the ratio of the permeable structure at the right boundary in a surface cell of the permeable sloping structure γ x is the surface permeability in the x direction 5 three dimensional numerical analysis 5 1 verification of the numerical analysis method the three dimensional hydraulic phenomenon around submerged breakwater was verified in a prior study using les wass 3d hur et al 2012a hur et al 2014 lee et al 2014 the numerical results were compared with the wave height and time waveform around submerged breakwater measured by kramer et al 2005 and also with flow speed time series by depth and time waveform at the gap between submerged breakwater measured by osanai and minami 2003 and were proven to show high accuracy for a numerical analysis of the effect of installation of a drainage channel on the hydraulic characteristics around submerged breakwater the numerical model is verified by comparing hydraulic experiment results in this study we compared the waveforms and surface elevations obtained from the numerical analysis with those obtained from experiments involving the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters for the numerical analysis we used the numerical wave basin presented in fig 2 fig 16 and fig 17 compare the measured and calculated waveforms for the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters for case 8 h i 7 cm t i 1 5 s h 27 cm respectively the waveforms were acquired at the wave gauges no 8 10 11 12 13 and 15 the red circle and solid black line indicate the measured and calculated waveforms respectively from figs 17 and 18 we see that there are clear characteristics of the wave transform for the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters fig 18 shows a comparison of the measured and calculated surface elevations for the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters for case 8 respectively the red circle and solid black line indicate the measured and calculated surface elevations respectively from fig 18 a for the typical submerged breakwater the mean surface elevation rapidly increases over the crest because of strong wave breaking and the increased surface elevation is maintained on the onshore side of the submerged breakwater because of the continuous mass transport by the wave train from fig 18 b for the proposed submerged breakwater the mean surface elevation increases a little over the crest and on the onshore side of the submerged breakwater because of the drain effect through the drainage channel the numerical results in figs 16 18 show excellent agreement with the measured results obtained from the experiment therefore these results verify the validity of the 3d numerical model les wass 3d 5 2 three dimensional numerical wave basin and incident wave conditions we used a 3d numerical wave basin to investigate characteristics of the wave height water surface elevation and flow around the submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel as shown in fig 19 we installed two submerged breakwaters with a height of 25 cm length of l r 1l i and the opening rate between two submerged breakwaters of w l r 0 5 the crest depth is 2 cm and the drainage channel connecting the inner and outer side waters was installed 5 cm 10 cm under the top of submerged breakwater depth 7 cm 12 cm its length is the same as the tip length of submerged breakwater 0 5 l i and the side end to the gap is sealed we considered a source for generating waves and an added fictitious dissipation zone in order to prevent wave reflection at the open boundary the slope of the impermeable seabed is 1 100 and the slope and volume porosity of sandy beach with a median grain size of 0 02 mm are 1 10 and 0 3 respectively the submerged breakwater is installed numerically with a slope of 1 2 and is composed of one layer with median grain sizes of 4 cm and a volume porosity of 0 4 for stones for convenience we used the slip condition at each end of the submerged breakwaters at the wave basin wall 5 3 three dimensional numerical analysis results 5 3 1 spatial distribution of wave height fig 20 shows the spatial distributions of the non dimensional wave height wave height incident wave height around the submerged breakwaters with without the drainage channel for incident wave heights of 4 cm and 7 cm wave period 1 5 s and water depths of 30 cm and 36 cm the dotted and solid lines represent the bottom and the crest of the submerged breakwaters respectively the upper and lower figures on the left show the wave heights without and with the drainage channel respectively the red and blue in the figures on the left indicate wave heights larger and smaller than the incident wave height respectively the figures on the right show the non dimensional wave heights above the middle of the submerged breakwater between a b in fig 19 fig 20 a and b show the spatial distributions of the wave height for permeable submerged breakwaters and those for impermeable submerged breakwaters respectively fig 20 a shows a comparison of the wave heights around permeable breakwaters with the drainage channel with those without the drainage channel for an incident wave height of 7 cm and water depth of 30 cm fig 20 b shows a comparison of the wave heights around impermeable breakwaters with the drainage channel with those without the drainage channel for an incident wave height of 7 cm and a water depth of 30 cm as shown in the figures on the left in fig 20 in all comparative cases with without the drainage channel there are similar patterns of the partial standing waves in front of the submerged breakwaters and this is caused by the effect of wave reflection it is expected that small standing waves will form in front of the submerged breakwaters because of the effect of the drainage channel but there is not a large difference in all comparative cases for permeable submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel case 5 relatively small standing waves form in front of the submerged breakwaters because of the effect of the drainage channel and similar patterns of the wave height distributions appear on the onshore side of the submerged breakwaters compared the wave heights on the onshore side of the submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel with those without the drainage channel in the figures on the right the wave heights on the onshore side of the submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel are relatively larger than those without the drainage channel for the submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel we deduce that there is no wave breaking over the crest of the submerged breakwaters because of the effect of the drainage channel and thus waves continuously grow by moving over and behind the submerged breakwaters 5 3 2 spatial distribution of the mean surface elevation fig 21 shows the spatial distributions of the mean surface elevation around the submerged breakwaters with without the drainage channel the red and blue in the figures on the left indicate the mean surface elevations larger and smaller than the still water level respectively fig 22 shows mean surface elevation differences between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwaters we obtained the mean surface elevations by averaging the integrated surface elevation at each point for three wave periods within the range from the offshore and onshore edges of the crest of the submerged breakwater to one wavelength offshore and onshore such as in fig 19 respectively in fig 22 the red square and blue triangle represent the mean surface elevations at the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater respectively and the black circle represents the mean surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater as shown in the figures on the left in fig 22 the mean surface elevations at the rear side of the submerged breakwater with the drainage channel decrease overall this is clearly seen in the impermeable submerged breakwater and for a larger incident wave from fig 22 we see that the mean surface elevations at the rear side of the submerged breakwater increase in the impermeable submerged breakwater rather than in the permeable submerged breakwater especially in case 8 and case 11 with larger incident wave heights because more intense wave breaking occurs over the crest of the submerged breakwater for the submerged breakwater with the drainage channel the mean surface elevations at the rear side of the submerged breakwater shows an overall decline especially in the impermeable submerged breakwater from the results obtained we see that the mean surface elevation at the rear side of the submerged breakwater decreases because of a flow moving offshore through the drainage channel 5 3 3 spatial distribution of the mean flow fig 23 shows the spatial distributions of the mean flow with without the drainage channel we obtained the mean flow u x y z using eq 12 by averaging the integrated mean flow calculated at each vertical point in the x y plane for three wave periods the red and blue in the figures on the left indicate large and small mean flows respectively fig 24 shows the flow velocities along the z direction at point p 1 p 2 and p 3 in fig 19 the red and blue indicate the flow velocities with and without the drainage channel respectively 12 u x y z 1 3 t t h η t i t i 3 t i u 2 v 2 d t d z as shown in fig 23 for both the submerged breakwaters with without the drainage channel the circular flows around the open inlet at the rear side of the submerged breakwaters and the rip currents flowing offshore through the open inlet are generated by the interaction between the flows moving offshore which results from the mean surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwaters as well as the incident wave propagating onshore in fig 24 compared the rip currents for the impermeable submerged breakwaters with those for the permeable submerged breakwaters larger rip currents are generated for the impermeable submerged breakwaters because of the larger surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwaters we also see that the rip currents are significantly reduced by installing the drainage channel inside the impermeable submerged breakwaters in fig 24 b further compared the rip currents for the submerged breakwaters with the drainage channel with those for the submerged breakwaters without the drainage channel the former are relatively small because of the flow that is generated by the increased surface elevation at the rear side which moves offshore through the drainage channel therefore rip currents can be reduced by installing a drainage channel inside the submerged breakwaters 6 summary and conclusions we performed a study to develop a newly proposed submerged breakwater with a drainage channel that can control flow at the open inlet between two submerged breakwaters while efficiently controlling waves without increasing the surface elevation at the rear side of the submerged breakwater first we investigated the hydraulic characteristics of the proposed submerged breakwater that was being developed by carrying out a 2d hydraulic experiment to which an effective drainage channel arrangement was applied next for a 3d numerical simulation we configured the proposed submerged breakwaters in a wave basin together with a realistic beach and we reviewed its effect on the rip current reduction at the open inlet the main findings obtained in this study can be described as follows in the 2d experimental analysis we performed 2d hydraulic experiments by applying the optimum layout and the effects on the wave control and surface elevation reduction at the rear side of the proposed submerged breakwater were closely investigated compared to the typical submerged breakwater 1 in the investigation on the reflectivity transmissibility and energy loss resulting from the typical and proposed submerged breakwaters the results show that the reflectivity and energy loss of the proposed submerged breakwater are a little smaller than those of the typical submerged breakwater and the transmissibility is found to be a little larger 2 for the proposed submerged breakwater the surface elevation on the onshore side of the submerged breakwater decreases because the flow moved offshore through the drainage channel and thus there is a decreased surface elevation difference between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater 3 a flow moving offshore through the drainage channel is generated in the proposed submerged breakwater and the mean surface elevation on the onshore side of the submerged breakwater decreases by about 70 9 compared with that for the submerged breakwater without a drainage channel 4 synthetically analyzing the characteristics of the flow field investigated in the experiment as the flow structure circulating current of the newly proposed submerged breakwater shows superior sea water circulation than that of the existing submerged breakwater it is believed to be advantageous from an environmental perspective in the 3d numerical analysis we performed 3d numerical simulations applying the proposed submerged breakwater which was very effective in terms of surface elevation reduction at the rear side of submerged breakwater while its wave control effect was similar to that of the typical submerged breakwater as investigated in the 2d hydraulic experiment in the 3d numerical wave basin we configured two proposed submerged breakwaters that were reviewed in the hydraulic experiment in addition we considered the dimensions of the submerged breakwater and the calculation conditions together with the hydraulic experiment the results of the 3d numerical analysis carried out for the proposed submerged breakwater are as follows 1 in verification of the validity and effectiveness of the 3d numerical model that used the hydraulic experiment conditions 3d numerical model generates suitable time waveforms as measured by the wave gauges on the crest and at the rear side of the proposed submerged breakwater as well as the typical submerged breakwater 2 the wave control function of the proposed submerged breakwater does not show any significant difference compared to that of the typical submerged breakwater even in a 3d wave field where both an open inlet and a beach exist 3 the difference between the surface elevation at the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater is larger in the case of an impermeable submerged breakwater compared to that in the case of a permeable submerged breakwater moreover the smaller ratio of the crest depth to the incident wave height r h i the larger was the increase in the mean surface elevation and the decrease in the mean surface elevation at the rear side of the proposed submerged breakwater is more effective 4 with respect to the effect of the proposed submerged breakwater installation on the control of the rip current at the open inlet it is effective in the condition where there is a large difference between the surface elevation at the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwater for a smaller r h i of the impermeable submerged breakwater therefore we infer that the flow around two submerged breakwaters which can cause scour and affect the stability of the submerged breakwater can be controlled as we reduce the mean surface elevation at the rear side of the submerged breakwater by installing a drainage channel furthermore rip currents flowing offshore through the open inlet between two submerged breakwaters which are generated by the difference in the mean surface elevation between the front and rear sides of the submerged breakwaters can be reduced and subsequently scour around the open inlet can also be reduced acknowledgements this research was a part of the project

22354,this work analyses the higher harmonic wave elevations of focused wave groups based on the assumption of a stokes type nonlinear structure a fully nonlinear potential flow model is employed to generate nonlinear wave groups by the newwave theory which represents an extreme event in a random sea state we present a methodology to generate high quality nonlinear wave groups of a narrow banded wave spectrum in a numerical wave tank a phase manipulation approach is employed to accurately extract the higher harmonic elevations the elevation spectra show clean separation of the first four harmonics comparisons with the experimental data show remarkably good agreements for the higher harmonics we confirm the stokes type underlying nonlinear structure of the harmonic elevations in focused wave groups this is found by simulating wave groups with varying wave steepness and calculating the corresponding elevation coefficients of the higher harmonics the harmonic coefficients are found almost constant against varying steepness an implication of the stokes type structure for the nonlinear wave elevations is that it allows us to estimate the higher harmonics based only on the linear component this is successfully demonstrated by reconstructing a nonlinear focused wave group using the linear newwave model and the coefficients at its higher harmonics keywords fully nonlinear simulation focused wave group higher harmonics stokes expansion 1 introduction in a random sea state an extremely large wave will be part of a wave group rather than in a regular wave train adcock and taylor 2009 extreme waves are usually the most critical to the survival of offshore structures records of those giant waves from instruments in the ocean for example the well known draupner wave described in walker et al 2004 have driven extensive research on the scientific explanation of the formation of them and understanding their characteristics adcock et al 2015 wang and balachandran 2018 attempt to recreate similar extreme waves in the laboratory using a deterministic wave energy spectrum has also been made in recent years such as by buldakov et al 2017 an engineering interest of studying the extreme waves is that these waves would produce significant nonlinear loads which could cause fatal damage to offshore structures understanding the characteristics of the nonlinear extreme waves improves the prediction of wave loading hence the design of offshore structures extreme waves in the ocean are believed to form when the wave components associated with a large number of wave frequencies in a random sea come into phase see a detailed explanation in fedele et al 2016 that is the focusing of a transient wave group the focused wave group has been demonstrated to be the average shape of large waves in a random sea whittaker et al 2016 mathematically the representation of the focused wave group is the scaled autocorrelation function as reported in lindgren 1970 the simplest linear model for a focused wave group might be the newwave presented originally in tromans et al 1991 the ability of the newwave model to represent an extreme wave has been shown in a few sets of field data in deep intermediate and shallow water depths walker et al 2004 whittaker et al 2016 taylor and williams 2004 meanwhile for model tests or simulations in a wave tank an obvious advantage of using a focused wave group against a random sea state is the time savings because the focusing occurs in a very short period of time in such a short period the near field wave is free from contamination of possible reflection from the far end of the tank most of the research work mentioned above investigate the general shape of a focused wave group in the linear or at most second order regime it is well known that higher harmonics can be expected resulting from the strong nonlinear wave wave interactions among the frequencies components the nonlinear schrödinger equation provides a good approximation for the nonlinear evolution of the wave group in deep water lo and mei 1985 trulsen and dysthe 1996 henderson et al 1999 adcock and taylor 2016 in the experimental work in johannessen and swan 2001 and the numerical study in gibson and swan 2007 and adcock and taylor 2016 it is shown that non linearity in focused wave groups leads to significant changes to the shape of the groups groups become taller and narrower with large waves moving towards the front of the groups nonetheless the properties of those individual higher harmonics than the second remains almost unexplored due to the difficulty in accurately extracting the individual higher harmonics there are two reasons the first is that the higher harmonic components could be very small for experiments possibly below the accuracy of confidence of the instruments the second is that the higher harmonic components cannot be easily and cleanly isolated from the total nonlinear wave field due to the spectrum overlap between neighbouring orders of harmonics therefore further study has to be conducted to extract cleanly the higher harmonics and to understand the nonlinear behaviour of the harmonics in an extreme wave since capturing accurately the small higher harmonic elevations might be difficult in a tank test it becomes practical to employ numerical models to replicate the process of the formation of the extreme wave a numerical model that can simulate all nonlinearities associated with the wave group might be the time domain fully nonlinear numerical wave tank nwt the nwt model we employed in this work basically represents a rectangular physical tank and simulates the wave generation and absorption without any assumption to the wave propagation and evolution except for fluid viscosity the fully nonlinear simulation will not lose any higher harmonic components arising from wave wave interactions innovative approach needs to be implemented in the nwt to cleanly extract the harmonics since we are concerned with the properties of each harmonic the method used in this study for decomposing higher harmonic components from a focused wave group is the phase manipulation recently presented in adcock et al 2019 a phase inversion or two phase method has been adopted by baldock et al 1996 and borthwick et al 2006 for analysing the second order wave elevations with the two phase method one can obtain the odd and even harmonics by combining two realizations or response time series where the two wave groups are of 180 out of phase fitzgerald et al 2014 generalized the two phase method to a four phase method similarly the first four harmonics can be separated by combining the four wave groups of 90 phase apart the approach assumes a stokes type harmonic structure of the wave elevations for a narrow banded wave group the regular wave amplitude a can be generalized to a time varying amplitude a t for the focused wave group owing to the fact that the amplitude a t is modulated and slowly varying near focusing this work presents a fully nonlinear potential flow model for simulating unidirectional focused wave groups in a rectangular tank inviscid fluid and irrotational flow is assumed following the potential flow theory the fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions are fulfilled during the time domain simulation with the exact free surface captured in time marching a higher order boundary element method hobem is adopted to solve the boundary value problem enclosing the fluid of interest we generate the focused wave group from a given wave energy spectrum phase control is implemented at the wavemaker in order to set apart the desired wave phases the primary purpose of this work is to investigate the characteristics of the higher harmonics in a focused wave group via clean harmonic decomposition and to confirm the underlying structure of these harmonics upon confirmation of the stokes type nonlinear structure the ultimate goal is to approximate the higher harmonics using the linear wave group which is simply the newwave this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly presents the governing equations of the nonlinear potential flow based nwt the boundary conditions and the boundary element method implementation of generating the focused wave group is also described section 3 focuses on validation of the numerical model by comparing with the existing experimental results section 4 presents the main results of this work we first revisit the cases in baldock et al 1996 and use the two phase method to extra the odd and even harmonic wave elevations the four phase method for extraction of the higher harmonics is then demonstrated by simulating the recent experiments the separation is found very clean up to 4th harmonic we confirm the stokes type structure of the higher order nonlinear elevations through simulations with varying wave steepness the agreement between the fully nonlinear simulation and the test data is remarkably well the harmonic elevation coefficients for the wave group defined similarly in the stokes wave model are obtained finally we reconstruct the higher harmonic wave elevations from the linear wave group with the obtained harmonic coefficients concluding remarks are drawn in the last section 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 model description we employ a numerical tank technique to simulate the focused wave groups the rectangular numerical wave tank is defined in fig 1 similar to a physical tank a narrow long tank is modelled the schematic figure consists of a wavemaker at the left boundary of the tank and a numerical beach placed on the surface at the far end of the tank the coordinate system o x y z has its origin on the undisturbed water surface in the centre of the tank with z axis pointing upward the computational domain includes all the wetted boundaries in particular s w m and s f represent the wavemaker and the free water surface respectively it is a three dimensional tank and the two side walls are not shown in the diagram the fully nonlinear potential flow theory is well established we briefly summarize the governing equations here on the assumptions that the fluid is incompressible and inviscid and the flow irrotational a scalar velocity potential φ x y z t can be defined u φ that satisfies the laplace equation in the fluid domain 1 2 φ 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 0 for the fully nonlinear potential flow model the fully nonlinear kinematic and dynamic conditions on the free surface s f in the lagrangian description are to satisfy 2 d x d t φ 3 d φ d t g z 1 2 φ φ where d d t t v is the material derivative with respect to fluid particle velocity v on the free surface x denotes position of points on the free surface and g is the gravitational acceleration difficulties arise to incorporate the nonlinear effects of these boundary conditions into the solution procedure in the fully nonlinear simulation the exact free surface has to be captured at every time step to update the nonlinear free surface in the time domain the mixed eulerian lagrangian mel algorithm is applied in the model the time marching scheme is the runge kutta 4th order method which has been shown numerically stable and accurate the boundary condition on the wavemaker s w m is defined as 4 φ x u t where u t is the velocity on the wavemaker along the x direction the velocity will be prescribed using the newwave theory introduced later in the model a piston like wavemaker is implemented the impermeable boundary condition on side walls is 5 φ n 0 the numerical beach or artificial damping layer in fig 1 is to absorb the wave energy at the far end of the tank in this model a simple method is adopted i e modifying only the kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions of eq 2 and eq 3 by adding a damping term over the damping layer length the modified free surface boundary conditions become 6 d x d t φ ν x d x x e 7 d φ d t g z 1 2 φ φ ν x d φ where x d is the distance from a point located in the damping layer to the staring point of the damping layer ν x d is the damping coefficient and x e x e y e 0 is the reference location at the still water surface the damping coefficient is imposed to be continuous and tuned to the peak frequency ω of the wave group the damping coefficient is computed according to the method in ferrant 1993 a higher order boundary element method is employed to solve the boundary value problem the numerical method is briefly summarized here the boundary integral equation bie can be formulated by the green s second identity considering a green function g x x 0 which is a velocity potential at a field point x 0 due to a distributed source at x it satisfies the laplace equation 2 g 0 in the fluid domain except at its singular point x 0 applying green s second identity by integration over the fluid domain surface enclosed by all the boundaries we have 8 c x 0 φ x 0 s g x x 0 φ x n φ x g x x 0 n d s where c x 0 is the solid angle at field point x 0 and n is measured from the source point x the solid angle c x 0 however is difficult to evaluate directly in the model we follow the treatment in teng and eatock taylor 1995 who employed the physical argument that a uniform potential applied over an enclosed fluid domain produces no flux therefore by considering a homogeneous dirichlet problem where a uniform field i e φ constant 0 is specified over the entire integral boundary the above eq 8 becomes 9 c x 0 s g x x 0 n d s in this way the solid angle c x 0 can be expressed as only a function of the boundary shape which is easily evaluated a simple 3d rankine source and its image with respect to the horizontal seabed z h can be chosen as the green function the green function is then written as 10 g x x 0 1 4 π 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 3 1 r 4 where 11 r 1 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 r 2 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 r 3 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 h 2 r 4 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 h 2 to numerically discretize the boundaries we introduce the shape functions n j ξ η in each boundary element where ξ η is the local element coordinate thus we are able to express the position coordinate x ξ η the velocity potential φ ξ η and its derivatives within this element in terms of the nodal values the boundary integral equation eq 8 can be written in its discretized form as 12 c x 0 φ x 0 n 1 n m 1 m g x m x 0 j 1 k n j ξ η φ n j g x m x 0 n j 1 k n j ξ η φ j ω m j m ξ η where k is the total number of nodes in the element i e 6 for a triangular element and 8 for a quadrilateral element n the total number of elements over the computational boundaries m the number of sampling points in each element in the standard gauss legendre method ω m the integral weight at mth sampling point and j m ξ η the jacobian transformation from the global to the local coordinate details of calculating the integral weight and jacobian in the standard gauss legendre method can be found in gernot et al 2008 for each field point we have a bie as eq 12 with the bies for all nodes on the boundaries a linear equation system can be assembled and solved details about the higher order boundary element method for solving the above boundary value problem and its numerical implementation can be found in feng 2015 to accelerate the computation we implement parallelization to the code using openmp 2015 the computational effort is mainly at assembling the dense asymmetrical matrix of influence coefficient from bies the assembling has to be performed every time step as the nonlinear free surface is updated each time step therefore we mainly parallelize the assembling subroutine for the influence matrix in addition an efficient open source solver lapack 2017 is adopted to solved the linear equation system the simulations were carried out on the high performance computing facility arc richards 2015 at the university of oxford with multithread 2 2 wave generation key to the work here is to generate high quality focused wave groups as an extension of the numerical tank designed for regular waves bai et al 2014 feng and bai 2015 2017 we generate a focused wave group by prescribing the proper phases of each frequency component for a given wave energy spectrum s ω the free surface elevation and the velocity potential based on the linear newwave model can be calculated as 13 η i x t n 1 n a n cos k n x x c ω n t t c 14 φ i x z t n 1 n a n ω n k n cosh k n z h sinh k n h sin k n x x c ω n t t c where a n is the wave amplitude ω n the wave frequency k n the wavenumber of the nth component the water depth is h the focused time is set as t c and the focused position x c the total number of component n should be large enough to reproduce the desired spectrum and n 200 is adopted in this study the amplitude a n ω of each wave component is calculated by 15 a n ω a s ω n δ ω n 1 n s ω n δ ω where a n 1 n a n is defined as the linearized wave group amplitude the newwave profile is simply the scaled autocorrelation function i e the inversed fourier transform of the energy density spectrum for the underlying sea state and the amplitude components are proportional to s ω n δ ω σ 2 the sum σ 2 n 1 n s ω n δ ω is the variance of the wave elevation in the numerical tank as in a physical tank to make the desired wave group a proper transfer function f t ω has to be applied to the prescribed displacement and velocity for the wavemaker therefore the desired free surface elevation at the wavemaker is η i x w m t f t ω and the velocity distribution on the wavemaker becomes u t φ i x w m z t x f t ω with x w m the position of the wavemaker for the piston type wavemaker used in the model there is a π 2 phase difference between its displacement and the wave elevation on the wavemaker the above equations will generate waves focusing at x c at the time instant t c according to linear wave theory however as the wave group evolution is nonlinear in this model both the focusing location and time would slightly shift due to nonlinear dispersion and wave wave interactions for decades a classic linear transfer function proposed by ursell et al 1960 has been used in wave generation problems the function based on the linear wave theory is expressed as 16 f t ω 2 sinh 2 k h sinh k h cosh k h k h in our model we compute the numerical transfer function by carrying out regular wave simulations for a particular depth regular waves of varying frequencies at very low amplitude k a 0 01 are generated and the transfer function is then estimated from the normalized by the input amplitude steady state surface elevation first order position control of the wavemaker using the numerically obtained transfer function is applied in our numerical model a comparison of transfer functions of the numerical tank with the ursell model is shown in fig 2 for the water depth 1 8 m the difference is mostly in the frequency range 3 6 rad s it is established that the linear ursell model eq 16 works best in shallow water regime at k h π 10 in our case with h 1 8 m the corresponding regime of wave frequency is ω 0 75 rad s this is consistent with fig 2 that the numerically obtained function value is approaching the ursell model when frequency becomes small in our simulations the input frequencies cover a range of ω 1 4 8 1 rad s in which the ursell model is not accurate for very short waves or higher wave frequencies the asymptotic value for both the ursell model and the numerical model is 2 0 the difference we see from fig 2 is that the numerically obtained transfer function value reaches 2 0 at a faster rate given the appreciable discrepancy between the numerical and the simple ursell model we adopt the numerically obtained transfer function in our simulations for wave groups from a wave spectrum a much finer frequency resolution is required between the cut off frequencies 0 5 f p 3 0 f p a fitting function is needed to estimate the transfer function value at each frequency component discretized from the wave spectrum here we adopt a simple polynomial fitting at the order of 6 which works fine in the frequency range of interest as shown in fig 2 2 3 phase manipulation approach a good model for the nonlinear harmonic elevations appears to be that they follow a stokes like form thus 17 η t o t a l a s 11 cos ϕ a 2 s 20 s 22 cos 2 ϕ a 3 s 31 cos ϕ s 33 cos 3 ϕ a 4 s 40 s 42 cos 2 ϕ s 44 cos 4 ϕ o a 5 up to fourth order of the amplitude a the coefficients s m n represent the coefficients corresponding to super sum m n and sub difference m n 2 harmonics and ϕ ω t ϕ 0 is the phase of the linear component of the wave the ϕ 0 is the initial phase to be prescribed at the wavemaker in the case of a wave group it is assumed the time varying amplitude is modulated such that it is slowly changing near the focus time this requires the wave spectrum to be narrow banded mei et al 2005 to extract the different harmonics we use a phase manipulation technique following fitzgerald et al 2014 who studied the wave forces on a surface piercing column we alter the phase at the wavemaker in certain increments this allows us to combine different phase results in order to separate different harmonics in particular we make the incoming waves with a phase shift of ϕ 0 0 90 180 and 270 we then submit them into eq 17 by linearly combining the four corresponding responses η 0 η 90 η 180 and η 270 the first four separated harmonics read 18a η 0 η 90 h η 180 η 270 h 4 a s 11 a 3 s 31 cos ω t 18b η 0 η 90 η 180 η 270 4 a 2 s 22 a 4 s 42 cos 2 ω t 18c η 0 η 90 h η 180 η 270 h 4 a 3 s 33 cos 3 ω t 18d η 0 η 90 η 180 η 270 4 a 2 s 20 a 4 s 40 a 4 s 44 cos 4 ω t where the accuracy is truncated to fourth order and the superscript h denotes the hilbert transform of the time signal clearly to separate the harmonics up to fourth order using this approach we have to repeat each simulation four times in a relative simpler model the odd and even harmonics can be separated using only the η 0 and η 180 signals the averaged difference and sum of the these two signals give up to 4th harmonic 19a η 0 η 180 2 a s 11 a 3 s 31 cos ω t a 3 s 33 cos 3 ω t 19b η 0 η 180 2 a 2 s 20 a 2 s 22 a 4 s 42 cos 2 ω t a 4 s 44 cos 4 ω t we adopt the four phase method in this work in order to obtain cleanly separated harmonics up to 4th order overlaps between the first and third second and fourth harmonics could occur in the two phase method as discussed in fitzgerald et al 2014 for instance one has to apply a bandpass filter to further separate the cos ω t term and the cos 3 ω t term from eq 19a however choosing proper frequency bandwidth could be problematic when the bound harmonics associated with cos ω t have a significant overlap with the cos 3 ω t component 3 convergence and validation we consider the experimental investigation performed by baldock et al 1996 who conducted the tests in a long rectangular tank the tank is 20 m long and 0 3 m wide with a water depth of 0 7 m to optimise the computational efficiency a 10 m tank is simulated in the numerical model the origin is set at the centre of the tank i e x c 0 0 m we consider two cases in our numerical simulations case b and case d which correspond to a broad banded and narrow banded wave spectrum respectively case b has a frequency range of f 0 71 1 66 hz and case d with f 0 83 1 25 hz in each case two amplitudes a 0 022 m and a 0 055 m of the wave group are simulated 3 1 mesh convergence convergence is of critical importance when it comes to the higher harmonics which is of our main concern here the element size on the free surface shall be governed by the shortest wavelength and its higher harmonic components we test three mesh configurations as we simulate only unidirectional wave groups two elements are distributed in the lateral direction mesh 1 corresponds to about 15 elements per shortest wavelength and mesh 2 has nearly a twice denser mesh configuration and mesh 3 has a total number of elements about three times that of mesh 1 the three meshes have 6661 11233 and 16833 nodes respectively distributed over the computational boundaries it shall be reminded that higher order elements are adopted in the model the normalized wave elevations at the middle of the tank x 0 0 m for the three mesh configurations are shown in fig 3 a and the corresponding energy density spectra are displayed in fig 3 b the discrepancies are almost invisible from the time histories except at some crests and troughs one can tell the difference however from the energy density spectra in order to show the small values at high frequencies we plot the spectra in log scale for frequencies less than 1 5 hz the spectra are identical for the three meshes relative large discrepancies appear between mesh 1 and the other two mesh cases when f 1 5 hz we adopt a mesh configuration similar to mesh 2 in the following studies to compromise accuracy and computational efficiency for the cases where a jonswap spectrum is used we set the mesh density level according to the peak wavelength that dominates the wave group s main characteristics the mesh convergence is carefully tested as well because we are aiming at capturing the very small higher harmonic components 3 2 effectiveness of damping zone the effectiveness of the damping zone is governed by the long wave components in a wave group despite the fact that the focus time regime is very short and the reflection from the end of the tank is not critical an important advantage of using a focused wave group it is worthwhile to check the reflection ratio for a particular setup as it is well known that in a physical tank the long waves are difficult to be absorbed by the damping beach we shall see the performance of the numerical damping layer in the present model when generating wave groups fig 4 shows the free surface elevations for three different setups of damping length as 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 times the largest wavelength λ m in fig 4 a we can see the difference at the peaks and troughs near the focus time at x 0 0 m a closer examination reveals that the peak elevation for the damping length 1 0 λ m is over predicted while the peaks of the damping length 1 5 λ m and 2 0 λ m are almost identical it is clear from the elevations at the end of the tank x 4 9 m in fig 4 c that there is about 1 reflection for the damping length 1 0 λ m while the reflection is only 0 2 and 0 02 for 1 5 λ m and 2 0 λ m respectively the reflected component is dominated by the wave group s main frequency this indicates that at most the first harmonic component of the wave group would be contaminated nevertheless we apply a 2 0 λ m damping zone to ensure minimum reflection 3 3 validation we now compare the fully nonlinear simulations with the laboratory tests reported in baldock et al 1996 the time histories of the wave elevations near the focus time for the broad banded spectrum case b are shown in fig 5 with two wave amplitudes a 0 022 m and a 0 055 m to demonstrate the nonlinear effect linear prediction using the newwave model is also included with low wave steepness in fig 5 a the numerical simulation the measurement and the linear result are generally very close discrepancies arise between the linear and nonlinear results for higher steepness in fig 5 b the nonlinearity clearly sharpens the crest and flattens the trough as expected better agreement is observed between the nonlinear model and the measured result note that the focus location for the steep wave is shifted downstream at around x 0 3 m the experimental observation in baldock et al 1996 shows constantly enlarged down shift with increasing amplitudes the down shifting is known to be due to third order wave wave interactions in a wave group and the distance of shifting depends on the nonlinearity and the spectrum bandwidth similar conclusions about the down shift can be drawn from the narrow banded case d in fig 6 the difference is that as the bandwidth reduces the shift of the focus location is more pronounced fig 6 b shows the elevations at the focus position at x 0 8 m the agreement between the numerical model and the measurement is very good especially at the peaks and troughs the linear model under predicts the peak value about 30 nevertheless to further confirm the accuracy of capturing the nonlinearity one would need to compare the detailed individual harmonics at higher orders this is one of the main objectives of this study and is demonstrated later here we have shown that the nonlinear numerical model is able to predict the nonlinear wave group very well comparing with the linear model 4 higher harmonic analysis the method of extracting the higher harmonics for focused wave groups is based on the phase manipulation technique in most of the previous studies such as in baldock et al 1996 borthwick et al 2006 and zang et al 2006 the two phase or phase inversion method was used in contrast to the four phase method described in eq 18 which is used in this study the two phase method in eq 19 makes use of the time series of only the 0 and the 180 phases the odd and even harmonic components can be separated however in the cases with strong wave wave interactions the elevation energy spectrum would show overlapping between neighbouring frequencies fitzgerald et al 2014 the two phase method might not be able to separate all the harmonic components cleanly thus the four phase method is more appropriate to obtain the accurate harmonics in the following we first present briefly the separated odd and even harmonics by the two phase method then we focus on demonstrating the four phase method and clean separation of the harmonics up to fourth order 4 1 two phase extraction we take again the above cases in baldock et al 1996 as an example the decomposed odd and even harmonics of elevations near focusing for case b and case d with a 0 055 m are shown in fig 7 a and c respectively their corresponding spectra are displayed on the right column as discussed before the nonlinearity characteristics for the narrow banded and broad banded spectra are different this might be better illustrated from the separated spectra i e the higher harmonic components the spectra are plotted in log scale in order to identify clearly the energy distribution at higher harmonics for the broad banded case b in fig 7 b the separation seems to work well up to second order the first harmonic in solid line is covered in the input range of 0 71 1 66 hz with some tailing reaching 2 4 hz however the second harmonic in the dash line spreads in a very large frequency range making it impossible to determine its harmonic bound any component above 3 0 hz is not separated for both odd and even harmonics for the narrow banded case d in fig 7 d the first and third harmonics are easily identified from frequency distribution of the odd harmonics though there might be some overlap between 2 0 3 0 hz the second sum harmonic becomes cleaner comparing with case b ideally the second harmonic shall cover the range of 2 0 83 1 25 hz where 0 83 1 25 hz is the linear range due to some energy redistribution at the first harmonic tailing the second harmonic frequency range is slightly broadened up to about 3 hz one might be able to extract the individual harmonic component by frequency filtering with carefully selected frequency range as done in chen et al 2018 nevertheless selection of frequency filtering range can be ambiguous in many cases in terms of harmonic separation the phase manipulation technique seems to work better for narrow banded spectrum indeed narrow band is one of the assumptions for stocks expanssion to be applied to focused wave groups 4 2 four phase extraction we now apply the four phase based method to extract the harmonics the purpose is to explore the detailed underlying structure of the higher harmonic wave elevations we set up a tank of 15 m long and 0 2 m wide and the water depth is 1 8 m a narrow banded jonswap spectrum is used its peak frequency is f p 0 429 hz the cutoff of input wave frequency is 0 5 f p 3 0 f p the jonswap spectrum in this range is discretized into 200 frequency components for a focused wave group we use the peak wave frequency and wavelength as its characteristic property the water depth is intermediate with k p h 1 48 note that the stokes wave theory breaks down at a shallow water depth various wave amplitudes are simulated the setup of the case corresponds to the recent experiments conducted at the kelvin hydrodynamic laboratory in the university of strathclyde details about the setup of the experiments are described in the recent conference paper in adcock et al 2019 the time histories of the total wave elevations for the four phases at the centre of the tank x 0 0 m are shown in fig 8 the linear wave group amplitude is a 0 213 m the elevations are normalized by a the linear wave group is set to focus at t 25 s the actual focus time would slightly delay and the focus location would shift downstream as discussed previously the slight shift of focusing in time and position does not matter for the following analysis of the peak responses because we compute the envelope of the time series instead of the maximum value without detailed calculation from the figure the elevations of the four phases preserve a stable phase difference near the focus time and they are within a same envelope as expected applying the linear combinations according to eq 18 the resulting four time histories of the first four harmonics are shown in fig 10 the corresponding spectra in log scale are shown in fig 9 the frequency is non dimensionalized by the peak frequency the separation of the first four harmonics η 1 η 2 η 3 η 4 is very successful no overlap is present among the four the second subharmonic or difference η 2 covering 0 2 0 f p can be easily extracted from the fourth harmonic the blue dot dash line as their frequency ranges are largely apart the linear component covers the input frequency range higher harmonic frequencies are slightly broadened for instance the second sum covers the range of 1 0 f p 5 f p the peak frequency of each harmonic corresponds to n f p for harmonics higher than 4th the spectrum is down to the noise level and cannot be further separated we see from the time histories in fig 10 that the peaks of the higher harmonics are nicely aligned with the linear suggesting the wave crest can be significantly enhanced if the nonlinear components are considerable in this case the second harmonic peak is about 20 of the linear the third and fourth harmonics are much lower they are really localized appearing within about 2 s near focusing yet the small higher harmonics can excite possible large resonant structural response in the environment if the offshore structure s natural frequency happens to be in this range direct comparisons of the elevations particularly the higher harmonics are made with the experimental results the same approach was used in the experiments to obtain the harmonics the results for two amplitudes a 0 134 m and a 0 213 m are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively we shift the time histories such that the focusing time is at t 0 0 s the nth harmonics are normalized by a n for both cases the linear elevations agree very well between the numerics and the experiments the second difference η 2 shows a significant set down of the wave group the numerical result in fig 11 b shows the typical set down at focusing which is a long but smooth component some wavy component appears in the experimental result due to the energy leakage from the linear or higher harmonics the agreement is much better for a 0 213 m in fig 12 b both the trough and the overall trend very good agreements are also observed in the second sum harmonics except after the time t 7 0 s when a large component appears in the numerical result this is believed to be due to the presence of the second order error wave generated at the wavemaker the presence and effect of error wave is extensively discussed in orszaghova et al 2014 the source of the error wave could be the first order position control of the wavemaker used in the model its effect on the second order component was discussed in spinneken and swan 2009 nevertheless the error wave is much delayed to the main wave group as higher frequency waves travel slower it will not affect the magnitude of the main group a relatively large discrepancy particularly in phase appears in the third harmonic in fig 11 d the experimental time series seems to have a trough focus at a time instant later than t 0 0 s while the numerical result focusses at t 0 0 s the phase modification due to third order resonant wave wave interactions see recently bonnefoy et al 2016 could be the explanation for the delay in the focused wave group however the discrepancy is not observed for a 0 213 m in fig 12 d note that the third harmonic elevation is very small in value given the scrutinous comparison performed above we are confident that the numerical model is highly accurate in predicting the higher harmonics of focused wave groups at the same time the four phase decomposition approach is quite successful for the extraction of higher harmonics further insight can be revealed from the time evolution of the wave profile of each harmonic along the tank in fig 13 where the first three harmonics are shown this is obtained by recording the wave elevation at every point along the tank applying the four phase combination method to each point gives the responses at each harmonic in the time domain we then plot the wave profile of each harmonic along the tank at every time step this post processing could be time consuming depending on the resolution of the free surface mesh in the figures each line shows the wave profile at a certain time step the bold red line shows the profile at the focused time note that the time steps for the three harmonics are different as they evolute at different time scales the linear wave profile in fig 13 a covers a time period more than three times longer than that in fig 13 c we see that the linear wave group has a smooth focusing and de focusing process with a relatively long wavelength in fig 13 b the error wave behind the main group is visible in the top left triangular zone generally the phase speed of the second harmonic is stable in contrast the third harmonic profile shows some randomness of its phase over the focusing and de focusing time period as explained the reason might be the underlying third order resonant wave wave interactions causing energy transfer between different frequency components it is also noticed that the third harmonic component only becomes significant near the focused time and near the focused location i e it is compactly localized however it may cause resonance if a structure is in presence which usually has a higher natural frequency than the linear frequency but near the triple frequency to see the separated wave profile in space clearly we present the decomposed harmonic elevations at the focused time along the centerline of the tank in fig 14 we see that the second harmonic elevation in space has the same phase with the first it sharpens the peak and flattens the trough of the linear wave profile the third harmonic profile is only visible near the focusing location x 0 0 m 4 3 harmonic coefficients in view of the stokes like harmonics of a focused wave group in eq 17 we can treat the time varying amplitude as the envelope of the time series using the peak value of the envelope we are able to compute the corresponding nth harmonic coefficient as 20 s n n max ξ n a n where ξ n is the envelope of the time series the envelope is computed by ξ n η n 2 η h n 2 the subscript h represents its hilbert transform to resolve the coefficient and the underlying structure of the harmonics it is necessary to perform simulations using various wave amplitudes fig 15 shows the second and third harmonic coefficients s 22 and s 33 against the wave steepness k p a 0 05 0 25 the cross is the experimental result the short horizontal lines represent some theoretical predictions which are independent on the wave steepness to keep the figure compact we plot the horizontal lines over the range of k p a 0 0 04 in fig 15 a the solid black line is the prediction using the method presented by dalzell 1999 with modification for a wave group the original dalzell model considers the wave wave interaction of two waves we extend the model for the wave group by considering the interactions between each possible pair of wave components in the group the modified formulation for the second order elevation is presented in the appendix the dot line is simply the regular wave stokes second order coefficient and the dot dash line is the stokes coefficient in deep water the numerical second harmonic coefficient s 22 shows more or less a constant value about 0 74 over the steepness range there is slight increment when the wave is steep near k p a 0 20 this trend is consistent with the experimental results where there is minor scattering it should be borne in mind that in the tests the actual value of the second harmonic peak is in the level of millimetre or smaller which is to the accuracy of wave gauges for the numerical model probing the small wave elevations is not an issue the averaged numerical s 22 agrees very well with the modified dalzell model and both are about 10 higher than the stokes coefficient the corresponding coefficient in deep water s 22 1 2 k p is much lower this is expected since the wave nonlinearity typically weakens with the increase of water depth the third harmonic coefficient s 33 of the experiments is more scattering than the second the scattering seems to occur either at low steepness or high steepness ranges for the very mild wave possibly the wave gauges could not capture the tiny component at the third harmonic for the relatively steep wave the third order resonant wave wave interaction would occur breaking down the stokes like nonlinear structure nonetheless the numerical results are still constant against the steepness again the averaged numerical coefficient s 33 is close to that of the experiments the regular wave stokes third order coefficient underestimates the test results by about 30 though close in any case the focused wave group is different from a regular wave the nonlinear wave wave interaction could play an important role in modifying the peak or trough of a focused wave group especially the third harmonic it might be interesting to study the variation of the harmonic coefficient against the wavenumber at a constant water depth the second harmonic coefficient as a function of k p h is depicted in fig 16 here we investigate three water depths i e h 0 5 m 1 8 m 10 m in each figure we plot results of the numerical model the modified dalzell model and the stokes coefficient for the small water depth in fig 16 a we see a significant drop of s 22 when k p h 1 0 at shallow water regime the numerical result seems to be between the dalzell s and the stokes coefficients with the stokes coefficient slightly higher than the other two the trend however changes when k p h 1 5 the stokes coefficient is slightly lower there is an intersection near k p h 1 5 and similar intersection is present for the 1 8 m depth case in fig 16 b in deep water the coefficient increases almost linearly with k p h the discrepancies among the numerical results dalzell s model and stokes seem consistent the same conclusion can be drawn from fig 16 c with h 10 m it is worthy pointing out that we use a wave steepness about k p a 0 1 for the numerical simulations the second order coefficient is in the order of a 2 4 4 estimation of higher harmonics from linear wave a primary purpose of obtaining the harmonic coefficients is to estimate the higher harmonics using the time series of the linear wave elevation η 1 the total wave elevation can be approximated as 21 η η 1 s 22 a 2 η 1 2 η h 1 2 s 33 a 3 η 1 3 3 η 1 η h 1 2 s 44 a 4 η 1 4 6 η 1 η h 1 2 η h 1 4 we take the case where f p 0 429 hz and a 0 213 m as an example we compute the harmonic coefficient s n n according to eq 20 up to 5th order the stokes type structure indicates the harmonic component shall have the form η ˆ n a n s n n cos n ω t φ n where a t is the linear amplitude in practice this can be obtained from the newwave model and φ n is the phase of the harmonic response note that the coefficient s n n is not a function of the wave steepness estimation of cos n ω t φ n for each higher harmonic from the linear η 1 and its hilbert transform η h 1 is documented in the appendix in walker et al 2004 the estimated time series of the harmonic elevations are shown in fig 17 the solid line is the direct results from the numerical simulation and the dash line is estimated using the reconstruction model eq 21 the harmonic coefficients s n n utilized in the reconstruction model are obtained from the numerical simulation they are the averaged s n n over the varying k p a we see that the overall reconstruction is successful up to 5th harmonic the total elevation is well estimated small discrepancy appears at the second harmonic near the focus time however the possible error wave after 30 s cannot be captured this is not a surprise because the reconstructed higher harmonic elevations will not have any wiggle following the main group the reconstructed harmonics are also more symmetric about the focus time than the original extracted ones because the linear component is essentially symmetric from the total elevation we see that the reconstructed elevation is almost identical to the original except for the small discrepancy after 30 s which is due to the presence of the second order error wave again the higher harmonic components above the third order are generally very small some noise seems to appear in the fifth harmonic nevertheless we can reconfirm the underlying stokes type structure of the nonlinear harmonics we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate the higher harmonics of a focused wave group by its linear wave elevation with the harmonic coefficients 5 concluding remarks we present a fully nonlinear potential flow model with implementation of generation of focused wave groups a phase manipulation method is adopted to decompose the harmonic components of the nonlinear wave elevation mesh convergence at the higher harmonics is carefully carried out the four phase method is demonstrated successful for separating the higher harmonics in the nonlinear wave group direct comparison of the harmonic time histories is made with the recent experiments the agreement is generally good the second harmonic from the numerical model shows a secondary group following the main group which however is not present in the experiment it is believed to be the effect of error wave of the second order the error wave is much delayed and has no influence on the main group small discrepancies are also observed in the third harmonic elevation while the third harmonic peak values are close for the numerical and experimental results there exists a slight phase difference this is explained by the phase modification resulting from resonant third order wave wave interactions which may not be captured in the numerical model nevertheless the absolute higher harmonic components are very small the differences are not visible from the total elevations the evolution of the decomposed higher harmonic wave profile is illustrated both the linear and second harmonics show smooth profiles along the tank the third is localized and wavy due to its short wave length and possible phase modification to confirm the stokes like structure of the higher harmonics we simulate the wave groups with varying amplitudes we compare the harmonic coefficients with both the tests and the theory at increasing wave steepness the second order coefficient s 22 is almost constant against the steepness for the numerical results small variation is present in the test data the second order wave wave interaction model by dalzell 1999 is extended for a focused wave group the modified dalzell model shows good prediction while the stokes second order model for regular waves slightly under predicts the second order coefficient for the third order coefficient s 33 the numerical results are almost constant with increasing wave steepness while the variation in the test data is considerable especially when the steepness is either low or high again the stokes third order model under predicts s 33 with the harmonic coefficients up to fifth order we estimate the higher harmonics from the linear elevation the reconstructed elevations agree well with the original confirming again the stokes type structure for the higher harmonics the harmonic component coefficients are not a function of the wave steepness suggesting one can estimate the harmonics from only the simple linear model for both mild and steep waves while the second harmonic coefficient for the focused wave group can be directly computed from the extended dalzell model higher harmonic coefficients for any general case cannot be easily obtained except running nonlinear simulations future investigations would be made to study the wave wave interactions at the third and higher orders leading to the quick estimation of the harmonic coefficients acknowledgements this work was funded by uk china offshore renewable

the university of oxford advanced research computing arc facility in carrying out the numerical work appendix the mathematical model of second order wave wave interaction for two regular waves was presented by dalzell 1999 we modify it for a focused wave group in a random sea state this is done by considering every pair of two components in a wave group and summing up all the possible pairs the formulation in dalzell 1999 considers directional spreading here we set up the direction of all the wave component as zero making it unidirectional the regular wave wave interaction resulting from two

22354,this work analyses the higher harmonic wave elevations of focused wave groups based on the assumption of a stokes type nonlinear structure a fully nonlinear potential flow model is employed to generate nonlinear wave groups by the newwave theory which represents an extreme event in a random sea state we present a methodology to generate high quality nonlinear wave groups of a narrow banded wave spectrum in a numerical wave tank a phase manipulation approach is employed to accurately extract the higher harmonic elevations the elevation spectra show clean separation of the first four harmonics comparisons with the experimental data show remarkably good agreements for the higher harmonics we confirm the stokes type underlying nonlinear structure of the harmonic elevations in focused wave groups this is found by simulating wave groups with varying wave steepness and calculating the corresponding elevation coefficients of the higher harmonics the harmonic coefficients are found almost constant against varying steepness an implication of the stokes type structure for the nonlinear wave elevations is that it allows us to estimate the higher harmonics based only on the linear component this is successfully demonstrated by reconstructing a nonlinear focused wave group using the linear newwave model and the coefficients at its higher harmonics keywords fully nonlinear simulation focused wave group higher harmonics stokes expansion 1 introduction in a random sea state an extremely large wave will be part of a wave group rather than in a regular wave train adcock and taylor 2009 extreme waves are usually the most critical to the survival of offshore structures records of those giant waves from instruments in the ocean for example the well known draupner wave described in walker et al 2004 have driven extensive research on the scientific explanation of the formation of them and understanding their characteristics adcock et al 2015 wang and balachandran 2018 attempt to recreate similar extreme waves in the laboratory using a deterministic wave energy spectrum has also been made in recent years such as by buldakov et al 2017 an engineering interest of studying the extreme waves is that these waves would produce significant nonlinear loads which could cause fatal damage to offshore structures understanding the characteristics of the nonlinear extreme waves improves the prediction of wave loading hence the design of offshore structures extreme waves in the ocean are believed to form when the wave components associated with a large number of wave frequencies in a random sea come into phase see a detailed explanation in fedele et al 2016 that is the focusing of a transient wave group the focused wave group has been demonstrated to be the average shape of large waves in a random sea whittaker et al 2016 mathematically the representation of the focused wave group is the scaled autocorrelation function as reported in lindgren 1970 the simplest linear model for a focused wave group might be the newwave presented originally in tromans et al 1991 the ability of the newwave model to represent an extreme wave has been shown in a few sets of field data in deep intermediate and shallow water depths walker et al 2004 whittaker et al 2016 taylor and williams 2004 meanwhile for model tests or simulations in a wave tank an obvious advantage of using a focused wave group against a random sea state is the time savings because the focusing occurs in a very short period of time in such a short period the near field wave is free from contamination of possible reflection from the far end of the tank most of the research work mentioned above investigate the general shape of a focused wave group in the linear or at most second order regime it is well known that higher harmonics can be expected resulting from the strong nonlinear wave wave interactions among the frequencies components the nonlinear schrödinger equation provides a good approximation for the nonlinear evolution of the wave group in deep water lo and mei 1985 trulsen and dysthe 1996 henderson et al 1999 adcock and taylor 2016 in the experimental work in johannessen and swan 2001 and the numerical study in gibson and swan 2007 and adcock and taylor 2016 it is shown that non linearity in focused wave groups leads to significant changes to the shape of the groups groups become taller and narrower with large waves moving towards the front of the groups nonetheless the properties of those individual higher harmonics than the second remains almost unexplored due to the difficulty in accurately extracting the individual higher harmonics there are two reasons the first is that the higher harmonic components could be very small for experiments possibly below the accuracy of confidence of the instruments the second is that the higher harmonic components cannot be easily and cleanly isolated from the total nonlinear wave field due to the spectrum overlap between neighbouring orders of harmonics therefore further study has to be conducted to extract cleanly the higher harmonics and to understand the nonlinear behaviour of the harmonics in an extreme wave since capturing accurately the small higher harmonic elevations might be difficult in a tank test it becomes practical to employ numerical models to replicate the process of the formation of the extreme wave a numerical model that can simulate all nonlinearities associated with the wave group might be the time domain fully nonlinear numerical wave tank nwt the nwt model we employed in this work basically represents a rectangular physical tank and simulates the wave generation and absorption without any assumption to the wave propagation and evolution except for fluid viscosity the fully nonlinear simulation will not lose any higher harmonic components arising from wave wave interactions innovative approach needs to be implemented in the nwt to cleanly extract the harmonics since we are concerned with the properties of each harmonic the method used in this study for decomposing higher harmonic components from a focused wave group is the phase manipulation recently presented in adcock et al 2019 a phase inversion or two phase method has been adopted by baldock et al 1996 and borthwick et al 2006 for analysing the second order wave elevations with the two phase method one can obtain the odd and even harmonics by combining two realizations or response time series where the two wave groups are of 180 out of phase fitzgerald et al 2014 generalized the two phase method to a four phase method similarly the first four harmonics can be separated by combining the four wave groups of 90 phase apart the approach assumes a stokes type harmonic structure of the wave elevations for a narrow banded wave group the regular wave amplitude a can be generalized to a time varying amplitude a t for the focused wave group owing to the fact that the amplitude a t is modulated and slowly varying near focusing this work presents a fully nonlinear potential flow model for simulating unidirectional focused wave groups in a rectangular tank inviscid fluid and irrotational flow is assumed following the potential flow theory the fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions are fulfilled during the time domain simulation with the exact free surface captured in time marching a higher order boundary element method hobem is adopted to solve the boundary value problem enclosing the fluid of interest we generate the focused wave group from a given wave energy spectrum phase control is implemented at the wavemaker in order to set apart the desired wave phases the primary purpose of this work is to investigate the characteristics of the higher harmonics in a focused wave group via clean harmonic decomposition and to confirm the underlying structure of these harmonics upon confirmation of the stokes type nonlinear structure the ultimate goal is to approximate the higher harmonics using the linear wave group which is simply the newwave this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly presents the governing equations of the nonlinear potential flow based nwt the boundary conditions and the boundary element method implementation of generating the focused wave group is also described section 3 focuses on validation of the numerical model by comparing with the existing experimental results section 4 presents the main results of this work we first revisit the cases in baldock et al 1996 and use the two phase method to extra the odd and even harmonic wave elevations the four phase method for extraction of the higher harmonics is then demonstrated by simulating the recent experiments the separation is found very clean up to 4th harmonic we confirm the stokes type structure of the higher order nonlinear elevations through simulations with varying wave steepness the agreement between the fully nonlinear simulation and the test data is remarkably well the harmonic elevation coefficients for the wave group defined similarly in the stokes wave model are obtained finally we reconstruct the higher harmonic wave elevations from the linear wave group with the obtained harmonic coefficients concluding remarks are drawn in the last section 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 model description we employ a numerical tank technique to simulate the focused wave groups the rectangular numerical wave tank is defined in fig 1 similar to a physical tank a narrow long tank is modelled the schematic figure consists of a wavemaker at the left boundary of the tank and a numerical beach placed on the surface at the far end of the tank the coordinate system o x y z has its origin on the undisturbed water surface in the centre of the tank with z axis pointing upward the computational domain includes all the wetted boundaries in particular s w m and s f represent the wavemaker and the free water surface respectively it is a three dimensional tank and the two side walls are not shown in the diagram the fully nonlinear potential flow theory is well established we briefly summarize the governing equations here on the assumptions that the fluid is incompressible and inviscid and the flow irrotational a scalar velocity potential φ x y z t can be defined u φ that satisfies the laplace equation in the fluid domain 1 2 φ 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 0 for the fully nonlinear potential flow model the fully nonlinear kinematic and dynamic conditions on the free surface s f in the lagrangian description are to satisfy 2 d x d t φ 3 d φ d t g z 1 2 φ φ where d d t t v is the material derivative with respect to fluid particle velocity v on the free surface x denotes position of points on the free surface and g is the gravitational acceleration difficulties arise to incorporate the nonlinear effects of these boundary conditions into the solution procedure in the fully nonlinear simulation the exact free surface has to be captured at every time step to update the nonlinear free surface in the time domain the mixed eulerian lagrangian mel algorithm is applied in the model the time marching scheme is the runge kutta 4th order method which has been shown numerically stable and accurate the boundary condition on the wavemaker s w m is defined as 4 φ x u t where u t is the velocity on the wavemaker along the x direction the velocity will be prescribed using the newwave theory introduced later in the model a piston like wavemaker is implemented the impermeable boundary condition on side walls is 5 φ n 0 the numerical beach or artificial damping layer in fig 1 is to absorb the wave energy at the far end of the tank in this model a simple method is adopted i e modifying only the kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions of eq 2 and eq 3 by adding a damping term over the damping layer length the modified free surface boundary conditions become 6 d x d t φ ν x d x x e 7 d φ d t g z 1 2 φ φ ν x d φ where x d is the distance from a point located in the damping layer to the staring point of the damping layer ν x d is the damping coefficient and x e x e y e 0 is the reference location at the still water surface the damping coefficient is imposed to be continuous and tuned to the peak frequency ω of the wave group the damping coefficient is computed according to the method in ferrant 1993 a higher order boundary element method is employed to solve the boundary value problem the numerical method is briefly summarized here the boundary integral equation bie can be formulated by the green s second identity considering a green function g x x 0 which is a velocity potential at a field point x 0 due to a distributed source at x it satisfies the laplace equation 2 g 0 in the fluid domain except at its singular point x 0 applying green s second identity by integration over the fluid domain surface enclosed by all the boundaries we have 8 c x 0 φ x 0 s g x x 0 φ x n φ x g x x 0 n d s where c x 0 is the solid angle at field point x 0 and n is measured from the source point x the solid angle c x 0 however is difficult to evaluate directly in the model we follow the treatment in teng and eatock taylor 1995 who employed the physical argument that a uniform potential applied over an enclosed fluid domain produces no flux therefore by considering a homogeneous dirichlet problem where a uniform field i e φ constant 0 is specified over the entire integral boundary the above eq 8 becomes 9 c x 0 s g x x 0 n d s in this way the solid angle c x 0 can be expressed as only a function of the boundary shape which is easily evaluated a simple 3d rankine source and its image with respect to the horizontal seabed z h can be chosen as the green function the green function is then written as 10 g x x 0 1 4 π 1 r 1 1 r 2 1 r 3 1 r 4 where 11 r 1 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 r 2 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 r 3 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 h 2 r 4 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 z z 0 2 h 2 to numerically discretize the boundaries we introduce the shape functions n j ξ η in each boundary element where ξ η is the local element coordinate thus we are able to express the position coordinate x ξ η the velocity potential φ ξ η and its derivatives within this element in terms of the nodal values the boundary integral equation eq 8 can be written in its discretized form as 12 c x 0 φ x 0 n 1 n m 1 m g x m x 0 j 1 k n j ξ η φ n j g x m x 0 n j 1 k n j ξ η φ j ω m j m ξ η where k is the total number of nodes in the element i e 6 for a triangular element and 8 for a quadrilateral element n the total number of elements over the computational boundaries m the number of sampling points in each element in the standard gauss legendre method ω m the integral weight at mth sampling point and j m ξ η the jacobian transformation from the global to the local coordinate details of calculating the integral weight and jacobian in the standard gauss legendre method can be found in gernot et al 2008 for each field point we have a bie as eq 12 with the bies for all nodes on the boundaries a linear equation system can be assembled and solved details about the higher order boundary element method for solving the above boundary value problem and its numerical implementation can be found in feng 2015 to accelerate the computation we implement parallelization to the code using openmp 2015 the computational effort is mainly at assembling the dense asymmetrical matrix of influence coefficient from bies the assembling has to be performed every time step as the nonlinear free surface is updated each time step therefore we mainly parallelize the assembling subroutine for the influence matrix in addition an efficient open source solver lapack 2017 is adopted to solved the linear equation system the simulations were carried out on the high performance computing facility arc richards 2015 at the university of oxford with multithread 2 2 wave generation key to the work here is to generate high quality focused wave groups as an extension of the numerical tank designed for regular waves bai et al 2014 feng and bai 2015 2017 we generate a focused wave group by prescribing the proper phases of each frequency component for a given wave energy spectrum s ω the free surface elevation and the velocity potential based on the linear newwave model can be calculated as 13 η i x t n 1 n a n cos k n x x c ω n t t c 14 φ i x z t n 1 n a n ω n k n cosh k n z h sinh k n h sin k n x x c ω n t t c where a n is the wave amplitude ω n the wave frequency k n the wavenumber of the nth component the water depth is h the focused time is set as t c and the focused position x c the total number of component n should be large enough to reproduce the desired spectrum and n 200 is adopted in this study the amplitude a n ω of each wave component is calculated by 15 a n ω a s ω n δ ω n 1 n s ω n δ ω where a n 1 n a n is defined as the linearized wave group amplitude the newwave profile is simply the scaled autocorrelation function i e the inversed fourier transform of the energy density spectrum for the underlying sea state and the amplitude components are proportional to s ω n δ ω σ 2 the sum σ 2 n 1 n s ω n δ ω is the variance of the wave elevation in the numerical tank as in a physical tank to make the desired wave group a proper transfer function f t ω has to be applied to the prescribed displacement and velocity for the wavemaker therefore the desired free surface elevation at the wavemaker is η i x w m t f t ω and the velocity distribution on the wavemaker becomes u t φ i x w m z t x f t ω with x w m the position of the wavemaker for the piston type wavemaker used in the model there is a π 2 phase difference between its displacement and the wave elevation on the wavemaker the above equations will generate waves focusing at x c at the time instant t c according to linear wave theory however as the wave group evolution is nonlinear in this model both the focusing location and time would slightly shift due to nonlinear dispersion and wave wave interactions for decades a classic linear transfer function proposed by ursell et al 1960 has been used in wave generation problems the function based on the linear wave theory is expressed as 16 f t ω 2 sinh 2 k h sinh k h cosh k h k h in our model we compute the numerical transfer function by carrying out regular wave simulations for a particular depth regular waves of varying frequencies at very low amplitude k a 0 01 are generated and the transfer function is then estimated from the normalized by the input amplitude steady state surface elevation first order position control of the wavemaker using the numerically obtained transfer function is applied in our numerical model a comparison of transfer functions of the numerical tank with the ursell model is shown in fig 2 for the water depth 1 8 m the difference is mostly in the frequency range 3 6 rad s it is established that the linear ursell model eq 16 works best in shallow water regime at k h π 10 in our case with h 1 8 m the corresponding regime of wave frequency is ω 0 75 rad s this is consistent with fig 2 that the numerically obtained function value is approaching the ursell model when frequency becomes small in our simulations the input frequencies cover a range of ω 1 4 8 1 rad s in which the ursell model is not accurate for very short waves or higher wave frequencies the asymptotic value for both the ursell model and the numerical model is 2 0 the difference we see from fig 2 is that the numerically obtained transfer function value reaches 2 0 at a faster rate given the appreciable discrepancy between the numerical and the simple ursell model we adopt the numerically obtained transfer function in our simulations for wave groups from a wave spectrum a much finer frequency resolution is required between the cut off frequencies 0 5 f p 3 0 f p a fitting function is needed to estimate the transfer function value at each frequency component discretized from the wave spectrum here we adopt a simple polynomial fitting at the order of 6 which works fine in the frequency range of interest as shown in fig 2 2 3 phase manipulation approach a good model for the nonlinear harmonic elevations appears to be that they follow a stokes like form thus 17 η t o t a l a s 11 cos ϕ a 2 s 20 s 22 cos 2 ϕ a 3 s 31 cos ϕ s 33 cos 3 ϕ a 4 s 40 s 42 cos 2 ϕ s 44 cos 4 ϕ o a 5 up to fourth order of the amplitude a the coefficients s m n represent the coefficients corresponding to super sum m n and sub difference m n 2 harmonics and ϕ ω t ϕ 0 is the phase of the linear component of the wave the ϕ 0 is the initial phase to be prescribed at the wavemaker in the case of a wave group it is assumed the time varying amplitude is modulated such that it is slowly changing near the focus time this requires the wave spectrum to be narrow banded mei et al 2005 to extract the different harmonics we use a phase manipulation technique following fitzgerald et al 2014 who studied the wave forces on a surface piercing column we alter the phase at the wavemaker in certain increments this allows us to combine different phase results in order to separate different harmonics in particular we make the incoming waves with a phase shift of ϕ 0 0 90 180 and 270 we then submit them into eq 17 by linearly combining the four corresponding responses η 0 η 90 η 180 and η 270 the first four separated harmonics read 18a η 0 η 90 h η 180 η 270 h 4 a s 11 a 3 s 31 cos ω t 18b η 0 η 90 η 180 η 270 4 a 2 s 22 a 4 s 42 cos 2 ω t 18c η 0 η 90 h η 180 η 270 h 4 a 3 s 33 cos 3 ω t 18d η 0 η 90 η 180 η 270 4 a 2 s 20 a 4 s 40 a 4 s 44 cos 4 ω t where the accuracy is truncated to fourth order and the superscript h denotes the hilbert transform of the time signal clearly to separate the harmonics up to fourth order using this approach we have to repeat each simulation four times in a relative simpler model the odd and even harmonics can be separated using only the η 0 and η 180 signals the averaged difference and sum of the these two signals give up to 4th harmonic 19a η 0 η 180 2 a s 11 a 3 s 31 cos ω t a 3 s 33 cos 3 ω t 19b η 0 η 180 2 a 2 s 20 a 2 s 22 a 4 s 42 cos 2 ω t a 4 s 44 cos 4 ω t we adopt the four phase method in this work in order to obtain cleanly separated harmonics up to 4th order overlaps between the first and third second and fourth harmonics could occur in the two phase method as discussed in fitzgerald et al 2014 for instance one has to apply a bandpass filter to further separate the cos ω t term and the cos 3 ω t term from eq 19a however choosing proper frequency bandwidth could be problematic when the bound harmonics associated with cos ω t have a significant overlap with the cos 3 ω t component 3 convergence and validation we consider the experimental investigation performed by baldock et al 1996 who conducted the tests in a long rectangular tank the tank is 20 m long and 0 3 m wide with a water depth of 0 7 m to optimise the computational efficiency a 10 m tank is simulated in the numerical model the origin is set at the centre of the tank i e x c 0 0 m we consider two cases in our numerical simulations case b and case d which correspond to a broad banded and narrow banded wave spectrum respectively case b has a frequency range of f 0 71 1 66 hz and case d with f 0 83 1 25 hz in each case two amplitudes a 0 022 m and a 0 055 m of the wave group are simulated 3 1 mesh convergence convergence is of critical importance when it comes to the higher harmonics which is of our main concern here the element size on the free surface shall be governed by the shortest wavelength and its higher harmonic components we test three mesh configurations as we simulate only unidirectional wave groups two elements are distributed in the lateral direction mesh 1 corresponds to about 15 elements per shortest wavelength and mesh 2 has nearly a twice denser mesh configuration and mesh 3 has a total number of elements about three times that of mesh 1 the three meshes have 6661 11233 and 16833 nodes respectively distributed over the computational boundaries it shall be reminded that higher order elements are adopted in the model the normalized wave elevations at the middle of the tank x 0 0 m for the three mesh configurations are shown in fig 3 a and the corresponding energy density spectra are displayed in fig 3 b the discrepancies are almost invisible from the time histories except at some crests and troughs one can tell the difference however from the energy density spectra in order to show the small values at high frequencies we plot the spectra in log scale for frequencies less than 1 5 hz the spectra are identical for the three meshes relative large discrepancies appear between mesh 1 and the other two mesh cases when f 1 5 hz we adopt a mesh configuration similar to mesh 2 in the following studies to compromise accuracy and computational efficiency for the cases where a jonswap spectrum is used we set the mesh density level according to the peak wavelength that dominates the wave group s main characteristics the mesh convergence is carefully tested as well because we are aiming at capturing the very small higher harmonic components 3 2 effectiveness of damping zone the effectiveness of the damping zone is governed by the long wave components in a wave group despite the fact that the focus time regime is very short and the reflection from the end of the tank is not critical an important advantage of using a focused wave group it is worthwhile to check the reflection ratio for a particular setup as it is well known that in a physical tank the long waves are difficult to be absorbed by the damping beach we shall see the performance of the numerical damping layer in the present model when generating wave groups fig 4 shows the free surface elevations for three different setups of damping length as 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 times the largest wavelength λ m in fig 4 a we can see the difference at the peaks and troughs near the focus time at x 0 0 m a closer examination reveals that the peak elevation for the damping length 1 0 λ m is over predicted while the peaks of the damping length 1 5 λ m and 2 0 λ m are almost identical it is clear from the elevations at the end of the tank x 4 9 m in fig 4 c that there is about 1 reflection for the damping length 1 0 λ m while the reflection is only 0 2 and 0 02 for 1 5 λ m and 2 0 λ m respectively the reflected component is dominated by the wave group s main frequency this indicates that at most the first harmonic component of the wave group would be contaminated nevertheless we apply a 2 0 λ m damping zone to ensure minimum reflection 3 3 validation we now compare the fully nonlinear simulations with the laboratory tests reported in baldock et al 1996 the time histories of the wave elevations near the focus time for the broad banded spectrum case b are shown in fig 5 with two wave amplitudes a 0 022 m and a 0 055 m to demonstrate the nonlinear effect linear prediction using the newwave model is also included with low wave steepness in fig 5 a the numerical simulation the measurement and the linear result are generally very close discrepancies arise between the linear and nonlinear results for higher steepness in fig 5 b the nonlinearity clearly sharpens the crest and flattens the trough as expected better agreement is observed between the nonlinear model and the measured result note that the focus location for the steep wave is shifted downstream at around x 0 3 m the experimental observation in baldock et al 1996 shows constantly enlarged down shift with increasing amplitudes the down shifting is known to be due to third order wave wave interactions in a wave group and the distance of shifting depends on the nonlinearity and the spectrum bandwidth similar conclusions about the down shift can be drawn from the narrow banded case d in fig 6 the difference is that as the bandwidth reduces the shift of the focus location is more pronounced fig 6 b shows the elevations at the focus position at x 0 8 m the agreement between the numerical model and the measurement is very good especially at the peaks and troughs the linear model under predicts the peak value about 30 nevertheless to further confirm the accuracy of capturing the nonlinearity one would need to compare the detailed individual harmonics at higher orders this is one of the main objectives of this study and is demonstrated later here we have shown that the nonlinear numerical model is able to predict the nonlinear wave group very well comparing with the linear model 4 higher harmonic analysis the method of extracting the higher harmonics for focused wave groups is based on the phase manipulation technique in most of the previous studies such as in baldock et al 1996 borthwick et al 2006 and zang et al 2006 the two phase or phase inversion method was used in contrast to the four phase method described in eq 18 which is used in this study the two phase method in eq 19 makes use of the time series of only the 0 and the 180 phases the odd and even harmonic components can be separated however in the cases with strong wave wave interactions the elevation energy spectrum would show overlapping between neighbouring frequencies fitzgerald et al 2014 the two phase method might not be able to separate all the harmonic components cleanly thus the four phase method is more appropriate to obtain the accurate harmonics in the following we first present briefly the separated odd and even harmonics by the two phase method then we focus on demonstrating the four phase method and clean separation of the harmonics up to fourth order 4 1 two phase extraction we take again the above cases in baldock et al 1996 as an example the decomposed odd and even harmonics of elevations near focusing for case b and case d with a 0 055 m are shown in fig 7 a and c respectively their corresponding spectra are displayed on the right column as discussed before the nonlinearity characteristics for the narrow banded and broad banded spectra are different this might be better illustrated from the separated spectra i e the higher harmonic components the spectra are plotted in log scale in order to identify clearly the energy distribution at higher harmonics for the broad banded case b in fig 7 b the separation seems to work well up to second order the first harmonic in solid line is covered in the input range of 0 71 1 66 hz with some tailing reaching 2 4 hz however the second harmonic in the dash line spreads in a very large frequency range making it impossible to determine its harmonic bound any component above 3 0 hz is not separated for both odd and even harmonics for the narrow banded case d in fig 7 d the first and third harmonics are easily identified from frequency distribution of the odd harmonics though there might be some overlap between 2 0 3 0 hz the second sum harmonic becomes cleaner comparing with case b ideally the second harmonic shall cover the range of 2 0 83 1 25 hz where 0 83 1 25 hz is the linear range due to some energy redistribution at the first harmonic tailing the second harmonic frequency range is slightly broadened up to about 3 hz one might be able to extract the individual harmonic component by frequency filtering with carefully selected frequency range as done in chen et al 2018 nevertheless selection of frequency filtering range can be ambiguous in many cases in terms of harmonic separation the phase manipulation technique seems to work better for narrow banded spectrum indeed narrow band is one of the assumptions for stocks expanssion to be applied to focused wave groups 4 2 four phase extraction we now apply the four phase based method to extract the harmonics the purpose is to explore the detailed underlying structure of the higher harmonic wave elevations we set up a tank of 15 m long and 0 2 m wide and the water depth is 1 8 m a narrow banded jonswap spectrum is used its peak frequency is f p 0 429 hz the cutoff of input wave frequency is 0 5 f p 3 0 f p the jonswap spectrum in this range is discretized into 200 frequency components for a focused wave group we use the peak wave frequency and wavelength as its characteristic property the water depth is intermediate with k p h 1 48 note that the stokes wave theory breaks down at a shallow water depth various wave amplitudes are simulated the setup of the case corresponds to the recent experiments conducted at the kelvin hydrodynamic laboratory in the university of strathclyde details about the setup of the experiments are described in the recent conference paper in adcock et al 2019 the time histories of the total wave elevations for the four phases at the centre of the tank x 0 0 m are shown in fig 8 the linear wave group amplitude is a 0 213 m the elevations are normalized by a the linear wave group is set to focus at t 25 s the actual focus time would slightly delay and the focus location would shift downstream as discussed previously the slight shift of focusing in time and position does not matter for the following analysis of the peak responses because we compute the envelope of the time series instead of the maximum value without detailed calculation from the figure the elevations of the four phases preserve a stable phase difference near the focus time and they are within a same envelope as expected applying the linear combinations according to eq 18 the resulting four time histories of the first four harmonics are shown in fig 10 the corresponding spectra in log scale are shown in fig 9 the frequency is non dimensionalized by the peak frequency the separation of the first four harmonics η 1 η 2 η 3 η 4 is very successful no overlap is present among the four the second subharmonic or difference η 2 covering 0 2 0 f p can be easily extracted from the fourth harmonic the blue dot dash line as their frequency ranges are largely apart the linear component covers the input frequency range higher harmonic frequencies are slightly broadened for instance the second sum covers the range of 1 0 f p 5 f p the peak frequency of each harmonic corresponds to n f p for harmonics higher than 4th the spectrum is down to the noise level and cannot be further separated we see from the time histories in fig 10 that the peaks of the higher harmonics are nicely aligned with the linear suggesting the wave crest can be significantly enhanced if the nonlinear components are considerable in this case the second harmonic peak is about 20 of the linear the third and fourth harmonics are much lower they are really localized appearing within about 2 s near focusing yet the small higher harmonics can excite possible large resonant structural response in the environment if the offshore structure s natural frequency happens to be in this range direct comparisons of the elevations particularly the higher harmonics are made with the experimental results the same approach was used in the experiments to obtain the harmonics the results for two amplitudes a 0 134 m and a 0 213 m are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively we shift the time histories such that the focusing time is at t 0 0 s the nth harmonics are normalized by a n for both cases the linear elevations agree very well between the numerics and the experiments the second difference η 2 shows a significant set down of the wave group the numerical result in fig 11 b shows the typical set down at focusing which is a long but smooth component some wavy component appears in the experimental result due to the energy leakage from the linear or higher harmonics the agreement is much better for a 0 213 m in fig 12 b both the trough and the overall trend very good agreements are also observed in the second sum harmonics except after the time t 7 0 s when a large component appears in the numerical result this is believed to be due to the presence of the second order error wave generated at the wavemaker the presence and effect of error wave is extensively discussed in orszaghova et al 2014 the source of the error wave could be the first order position control of the wavemaker used in the model its effect on the second order component was discussed in spinneken and swan 2009 nevertheless the error wave is much delayed to the main wave group as higher frequency waves travel slower it will not affect the magnitude of the main group a relatively large discrepancy particularly in phase appears in the third harmonic in fig 11 d the experimental time series seems to have a trough focus at a time instant later than t 0 0 s while the numerical result focusses at t 0 0 s the phase modification due to third order resonant wave wave interactions see recently bonnefoy et al 2016 could be the explanation for the delay in the focused wave group however the discrepancy is not observed for a 0 213 m in fig 12 d note that the third harmonic elevation is very small in value given the scrutinous comparison performed above we are confident that the numerical model is highly accurate in predicting the higher harmonics of focused wave groups at the same time the four phase decomposition approach is quite successful for the extraction of higher harmonics further insight can be revealed from the time evolution of the wave profile of each harmonic along the tank in fig 13 where the first three harmonics are shown this is obtained by recording the wave elevation at every point along the tank applying the four phase combination method to each point gives the responses at each harmonic in the time domain we then plot the wave profile of each harmonic along the tank at every time step this post processing could be time consuming depending on the resolution of the free surface mesh in the figures each line shows the wave profile at a certain time step the bold red line shows the profile at the focused time note that the time steps for the three harmonics are different as they evolute at different time scales the linear wave profile in fig 13 a covers a time period more than three times longer than that in fig 13 c we see that the linear wave group has a smooth focusing and de focusing process with a relatively long wavelength in fig 13 b the error wave behind the main group is visible in the top left triangular zone generally the phase speed of the second harmonic is stable in contrast the third harmonic profile shows some randomness of its phase over the focusing and de focusing time period as explained the reason might be the underlying third order resonant wave wave interactions causing energy transfer between different frequency components it is also noticed that the third harmonic component only becomes significant near the focused time and near the focused location i e it is compactly localized however it may cause resonance if a structure is in presence which usually has a higher natural frequency than the linear frequency but near the triple frequency to see the separated wave profile in space clearly we present the decomposed harmonic elevations at the focused time along the centerline of the tank in fig 14 we see that the second harmonic elevation in space has the same phase with the first it sharpens the peak and flattens the trough of the linear wave profile the third harmonic profile is only visible near the focusing location x 0 0 m 4 3 harmonic coefficients in view of the stokes like harmonics of a focused wave group in eq 17 we can treat the time varying amplitude as the envelope of the time series using the peak value of the envelope we are able to compute the corresponding nth harmonic coefficient as 20 s n n max ξ n a n where ξ n is the envelope of the time series the envelope is computed by ξ n η n 2 η h n 2 the subscript h represents its hilbert transform to resolve the coefficient and the underlying structure of the harmonics it is necessary to perform simulations using various wave amplitudes fig 15 shows the second and third harmonic coefficients s 22 and s 33 against the wave steepness k p a 0 05 0 25 the cross is the experimental result the short horizontal lines represent some theoretical predictions which are independent on the wave steepness to keep the figure compact we plot the horizontal lines over the range of k p a 0 0 04 in fig 15 a the solid black line is the prediction using the method presented by dalzell 1999 with modification for a wave group the original dalzell model considers the wave wave interaction of two waves we extend the model for the wave group by considering the interactions between each possible pair of wave components in the group the modified formulation for the second order elevation is presented in the appendix the dot line is simply the regular wave stokes second order coefficient and the dot dash line is the stokes coefficient in deep water the numerical second harmonic coefficient s 22 shows more or less a constant value about 0 74 over the steepness range there is slight increment when the wave is steep near k p a 0 20 this trend is consistent with the experimental results where there is minor scattering it should be borne in mind that in the tests the actual value of the second harmonic peak is in the level of millimetre or smaller which is to the accuracy of wave gauges for the numerical model probing the small wave elevations is not an issue the averaged numerical s 22 agrees very well with the modified dalzell model and both are about 10 higher than the stokes coefficient the corresponding coefficient in deep water s 22 1 2 k p is much lower this is expected since the wave nonlinearity typically weakens with the increase of water depth the third harmonic coefficient s 33 of the experiments is more scattering than the second the scattering seems to occur either at low steepness or high steepness ranges for the very mild wave possibly the wave gauges could not capture the tiny component at the third harmonic for the relatively steep wave the third order resonant wave wave interaction would occur breaking down the stokes like nonlinear structure nonetheless the numerical results are still constant against the steepness again the averaged numerical coefficient s 33 is close to that of the experiments the regular wave stokes third order coefficient underestimates the test results by about 30 though close in any case the focused wave group is different from a regular wave the nonlinear wave wave interaction could play an important role in modifying the peak or trough of a focused wave group especially the third harmonic it might be interesting to study the variation of the harmonic coefficient against the wavenumber at a constant water depth the second harmonic coefficient as a function of k p h is depicted in fig 16 here we investigate three water depths i e h 0 5 m 1 8 m 10 m in each figure we plot results of the numerical model the modified dalzell model and the stokes coefficient for the small water depth in fig 16 a we see a significant drop of s 22 when k p h 1 0 at shallow water regime the numerical result seems to be between the dalzell s and the stokes coefficients with the stokes coefficient slightly higher than the other two the trend however changes when k p h 1 5 the stokes coefficient is slightly lower there is an intersection near k p h 1 5 and similar intersection is present for the 1 8 m depth case in fig 16 b in deep water the coefficient increases almost linearly with k p h the discrepancies among the numerical results dalzell s model and stokes seem consistent the same conclusion can be drawn from fig 16 c with h 10 m it is worthy pointing out that we use a wave steepness about k p a 0 1 for the numerical simulations the second order coefficient is in the order of a 2 4 4 estimation of higher harmonics from linear wave a primary purpose of obtaining the harmonic coefficients is to estimate the higher harmonics using the time series of the linear wave elevation η 1 the total wave elevation can be approximated as 21 η η 1 s 22 a 2 η 1 2 η h 1 2 s 33 a 3 η 1 3 3 η 1 η h 1 2 s 44 a 4 η 1 4 6 η 1 η h 1 2 η h 1 4 we take the case where f p 0 429 hz and a 0 213 m as an example we compute the harmonic coefficient s n n according to eq 20 up to 5th order the stokes type structure indicates the harmonic component shall have the form η ˆ n a n s n n cos n ω t φ n where a t is the linear amplitude in practice this can be obtained from the newwave model and φ n is the phase of the harmonic response note that the coefficient s n n is not a function of the wave steepness estimation of cos n ω t φ n for each higher harmonic from the linear η 1 and its hilbert transform η h 1 is documented in the appendix in walker et al 2004 the estimated time series of the harmonic elevations are shown in fig 17 the solid line is the direct results from the numerical simulation and the dash line is estimated using the reconstruction model eq 21 the harmonic coefficients s n n utilized in the reconstruction model are obtained from the numerical simulation they are the averaged s n n over the varying k p a we see that the overall reconstruction is successful up to 5th harmonic the total elevation is well estimated small discrepancy appears at the second harmonic near the focus time however the possible error wave after 30 s cannot be captured this is not a surprise because the reconstructed higher harmonic elevations will not have any wiggle following the main group the reconstructed harmonics are also more symmetric about the focus time than the original extracted ones because the linear component is essentially symmetric from the total elevation we see that the reconstructed elevation is almost identical to the original except for the small discrepancy after 30 s which is due to the presence of the second order error wave again the higher harmonic components above the third order are generally very small some noise seems to appear in the fifth harmonic nevertheless we can reconfirm the underlying stokes type structure of the nonlinear harmonics we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate the higher harmonics of a focused wave group by its linear wave elevation with the harmonic coefficients 5 concluding remarks we present a fully nonlinear potential flow model with implementation of generation of focused wave groups a phase manipulation method is adopted to decompose the harmonic components of the nonlinear wave elevation mesh convergence at the higher harmonics is carefully carried out the four phase method is demonstrated successful for separating the higher harmonics in the nonlinear wave group direct comparison of the harmonic time histories is made with the recent experiments the agreement is generally good the second harmonic from the numerical model shows a secondary group following the main group which however is not present in the experiment it is believed to be the effect of error wave of the second order the error wave is much delayed and has no influence on the main group small discrepancies are also observed in the third harmonic elevation while the third harmonic peak values are close for the numerical and experimental results there exists a slight phase difference this is explained by the phase modification resulting from resonant third order wave wave interactions which may not be captured in the numerical model nevertheless the absolute higher harmonic components are very small the differences are not visible from the total elevations the evolution of the decomposed higher harmonic wave profile is illustrated both the linear and second harmonics show smooth profiles along the tank the third is localized and wavy due to its short wave length and possible phase modification to confirm the stokes like structure of the higher harmonics we simulate the wave groups with varying amplitudes we compare the harmonic coefficients with both the tests and the theory at increasing wave steepness the second order coefficient s 22 is almost constant against the steepness for the numerical results small variation is present in the test data the second order wave wave interaction model by dalzell 1999 is extended for a focused wave group the modified dalzell model shows good prediction while the stokes second order model for regular waves slightly under predicts the second order coefficient for the third order coefficient s 33 the numerical results are almost constant with increasing wave steepness while the variation in the test data is considerable especially when the steepness is either low or high again the stokes third order model under predicts s 33 with the harmonic coefficients up to fifth order we estimate the higher harmonics from the linear elevation the reconstructed elevations agree well with the original confirming again the stokes type structure for the higher harmonics the harmonic component coefficients are not a function of the wave steepness suggesting one can estimate the harmonics from only the simple linear model for both mild and steep waves while the second harmonic coefficient for the focused wave group can be directly computed from the extended dalzell model higher harmonic coefficients for any general case cannot be easily obtained except running nonlinear simulations future investigations would be made to study the wave wave interactions at the third and higher orders leading to the quick estimation of the harmonic coefficients acknowledgements this work was funded by uk china offshore renewable

the university of oxford advanced research computing arc facility in carrying out the numerical work appendix the mathematical model of second order wave wave interaction for two regular waves was presented by dalzell 1999 we modify it for a focused wave group in a random sea state this is done by considering every pair of two components in a wave group and summing up all the possible pairs the formulation in dalzell 1999 considers directional spreading here we set up the direction of all the wave component as zero making it unidirectional the regular wave wave interaction resulting from two components in uni direction has the second order sum elevation a 1 η 22 a 1 2 k 1 4 tanh k 1 h 2 3 sinh 2 k 1 h a 2 2 k 2 4 tanh k 2 h 2 3 sinh 2 k 2 h a 1 a 2 b p a 2 b p ω 1 2 ω 2 2 2 g ω 1 ω 2 2 g
