8045,study region the lower athabasca river was used as a test case using total suspended sediment chloride and vanadium as the model variables upstream model boundary conditions included water from the tributary clearwater river right stream tube and the upper athabasca river extending upstream of the tributary mouth left stream tube this model will be extended to include the peace athabasca delta pad to determine the implications of mining outfall discharges on a large region of the athabasca pad region study focus a novel quasi two dimensional surface water quality modelling approach is presented in which the model domain can be discretised in two dimensions but a one dimension solver can still be applied to capture water flow between the discretisation units segments the approach requires a river reach to be divided into two stream tubes along the left and right river sides with flows exchanging through the segments longitudinally and also laterally between adjacent segments along the two streams new hydrological insights for the region the new method allows the transverse mixing of tributary and outfall water of different constituent concentrations to be simulated along the course of the river additional diffuse loading of dissolved vanadium could be determined from the model s substance balance a scenario was then simulated in which the transport and fate of vanadium in a floodplain lake and a secondary channel was determined keywords oil sands quasi two dimensional model sediment vanadium wasp 1 introduction release of treated oil sands process water is an option that is currently being evaluated to reduce inventories on oil sands sites vanadium was modelled in this exercise since it is present in bitumen mined in the athabasca oil sands region and in oil sand process water schlesinger et al 2017 the metal can have toxic effects on aquatic life for example phytoplankton and zooplankton schiffer and liber 2017a and selected macroinvertebrates and fish schiffer and liber 2017b other studies have been carried out to further understand the toxicity transport fate and environmental behaviour of vanadium e g jardine et al 2019 kay et al 2020 klemt et al 2020 tendler et al 2020 our modelling study work can contribute to this understanding gupta et al 2021 provides a historical overview of modelling in the athabasca river basin only the instream water quality modelling of the lower athabasca river will be highlighted here since the 1970s it has been understood that near field mixing is a key factor influencing the fate and transport of releases to the lower athabasca river beltaos 1979 lipsett and beltaos 1978 a model of the lower athabasca river developed at the national water research institute in the 1970s had initially been developed as a one dimensional model however the need for two dimensional analysis was identified based on observed mixing patterns downstream of fort mcmurray to the delta at lake athabasca booty 1994 bourbonniere 1992 a two dimensional model was calibrated using mixing in the athabasca and clearwater rivers booty 1994 and later using the wastewater from the oil company suncor booty et al 1996 at the time the suncor wastewater had measurable concentrations of several organic constituents including 2 4 dimethylbenzothiophene which were used to validate the two dimensional mixing model booty et al 1996 a model for transport and fate of substances was developed for the athabasca and wapiti smoky rivers using the wasp model as part of the northern rivers basin study golder 1997a the purpose of the model was to predict the fate and transport of sediment associated substances that were accumulating in the bed sediment downstream of pulp mill outfalls the wasp model for the athabasca river was successfully configured to capture the process and longitudinal pattern of sediment flocculation and deposition downstream of the pulp mill releases krishnappan 1996 golder 1997b vanadium has been modelled for the lower athabasca river using the two dimensional model efdc kashyap et al 2017 set within a surface water modelling framework for water quality assessment and substance load allocation along the lower athabasca river ec 2011 although it has been asserted that conditions in the lower athabasca river require a fully dynamic two or three dimensional model of the river the implementation of these types of models for the lower athabasca river has encountered computational issues resulting in costly and protracted model development one dimensional models have also been applied to the lower athabasca river such as mike 11 model dibike et al 2018 one drawback with mike 11 is that the model does not account for transverse mixing which has been identified as a key feature for modelling operational releases to the lower athabasca river as stated above based on analyses completed as part of a regional substance allocation study rsla 2021 substance load allocations calculated without accounting for transverse mixing would be approximately ten times higher than those accounting for delayed transverse mixing in order to accommodate for the aforementioned model shortcomings the following criteria were considered paramount for a new development of a model of the lower athabasca river leanness in computational resources including short simulation times this is important for planned future work in i scaling up the model spatially when extending the lower athabasca river model to include the athabasca delta ii coupling the model to a hydrological and sediment transport model mesh sed for climate change scenario modelling rokaya et al 2019 das et al 2020 2021 and iii incorporating the river ice model rivice of the athabasca river lindenschmidt 2017 lindenschmidt et al 2019 into the mesh sed wasp modelling system to investigate the impact of ice cover breakup and ice jams on the transport of sediments and contaminants within the river simulation of transverse mixing which must be accounted for to accurately predict concentrations in the mid field downstream of outfalls hence we introduce a novel quasi two dimensional modelling approach in which a one dimensional modelling solution can be used to reduce computation resources which allows discretization in a manner to mimic a two dimensional configuration the wasp platform is an ideal avenue to fulfil such a setup the model takes advantage of short computational times offered by its one dimensional solver but allows for transverse mixing with a discretization that accounts for not only longitudinally but also laterally exchanges along the river as shown in fig 1 left panel for comparison a two dimensional model of the lower athabasca river developed by kashyap et al 2017 with a domain extending 160 km downstream from fort mcmurray required computational times greater than 3 h our quasi two dimension model requires only 2 min to reach steady state conditions taking into account that our model domain is only about one third of the domain modelled by kashyap et al 2017 the quasi two dimensional approach is still at least 20 times faster than a full two dimensional setup such an approach is yet to be documented in the literature for heavy metal transport the closest study to such an approach is the modelling of the deposition of zinc in off channel storage basins polders along the elbe river lindenschmidt et al 2008 sehnert and lindenschmidt 2009 but only longitudinal not transverse mixing within the river was considered the two dimensional discretization only came into play when coupling the polder to the river s mainstem fig 1 middle panel in this study however the two dimensional discretization is to be carried out within the river s mainstem as two stream tubes to allow flow and hence mixing between lateral segmentations fig 1 right panel key objectives of this paper are mimic transverse mixing in a river using a quasi two dimension approach in which a river model domain is discretised in two dimensions but the flows between discretisation units are in one direction allowing a one dimensional solver to be used in the simulations verify the accuracy of the quasi two dimensional approach by simulating chloride total suspended sediments and vanadium 1 1 site description the athabasca river originates on the eastern slopes of the rocky mountains and flows unregulated approximately 1500 km through alberta in a north easterly direction to the athabasca delta and lake athabasca see fig 2 water quality in the athabasca river and tributaries is rated as good or excellent charette and trites 2011 fiera 2012 with relatively low contributions from non point sources associated with urban and agricultural development fiera 2013 this study focuses on a stretch along the lower athabasca river downstream of fort mcmurray see fig 3 between water quality sampling stations m3 and m4 the lower athabasca river within the oil sands region extends from just upstream of fort mcmurray to the athabasca delta at fort mcmurray there is a convergence of the athabasca river with the clearwater river which has unique water quality and flow characteristics compared to the athabasca river upstream of the athabasca clearwater river confluence mixing of the clearwater river water is delayed and results in gradients in concentrations of chloride and other ions for many kilometres downstream of the confluence major tributaries along the lower athabasca river are the steepbank muskeg mckay ells and firebag rivers however only the steepbank river whose average flow constitutes less than 1 of the athabasca river is found within our modelling domain the lower reaches of the clearwater river and many areas of the lower athabasca river are incised into the devonian and cretaceous geological formations as a result there are numerous fens springs and riverbed seeps that contribute high salinity groundwater to the river roy et al 2016 gue et al 2018 birks et al 2018 additionally erosion of the bank and bed of tributaries contributes bituminous material to the athabasca river along the upper athabasca river are sources of natural bitumen erosion including prominent mcmurray formation outcrops at crooked rapids mountain rapids and between mountain rapids and fort mcmurray hein et al 2001 there is also substantial bituminous material in the clearwater river and other smaller tributaries the lower athabasca river contains many islands secondary channels wetlands and floodplain lakes many of these secondary channels freeze to the bottom or have low oxygen levels during winter sediment deposition areas occur below tributaries confluence bars in mid channel bars and in secondary channels throughout the river during flooding events in tributaries substantial amounts of oil sands material can be transported downstream and deposited on the surface of confluence bars over time these areas of high oil sands material are mixed with sediment coming from upstream and are diluted conly et al 2002 most sediments conveyed through the lower athabasca river stem from upstream sources in the athabasca and clearwater rivers with minor contributions from tributaries and from within the lower athabasca river there is an abrupt change in the river slope at fort mcmurray at the confluence of the clearwater river where the gradient of about 0 00014 carson and hudson 1997 downstream of fort mcmurray there is less gravel than the upstream reaches and the substrate is dominated by sand between fort mackay and embarras airport the river slope decreases further to about 0 0001 and the character of the channel becomes more sinuous with occasional well developed meanders and a well defined floodplain of silt and sand has been built up in most places the bed is sandy throughout with finer sediment in the secondary channels downstream of the embarras airport the river gradient again decreases as the river enters the peace athabasca delta bed sediment in this area is much finer as silt and clay settle out in the more slowly flowing water the athabasca river receives continuous releases from five pulp mills and four municipal wastewater treatment plants upstream of fort mcmurray in 2011 the total release from these uses was estimated to be about 5 m3 s ag 2015 wastewater loadings to the lower athabasca river are limited to treated municipal wastewater from the city of fort mcmurray suncor s industrial release and syncrude s clean water release in addition approximately 3300 tonnes of road salt are applied as road de icing agents in fort mcmurray in the winter jasechko et al 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydraulic modelling with hec ras the hydraulic model hec ras developed by the u s army corps of engineers was used to simulate the hydrodynamics of the model domain flow rates of 600 m3 s approximate average flow at the athabasca river gauge below fort mcmurray and 1600 m3 s a high flow corresponding to approximately the maximum 3rd quartile of monthly flow were chosen to run the model for steady state conditions water quality data were also available for these flows the flow widths average depths and water volumes between cross sections were used as a basis for the dimensioning of the segmentation of the wasp model described below bathymetry data provided by alberta environment and parks was used to generate the 100 cross sections at approximately 500 m intervals along the model domain due to the lack of gauges along this stretch the model s accuracy for predicting water level elevations was verified through the hydraulic model one d in a previous study sabokruhie et al 2021 the one dimensional hec ras model could not be coupled to the quasi two dimensional wasp model since hec ras incorporates the entire cross section of the channel as a single entity the cross sections cannot be further discretized into two entities transversely as we have done in our quasi two dimensional wasp setup as left and right stream tubes along the channel 2 2 water quality analysis simulation package wasp the water quality analysis simulation program wasp 8 3 2 was used to model the water quality of the study a stretch of the lower athabasca river wasp is a finite difference model for analysing the transport and fate of sediments and toxicants in aquatic environments and to simulate key processes to describe eutrophication this latest version of wasp has undergone many significant changes which are briefly discussed in wool et al 2020 the model was developed based on the conservation of mass momentum and energy the model domain is discretised by water volumes called segments allowing the simulation of water depths flow velocities and water volumes based on the segment geometries and roughness coefficients these in turn control the passage of sediments and chemicals by advection deposition resuspension partitioning oxidation photolysis and many other processes and transformations additional inputs to the model include a flow routing map boundary conditions environmental functions constants loads and initial conditions for segments the wasp segment geometries were generated from the hec ras model the uneven shape of the channel was described using a depth exponent of 0 3 the segment length considered for modelling was 500 m this length grants an acceptable mixing and an approximate uniform volume for segments and deems computational times acceptable although the water quality simulations were carried out one dimensionally the discretization of the surface water segments into two stream tubes longitudinally along the studied reach allowed for a two dimensional representation of the model domain as shown in fig 4 a novel approach we have coined quasi two dimensional modelling benthic segments were also inserted under each surface water segment to characterise erosion and deposition processes for the upstream model boundary the flow from the clearwater river was supplied to the right stream tube segment while the upper athabasca river flow flow along the athabasca river upstream of the athabasca clearwater river confluence was inserted into the left stream tube segment the width of each stream tube was proportional to the discharge allocation the flow mapping was carried out in such a way that a 50 50 ratio of the flow in each tube was achieved by the time the flow reached the downstream boundary from the 80 20 ratio of the left right stream tubes for the upper athabasca clearwater flows at the upstream boundary the draper gauge provided daily flows along the clearwater river whereas the upper athabasca river flow was obtained by simple subtraction of the clearwater river flow from the flow recorded at the athabasca river gauge downstream of fort mcmurray this estimation was deemed suitable since transit times between gauges are much shorter than one day for total flows at the athabasca river gauge of 600 and 1600 m3 s the clearwater river supplies respectively approximately 14 and 16 of the flow to the lower athabasca river flow mapping was carried out to characterise a complete mixing in the 50 km stretch of the modelling domain transverse transport between segments was configured so that a 1 1 flow ratio was obtained after 50 kilometres of flow at the downstream boundary of the model domain this was done by progressively inserting flows between laterally adjacent segments with more flows from left stream tube segments to right stream tube segments as shown in fig 5 the hydrodynamics of the system was modelled using the kinematic wave flow option throughout the network the algorithm used to solve the equations involves finite difference formulations of flow and continuity in one dimensional conditions this method is based on solutions of one dimensional continuity equations and the momentum equation that addresses gravity and friction the flow between the left and right side segments was transferred by diverting 1 of the longitudinal flow between adjacent upstream and downstream segments to laterally adjacent segments alternating from right to left and left to right with the right side progressively receiving more water volume and the left side less water volume at the upstream boundary 80 of the flow was emitted in the left stream tube whereas 20 in the right stream tube based on the 80 20 ratio of the flows from the upper athabasca and clearwater rivers respectively the 1 flow exchange was configured in such as way that the downstream boundary flows in the left and right stream tubes became balanced 50 50 at this location the concentrations of sediment and chloride across the river were relatively uniform indicating full mixing the kinematic wave equation was used to model the flow from one segment to another the kinematic wave estimates wave propagation and variation in flow velocity through a stream network kinematic wave formulation controls flow by river bottom and slope roughness and can be described using manning s equation q 1 n a 5 3 b 2 3 s 0 1 2 and the continuity equation differentiated with respect to distance in the flow direction and time q x α β q β 1 q t 0 where q is flow x is distance in the flow direction one dimensional flow t is time α and β are functions of hydraulic coefficients which are related to channel geometry s 0 is the bottom slope n is manning s roughness coefficient a is cross sectional area and b is channel width a depth exponent is used along with segment geometries to estimate hydraulic coefficients which are later used to calculate segment flow depths under specific flow rates a more detailed description of stream transport in wasp is provided in wool et al 2020 further descriptions of the flow mapping and transverse mixing can be obtained from sabokruhie et al 2021 boundary and initial conditions for the segments were determined using existing water quality and flow data at the existing stations wasp uses flow and dispersion paths to specify boundary paths for the upstream boundary condition these data were obtained from the m3 station initial concentrations for all segments along the model domain were derived by linear interpolation of values between the m3 and m4 stations settling of silt and clay was estimated using stokes law and the settling velocity of sand was estimated based on ferguson and church 2004 resuspension was based on van rijn 2007 to model vanadium the partitioning coefficient was obtained from allison and allison 2005 the deposition rate of vanadium was calibrated using the sampled concentration at the upstream and downstream model boundaries the concentration of vanadium in the riverbed was taken to be 18 mg kg which is an average of all the values available from field sampling see fig 6 the model was run in a steady state until equilibrium conditions of constituent concentrations in all segments was reached 3 results 3 1 total suspended sediment constitutent sampling was carried out for many days between 2011 and 2018 however the sampling at stations m3 and m4 were carried out on different days constitutents for flows of approximately 600 m3 s and 1600 m3 s 25 for each were sought and collated in fig 6 as indicated in the top panels of fig 6 for the lower flow scenario of 600 m3 s the total suspended sediment concentrations are only slightly greater stemming from the upper athabasca river left stream tube than those from the clearwater river right stream tube the concentrations quickly become uniform across the two streams as flow moves downstream as indicated by the 600 m3 s longitudinal profiles in fig 7 for the higher flow scenario there is a larger difference in total suspended sediment concentrations between the upper athabasca and clearwater rivers see bottom left panel of fig 6 about one third less for the clearwater river the concentrations are almost uniform between the two stream tubes by the time the flow reaches the downstream model domain boundary at station m4 see bottom right panel of fig 6 the total suspended sediment concentrations between the two streams become uniform quicker at the higher flow scenario as indicated by the 1600 m3 s longitudinal profiles in fig 7 this is due to both the larger transverse flows between laterally adjacent segments and the high concentration gradients between the two stream tubes fig 8 3 2 chloride chloride was modelled for the same flow dates as for total suspended sediments above in order to show that our quasi two dimensional model setup can capture the lateral mixing along the lower athabasca river chloride is considered to be a conservative substance making it suitable for tracking its mixing along a river for the upstream boundary of our modelling domain at station m3 referring to the left panels of fig 9 chloride concentrations in the right stream tube hence from the clearwater river are higher than the concentrations in the left stream tube hence the upper athabasca river for both flow scenarios of 600 and 1600 m3 s the concentrations of chloride in the two streams remain relatively the same there is a slight increase in chloride concentrations at 1600 m3 s compared to 600 m3 s by the time the flow has reached the downstream boundary of our modelling domain at station m4 referring to the right panels of fig 9 chloride concentrations across the transect are almost uniform indicating the complete mixing of chloride has occurred across both stream tubes chloride concentrations are slightly greater at the 600 m3 s flow scenario compared to the higher 1600 m3 s flow this is substantiated with the longitudinal profiles of simulated chloride concentrations along the model domain between station m3 upstream boundary and station m4 downstream boundary shown in fig 10 the chloride concentrations along the right stream tube tend to drop off faster for the higher flow scenario due to the higher mixing between segments at higher flows lateral flows between segments are input as a percentage of the longitudinal flow through the segments hence for higher flows a larger flow is simulated between two laterally adjacent segments the chloride concentrations in the left stream tube increase slightly for the lower flow scenario but dilute more for the higher flow simulation 3 3 vanadium referring to fig 11 and fig 12 vanadium was present mainly in particulate form for both left and right stream tubes and for both flow scenarios of 600 and 1600 m3 s eighty percent of the metal was in particulate form at 600 m3 s whereas 97 of it was particulate at 1600 m3 s particulate vanadium concentrations were almost 10 times higher at the higher flow compared to the lower flow scenario this follows a trend in which more of the vanadium is transported in particulate form at higher flows which aligns with more sediment being transported in the river at higher flows particularly for the upper athabasca river modelling both particulate and dissolved fractions of vanadium concentrations required setting both a partitioning coefficient and deposition rate for the particulate fraction as shown in fig 11 initial simulations without additional non point source loading were not obtained between simulated and observed vanadium concentrations at station m4 particularly the dissolved fraction of vanadium the left stream tube for a flow of 600 m3 s was also underestimated especially at the lower flow scenario top right panel of fig 11 although the discrepancy for the particulate fraction was not as large hence an additional source of dissolved vanadium with loading was included in the simulations as shown in the longitudinal profiles in fig 12 this markedly improved the accuracy of the simulations with modelled values matching observations better especially for dissolved vanadium some of the additional dissolved vanadium load partitioned to its particulate form this partitioning was stronger at the lower flow scenario of 600 m3 s an additional 3 kg day and 1 kg day of dissolved vanadium needed to be added as a diffuse loading to respectively the left and right stream tubes of the modelling domain the additional loading of dissolved vanadium was distributed along the course of the river as a diffuse load of approximately 0 06 and 0 02 kg day km respectively for the left and right sides of the river at the 600 m3 s flow rate these values were decreased 10 fold for the high flow of 1600 m3 s these amounts were determined through the calibration process as was the case for chloride and total suspended sediment the left and right stream concentrations of both particulate and dissolved vanadium were nearly uniform at the downstream boundary of the model domain at m4 4 discussion 4 1 total suspended sediment the higher sediment concentrations in the upper athabasca river compared to the clearwater river at higher flows can be attributed to the larger catchment size of the former river providing higher ratios of flow to the lower athabasca river and more eroded and transported sources of sediment it is evident that the athabasca river carries more sediment concentration compared to the clearwater river total suspended sediment concentrations increase exponentially with flow for both the upper athabasca and clearwater rivers as was similarly found by sabokruhie et al 2021 4 2 chloride the chloride simulations indicate that our quasi two dimension approach is suitable to mimic transverse mixing along a river chloride concentrations along both stream tubes converge to become closer to being uniform as flow moves further downstream in this case flow lengths of up to 50 km are required for full mixing to have occurred mixing is faster leading to shorter mixing lengths for higher flows mixing is induced by not only longitudinal flows along the stream tubes but transverse flow between laterally adjacent segments these flows are higher for higher flow scenarios mixing is also quicker between the two stream tubes when concentration gradients of substances between the two streams is greater 4 3 vanadium shotyk et al 2017 also investigated the transport of dissolved vanadium and noted a statistically significant increase in concentration along the lower athabasca river however they did not attribute the increase to any specific source their data which was collected on the same day and shows an increase in concentrations between their sites corresponding to stations m3 to m4 with the increase occurring primarily between just upstream of the steepbank river inflow to just downstream of saline lake approximately a 9 km stretch vanadium is elevated in local tributaries including the mildred lake reservoir which is used for the syncrude potable water supply tondu 2017 hence it can be assumed that vanadium is present in surficial aquifer and muskeg dewatering water from the mine sites additional sources may be surficial aquifer water that is exfiltrating into the river deposition of dust and bank erosion other possible sources such as contaminated sediment or tailings water seepage do not seem as likely based on the available evidence these transport processes have been described as critically important to understanding potential environmental effects of oil sands development our modelling has the aim to determine those processes that are critical to understanding impacts to the peace athabasca delta but on a much smaller scale the sediment processes and the representation of a floodplain lake and a secondary channel are important parts of the design these types of features were addressed in the mike 11 dibike et al 2018 and efdc kashyap et al 2017 modelling with the relevance of the work described in detail by culp et al 2021 hence a scenario was run with our model which included a side lake in the floodplain with additional segments representing the deep and shallow areas of shipyard lake and a secondary channel removal of lateral flow exchange between the left mainstem and right secondary channel stream tubes to determine the transport behaviour of vanadium in these features the modified segmentation is shown in fig 13 as expected vanadium concentrations in the lake are less than in the adjacent stream of the mainstem increased residence times and lower flow velocities contribute to the high sedimentation rates within the lake areas fig 14 5 conclusions the quasi two dimensional approach was successful in capturing the mixing character of tributary water clearwater river with the mainstem water upper athabasca river substantiated by the simulation of chloride a conservative constituent and total suspended sediment a length of 50 km suffices to mix constituents uniformly for a range of flows between 2nd i e the mean and 3rd quartiles of recorded flows mixing is quicker at higher flows an additional loading of dissolved vanadium was required to simulated values to match observed concentrations including outfalls in the modelling is a topic of future work which may require an additional stream tube to be included in the discretisation especially if the outfalls are at both the left and right banks and less than 50 flow kilometres apart see fig 15 this is the case for the proposed outfalls of syncrude and suncor one being on the left bank and the other on the right bank of the lower athabasca river the flow distance between the two outfall locations is approximately 15 km from each other using the quasi two dimensional modelling approach has applicability beyond riverine systems impacted by mining sites floodplains can be included in the discretisation as a separate cluster of segments connected to the mainstem of the river segmentation credit authorship contribution statement kel conceptualization ps tr data curation kel tr formal

channel storage basins polders along the elbe river lindenschmidt et al 2008 sehnert and lindenschmidt 2009 but only longitudinal not transverse mixing within the river was considered the two dimensional discretization only came into play when coupling the polder to the river s mainstem fig 1 middle panel in this study however the two dimensional discretization is to be carried out within the river s mainstem as two stream tubes to allow flow and hence mixing between lateral segmentations fig 1 right panel key objectives of this paper are mimic transverse mixing in a river using a quasi two dimension approach in which a river model domain is discretised in two dimensions but the flows between discretisation units are in one direction allowing a one dimensional solver to be used in the simulations verify the accuracy of the quasi two dimensional approach by simulating chloride total suspended sediments and vanadium 1 1 site description the athabasca river originates on the eastern slopes of the rocky mountains and flows unregulated approximately 1500 km through alberta in a north easterly direction to the athabasca delta and lake athabasca see fig 2 water quality in the athabasca river and tributaries is rated as good or excellent charette and trites 2011 fiera 2012 with relatively low contributions from non point sources associated with urban and agricultural development fiera 2013 this study focuses on a stretch along the lower athabasca river downstream of fort mcmurray see fig 3 between water quality sampling stations m3 and m4 the lower athabasca river within the oil sands region extends from just upstream of fort mcmurray to the athabasca delta at fort mcmurray there is a convergence of the athabasca river with the clearwater river which has unique water quality and flow characteristics compared to the athabasca river upstream of the athabasca clearwater river confluence mixing of the clearwater river water is delayed and results in gradients in concentrations of chloride and other ions for many kilometres downstream of the confluence major tributaries along the lower athabasca river are the steepbank muskeg mckay ells and firebag rivers however only the steepbank river whose average flow constitutes less than 1 of the athabasca river is found within our modelling domain the lower reaches of the clearwater river and many areas of the lower athabasca river are incised into the devonian and cretaceous geological formations as a result there are numerous fens springs and riverbed seeps that contribute high salinity groundwater to the river roy et al 2016 gue et al 2018 birks et al 2018 additionally erosion of the bank and bed of tributaries contributes bituminous material to the athabasca river along the upper athabasca river are sources of natural bitumen erosion including prominent mcmurray formation outcrops at crooked rapids mountain rapids and between mountain rapids and fort mcmurray hein et al 2001 there is also substantial bituminous material in the clearwater river and other smaller tributaries the lower athabasca river contains many islands secondary channels wetlands and floodplain lakes many of these secondary channels freeze to the bottom or have low oxygen levels during winter sediment deposition areas occur below tributaries confluence bars in mid channel bars and in secondary channels throughout the river during flooding events in tributaries substantial amounts of oil sands material can be transported downstream and deposited on the surface of confluence bars over time these areas of high oil sands material are mixed with sediment coming from upstream and are diluted conly et al 2002 most sediments conveyed through the lower athabasca river stem from upstream sources in the athabasca and clearwater rivers with minor contributions from tributaries and from within the lower athabasca river there is an abrupt change in the river slope at fort mcmurray at the confluence of the clearwater river where the gradient of about 0 00014 carson and hudson 1997 downstream of fort mcmurray there is less gravel than the upstream reaches and the substrate is dominated by sand between fort mackay and embarras airport the river slope decreases further to about 0 0001 and the character of the channel becomes more sinuous with occasional well developed meanders and a well defined floodplain of silt and sand has been built up in most places the bed is sandy throughout with finer sediment in the secondary channels downstream of the embarras airport the river gradient again decreases as the river enters the peace athabasca delta bed sediment in this area is much finer as silt and clay settle out in the more slowly flowing water the athabasca river receives continuous releases from five pulp mills and four municipal wastewater treatment plants upstream of fort mcmurray in 2011 the total release from these uses was estimated to be about 5 m3 s ag 2015 wastewater loadings to the lower athabasca river are limited to treated municipal wastewater from the city of fort mcmurray suncor s industrial release and syncrude s clean water release in addition approximately 3300 tonnes of road salt are applied as road de icing agents in fort mcmurray in the winter jasechko et al 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydraulic modelling with hec ras the hydraulic model hec ras developed by the u s army corps of engineers was used to simulate the hydrodynamics of the model domain flow rates of 600 m3 s approximate average flow at the athabasca river gauge below fort mcmurray and 1600 m3 s a high flow corresponding to approximately the maximum 3rd quartile of monthly flow were chosen to run the model for steady state conditions water quality data were also available for these flows the flow widths average depths and water volumes between cross sections were used as a basis for the dimensioning of the segmentation of the wasp model described below bathymetry data provided by alberta environment and parks was used to generate the 100 cross sections at approximately 500 m intervals along the model domain due to the lack of gauges along this stretch the model s accuracy for predicting water level elevations was verified through the hydraulic model one d in a previous study sabokruhie et al 2021 the one dimensional hec ras model could not be coupled to the quasi two dimensional wasp model since hec ras incorporates the entire cross section of the channel as a single entity the cross sections cannot be further discretized into two entities transversely as we have done in our quasi two dimensional wasp setup as left and right stream tubes along the channel 2 2 water quality analysis simulation package wasp the water quality analysis simulation program wasp 8 3 2 was used to model the water quality of the study a stretch of the lower athabasca river wasp is a finite difference model for analysing the transport and fate of sediments and toxicants in aquatic environments and to simulate key processes to describe eutrophication this latest version of wasp has undergone many significant changes which are briefly discussed in wool et al 2020 the model was developed based on the conservation of mass momentum and energy the model domain is discretised by water volumes called segments allowing the simulation of water depths flow velocities and water volumes based on the segment geometries and roughness coefficients these in turn control the passage of sediments and chemicals by advection deposition resuspension partitioning oxidation photolysis and many other processes and transformations additional inputs to the model include a flow routing map boundary conditions environmental functions constants loads and initial conditions for segments the wasp segment geometries were generated from the hec ras model the uneven shape of the channel was described using a depth exponent of 0 3 the segment length considered for modelling was 500 m this length grants an acceptable mixing and an approximate uniform volume for segments and deems computational times acceptable although the water quality simulations were carried out one dimensionally the discretization of the surface water segments into two stream tubes longitudinally along the studied reach allowed for a two dimensional representation of the model domain as shown in fig 4 a novel approach we have coined quasi two dimensional modelling benthic segments were also inserted under each surface water segment to characterise erosion and deposition processes for the upstream model boundary the flow from the clearwater river was supplied to the right stream tube segment while the upper athabasca river flow flow along the athabasca river upstream of the athabasca clearwater river confluence was inserted into the left stream tube segment the width of each stream tube was proportional to the discharge allocation the flow mapping was carried out in such a way that a 50 50 ratio of the flow in each tube was achieved by the time the flow reached the downstream boundary from the 80 20 ratio of the left right stream tubes for the upper athabasca clearwater flows at the upstream boundary the draper gauge provided daily flows along the clearwater river whereas the upper athabasca river flow was obtained by simple subtraction of the clearwater river flow from the flow recorded at the athabasca river gauge downstream of fort mcmurray this estimation was deemed suitable since transit times between gauges are much shorter than one day for total flows at the athabasca river gauge of 600 and 1600 m3 s the clearwater river supplies respectively approximately 14 and 16 of the flow to the lower athabasca river flow mapping was carried out to characterise a complete mixing in the 50 km stretch of the modelling domain transverse transport between segments was configured so that a 1 1 flow ratio was obtained after 50 kilometres of flow at the downstream boundary of the model domain this was done by progressively inserting flows between laterally adjacent segments with more flows from left stream tube segments to right stream tube segments as shown in fig 5 the hydrodynamics of the system was modelled using the kinematic wave flow option throughout the network the algorithm used to solve the equations involves finite difference formulations of flow and continuity in one dimensional conditions this method is based on solutions of one dimensional continuity equations and the momentum equation that addresses gravity and friction the flow between the left and right side segments was transferred by diverting 1 of the longitudinal flow between adjacent upstream and downstream segments to laterally adjacent segments alternating from right to left and left to right with the right side progressively receiving more water volume and the left side less water volume at the upstream boundary 80 of the flow was emitted in the left stream tube whereas 20 in the right stream tube based on the 80 20 ratio of the flows from the upper athabasca and clearwater rivers respectively the 1 flow exchange was configured in such as way that the downstream boundary flows in the left and right stream tubes became balanced 50 50 at this location the concentrations of sediment and chloride across the river were relatively uniform indicating full mixing the kinematic wave equation was used to model the flow from one segment to another the kinematic wave estimates wave propagation and variation in flow velocity through a stream network kinematic wave formulation controls flow by river bottom and slope roughness and can be described using manning s equation q 1 n a 5 3 b 2 3 s 0 1 2 and the continuity equation differentiated with respect to distance in the flow direction and time q x α β q β 1 q t 0 where q is flow x is distance in the flow direction one dimensional flow t is time α and β are functions of hydraulic coefficients which are related to channel geometry s 0 is the bottom slope n is manning s roughness coefficient a is cross sectional area and b is channel width a depth exponent is used along with segment geometries to estimate hydraulic coefficients which are later used to calculate segment flow depths under specific flow rates a more detailed description of stream transport in wasp is provided in wool et al 2020 further descriptions of the flow mapping and transverse mixing can be obtained from sabokruhie et al 2021 boundary and initial conditions for the segments were determined using existing water quality and flow data at the existing stations wasp uses flow and dispersion paths to specify boundary paths for the upstream boundary condition these data were obtained from the m3 station initial concentrations for all segments along the model domain were derived by linear interpolation of values between the m3 and m4 stations settling of silt and clay was estimated using stokes law and the settling velocity of sand was estimated based on ferguson and church 2004 resuspension was based on van rijn 2007 to model vanadium the partitioning coefficient was obtained from allison and allison 2005 the deposition rate of vanadium was calibrated using the sampled concentration at the upstream and downstream model boundaries the concentration of vanadium in the riverbed was taken to be 18 mg kg which is an average of all the values available from field sampling see fig 6 the model was run in a steady state until equilibrium conditions of constituent concentrations in all segments was reached 3 results 3 1 total suspended sediment constitutent sampling was carried out for many days between 2011 and 2018 however the sampling at stations m3 and m4 were carried out on different days constitutents for flows of approximately 600 m3 s and 1600 m3 s 25 for each were sought and collated in fig 6 as indicated in the top panels of fig 6 for the lower flow scenario of 600 m3 s the total suspended sediment concentrations are only slightly greater stemming from the upper athabasca river left stream tube than those from the clearwater river right stream tube the concentrations quickly become uniform across the two streams as flow moves downstream as indicated by the 600 m3 s longitudinal profiles in fig 7 for the higher flow scenario there is a larger difference in total suspended sediment concentrations between the upper athabasca and clearwater rivers see bottom left panel of fig 6 about one third less for the clearwater river the concentrations are almost uniform between the two stream tubes by the time the flow reaches the downstream model domain boundary at station m4 see bottom right panel of fig 6 the total suspended sediment concentrations between the two streams become uniform quicker at the higher flow scenario as indicated by the 1600 m3 s longitudinal profiles in fig 7 this is due to both the larger transverse flows between laterally adjacent segments and the high concentration gradients between the two stream tubes fig 8 3 2 chloride chloride was modelled for the same flow dates as for total suspended sediments above in order to show that our quasi two dimensional model setup can capture the lateral mixing along the lower athabasca river chloride is considered to be a conservative substance making it suitable for tracking its mixing along a river for the upstream boundary of our modelling domain at station m3 referring to the left panels of fig 9 chloride concentrations in the right stream tube hence from the clearwater river are higher than the concentrations in the left stream tube hence the upper athabasca river for both flow scenarios of 600 and 1600 m3 s the concentrations of chloride in the two streams remain relatively the same there is a slight increase in chloride concentrations at 1600 m3 s compared to 600 m3 s by the time the flow has reached the downstream boundary of our modelling domain at station m4 referring to the right panels of fig 9 chloride concentrations across the transect are almost uniform indicating the complete mixing of chloride has occurred across both stream tubes chloride concentrations are slightly greater at the 600 m3 s flow scenario compared to the higher 1600 m3 s flow this is substantiated with the longitudinal profiles of simulated chloride concentrations along the model domain between station m3 upstream boundary and station m4 downstream boundary shown in fig 10 the chloride concentrations along the right stream tube tend to drop off faster for the higher flow scenario due to the higher mixing between segments at higher flows lateral flows between segments are input as a percentage of the longitudinal flow through the segments hence for higher flows a larger flow is simulated between two laterally adjacent segments the chloride concentrations in the left stream tube increase slightly for the lower flow scenario but dilute more for the higher flow simulation 3 3 vanadium referring to fig 11 and fig 12 vanadium was present mainly in particulate form for both left and right stream tubes and for both flow scenarios of 600 and 1600 m3 s eighty percent of the metal was in particulate form at 600 m3 s whereas 97 of it was particulate at 1600 m3 s particulate vanadium concentrations were almost 10 times higher at the higher flow compared to the lower flow scenario this follows a trend in which more of the vanadium is transported in particulate form at higher flows which aligns with more sediment being transported in the river at higher flows particularly for the upper athabasca river modelling both particulate and dissolved fractions of vanadium concentrations required setting both a partitioning coefficient and deposition rate for the particulate fraction as shown in fig 11 initial simulations without additional non point source loading were not obtained between simulated and observed vanadium concentrations at station m4 particularly the dissolved fraction of vanadium the left stream tube for a flow of 600 m3 s was also underestimated especially at the lower flow scenario top right panel of fig 11 although the discrepancy for the particulate fraction was not as large hence an additional source of dissolved vanadium with loading was included in the simulations as shown in the longitudinal profiles in fig 12 this markedly improved the accuracy of the simulations with modelled values matching observations better especially for dissolved vanadium some of the additional dissolved vanadium load partitioned to its particulate form this partitioning was stronger at the lower flow scenario of 600 m3 s an additional 3 kg day and 1 kg day of dissolved vanadium needed to be added as a diffuse loading to respectively the left and right stream tubes of the modelling domain the additional loading of dissolved vanadium was distributed along the course of the river as a diffuse load of approximately 0 06 and 0 02 kg day km respectively for the left and right sides of the river at the 600 m3 s flow rate these values were decreased 10 fold for the high flow of 1600 m3 s these amounts were determined through the calibration process as was the case for chloride and total suspended sediment the left and right stream concentrations of both particulate and dissolved vanadium were nearly uniform at the downstream boundary of the model domain at m4 4 discussion 4 1 total suspended sediment the higher sediment concentrations in the upper athabasca river compared to the clearwater river at higher flows can be attributed to the larger catchment size of the former river providing higher ratios of flow to the lower athabasca river and more eroded and transported sources of sediment it is evident that the athabasca river carries more sediment concentration compared to the clearwater river total suspended sediment concentrations increase exponentially with flow for both the upper athabasca and clearwater rivers as was similarly found by sabokruhie et al 2021 4 2 chloride the chloride simulations indicate that our quasi two dimension approach is suitable to mimic transverse mixing along a river chloride concentrations along both stream tubes converge to become closer to being uniform as flow moves further downstream in this case flow lengths of up to 50 km are required for full mixing to have occurred mixing is faster leading to shorter mixing lengths for higher flows mixing is induced by not only longitudinal flows along the stream tubes but transverse flow between laterally adjacent segments these flows are higher for higher flow scenarios mixing is also quicker between the two stream tubes when concentration gradients of substances between the two streams is greater 4 3 vanadium shotyk et al 2017 also investigated the transport of dissolved vanadium and noted a statistically significant increase in concentration along the lower athabasca river however they did not attribute the increase to any specific source their data which was collected on the same day and shows an increase in concentrations between their sites corresponding to stations m3 to m4 with the increase occurring primarily between just upstream of the steepbank river inflow to just downstream of saline lake approximately a 9 km stretch vanadium is elevated in local tributaries including the mildred lake reservoir which is used for the syncrude potable water supply tondu 2017 hence it can be assumed that vanadium is present in surficial aquifer and muskeg dewatering water from the mine sites additional sources may be surficial aquifer water that is exfiltrating into the river deposition of dust and bank erosion other possible sources such as contaminated sediment or tailings water seepage do not seem as likely based on the available evidence these transport processes have been described as critically important to understanding potential environmental effects of oil sands development our modelling has the aim to determine those processes that are critical to understanding impacts to the peace athabasca delta but on a much smaller scale the sediment processes and the representation of a floodplain lake and a secondary channel are important parts of the design these types of features were addressed in the mike 11 dibike et al 2018 and efdc kashyap et al 2017 modelling with the relevance of the work described in detail by culp et al 2021 hence a scenario was run with our model which included a side lake in the floodplain with additional segments representing the deep and shallow areas of shipyard lake and a secondary channel removal of lateral flow exchange between the left mainstem and right secondary channel stream tubes to determine the transport behaviour of vanadium in these features the modified segmentation is shown in fig 13 as expected vanadium concentrations in the lake are less than in the adjacent stream of the mainstem increased residence times and lower flow velocities contribute to the high sedimentation rates within the lake areas fig 14 5 conclusions the quasi two dimensional approach was successful in capturing the mixing character of tributary water clearwater river with the mainstem water upper athabasca river substantiated by the simulation of chloride a conservative constituent and total suspended sediment a length of 50 km suffices to mix constituents uniformly for a range of flows between 2nd i e the mean and 3rd quartiles of recorded flows mixing is quicker at higher flows an additional loading of dissolved vanadium was required to simulated values to match observed concentrations including outfalls in the modelling is a topic of future work which may require an additional stream tube to be included in the discretisation especially if the outfalls are at both the left and right banks and less than 50 flow kilometres apart see fig 15 this is the case for the proposed outfalls of syncrude and suncor one being on the left bank and the other on the right bank of the lower athabasca river the flow distance between the two outfall locations is approximately 15 km from each other using the quasi two dimensional modelling approach has applicability beyond riverine systems impacted by mining sites floodplains can be included in the discretisation as a separate cluster of segments connected to the mainstem of the river segmentation credit authorship contribution statement kel conceptualization ps tr data curation kel tr formal

8046,study region the danube river basin study focus hydrological modelling of large heterogeneous watersheds requires appropriate meteorological forcing data the global meteorological reanalysis era5 and the global forcing dataset wfde5 were evaluated for driving an uncalibrated setup of the mechanistic hydrological model promet 0 00833333 1 h resolution for the period 1980 2016 different climatologies were used for linear bias correction of era5 the global worldclim 2 temperature and precipitation climatologies and the regional glowa and prism alpine precipitation climatologies simulations driven with the uncorrected era5 reanalysis the wfde5 forcing dataset era5 bias corrected with worldclim 2 and era5 bias corrected with a glowa prism worldclim 2 mosaic were evaluated regarding percent bias of discharge and model efficiency new hydrological insights for the region simulations yielded good model efficiencies and low percent biases of discharge at selected gauges uncalibrated model efficiencies corresponded with previous hydrological modelling studies era5 and wfde5 were well suited to drive promet in the hydrologically complex danube basin but bias correction of precipitation was essential for era5 the era5 driven simulation bias corrected with a glowa prism worldclim 2 mosaic performed best bias correction with glowa and prism outperformed worldclim 2 in the alps due to more realistic small scale alpine precipitation patterns resulting from higher station densities in mountainous terrain we emphasize the need for regional high resolution precipitation climatologies and recommend them for bias correction of precipitation rather than global datasets keywords reanalysis precipitation climatology observational uncertainty alpine precipitation worldclim 2 promet 1 introduction hydrological modelling is critically dependent on accurate meteorological forcing data observations from ground based weather station networks are a very appropriate source of meteorological forcing data but are often only available at the scale of smaller watersheds however hydrological modelling of large scale watersheds covering hundreds of thousands of km² or more has gained increasing scientific interest at this scale international river basin organizations irbos have been established for most transboundary watersheds around the world such as the international commission for the protection of the danube river icpdr for the danube river basin drb for instance the irbos require scenario analyses of trade offs between different management interventions regarding agriculture or water management in the context of climate change biodiversity or aquatic ecology for which hydrological modelling provides an indispensable contribution abbaspour et al 2015 döll et al 2009 malagó et al 2017 however when it comes to hydrological modelling of large scale watersheds continuous observation time series from weather station networks typically become sparse therefore modelling studies have increasingly relied on high resolution gridded meteorological forcing datasets such as global reanalyses or regional climate models rcms e g beck et al 2017 chen et al 2018 essou et al 2017 essou et al 2016 kay et al 2015 tarek et al 2020 for example the newly available global reanalysis era5 hersbach et al 2020 and the global forcing dataset wfde5 cucchi et al 2020 deliver a global coverage with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and 0 5 and hourly temporal resolution for most of the global land surface these meteorological forcing datasets now approximate or surpass the spatial data density of available weather station networks significantly facilitating hydrological modelling in data scarce regions tarek et al 2020 even in well equipped regions such as central europe high resolution meteorological forcing datasets approach the spatial density and temporal resolution of weather station networks in switzerland for example the weather station density corresponds to one station per 475 km² for temperature and one per 100 km² for precipitation gubler et al 2017 moreover a decline in operating ground based weather stations has been observed in recent years in most countries around the world essou et al 2016 the availability of global to regional high resolution gridded meteorological drivers offers great potential to compensate for this declining trend in observation data availability tarek et al 2020 but still raises questions regarding their suitability for driving hydrological models especially in large and complex watersheds being the successor to era interim dee et al 2011 era5 benefits from a decade of developments in model physics core dynamics and data assimilation hersbach et al 2020 and should therefore outperform classical and even sophisticated interpolation of weather station network observations in terms of adequately describing atmospheric dynamics nevertheless global reanalyses often show systematic regionally distributed biases compared to ground based weather station observations especially of precipitation which has led to the development of bias correction methodologies muñoz sabater et al 2021 weedon et al 2011 from a meteorological perspective bias correction of reanalyses is widely considered an essential task to better reproduce spatial patterns of meteorological observations but is nonetheless controversial for hydrological modelling purposes essou et al 2016 the bias correction procedure is usually embedded in the downscaling routine of the gridded meteorological data where complex sub scale spatial characteristics of the meteorological parameters especially in mountainous terrain are incorporated shrestha et al 2017 interestingly existing studies on the evaluation of bias correction routines have focused almost exclusively on different methods for bias correction e g linear vs quantile mapping chen et al 2013 lafon et al 2013 and have very rarely questioned the choice of appropriate reference observational data first attempts of questioning the application specific choice of reference datasets in the light of observational uncertainties have been undertaken by prein and gobiet 2017 kotlarski et al 2019 and gampe et al 2019 finding that observational uncertainties can be considerable depending on the reference dataset gampe et al 2019 emphasized that considering multiple reference datasets for bias correction is highly important for obtaining robust results in climate change impact studies from a hydrological perspective model calibration is widely perceived as another essential task to account for conceptualizations and aggregations of hydrological processes in the model description that are not fully physically described yilmaz et al 2010 for this purpose suitable model parameters are often determined by trial and error calibration of the hydrological model across the hydrological modelling community great efforts are being undertaken to calibrate empirical and physically based hydrological models down to the scale of smallest sub basins to maximize model efficiency for the drb e g pagliero et al 2014 and stagl and hattermann 2015 such calibration efforts result in the best possible model fit over the chosen spatial and temporal model framework but limit transferability over space and time especially when considering for example climate change impact effects or as in our case comparing the suitability of different meteorological forcing datasets for hydrological modelling in this paper we analysed the performance of the global meteorological reanalysis era5 and the global bias adjusted forcing dataset wfde5 for driving a physically based hydrological model in a large heterogeneous watershed and the possible improvements that could be achieved by linear temperature and precipitation bias correction of era5 with different global and regional reference climatologies for this purpose we applied different configurations for bias correction of era5 during the downscaling process in a first step no bias correction was applied at all in a second step different combinations of the global worldclim 2 temperature and precipitation climatologies fick and hijmans 2017 the glowa alpine precipitation climatology früh et al 2006 and the prism alpine precipitation climatology frei and schär 1998 were used as reference datasets for linear bias correction of temperature and precipitation to ensure the best possible comparability between these different meteorological forcing datasets the hydrological model was not calibrated with measured discharge and an identical model setup and parametrization was used for all simulation runs ceteris paribus conditions we chose the large scale drb for a regional case study which features very heterogeneous natural regions and hydrological characteristics comprising mountain ranges alps dinarides carpathians and extended lowlands pannonian basin romanian plain due to its complexity the drb is a very appropriate pilot basin for a detailed analysis of the performance of global scale meteorological forcing datasets for hydrological modelling and of the suitability of different reference datasets for bias correction under widely varying landscape conditions for our simulation studies we used the mechanistic hydro agroecological model promet mauser and bach 2009 at a spatial resolution of 30 0 00833333 we performed four different long term hydrological simulation runs see sect 2 4 driven with the downscaled and optionally bias corrected global meteorological reanalysis era5 and the downscaled global meteorological forcing dataset wfde5 in the drb for the period 1980 2016 first we show a comparison of spatial patterns of long term mean annual precipitation between the different downscaled meteorological forcing datasets and compare them with existing observation derived precipitation maps of the danube second we compare area averages of sub basin specific long term annual means of temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration between the forcing datasets third we evaluate the performance of the optionally bias corrected global meteorological forcing datasets in terms of percent bias of discharge and model efficiency metrics for all simulation runs model efficiency metrics and percent bias of discharge were calculated from the comparison between modelled and observed daily discharge at selected sub basin gauges based on our results we discuss the performance of the uncalibrated hydrological model in general evaluate the suitability of the global meteorological datasets for driving a hydrological model in a larger watershed and discuss the importance of bias correction in this context we particularly highlight how the choice of different global to regional reference climatologies for bias correction of precipitation affected percent bias of discharge and model efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 the danube river basin shared by 20 countries the drb is the most international river basin in the world and the second largest river basin 817 000 km² in europe jungwirth et al 2014 the danube river drains wide parts of central and south eastern europe and as a waterway connects very heterogeneous natural cultural and economic regions jungwirth et al 2014 the danube originates in the black forest in south western germany and passes 10 countries to its mouth in the black sea on its way the danube gradually changes its character from a mountain to a lowland river crossing mountainous terrain along the eastern alpine foothills as well as large basins like the vienna basin the pannonian basin and the romanian plain see fig 1 hence its watershed comprises very heterogeneous hydrological characteristics including mountain watersheds such as the upper danube the drava and the sava basin and lowland watersheds such as the tributary basins of the middle and lower danube linked to this the drb is commonly divided by mountain ranges into three main sections the upper danube extends from its source to the devín gate in the little carpathians at the border of austria and slovakia jungwirth et al 2014 the middle danube extends to the iron gate in the carpathians at the border of hungary and romania and from here the lower danube extends down to the mouth including the danube delta jungwirth et al 2014 in accordance with the heterogeneous topography annual precipitation is very unevenly distributed throughout the danube basin in contrast to the water towers alps and dinarides with annual rainfall of up to 3200 mm a in the alpine high mountain range the lower danube features rather dry lowland regions like the pannonian basin and the romanian plain where annual rainfall amounts to 350 mm a schiller et al 2010 after 2857 river km from source to mouth the average discharge mq of the danube river at the outlet gauge in ceatal izmail amounts to 6550 m³ s schiller et al 2010 2 2 the hydro agroecological model promet the physically based hydro agroecological model promet processes of radiation mass and energy transfer mauser and bach 2009 mauser et al 2015 models water energy and carbon fluxes in an interlinked manner strictly closing energy and mass balance on the land surface promet simulates all processes in hourly time steps on a spatially distributed raster based architecture of custom spatial resolution in this study we chose to run promet on a 30 grid 0 00833333 spatial resolution 1 km² at the equator and with hourly temporal resolution the model framework of promet comprises different components such as meteorology soil groundwater vegetation channel flow and agricultural management with e g fertilization and irrigation options modules which are described in detail in mauser and bach 2009 hank et al 2015 mauser et al 2015 and zabel et al 2014 the vegetation module simulates net primary production land surface energy balance and evapotranspiration in an iterative manner using the mechanistic plant physiology approach of farquhar et al 1980 and chen et al 1994 dynamically computing transpiration and co2 assimilation by c3 and c4 plant photosynthesis processes thereby a phenological component is triggered that uses trait information to simulate the weather dependent annual development of 28 different plant types representing various agricultural crops pasture forest and natural vegetation see sect 2 5 the channel flow component calculates the channel routing of surface flow interflow and baseflow through the river network to an outlet gauge following the approach of muskingum cunge todini cunge 1969 todini 2007 due to its physical and physiological basis and spatial heterogeneity a classical calibration of the promet model parameters to fit measured discharge is neither feasible nor desirable therefore heterogeneous input parameters are used for watershed characterization terrain soil land use river width channel slope and manning coefficients as well as for the system of linear storages which receive percolation and are used to determine baseflow the dynamical vegetation module is likewise supplied with consistent parameter sets for each plant type in the basin see sect 2 5 in this study promet was run with a comprehensive and plausibility tested parametrization for hydrology and vegetation 2 3 meteorological downscaling and bias correction the promet hydrological simulations are driven with gridded hourly time series of meteorological input parameters required parameters are air temperature 2 m height total precipitation air humidity 2 m height surface air pressure wind speed 2 m height surface downwelling direct and diffuse shortwave solar radiation as well as surface downwelling longwave radiation the promet meteorology module contains a routine that downscales and disaggregates coarse gridded meteorological forcing data to the custom spatial and temporal model resolution in promet a spatial downscaling approach is applied to the meteorological forcing data according to marke et al 2014 to bridge the gap between the coarse spatial resolution of the meteorological forcing datasets and the custom internal promet model resolution 30 in this study according to the approach of marke et al 2014 local elevation gradients are determined for elevation dependent parameters and combined with the interpolation of de trended residuals as part of the spatial downscaling routine a spatially distributed linear bias correction of hourly temperature and precipitation can optionally be applied for this promet applies spatially distributed daily patterns of bias correction coefficients to the downscaled meteorological forcing data to account for local biases in the meteorological parameters spatially distributed daily bias correction coefficients are derived from observed monthly climatologies of temperature and precipitation for the linear bias correction additive bias correction factors are used for temperature and multiplicative bias correction factors are used for precipitation bias correction of temperature is calculated following eq 1 1 t corr t t raw t f tbias d where t raw t is the downscaled hourly temperature from the meteorological forcing data on a certain pixel f tbias d the pixel specific daily additive temperature correction factor and t corr t the resulting bias corrected hourly temperature value on the pixel bias correction of precipitation is calculated following eq 2 2 p corr t p raw t f pbias d where p raw t is the downscaled hourly precipitation from the meteorological forcing data on a certain pixel f pbias d the pixel specific daily multiplicative precipitation correction factor and p corr t the resulting bias corrected hourly precipitation value on the pixel spatially distributed additive temperature correction factors are calculated following eq 3 3 f tbias mon t climmean mon t rawmean mon where f tbias mon is the pixel specific monthly additive temperature correction factor t climmean mon the long term monthly mean temperature of the reference climatology on the pixel and t rawmean mon the long term monthly mean temperature of the downscaled meteorological forcing data on the pixel spatially distributed multiplicative precipitation correction factors are calculated following eq 4 4 f pbias mon p climmean mon p rawmean mon where f pbias mon is the pixel specific monthly multiplicative precipitation correction factor p climmean mon the long term monthly mean precipitation sum of the reference climatology on the pixel and p rawmean mon the long term monthly mean precipitation sum of the downscaled meteorological forcing data on the pixel in a last step daily correction factors for temperature and precipitation are determined by a simple cubic interpolation of the monthly correction factors for each pixel 2 4 meteorological forcing data and climatologies for bias correction for the hydrological modelling study in this paper we used the era5 climate reanalysis produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and the derived bias corrected wfde5 forcing dataset as meteorological drivers era5 is a global atmospheric land and oceanic reanalysis calculated by the integrated forecasting system cy41r2 hersbach et al 2020 it is available from 1 january 1979 until present with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and hourly temporal resolution wfde5 is a global forcing dataset directly based on era5 which is available from 1 january 1979 until 31 december 2018 on a spatial resolution of 0 5 and hourly temporal resolution wfde5 was derived from era5 surface meteorological variables which were aggregated to 0 5 spatial resolution and some of them bias corrected according to the watch forcing data wfd methodology cucchi et al 2020 weedon et al 2011 for precipitation bias correction is either based on the observed monthly climate research unit times series version 4 03 cru ts4 03 harris et al 2014 precipitation totals for 1979 2018 or on the observed monthly global precipitation climatology centre version 2018 gpccv2018 schneider et al 2017 precipitation totals for 1979 2016 cucchi et al 2020 hence wfde5 precipitation is provided in a cru based and in a gpcc based version cucchi et al 2020 in this study we used wfde5 version 1 1 with gpcc based precipitation for the era5 and wfde5 meteorological forcing datasets it was necessary to apply a spatial downscaling procedure to comply with the promet model resolution of 30 in this study see sect 2 3 however since both era5 and wfde5 are available on hourly temporal resolution no temporal disaggregation was necessary to comply with the hourly model time steps in promet to systematically determine the comparative skills of era5 and wfde5 for driving promet we used the downscaled era5 reanalysis as meteorological forcing for the hydrological simulations in different modifications first without any bias correction subsequently we bias corrected temperature and precipitation based on different global to regional reference climatologies for this we used the following temperature and precipitation reference climatologies the global worldclim 2 climatologies fick and hijmans 2017 of long term mean monthly temperature and precipitation for the period 1970 2000 with a spatial resolution of 30 0 00833333 the worldclim 2 climatologies are based on 34 542 global weather stations from multiple sources fick and hijmans 2017 the regional prism climatology of long term mean monthly precipitation covering the european alps frei and schär 1998 schwarb et al 2001 for the period 1971 1990 with a spatial resolution of 2 5 0 04166666 the prism climatology is based on more than 6600 rain gauge stations frei and schär 1998 and was thus created from a higher station density in the european alps than worldclim 2 the regional glowa climatology of long term mean monthly precipitation covering the upper danube basin früh et al 2006 for the period 1991 2000 with a spatial resolution of 30 0 00833333 the glowa climatology is directly based on the prism climatology which was transformed to the more recent reference period using 2198 weather stations früh et al 2006 for temperature we created a single dataset of spatially distributed bias correction factors with a spatial resolution of 30 according to eq 3 here we used long term monthly mean temperatures of the worldclim 2 reference climatology 1970 2000 and long term monthly means of downscaled era5 temperature 1979 2000 for precipitation we created two different datasets of spatially distributed bias correction factors with a spatial resolution of 30 based on different combinations of precipitation correction factors derived from worldclim 2 glowa and prism according to eq 4 we used long term monthly mean precipitation sums of the respective climatology worldclim 2 glowa or prism and long term monthly means of downscaled era5 precipitation sums for respective overlapping reference periods for the worldclim 2 derived precipitation bias correction factors we took the era5 period 1979 2000 for the glowa derived correction factors we took the era5 period 1991 2000 and for the prism derived correction factors we took the era5 period 1979 1990 the two bias correction factor datasets for precipitation generated in this way consisted of i the worldclim 2 derived precipitation correction factors for the whole danube basin the meteorological forcing dataset consisting of era5 variables of which precipitation was bias corrected with this precipitation correction dataset and of which temperature was bias corrected with the worldclim 2 derived temperature correction factors is further referred to as era5 wc in this paper ii a mosaic of the glowa derived precipitation correction factors for the upper danube basin the prism derived precipitation correction factors for the alps and northern dinarides outside the upper danube basin and the worldclim 2 derived precipitation correction factors in the remaining danube basin see fig 2 the meteorological forcing dataset consisting of era5 variables of which precipitation was bias corrected with this precipitation correction dataset and of which temperature was bias corrected with the worldclim 2 derived temperature correction factors is further referred to as era5 gpw in this paper in contrast to era5 we applied no additional bias correction to the downscaled wfde5 product as it has already been bias corrected according to the wfd methodology described in cucchi et al 2020 and weedon et al 2011 in this study we therefore performed four different hydrological simulation runs in the drb each driven by one of the following meteorological forcing datasets i era5 ii era5 wc iii era5 gpw and iv wfde5 in table 1 we give an overview of the four different meteorological forcing datasets and global to regional datasets optionally used for bias correction of temperature and precipitation 2 5 model setup and gridded input data promet used a digital terrain model derived from the global srtm shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model farr et al 2007 in which radiometric slope and aspect was calculated from the srtm elevation information promet requires radiometric slope and aspect together with cloud cover from the meteorological forcing data to retrieve hourly direct and diffuse shortwave solar radiation components from the surface downwelling shortwave solar radiation soil properties data were derived from the harmonized world soil database hwsd fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 soil specific sets of physical and hydraulic parameters were created for a four layer soil column of 2 m depth following the approach of brooks and corey 1964 in mountainous terrain of 10 slope we reduced total soil depth to 0 9 m watershed delineation spatial flow direction and accumulation were derived from the global hydrosheds database lehner et al 2008 the land use map of the drb used in this study is based on a mosaic of the corine land cover 2012 european environmental agency eea 2012 and the global esa cci land cover 2015 european space agency esa 2015 the corine land cover includes all eu member states within the drb i e germany austria italy poland czech republic slovakia hungary slovenia croatia romania and bulgaria as well as switzerland and the non eu balkan states i e bosnia and herzegovina serbia montenegro kosovo north macedonia and albania the esa cci land cover includes the territories of ukraine and moldova within the drb that are missing in the corine land cover the two land cover products provide detailed spatial information on a wide range of land cover categories but lack information on the distribution of most agricultural crops except for rice fields vineyards olive groves fruits and berries which are explicitly spatially distributed in the corine land cover for hydrological modelling though the proportional distribution of crops within sub basins is vital because the modelled biophysical processes and water fluxes such as evapo transpiration are very crop specific to account for this the promet dynamical vegetation module comprises several land use classes they consist of 21 classes of agricultural crops maize winter summer wheat winter summer barley rye oat rapeseed sunflower soybean silage forage hop legumes potato sugar beet rice cotton vegetables fruits set aside 2 pasture classes extensive intensive grassland and 5 classes of natural vegetation coniferous deciduous forest natural grassland wetland alpine vegetation they are completed by 5 non vegetative classes rock water glacier residential industrial built up to create a land use map including the spatial distribution of agricultural crops we consulted eu wide and national statistics eurostat 2013 on the cultivation area ha of the different crops per nuts ii region for 2013 as reference year based on the cultivation statistics we performed a spatially randomized distribution of agricultural crops over the agricultural land in the corine and the esa cci land cover within each nuts ii region in doing so we did not attempt to achieve a completely spatially accurate distribution of agricultural crops which is not even necessary due to crop rotation but we developed a statistically correct representation of the proportional shares of crops on the agricultural land in each nuts ii region comprehensive parameters for vegetation parametrization sowing date growing season fertilization level were derived from sacks et al 2010 and from agricultural crop yield statistics on country level eurostat 2021 2 6 sub basin division and evaluation metrics considering long term availability of discharge measurements we divided the danube basin into 8 sub basins see fig 3 for which we analysed spatial precipitation patterns area averaged values for temperature precipitation evapotranspiration as well as percent bias of discharge and model efficiency based on modelled and observed daily discharge at the respective sub basin outlet gauges discharge measurements were obtained from the global runoff data centre grdc 2019 and the international commission for the protection of the danube river icpdr 2021 within the overlapping era5 and wfde5 data availability period 1979 2018 daily discharge observations were available mainly for the period 1979 2016 see table 2 thus we performed the four different hydrological simulation runs driven by era5 era5 wc era5 gpw and wfde5 for the period 1980 2016 considering a decent model spin up of 5 preceding years 1975 1979 from the results of the four different hydrological simulation runs we calculated the percent bias pbias of the long term daily discharge at the outlet gauges of the danube basin and each of its sub basins according to yapo et al 1996 eq 5 5 pbias t 1 t q mod t q obs t t 1 t q obs t 100 where q mod t stands for modelled discharge at time step t and q obs t for observed discharge at time step t with pbias we investigated whether the model correctly predicted the volume of modelled runoff or whether there was a potential tendency to over or underestimate modelled discharge in the specific sub basins we determined model efficiency based on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge of the daily discharge at the outlet gauges of the danube basin and each of its sub basins we calculated nse according to nash and sutcliffe 1970 eq 6 6 nse 1 t 1 t q mod t q obs t 2 t 1 t q obs t q obs 2 where q mod t is the modelled discharge at time step t q obs t is the observed discharge at time step t and q obs is the mean of observed discharges we calculated kge according to gupta et al 2009 and kling et al 2012 eq 7 7 kge 1 r 1 2 μ mod μ obs 1 2 σ mod μ mod σ obs μ obs 1 2 where r is the correlation coefficient between modelled and observed discharge μ mod is the mean modelled discharge μ obs is the mean observed discharge σ mod is the standard deviation of modelled discharge and σ obs is the standard deviation of observed discharge the kge metric is widely perceived as a significant improvement to nse and can be understood as a decomposition of nse into its components which measure the linear correlation the bias and the variability of flow gupta et al 2009 nevertheless both metrics have very specific strengths and weaknesses and cannot be directly compared to each other knoben et al 2019 nse 1 and kge 1 indicate perfect agreement between model and observations nse 0 and kge 0 41 indicate that the model has the same explanatory power as the mean of the observations and nse 0 and kge 0 41 indicate that the model is a worse predictor than the mean of the observations knoben et al 2019 3 results 3 1 spatial precipitation patterns a realistic representation of spatial precipitation patterns in the meteorological forcing data is crucial for successful hydrological modelling as rainfall distribution strongly influences the dynamics of runoff formation within a watershed and the timing and potential coincidence of flood waves at the confluences of rivers it is important to note that spatial precipitation patterns from interpolated observations are strongly dependent on the underlying interpolation methods interestingly we found that precipitation patterns differ greatly in various precipitation maps of the danube available in the literature fig 4 depicts a comparison of different maps showing observed precipitation from various sources as well as downscaled precipitation from our meteorological forcing datasets we show long term annual mean precipitation from interpolated observations for the period 1961 1990 created by the institute of hydrology at the slovak academy of sciences kovács 2010 petrovič et al 2010 in the following denoted as sas map a moreover we show long term annual mean precipitation from the e obs gridded precipitation observation product version 22 0e ensemble mean 0 1 spatial resolution for the period 1980 2016 cornes et al 2018 b furthermore we show long term annual mean downscaled precipitation for the period 1980 2016 from our forcing datasets era5 c era5 wc d era5 gpw e and wfde5 f apparently there are large differences in precipitation patterns visible between the two observation maps especially in mountain regions like the alps the dinarides and the carpathians particularly striking is that the sas precipitation map a shows a distinct rainfall band in the bavarian alpine foreland extending far to the east which is far less pronounced in the e obs precipitation map b the sas map moreover shows a round shaped dry region in the south eastern slovenian alps which is not present in the e obs map in the sas map precipitation ranges from 200 mm a near the danube delta to 2300 mm a in the alpine foreland close to the northern limestone alps and around the dinaric mountain peaks in the e obs map average precipitation amounts to 684 mm a with rainfall ranging from 273 mm a near the danube delta to 2218 mm a at the dinaric mountain peaks in the sava basin the era5 c and wfde5 f precipitation maps show rather smooth precipitation patterns due to the downscaling procedure without bias correction in contrast the era5 wc d and era5 gpw e precipitation maps feature visible topography structures due to the bias correction step included in the downscaling procedure here corresponding reference climatologies used for bias correction augmented the precipitation maps with small scale structures at a spatial resolution of 30 era5 was the wettest forcing dataset with 824 mm a precipitation on average over the whole basin minimum and maximum rainfall ranged from 449 mm a in the moldovan plain to 1943 mm a in the eastern alps in the alps and the alpine foreland rainfall patterns in the era5 map are rather evenly distributed and show little of the more complex structures that are visible in the sas and e obs maps of observed precipitation especially the inner alpine dry valleys of the inn catchment in the south western part of the upper danube in the southern sava basin and in the carpathian region patchy rainfall patterns are visible era5 wc was the driest forcing dataset with 754 mm a precipitation on average with rainfall ranging from 337 mm a near the danube delta to 2516 mm a around the alpine and dinaric mountain peaks in the drava and sava basins the era5 wc precipitation patterns in the alpine region especially the inner alpine dry valleys in the dinaric region and in the lower danube around the southern carpathian region are strikingly similar to the structures in the e obs rainfall map in the era5 gpw forcing dataset average precipitation amounted to 764 mm a with rainfall ranging from 337 mm a in the danube delta like era5 wc to very high local maxima of 3225 mm a at single mountain peaks in the northern sava basin in the era5 gpw precipitation map a strong resemblance to the sas map is noticeable for the alpine region first the distinct rainfall band in the alpine foreland extending far to the east second the pronounced inner alpine dry valleys of the inn catchment in the south western upper danube and third the round shaped dry region at the transition between the alps and the dinarides in the drava basin the wfde5 forcing dataset yielded an average precipitation of 788 mm a with rainfall ranging from 278 mm a near the danube delta to 2251 mm a at single mountain peaks in the northern sava basin the likewise smooth wfde5 precipitation patterns in the map are quite similar to the era5 patterns with a few spatial shifts due to the wfd bias correction and with some more indications of alpine precipitation patterns e g the inner alpine dry valleys and the round shaped dry region in the drava basin that are visible in the sas and e obs observation maps 3 2 temperature precipitation evapotranspiration and percent bias of discharge the percent bias pbias of discharge is an important quality criterion in hydrological modelling as it provides information on whether the water volume of the modelled discharge in a basin is well predicted or rather over or underestimated in table 3 and fig 5 we show the modelled long term annual means of temperature c precipitation mm a and evapotranspiration mm a as well as pbias of discharge for the period 1980 2016 in the drb and its sub basins for the simulation runs driven by era5 era5 wc era5 gpw and wfde5 here long term annual mean temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration are given as area averaged values which were calculated for the whole basin area upstream of the basin s associated gauge station see table 2 apparently there was much more variation in precipitation and pbias than in temperature and evapotranspiration between the different forcing datasets and consequently simulation runs the downscaled uncorrected era5 forcing dataset gave highest precipitation in most of the sub basins i e the upper and middle danube gauges achleiten bezdan the mures tisza and siret tributary basins and the danube overall outlet gauge ceatal izmail compared to the other forcing datasets in most of these sub basins also evapotranspiration and in a lesser extent temperature showed highest values for era5 higher annual precipitation in most danube sub basins and the danube overall coincided with more or less high positive pbias esp the mures and tisza basins for era5 in contrast the sava basin showed least precipitation for the era5 forcing dataset which coincided with a relatively high negative pbias introducing bias correction of era5 with the global worldclim 2 climatologies era5 wc forcing dataset led to a significant reduction of precipitation in the upper and middle danube gauges achleiten bezdan the mures tisza and siret tributary basins and the danube overall on the one hand and to an increase of precipitation in the drava and sava basins on the other at the same time pbias turned negative in the upper danube and more positive in the drava basin for the era5 wc forcing dataset the more or less highly positive pbias in the mures tisza and siret basins and the danube overall resulting from era5 were mitigated due to the reduction of precipitation in total pbias was especially low in the danube overall at gauge ceatal izmail similarly the negative pbias in the sava basin resulting from era5 was slightly mitigated in era5 wc the additional integration of the regional precipitation climatologies glowa and prism for the alpine and dinaric region into the bias correction process of era5 era5 gpw forcing dataset led to an increase of precipitation in the upper and middle danube gauges achleiten bezdan and also slightly in the sava basin at the same time precipitation in the drava basin decreased to about the same magnitude as in the uncorrected era5 forcing dataset for the era5 gpw forcing dataset the negative pbias in the upper danube and the positive pbias in the drava basin resulting from the era5 wc forcing dataset was mitigated moreover the negative pbias in the sava basin resulting from era5 and era5 wc was slightly mitigated for era5 gpw for the wfde5 forcing dataset precipitation increased again in the upper and middle danube gauge bezdan the mures tisza and siret tributary basins and the danube overall which coincided with more positive pbias values in those basins compared to the other forcing datasets wfde5 showed intermediate precipitation values for most sub basins and highest temperature values for the upper and middle danube gauges achleiten bezdan and the drava basin interestingly the wfde5 forcing dataset gave smallest pbias for the drava 12 8 and siret basins 24 2 compared to the other forcing datasets however for the majority of the sub basins smallest pbias values were obtained with the era5 wc and era5 gpw forcing datasets era5 gpw yielded smallest pbias for the upper danube at gauge achleiten 1 1 and for the sava basin 14 6 era5 wc yielded smallest pbias for the upper and middle danube at gauge bezdan 1 9 and for the danube overall at gauge ceatal izmail 4 7 for two tributary basins of the lower danube smallest pbias were equally obtained by era5 wc and era5 gpw i e the mures basin 16 2 and the tisza basin 24 3 era5 did not show smallest pbias values in any of the sub basins 3 3 model efficiency based on daily discharge in table 4 and fig 6 we show model efficiencies nse and kge based on observed and modelled daily discharge as modelled by the era5 era5 wc era5 gpw and wfde5 forcing datasets for the period 1980 2016 for the danube and its sub basins in comparison to all other simulation runs the era5 driven simulation showed poorest results for the majority of sub basins esp the tributary basins of the lower danube concerning nse and kge especially low model efficiencies were achieved in the mures and tisza basins nse 0 for era5 in contrast relatively high model efficiencies were achieved for the upper danube gauge achleiten and the drava basin the poor era5 model efficiencies especially in the sava mures tisza and siret basins and the danube overall gauge ceatal izmail could be significantly improved by era5 wc however model efficiencies of the era5 wc driven simulation slightly declined in the upper danube gauge achleiten and vastly dropped in the drava basin to nse 0 in comparison to era5 through the additional introduction of the regional precipitation climatologies glowa and prism for the bias correction in the alps and dinarides the era5 gpw driven simulation showed improved model efficiencies especially for the upper danube the drava and the sava basins in comparison to era5 gpw discharges from the wfde5 driven simulation showed lower efficiencies for the majority of sub basins with especially low results for the mures and tisza basins in contrast the wfde5 driven simulation showed best model efficiencies for the drava nse 0 66 kge 0 83 the sava nse 0 66 kge 0 66 and the siret basin nse 0 54 kge 0 57 in comparison to all other forcing datasets for the upper danube gauge achleiten best nse was obtained with the era5 gpw driven simulation nse 0 75 whereas best kge was obtained with the era5 driven simulation kge 0 83 although kge was very similar for era5 era5 gpw and wfde5 for two tributary basins of the lower danube efficiency measures were equally best for era5 wc and era5 gpw nse 0 47 and kge 0 69 for the mures and nse 0 39 and kge 0 54 for the tisza basin moreover era5 wc yielded best efficiencies for the upper and middle danube at gauge bezdan nse 0 71 kge 0 78 and for the danube overall at gauge ceatal izmail nse 0 70 kge 0 77 also for these two basins kge values were very similar for the era5 wc driven and the era5 gpw driven simulation 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the uncalibrated hydrological model our results showed that satisfactory model results in terms of the goodness of fit criteria pbias nse and kge could be equally achievable without extensive model calibration considering the fact that no calibration with observed discharge has been undertaken at all we obtained satisfactory results by using a reasonably and comprehensively parameterized mechanistic hydrological model which takes physical processes of water flows into account due to its process based nature also for methodological reasons it is appropriate to dispense with calibration so that the hydrological model is not parameterized differently for each meteorological forcing dataset calibration that aims to best fit the discharge observations would prevent an objective comparison of the suitability of the different meteorological drivers for hydrological modelling applications from the outset the nse results obtained in our study are in good accordance compared to other model studies where extensive calibration efforts have been undertaken in table 5 we show nse of daily discharges from the respective best simulation run in this study compared to the daily nse of validation obtained at the exact or nearby gauges from the study of stagl and hattermann 2015 as can be seen our nse were quite similar to the nse given in the comparative study and were even better for the upper danube the upper and middle danube nse at bezdan bratislava gauges the drava and the siret basin concerning the relationship between nse and kge across all sub basins and all simulation runs our results gave a positive linear correlation between nse and kge values this means that higher nse tended to be associated with higher kge and vice versa see fig 7 kge is often used in addition to or instead of nse to account for specific shortcomings of nse with kge it is possible to rate the model s ability to yield simultaneously good solutions for the linear correlation the bias and the variability of flow which is not the case with nse gupta et al 2009 as knoben et al 2019 vividly showed an exemplary strength of kge is the ability to capture a model s potential tendency to overestimate discharge peaks which nse cannot and in contrast an exemplary strength of nse is the ability to capture potential systematic offsets between the modelled and the observed hydrograph which kge cannot a positive correlation of nse and kge therefore indicates that there are no one sided deficiencies in the physically based description of hydrological processes in promet that would manifest as systematic over or underestimations of the modelled hydrograph or a systematic overestimation of modelled flood peaks 4 2 performance of the meteorological forcing datasets and climatologies for bias correction our results showed that sub basin specific variations in long term annual means of precipitation between the different forcing datasets and thus simulation runs were much greater than of temperature or evapotranspiration connected with corresponding impacts on pbias sub basin specific higher pbias values positive or negative coincided primarily with variations in forcing data specific precipitation between the different simulation runs and very little with variations in temperature or evapotranspiration this clearly suggests that a small pbias and thus well predicted water budget within a basin is above all dependent on the correct representation of precipitation in the meteorological data and underlines the importance of choosing appropriate precipitation forcing data as input for hydrological modelling combined with suitable climatologies especially for precipitation bias correction the uncorrected era5 forcing dataset showed highest annual mean precipitation for most sub basins except for drava and sava leading to systematic positive pbias for the era5 driven simulation in these sub basins the poor performance of the era5 driven simulation concerning nse and kge compared to the other simulations may be traced back to the relatively smooth patterns in the downscaled era5 precipitation map especially over mountainous terrain see fig 4 in mountain regions the era5 precipitation map sharply contrasted with the sas and e obs maps of observed precipitation both of which showed detailed small scale rainfall structures in the alps the dinarides and the carpathians especially inner alpine dry valleys and drier regions in the drava basin this suggests that the smooth precipitation patterns in era5 may have led to a distortion of spatial runoff dynamics and to an inadequate emulation of the hydrograph interestingly the downscaled wfde5 forcing dataset showed similar smooth precipitation patterns compared to the downscaled uncorrected era5 reanalysis but the wfde5 driven simulation yielded much better results in terms of pbias nse and kge in almost all sub basins compared to the era5 driven simulation wfde5 even yielded best nse and kge for the mountain watersheds drava and sava and also for the siret basin across all forcing datasets apparently the wfd bias correction methodology used to create wfde5 offers great benefits for hydrological modelling purposes in the drb another aspect which is particularly important in mountainous regions may also be a determining factor for the good performance of wfde5 in the mountain watersheds the presence of undercatch correction especially in mountainous regions a major source of uncertainty is systematic measurement bias due to wind induced undercatch at precipitation gauging stations this is particularly significant in wind exposed areas and during snowfall periods leading to systematic underestimations of precipitation sevruk 2005 in contrast to all other forcing datasets precipitation climatologies and observation datasets presented in this study era5 worldclim 2 prism glowa and e obs the wfde5 forcing dataset is in fact the only one which includes an undercatch correction cornes et al 2018 cucchi et al 2020 fick and hijmans 2017 frei and schär 1998 früh et al 2006 although the mountainous upper danube drava and sava basins featured highest area averaged precipitation means in the era5 era5 wc and era5 gpw forcing datasets and not in the wfde5 dataset absent undercatch correction can nevertheless lead to local underestimations of rainfall at higher altitudes within the sub basins this may result in inadequately predicted dynamics of discharge formation and to a possible distortion of the hydrograph therefore a possible explanation for the best model efficiencies of wfde5 in the drava the sava and the siret basins may well be the presence of both bias correction and undercatch correction in the wfde5 dataset leading to better predicted dynamics of the mountain watershed hydrology concerning era5 the introduction of bias correction vastly reduced pbias and improved nse and kge for the simulations driven by era5 wc and era5 gpw compared to the simulation driven by the uncorrected era5 reanalysis solely incorporating the global worldclim 2 temperature and precipitation climatologies for bias correction era5 wc led to smaller pbias values and improved model efficiency especially in the lower danube and its tributary basins where worldclim 2 significantly reduced precipitation amounts in contrast in the complex terrains of the alps and dinarides esp upper danube and drava basin worldclim 2 indeed added some structure to the precipitation map but did not appear to reproduce the complex actual precipitation patterns in an eligible way as nse and kge considerably dropped compared to the era5 driven simulation this is particularly interesting given that the spatial patterns in the era5 wc precipitation map in the alps and dinarides fig 4 were in close correspondence to the patterns in the e obs precipitation map but not to those in the sas map this similarity may well be due to the fact that worldclim 2 and e obs incorporate overlapping precipitation stations across europe e obs is created from data by the european climate assessment and dataset eca d initiative klein tank et al 2002 klok and klein tank 2009 sourcing station data from many national meteorological services nms and other providers across europe cornes et al 2018 the worldclim 2 station data basis is mainly compiled from global datasets like cru ts3 22 station observations some of which are shared by numerous national weather services through the world meteorological organization wmo harris et al 2014 however a considerable proportion of the station data basis for worldclim 2 also directly originates from the eca d pool in addition to the directly included eca d stations there is also a larger number of stations in europe which are duplicated in eca d and global sources used for worldclim 2 fick and hijmans 2017 as fick and hijmans 2017 and hijmans et al 2005 stated there are greater uncertainties in the worldclim 2 precipitation climatology in mountainous terrain mainly due to the lower station density and the simplifying assumption of an elevation dependence of precipitation in the spatial interpolation routine uncertainties were also reported for the e obs precipitation dataset in mountainous and data scarce regions cornes et al 2018 in contrast frei and schär 1998 argued that precipitation elevation correlations should only be used very carefully when interpolating station data in the alpine region they pointed out that precipitation measured at stations is highly dependent on broader scale synoptic characteristics and topographical factors like slope or exposure summit vs valley location windward vs leeward aspect which lead to particular variations in the alpine region and especially across the alpine ridge frei and schär 1998 the relatively high uncertainties for precipitation in mountainous terrain in worldclim 2 could be the reason for overestimations of precipitation at highest elevations in the danube basin and excess precipitation especially in the drava basin connected with a highly positive pbias excess rainfall at highest elevations in the model may also have caused an inadequate simulation of runoff volume dynamics and timing and may have resulted in a hydrograph yielding poor nse and kge in the drava and upper danube basins we learned that the additional integration of the regional precipitation climatologies glowa and prism in the bias correction routine of precipitation era5 gpw led to better results concerning pbias nse and kge in the upper danube drava and sava basins than the bias correction with the worldclim 2 precipitation climatology alone era5 wc an interesting finding here is that the era5 gpw precipitation map fig 4 showed very similar spatial patterns in the alps and dinarides compared to the sas map in particular the distinct rainfall band in the bavarian alpine foreland the inner alpine dry valleys of the inn catchment in the south western upper danube and the round shaped dry region in the drava basin in contrast the era5 gpw map did not resemble the e obs map in these regions in total the described precipitation patterns resulted in a higher basin precipitation in the upper danube for era5 gpw and in a much smaller pbias compared to era5 wc thus the reduced pbias and the improved model efficiencies for the upper danube drava and sava basins may indicate that the era5 gpw precipitation map which was similar to the sas map showed more realistic spatial precipitation patterns in the alpine region than the era5 wc map which was similar to the e obs map we assume that the underlying higher station density for the generation of the regional precipitation climatologies glowa and prism leads to a much more realistic reproduction of the actual spatial precipitation patterns in the alps and dinarides than worldclim 2 is able to provide this is a strong indication that observation datasets should not be considered trustworthy based on their mere observational nature taking observational uncertainties into account the selection of an appropriate reference climatology dataset for bias correction should be handled just as critically as for example the selection of an appropriate bias correction method 5 summary and conclusions in this paper we analysed the performance of the global meteorological reanalysis era5 and the global bias adjusted forcing dataset wfde5 for driving the physically based hydro agroecological model promet in the large heterogeneous danube river basin furthermore we investigated the suitability of the global to regional reference climatologies worldclim 2 glowa and prism for linear bias correction of era5 temperature and precipitation incorporated in the downscaling routine we performed four uncalibrated hydrological simulation runs of 30 spatial and hourly temporal resolution for the period 1980 2016 driven by the following configurations of meteorological forcing data the uncorrected era5 reanalysis denoted as era5 the wfde5 forcing dataset bias corrected according to the wfd methodology denoted as wfde5 the era5 reanalysis bias corrected with the worldclim 2 temperature and precipitation climatologies denoted as era5 wc the era5 reanalysis bias corrected with the worldclim 2 temperature climatology and a mosaic of the glowa and prism alpine precipitation climatologies and the worldclim 2 precipitation climatology denoted as era5 gpw our simulations showed significant differences in performance between the different meteorological forcing datasets era5 wfde5 era5 wc and era5 gpw we evaluated the performance of the simulation runs using the pbias of discharge and the model efficiency metrics nse and kge calculated from modelled and observed daily discharge at selected gauges in the danube basin and its sub basins the era5 gpw driven simulation yielded the smallest pbias values and the best model efficiencies across the majority of sub basins compared to the other simulation runs given the poor performance of the era5 driven simulation in terms of pbias nse and kge across nearly all sub basins bias correction is essential for hydrological modelling in the drb compared to era5 the wfde5 driven simulation yielded much better results in terms of pbias nse and kge with even best nse and kge in the mountainous drava and sava basins this could be due to the wfd bias correction and the undercatch correction applied in wfde5 which is apparently very suitable for hydrological modelling purposes concerning era5 we learned that bias correction with the global and widely used worldclim 2 temperature and precipitation climatology alone era5 wc forcing dataset significantly improved the lower danube and its tributary basins in terms of pbias nse and kge however worldclim 2 was insufficient to capture the complex spatial precipitation patterns in mountainous terrain in the alps and dinarides which are located in the upper danube drava and sava basins here the greater uncertainties in the interpolation of precipitation in mountainous terrain are likely to be a major limitation instead additionally incorporating the regional high resolution glowa and prism alpine precipitation climatologies derived from a much higher underlying station density in the european alps in the bias correction routine of era5 era5 gpw forcing dataset noticeably added distinct small scale spatial precipitation patterns in the alps and dinarides this approach reduced pbias values and improved model efficiencies for the mountain watersheds upper danube drava and sava in comparison to the bias correction with worldclim 2 alone we draw three major conclusions from the findings of our simulation study first we have shown that with a reasonable and comprehensive parametrization of a process based hydrological model such as promet satisfying results for pbias nse and kge can be obtained without extensive calibration of model parameters to best fit measured discharges the ability of promet to simulate water flows runoff formation and flood propagation in the channel through a physical process description without trial and error calibration was the prerequisite to perform an objective comparison of different meteorological forcing datasets in the next step second we have demonstrated the applicability of the global meteorological reanalysis era5 with appropriate bias correction as a prerequisite and the global bias adjusted forcing dataset wfde5 for hydrological modelling we obtained satisfying results for pbias nse and kge at a comparatively fine spatial resolution of 30 even in a hydrologically complex large and diverse basin such as the danube nevertheless we have shown that appropriate bias correction especially of precipitation is an essential part of the downscaling routine of the era5 reanalysis for driving hydrological models in the drb third we emphasize the need for regional high resolution precipitation climatologies for the precipitation bias correction process of reanalyses for hydrological modelling applications in topographically complex mountain terrains such as the alps and dinarides high resolution precipitation climatologies such as glowa and prism created from high station density can more adequately account for small scale precipitation patterns in contrast global climatologies created from lower station density quickly reach their limits based on our findings we therefore argue that the choice of an appropriate reference climatology dataset for bias correction of precipitation in alpine terrain is of utmost importance and needs to be carefully considered further research must be undertaken to determine whether and to what extent the need for regional high resolution precipitation climatologies for bias correction applies for other mountainous regions around the globe it seems plausible that this issue is not unique to the european alps in this light our results also emphasize the importance of further research to develop appropriate reanalysis schemes for mountainous regions of much higher spatial resolution with the ultimate goal of eventually eliminating the need for downscaling and bias correction of meteorological forcing data for hydrological modelling credit authorship contribution statement elisabeth probst conceptualization

8046,study region the danube river basin study focus hydrological modelling of large heterogeneous watersheds requires appropriate meteorological forcing data the global meteorological reanalysis era5 and the global forcing dataset wfde5 were evaluated for driving an uncalibrated setup of the mechanistic hydrological model promet 0 00833333 1 h resolution for the period 1980 2016 different climatologies were used for linear bias correction of era5 the global worldclim 2 temperature and precipitation climatologies and the regional glowa and prism alpine precipitation climatologies simulations driven with the uncorrected era5 reanalysis the wfde5 forcing dataset era5 bias corrected with worldclim 2 and era5 bias corrected with a glowa prism worldclim 2 mosaic were evaluated regarding percent bias of discharge and model efficiency new hydrological insights for the region simulations yielded good model efficiencies and low percent biases of discharge at selected gauges uncalibrated model efficiencies corresponded with previous hydrological modelling studies era5 and wfde5 were well suited to drive promet in the hydrologically complex danube basin but bias correction of precipitation was essential for era5 the era5 driven simulation bias corrected with a glowa prism worldclim 2 mosaic performed best bias correction with glowa and prism outperformed worldclim 2 in the alps due to more realistic small scale alpine precipitation patterns resulting from higher station densities in mountainous terrain we emphasize the need for regional high resolution precipitation climatologies and recommend them for bias correction of precipitation rather than global datasets keywords reanalysis precipitation climatology observational uncertainty alpine precipitation worldclim 2 promet 1 introduction hydrological modelling is critically dependent on accurate meteorological forcing data observations from ground based weather station networks are a very appropriate source of meteorological forcing data but are often only available at the scale of smaller watersheds however hydrological modelling of large scale watersheds covering hundreds of thousands of km² or more has gained increasing scientific interest at this scale international river basin organizations irbos have been established for most transboundary watersheds around the world such as the international commission for the protection of the danube river icpdr for the danube river basin drb for instance the irbos require scenario analyses of trade offs between different management interventions regarding agriculture or water management in the context of climate change biodiversity or aquatic ecology for which hydrological modelling provides an indispensable contribution abbaspour et al 2015 döll et al 2009 malagó et al 2017 however when it comes to hydrological modelling of large scale watersheds continuous observation time series from weather station networks typically become sparse therefore modelling studies have increasingly relied on high resolution gridded meteorological forcing datasets such as global reanalyses or regional climate models rcms e g beck et al 2017 chen et al 2018 essou et al 2017 essou et al 2016 kay et al 2015 tarek et al 2020 for example the newly available global reanalysis era5 hersbach et al 2020 and the global forcing dataset wfde5 cucchi et al 2020 deliver a global coverage with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and 0 5 and hourly temporal resolution for most of the global land surface these meteorological forcing datasets now approximate or surpass the spatial data density of available weather station networks significantly facilitating hydrological modelling in data scarce regions tarek et al 2020 even in well equipped regions such as central europe high resolution meteorological forcing datasets approach the spatial density and temporal resolution of weather station networks in switzerland for example the weather station density corresponds to one station per 475 km² for temperature and one per 100 km² for precipitation gubler et al 2017 moreover a decline in operating ground based weather stations has been observed in recent years in most countries around the world essou et al 2016 the availability of global to regional high resolution gridded meteorological drivers offers great potential to compensate for this declining trend in observation data availability tarek et al 2020 but still raises questions regarding their suitability for driving hydrological models especially in large and complex watersheds being the successor to era interim dee et al 2011 era5 benefits from a decade of developments in model physics core dynamics and data assimilation hersbach et al 2020 and should therefore outperform classical and even sophisticated interpolation of weather station network observations in terms of adequately describing atmospheric dynamics nevertheless global reanalyses often show systematic regionally distributed biases compared to ground based weather station observations especially of precipitation which has led to the development of bias correction methodologies muñoz sabater et al 2021 weedon et al 2011 from a meteorological perspective bias correction of reanalyses is widely considered an essential task to better reproduce spatial patterns of meteorological observations but is nonetheless controversial for hydrological modelling purposes essou et al 2016 the bias correction procedure is usually embedded in the downscaling routine of the gridded meteorological data where complex sub scale spatial characteristics of the meteorological parameters especially in mountainous terrain are incorporated shrestha et al 2017 interestingly existing studies on the evaluation of bias correction routines have focused almost exclusively on different methods for bias correction e g linear vs quantile mapping chen et al 2013 lafon et al 2013 and have very rarely questioned the choice of appropriate reference observational data first attempts of questioning the application specific choice of reference datasets in the light of observational uncertainties have been undertaken by prein and gobiet 2017 kotlarski et al 2019 and gampe et al 2019 finding that observational uncertainties can be considerable depending on the reference dataset gampe et al 2019 emphasized that considering multiple reference datasets for bias correction is highly important for obtaining robust results in climate change impact studies from a hydrological perspective model calibration is widely perceived as another essential task to account for conceptualizations and aggregations of hydrological processes in the model description that are not fully physically described yilmaz et al 2010 for this purpose suitable model parameters are often determined by trial and error calibration of the hydrological model across the hydrological modelling community great efforts are being undertaken to calibrate empirical and physically based hydrological models down to the scale of smallest sub basins to maximize model efficiency for the drb e g pagliero et al 2014 and stagl and hattermann 2015 such calibration efforts result in the best possible model fit over the chosen spatial and temporal model framework but limit transferability over space and time especially when considering for example climate change impact effects or as in our case comparing the suitability of different meteorological forcing datasets for hydrological modelling in this paper we analysed the performance of the global meteorological reanalysis era5 and the global bias adjusted forcing dataset wfde5 for driving a physically based hydrological model in a large heterogeneous watershed and the possible improvements that could be achieved by linear temperature and precipitation bias correction of era5 with different global and regional reference climatologies for this purpose we applied different configurations for bias correction of era5 during the downscaling process in a first step no bias correction was applied at all in a second step different combinations of the global worldclim 2 temperature and precipitation climatologies fick and hijmans 2017 the glowa alpine precipitation climatology früh et al 2006 and the prism alpine precipitation climatology frei and schär 1998 were used as reference datasets for linear bias correction of temperature and precipitation to ensure the best possible comparability between these different meteorological forcing datasets the hydrological model was not calibrated with measured discharge and an identical model setup and parametrization was used for all simulation runs ceteris paribus conditions we chose the large scale drb for a regional case study which features very heterogeneous natural regions and hydrological characteristics comprising mountain ranges alps dinarides carpathians and extended lowlands pannonian basin romanian plain due to its complexity the drb is a very appropriate pilot basin for a detailed analysis of the performance of global scale meteorological forcing datasets for hydrological modelling and of the suitability of different reference datasets for bias correction under widely varying landscape conditions for our simulation studies we used the mechanistic hydro agroecological model promet mauser and bach 2009 at a spatial resolution of 30 0 00833333 we performed four different long term hydrological simulation runs see sect 2 4 driven with the downscaled and optionally bias corrected global meteorological reanalysis era5 and the downscaled global meteorological forcing dataset wfde5 in the drb for the period 1980 2016 first we show a comparison of spatial patterns of long term mean annual precipitation between the different downscaled meteorological forcing datasets and compare them with existing observation derived precipitation maps of the danube second we compare area averages of sub basin specific long term annual means of temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration between the forcing datasets third we evaluate the performance of the optionally bias corrected global meteorological forcing datasets in terms of percent bias of discharge and model efficiency metrics for all simulation runs model efficiency metrics and percent bias of discharge were calculated from the comparison between modelled and observed daily discharge at selected sub basin gauges based on our results we discuss the performance of the uncalibrated hydrological model in general evaluate the suitability of the global meteorological datasets for driving a hydrological model in a larger watershed and discuss the importance of bias correction in this context we particularly highlight how the choice of different global to regional reference climatologies for bias correction of precipitation affected percent bias of discharge and model efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 the danube river basin shared by 20 countries the drb is the most international river basin in the world and the second largest river basin 817 000 km² in europe jungwirth et al 2014 the danube river drains wide parts of central and south eastern europe and as a waterway connects very heterogeneous natural cultural and economic regions jungwirth et al 2014 the danube originates in the black forest in south western germany and passes 10 countries to its mouth in the black sea on its way the danube gradually changes its character from a mountain to a lowland river crossing mountainous terrain along the eastern alpine foothills as well as large basins like the vienna basin the pannonian basin and the romanian plain see fig 1 hence its watershed comprises very heterogeneous hydrological characteristics including mountain watersheds such as the upper danube the drava and the sava basin and lowland watersheds such as the tributary basins of the middle and lower danube linked to this the drb is commonly divided by mountain ranges into three main sections the upper danube extends from its source to the devín gate in the little carpathians at the border of austria and slovakia jungwirth et al 2014 the middle danube extends to the iron gate in the carpathians at the border of hungary and romania and from here the lower danube extends down to the mouth including the danube delta jungwirth et al 2014 in accordance with the heterogeneous topography annual precipitation is very unevenly distributed throughout the danube basin in contrast to the water towers alps and dinarides with annual rainfall of up to 3200 mm a in the alpine high mountain range the lower danube features rather dry lowland regions like the pannonian basin and the romanian plain where annual rainfall amounts to 350 mm a schiller et al 2010 after 2857 river km from source to mouth the average discharge mq of the danube river at the outlet gauge in ceatal izmail amounts to 6550 m³ s schiller et al 2010 2 2 the hydro agroecological model promet the physically based hydro agroecological model promet processes of radiation mass and energy transfer mauser and bach 2009 mauser et al 2015 models water energy and carbon fluxes in an interlinked manner strictly closing energy and mass balance on the land surface promet simulates all processes in hourly time steps on a spatially distributed raster based architecture of custom spatial resolution in this study we chose to run promet on a 30 grid 0 00833333 spatial resolution 1 km² at the equator and with hourly temporal resolution the model framework of promet comprises different components such as meteorology soil groundwater vegetation channel flow and agricultural management with e g fertilization and irrigation options modules which are described in detail in mauser and bach 2009 hank et al 2015 mauser et al 2015 and zabel et al 2014 the vegetation module simulates net primary production land surface energy balance and evapotranspiration in an iterative manner using the mechanistic plant physiology approach of farquhar et al 1980 and chen et al 1994 dynamically computing transpiration and co2 assimilation by c3 and c4 plant photosynthesis processes thereby a phenological component is triggered that uses trait information to simulate the weather dependent annual development of 28 different plant types representing various agricultural crops pasture forest and natural vegetation see sect 2 5 the channel flow component calculates the channel routing of surface flow interflow and baseflow through the river network to an outlet gauge following the approach of muskingum cunge todini cunge 1969 todini 2007 due to its physical and physiological basis and spatial heterogeneity a classical calibration of the promet model parameters to fit measured discharge is neither feasible nor desirable therefore heterogeneous input parameters are used for watershed characterization terrain soil land use river width channel slope and manning coefficients as well as for the system of linear storages which receive percolation and are used to determine baseflow the dynamical vegetation module is likewise supplied with consistent parameter sets for each plant type in the basin see sect 2 5 in this study promet was run with a comprehensive and plausibility tested parametrization for hydrology and vegetation 2 3 meteorological downscaling and bias correction the promet hydrological simulations are driven with gridded hourly time series of meteorological input parameters required parameters are air temperature 2 m height total precipitation air humidity 2 m height surface air pressure wind speed 2 m height surface downwelling direct and diffuse shortwave solar radiation as well as surface downwelling longwave radiation the promet meteorology module contains a routine that downscales and disaggregates coarse gridded meteorological forcing data to the custom spatial and temporal model resolution in promet a spatial downscaling approach is applied to the meteorological forcing data according to marke et al 2014 to bridge the gap between the coarse spatial resolution of the meteorological forcing datasets and the custom internal promet model resolution 30 in this study according to the approach of marke et al 2014 local elevation gradients are determined for elevation dependent parameters and combined with the interpolation of de trended residuals as part of the spatial downscaling routine a spatially distributed linear bias correction of hourly temperature and precipitation can optionally be applied for this promet applies spatially distributed daily patterns of bias correction coefficients to the downscaled meteorological forcing data to account for local biases in the meteorological parameters spatially distributed daily bias correction coefficients are derived from observed monthly climatologies of temperature and precipitation for the linear bias correction additive bias correction factors are used for temperature and multiplicative bias correction factors are used for precipitation bias correction of temperature is calculated following eq 1 1 t corr t t raw t f tbias d where t raw t is the downscaled hourly temperature from the meteorological forcing data on a certain pixel f tbias d the pixel specific daily additive temperature correction factor and t corr t the resulting bias corrected hourly temperature value on the pixel bias correction of precipitation is calculated following eq 2 2 p corr t p raw t f pbias d where p raw t is the downscaled hourly precipitation from the meteorological forcing data on a certain pixel f pbias d the pixel specific daily multiplicative precipitation correction factor and p corr t the resulting bias corrected hourly precipitation value on the pixel spatially distributed additive temperature correction factors are calculated following eq 3 3 f tbias mon t climmean mon t rawmean mon where f tbias mon is the pixel specific monthly additive temperature correction factor t climmean mon the long term monthly mean temperature of the reference climatology on the pixel and t rawmean mon the long term monthly mean temperature of the downscaled meteorological forcing data on the pixel spatially distributed multiplicative precipitation correction factors are calculated following eq 4 4 f pbias mon p climmean mon p rawmean mon where f pbias mon is the pixel specific monthly multiplicative precipitation correction factor p climmean mon the long term monthly mean precipitation sum of the reference climatology on the pixel and p rawmean mon the long term monthly mean precipitation sum of the downscaled meteorological forcing data on the pixel in a last step daily correction factors for temperature and precipitation are determined by a simple cubic interpolation of the monthly correction factors for each pixel 2 4 meteorological forcing data and climatologies for bias correction for the hydrological modelling study in this paper we used the era5 climate reanalysis produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and the derived bias corrected wfde5 forcing dataset as meteorological drivers era5 is a global atmospheric land and oceanic reanalysis calculated by the integrated forecasting system cy41r2 hersbach et al 2020 it is available from 1 january 1979 until present with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and hourly temporal resolution wfde5 is a global forcing dataset directly based on era5 which is available from 1 january 1979 until 31 december 2018 on a spatial resolution of 0 5 and hourly temporal resolution wfde5 was derived from era5 surface meteorological variables which were aggregated to 0 5 spatial resolution and some of them bias corrected according to the watch forcing data wfd methodology cucchi et al 2020 weedon et al 2011 for precipitation bias correction is either based on the observed monthly climate research unit times series version 4 03 cru ts4 03 harris et al 2014 precipitation totals for 1979 2018 or on the observed monthly global precipitation climatology centre version 2018 gpccv2018 schneider et al 2017 precipitation totals for 1979 2016 cucchi et al 2020 hence wfde5 precipitation is provided in a cru based and in a gpcc based version cucchi et al 2020 in this study we used wfde5 version 1 1 with gpcc based precipitation for the era5 and wfde5 meteorological forcing datasets it was necessary to apply a spatial downscaling procedure to comply with the promet model resolution of 30 in this study see sect 2 3 however since both era5 and wfde5 are available on hourly temporal resolution no temporal disaggregation was necessary to comply with the hourly model time steps in promet to systematically determine the comparative skills of era5 and wfde5 for driving promet we used the downscaled era5 reanalysis as meteorological forcing for the hydrological simulations in different modifications first without any bias correction subsequently we bias corrected temperature and precipitation based on different global to regional reference climatologies for this we used the following temperature and precipitation reference climatologies the global worldclim 2 climatologies fick and hijmans 2017 of long term mean monthly temperature and precipitation for the period 1970 2000 with a spatial resolution of 30 0 00833333 the worldclim 2 climatologies are based on 34 542 global weather stations from multiple sources fick and hijmans 2017 the regional prism climatology of long term mean monthly precipitation covering the european alps frei and schär 1998 schwarb et al 2001 for the period 1971 1990 with a spatial resolution of 2 5 0 04166666 the prism climatology is based on more than 6600 rain gauge stations frei and schär 1998 and was thus created from a higher station density in the european alps than worldclim 2 the regional glowa climatology of long term mean monthly precipitation covering the upper danube basin früh et al 2006 for the period 1991 2000 with a spatial resolution of 30 0 00833333 the glowa climatology is directly based on the prism climatology which was transformed to the more recent reference period using 2198 weather stations früh et al 2006 for temperature we created a single dataset of spatially distributed bias correction factors with a spatial resolution of 30 according to eq 3 here we used long term monthly mean temperatures of the worldclim 2 reference climatology 1970 2000 and long term monthly means of downscaled era5 temperature 1979 2000 for precipitation we created two different datasets of spatially distributed bias correction factors with a spatial resolution of 30 based on different combinations of precipitation correction factors derived from worldclim 2 glowa and prism according to eq 4 we used long term monthly mean precipitation sums of the respective climatology worldclim 2 glowa or prism and long term monthly means of downscaled era5 precipitation sums for respective overlapping reference periods for the worldclim 2 derived precipitation bias correction factors we took the era5 period 1979 2000 for the glowa derived correction factors we took the era5 period 1991 2000 and for the prism derived correction factors we took the era5 period 1979 1990 the two bias correction factor datasets for precipitation generated in this way consisted of i the worldclim 2 derived precipitation correction factors for the whole danube basin the meteorological forcing dataset consisting of era5 variables of which precipitation was bias corrected with this precipitation correction dataset and of which temperature was bias corrected with the worldclim 2 derived temperature correction factors is further referred to as era5 wc in this paper ii a mosaic of the glowa derived precipitation correction factors for the upper danube basin the prism derived precipitation correction factors for the alps and northern dinarides outside the upper danube basin and the worldclim 2 derived precipitation correction factors in the remaining danube basin see fig 2 the meteorological forcing dataset consisting of era5 variables of which precipitation was bias corrected with this precipitation correction dataset and of which temperature was bias corrected with the worldclim 2 derived temperature correction factors is further referred to as era5 gpw in this paper in contrast to era5 we applied no additional bias correction to the downscaled wfde5 product as it has already been bias corrected according to the wfd methodology described in cucchi et al 2020 and weedon et al 2011 in this study we therefore performed four different hydrological simulation runs in the drb each driven by one of the following meteorological forcing datasets i era5 ii era5 wc iii era5 gpw and iv wfde5 in table 1 we give an overview of the four different meteorological forcing datasets and global to regional datasets optionally used for bias correction of temperature and precipitation 2 5 model setup and gridded input data promet used a digital terrain model derived from the global srtm shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model farr et al 2007 in which radiometric slope and aspect was calculated from the srtm elevation information promet requires radiometric slope and aspect together with cloud cover from the meteorological forcing data to retrieve hourly direct and diffuse shortwave solar radiation components from the surface downwelling shortwave solar radiation soil properties data were derived from the harmonized world soil database hwsd fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 soil specific sets of physical and hydraulic parameters were created for a four layer soil column of 2 m depth following the approach of brooks and corey 1964 in mountainous terrain of 10 slope we reduced total soil depth to 0 9 m watershed delineation spatial flow direction and accumulation were derived from the global hydrosheds database lehner et al 2008 the land use map of the drb used in this study is based on a mosaic of the corine land cover 2012 european environmental agency eea 2012 and the global esa cci land cover 2015 european space agency esa 2015 the corine land cover includes all eu member states within the drb i e germany austria italy poland czech republic slovakia hungary slovenia croatia romania and bulgaria as well as switzerland and the non eu balkan states i e bosnia and herzegovina serbia montenegro kosovo north macedonia and albania the esa cci land cover includes the territories of ukraine and moldova within the drb that are missing in the corine land cover the two land cover products provide detailed spatial information on a wide range of land cover categories but lack information on the distribution of most agricultural crops except for rice fields vineyards olive groves fruits and berries which are explicitly spatially distributed in the corine land cover for hydrological modelling though the proportional distribution of crops within sub basins is vital because the modelled biophysical processes and water fluxes such as evapo transpiration are very crop specific to account for this the promet dynamical vegetation module comprises several land use classes they consist of 21 classes of agricultural crops maize winter summer wheat winter summer barley rye oat rapeseed sunflower soybean silage forage hop legumes potato sugar beet rice cotton vegetables fruits set aside 2 pasture classes extensive intensive grassland and 5 classes of natural vegetation coniferous deciduous forest natural grassland wetland alpine vegetation they are completed by 5 non vegetative classes rock water glacier residential industrial built up to create a land use map including the spatial distribution of agricultural crops we consulted eu wide and national statistics eurostat 2013 on the cultivation area ha of the different crops per nuts ii region for 2013 as reference year based on the cultivation statistics we performed a spatially randomized distribution of agricultural crops over the agricultural land in the corine and the esa cci land cover within each nuts ii region in doing so we did not attempt to achieve a completely spatially accurate distribution of agricultural crops which is not even necessary due to crop rotation but we developed a statistically correct representation of the proportional shares of crops on the agricultural land in each nuts ii region comprehensive parameters for vegetation parametrization sowing date growing season fertilization level were derived from sacks et al 2010 and from agricultural crop yield statistics on country level eurostat 2021 2 6 sub basin division and evaluation metrics considering long term availability of discharge measurements we divided the danube basin into 8 sub basins see fig 3 for which we analysed spatial precipitation patterns area averaged values for temperature precipitation evapotranspiration as well as percent bias of discharge and model efficiency based on modelled and observed daily discharge at the respective sub basin outlet gauges discharge measurements were obtained from the global runoff data centre grdc 2019 and the international commission for the protection of the danube river icpdr 2021 within the overlapping era5 and wfde5 data availability period 1979 2018 daily discharge observations were available mainly for the period 1979 2016 see table 2 thus we performed the four different hydrological simulation runs driven by era5 era5 wc era5 gpw and wfde5 for the period 1980 2016 considering a decent model spin up of 5 preceding years 1975 1979 from the results of the four different hydrological simulation runs we calculated the percent bias pbias of the long term daily discharge at the outlet gauges of the danube basin and each of its sub basins according to yapo et al 1996 eq 5 5 pbias t 1 t q mod t q obs t t 1 t q obs t 100 where q mod t stands for modelled discharge at time step t and q obs t for observed discharge at time step t with pbias we investigated whether the model correctly predicted the volume of modelled runoff or whether there was a potential tendency to over or underestimate modelled discharge in the specific sub basins we determined model efficiency based on nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge of the daily discharge at the outlet gauges of the danube basin and each of its sub basins we calculated nse according to nash and sutcliffe 1970 eq 6 6 nse 1 t 1 t q mod t q obs t 2 t 1 t q obs t q obs 2 where q mod t is the modelled discharge at time step t q obs t is the observed discharge at time step t and q obs is the mean of observed discharges we calculated kge according to gupta et al 2009 and kling et al 2012 eq 7 7 kge 1 r 1 2 μ mod μ obs 1 2 σ mod μ mod σ obs μ obs 1 2 where r is the correlation coefficient between modelled and observed discharge μ mod is the mean modelled discharge μ obs is the mean observed discharge σ mod is the standard deviation of modelled discharge and σ obs is the standard deviation of observed discharge the kge metric is widely perceived as a significant improvement to nse and can be understood as a decomposition of nse into its components which measure the linear correlation the bias and the variability of flow gupta et al 2009 nevertheless both metrics have very specific strengths and weaknesses and cannot be directly compared to each other knoben et al 2019 nse 1 and kge 1 indicate perfect agreement between model and observations nse 0 and kge 0 41 indicate that the model has the same explanatory power as the mean of the observations and nse 0 and kge 0 41 indicate that the model is a worse predictor than the mean of the observations knoben et al 2019 3 results 3 1 spatial precipitation patterns a realistic representation of spatial precipitation patterns in the meteorological forcing data is crucial for successful hydrological modelling as rainfall distribution strongly influences the dynamics of runoff formation within a watershed and the timing and potential coincidence of flood waves at the confluences of rivers it is important to note that spatial precipitation patterns from interpolated observations are strongly dependent on the underlying interpolation methods interestingly we found that precipitation patterns differ greatly in various precipitation maps of the danube available in the literature fig 4 depicts a comparison of different maps showing observed precipitation from various sources as well as downscaled precipitation from our meteorological forcing datasets we show long term annual mean precipitation from interpolated observations for the period 1961 1990 created by the institute of hydrology at the slovak academy of sciences kovács 2010 petrovič et al 2010 in the following denoted as sas map a moreover we show long term annual mean precipitation from the e obs gridded precipitation observation product version 22 0e ensemble mean 0 1 spatial resolution for the period 1980 2016 cornes et al 2018 b furthermore we show long term annual mean downscaled precipitation for the period 1980 2016 from our forcing datasets era5 c era5 wc d era5 gpw e and wfde5 f apparently there are large differences in precipitation patterns visible between the two observation maps especially in mountain regions like the alps the dinarides and the carpathians particularly striking is that the sas precipitation map a shows a distinct rainfall band in the bavarian alpine foreland extending far to the east which is far less pronounced in the e obs precipitation map b the sas map moreover shows a round shaped dry region in the south eastern slovenian alps which is not present in the e obs map in the sas map precipitation ranges from 200 mm a near the danube delta to 2300 mm a in the alpine foreland close to the northern limestone alps and around the dinaric mountain peaks in the e obs map average precipitation amounts to 684 mm a with rainfall ranging from 273 mm a near the danube delta to 2218 mm a at the dinaric mountain peaks in the sava basin the era5 c and wfde5 f precipitation maps show rather smooth precipitation patterns due to the downscaling procedure without bias correction in contrast the era5 wc d and era5 gpw e precipitation maps feature visible topography structures due to the bias correction step included in the downscaling procedure here corresponding reference climatologies used for bias correction augmented the precipitation maps with small scale structures at a spatial resolution of 30 era5 was the wettest forcing dataset with 824 mm a precipitation on average over the whole basin minimum and maximum rainfall ranged from 449 mm a in the moldovan plain to 1943 mm a in the eastern alps in the alps and the alpine foreland rainfall patterns in the era5 map are rather evenly distributed and show little of the more complex structures that are visible in the sas and e obs maps of observed precipitation especially the inner alpine dry valleys of the inn catchment in the south western part of the upper danube in the southern sava basin and in the carpathian region patchy rainfall patterns are visible era5 wc was the driest forcing dataset with 754 mm a precipitation on average with rainfall ranging from 337 mm a near the danube delta to 2516 mm a around the alpine and dinaric mountain peaks in the drava and sava basins the era5 wc precipitation patterns in the alpine region especially the inner alpine dry valleys in the dinaric region and in the lower danube around the southern carpathian region are strikingly similar to the structures in the e obs rainfall map in the era5 gpw forcing dataset average precipitation amounted to 764 mm a with rainfall ranging from 337 mm a in the danube delta like era5 wc to very high local maxima of 3225 mm a at single mountain peaks in the northern sava basin in the era5 gpw precipitation map a strong resemblance to the sas map is noticeable for the alpine region first the distinct rainfall band in the alpine foreland extending far to the east second the pronounced inner alpine dry valleys of the inn catchment in the south western upper danube and third the round shaped dry region at the transition between the alps and the dinarides in the drava basin the wfde5 forcing dataset yielded an average precipitation of 788 mm a with rainfall ranging from 278 mm a near the danube delta to 2251 mm a at single mountain peaks in the northern sava basin the likewise smooth wfde5 precipitation patterns in the map are quite similar to the era5 patterns with a few spatial shifts due to the wfd bias correction and with some more indications of alpine precipitation patterns e g the inner alpine dry valleys and the round shaped dry region in the drava basin that are visible in the sas and e obs observation maps 3 2 temperature precipitation evapotranspiration and percent bias of discharge the percent bias pbias of discharge is an important quality criterion in hydrological modelling as it provides information on whether the water volume of the modelled discharge in a basin is well predicted or rather over or underestimated in table 3 and fig 5 we show the modelled long term annual means of temperature c precipitation mm a and evapotranspiration mm a as well as pbias of discharge for the period 1980 2016 in the drb and its sub basins for the simulation runs driven by era5 era5 wc era5 gpw and wfde5 here long term annual mean temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration are given as area averaged values which were calculated for the whole basin area upstream of the basin s associated gauge station see table 2 apparently there was much more variation in precipitation and pbias than in temperature and evapotranspiration between the different forcing datasets and consequently simulation runs the downscaled uncorrected era5 forcing dataset gave highest precipitation in most of the sub basins i e the upper and middle danube gauges achleiten bezdan the mures tisza and siret tributary basins and the danube overall outlet gauge ceatal izmail compared to the other forcing datasets in most of these sub basins also evapotranspiration and in a lesser extent temperature showed highest values for era5 higher annual precipitation in most danube sub basins and the danube overall coincided with more or less high positive pbias esp the mures and tisza basins for era5 in contrast the sava basin showed least precipitation for the era5 forcing dataset which coincided with a relatively high negative pbias introducing bias correction of era5 with the global worldclim 2 climatologies era5 wc forcing dataset led to a significant reduction of precipitation in the upper and middle danube gauges achleiten bezdan the mures tisza and siret tributary basins and the danube overall on the one hand and to an increase of precipitation in the drava and sava basins on the other at the same time pbias turned negative in the upper danube and more positive in the drava basin for the era5 wc forcing dataset the more or less highly positive pbias in the mures tisza and siret basins and the danube overall resulting from era5 were mitigated due to the reduction of precipitation in total pbias was especially low in the danube overall at gauge ceatal izmail similarly the negative pbias in the sava basin resulting from era5 was slightly mitigated in era5 wc the additional integration of the regional precipitation climatologies glowa and prism for the alpine and dinaric region into the bias correction process of era5 era5 gpw forcing dataset led to an increase of precipitation in the upper and middle danube gauges achleiten bezdan and also slightly in the sava basin at the same time precipitation in the drava basin decreased to about the same magnitude as in the uncorrected era5 forcing dataset for the era5 gpw forcing dataset the negative pbias in the upper danube and the positive pbias in the drava basin resulting from the era5 wc forcing dataset was mitigated moreover the negative pbias in the sava basin resulting from era5 and era5 wc was slightly mitigated for era5 gpw for the wfde5 forcing dataset precipitation increased again in the upper and middle danube gauge bezdan the mures tisza and siret tributary basins and the danube overall which coincided with more positive pbias values in those basins compared to the other forcing datasets wfde5 showed intermediate precipitation values for most sub basins and highest temperature values for the upper and middle danube gauges achleiten bezdan and the drava basin interestingly the wfde5 forcing dataset gave smallest pbias for the drava 12 8 and siret basins 24 2 compared to the other forcing datasets however for the majority of the sub basins smallest pbias values were obtained with the era5 wc and era5 gpw forcing datasets era5 gpw yielded smallest pbias for the upper danube at gauge achleiten 1 1 and for the sava basin 14 6 era5 wc yielded smallest pbias for the upper and middle danube at gauge bezdan 1 9 and for the danube overall at gauge ceatal izmail 4 7 for two tributary basins of the lower danube smallest pbias were equally obtained by era5 wc and era5 gpw i e the mures basin 16 2 and the tisza basin 24 3 era5 did not show smallest pbias values in any of the sub basins 3 3 model efficiency based on daily discharge in table 4 and fig 6 we show model efficiencies nse and kge based on observed and modelled daily discharge as modelled by the era5 era5 wc era5 gpw and wfde5 forcing datasets for the period 1980 2016 for the danube and its sub basins in comparison to all other simulation runs the era5 driven simulation showed poorest results for the majority of sub basins esp the tributary basins of the lower danube concerning nse and kge especially low model efficiencies were achieved in the mures and tisza basins nse 0 for era5 in contrast relatively high model efficiencies were achieved for the upper danube gauge achleiten and the drava basin the poor era5 model efficiencies especially in the sava mures tisza and siret basins and the danube overall gauge ceatal izmail could be significantly improved by era5 wc however model efficiencies of the era5 wc driven simulation slightly declined in the upper danube gauge achleiten and vastly dropped in the drava basin to nse 0 in comparison to era5 through the additional introduction of the regional precipitation climatologies glowa and prism for the bias correction in the alps and dinarides the era5 gpw driven simulation showed improved model efficiencies especially for the upper danube the drava and the sava basins in comparison to era5 gpw discharges from the wfde5 driven simulation showed lower efficiencies for the majority of sub basins with especially low results for the mures and tisza basins in contrast the wfde5 driven simulation showed best model efficiencies for the drava nse 0 66 kge 0 83 the sava nse 0 66 kge 0 66 and the siret basin nse 0 54 kge 0 57 in comparison to all other forcing datasets for the upper danube gauge achleiten best nse was obtained with the era5 gpw driven simulation nse 0 75 whereas best kge was obtained with the era5 driven simulation kge 0 83 although kge was very similar for era5 era5 gpw and wfde5 for two tributary basins of the lower danube efficiency measures were equally best for era5 wc and era5 gpw nse 0 47 and kge 0 69 for the mures and nse 0 39 and kge 0 54 for the tisza basin moreover era5 wc yielded best efficiencies for the upper and middle danube at gauge bezdan nse 0 71 kge 0 78 and for the danube overall at gauge ceatal izmail nse 0 70 kge 0 77 also for these two basins kge values were very similar for the era5 wc driven and the era5 gpw driven simulation 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the uncalibrated hydrological model our results showed that satisfactory model results in terms of the goodness of fit criteria pbias nse and kge could be equally achievable without extensive model calibration considering the fact that no calibration with observed discharge has been undertaken at all we obtained satisfactory results by using a reasonably and comprehensively parameterized mechanistic hydrological model which takes physical processes of water flows into account due to its process based nature also for methodological reasons it is appropriate to dispense with calibration so that the hydrological model is not parameterized differently for each meteorological forcing dataset calibration that aims to best fit the discharge observations would prevent an objective comparison of the suitability of the different meteorological drivers for hydrological modelling applications from the outset the nse results obtained in our study are in good accordance compared to other model studies where extensive calibration efforts have been undertaken in table 5 we show nse of daily discharges from the respective best simulation run in this study compared to the daily nse of validation obtained at the exact or nearby gauges from the study of stagl and hattermann 2015 as can be seen our nse were quite similar to the nse given in the comparative study and were even better for the upper danube the upper and middle danube nse at bezdan bratislava gauges the drava and the siret basin concerning the relationship between nse and kge across all sub basins and all simulation runs our results gave a positive linear correlation between nse and kge values this means that higher nse tended to be associated with higher kge and vice versa see fig 7 kge is often used in addition to or instead of nse to account for specific shortcomings of nse with kge it is possible to rate the model s ability to yield simultaneously good solutions for the linear correlation the bias and the variability of flow which is not the case with nse gupta et al 2009 as knoben et al 2019 vividly showed an exemplary strength of kge is the ability to capture a model s potential tendency to overestimate discharge peaks which nse cannot and in contrast an exemplary strength of nse is the ability to capture potential systematic offsets between the modelled and the observed hydrograph which kge cannot a positive correlation of nse and kge therefore indicates that there are no one sided deficiencies in the physically based description of hydrological processes in promet that would manifest as systematic over or underestimations of the modelled hydrograph or a systematic overestimation of modelled flood peaks 4 2 performance of the meteorological forcing datasets and climatologies for bias correction our results showed that sub basin specific variations in long term annual means of precipitation between the different forcing datasets and thus simulation runs were much greater than of temperature or evapotranspiration connected with corresponding impacts on pbias sub basin specific higher pbias values positive or negative coincided primarily with variations in forcing data specific precipitation between the different simulation runs and very little with variations in temperature or evapotranspiration this clearly suggests that a small pbias and thus well predicted water budget within a basin is above all dependent on the correct representation of precipitation in the meteorological data and underlines the importance of choosing appropriate precipitation forcing data as input for hydrological modelling combined with suitable climatologies especially for precipitation bias correction the uncorrected era5 forcing dataset showed highest annual mean precipitation for most sub basins except for drava and sava leading to systematic positive pbias for the era5 driven simulation in these sub basins the poor performance of the era5 driven simulation concerning nse and kge compared to the other simulations may be traced back to the relatively smooth patterns in the downscaled era5 precipitation map especially over mountainous terrain see fig 4 in mountain regions the era5 precipitation map sharply contrasted with the sas and e obs maps of observed precipitation both of which showed detailed small scale rainfall structures in the alps the dinarides and the carpathians especially inner alpine dry valleys and drier regions in the drava basin this suggests that the smooth precipitation patterns in era5 may have led to a distortion of spatial runoff dynamics and to an inadequate emulation of the hydrograph interestingly the downscaled wfde5 forcing dataset showed similar smooth precipitation patterns compared to the downscaled uncorrected era5 reanalysis but the wfde5 driven simulation yielded much better results in terms of pbias nse and kge in almost all sub basins compared to the era5 driven simulation wfde5 even yielded best nse and kge for the mountain watersheds drava and sava and also for the siret basin across all forcing datasets apparently the wfd bias correction methodology used to create wfde5 offers great benefits for hydrological modelling purposes in the drb another aspect which is particularly important in mountainous regions may also be a determining factor for the good performance of wfde5 in the mountain watersheds the presence of undercatch correction especially in mountainous regions a major source of uncertainty is systematic measurement bias due to wind induced undercatch at precipitation gauging stations this is particularly significant in wind exposed areas and during snowfall periods leading to systematic underestimations of precipitation sevruk 2005 in contrast to all other forcing datasets precipitation climatologies and observation datasets presented in this study era5 worldclim 2 prism glowa and e obs the wfde5 forcing dataset is in fact the only one which includes an undercatch correction cornes et al 2018 cucchi et al 2020 fick and hijmans 2017 frei and schär 1998 früh et al 2006 although the mountainous upper danube drava and sava basins featured highest area averaged precipitation means in the era5 era5 wc and era5 gpw forcing datasets and not in the wfde5 dataset absent undercatch correction can nevertheless lead to local underestimations of rainfall at higher altitudes within the sub basins this may result in inadequately predicted dynamics of discharge formation and to a possible distortion of the hydrograph therefore a possible explanation for the best model efficiencies of wfde5 in the drava the sava and the siret basins may well be the presence of both bias correction and undercatch correction in the wfde5 dataset leading to better predicted dynamics of the mountain watershed hydrology concerning era5 the introduction of bias correction vastly reduced pbias and improved nse and kge for the simulations driven by era5 wc and era5 gpw compared to the simulation driven by the uncorrected era5 reanalysis solely incorporating the global worldclim 2 temperature and precipitation climatologies for bias correction era5 wc led to smaller pbias values and improved model efficiency especially in the lower danube and its tributary basins where worldclim 2 significantly reduced precipitation amounts in contrast in the complex terrains of the alps and dinarides esp upper danube and drava basin worldclim 2 indeed added some structure to the precipitation map but did not appear to reproduce the complex actual precipitation patterns in an eligible way as nse and kge considerably dropped compared to the era5 driven simulation this is particularly interesting given that the spatial patterns in the era5 wc precipitation map in the alps and dinarides fig 4 were in close correspondence to the patterns in the e obs precipitation map but not to those in the sas map this similarity may well be due to the fact that worldclim 2 and e obs incorporate overlapping precipitation stations across europe e obs is created from data by the european climate assessment and dataset eca d initiative klein tank et al 2002 klok and klein tank 2009 sourcing station data from many national meteorological services nms and other providers across europe cornes et al 2018 the worldclim 2 station data basis is mainly compiled from global datasets like cru ts3 22 station observations some of which are shared by numerous national weather services through the world meteorological organization wmo harris et al 2014 however a considerable proportion of the station data basis for worldclim 2 also directly originates from the eca d pool in addition to the directly included eca d stations there is also a larger number of stations in europe which are duplicated in eca d and global sources used for worldclim 2 fick and hijmans 2017 as fick and hijmans 2017 and hijmans et al 2005 stated there are greater uncertainties in the worldclim 2 precipitation climatology in mountainous terrain mainly due to the lower station density and the simplifying assumption of an elevation dependence of precipitation in the spatial interpolation routine uncertainties were also reported for the e obs precipitation dataset in mountainous and data scarce regions cornes et al 2018 in contrast frei and schär 1998 argued that precipitation elevation correlations should only be used very carefully when interpolating station data in the alpine region they pointed out that precipitation measured at stations is highly dependent on broader scale synoptic characteristics and topographical factors like slope or exposure summit vs valley location windward vs leeward aspect which lead to particular variations in the alpine region and especially across the alpine ridge frei and schär 1998 the relatively high uncertainties for precipitation in mountainous terrain in worldclim 2 could be the reason for overestimations of precipitation at highest elevations in the danube basin and excess precipitation especially in the drava basin connected with a highly positive pbias excess rainfall at highest elevations in the model may also have caused an inadequate simulation of runoff volume dynamics and timing and may have resulted in a hydrograph yielding poor nse and kge in the drava and upper danube basins we learned that the additional integration of the regional precipitation climatologies glowa and prism in the bias correction routine of precipitation era5 gpw led to better results concerning pbias nse and kge in the upper danube drava and sava basins than the bias correction with the worldclim 2 precipitation climatology alone era5 wc an interesting finding here is that the era5 gpw precipitation map fig 4 showed very similar spatial patterns in the alps and dinarides compared to the sas map in particular the distinct rainfall band in the bavarian alpine foreland the inner alpine dry valleys of the inn catchment in the south western upper danube and the round shaped dry region in the drava basin in contrast the era5 gpw map did not resemble the e obs map in these regions in total the described precipitation patterns resulted in a higher basin precipitation in the upper danube for era5 gpw and in a much smaller pbias compared to era5 wc thus the reduced pbias and the improved model efficiencies for the upper danube drava and sava basins may indicate that the era5 gpw precipitation map which was similar to the sas map showed more realistic spatial precipitation patterns in the alpine region than the era5 wc map which was similar to the e obs map we assume that the underlying higher station density for the generation of the regional precipitation climatologies glowa and prism leads to a much more realistic reproduction of the actual spatial precipitation patterns in the alps and dinarides than worldclim 2 is able to provide this is a strong indication that observation datasets should not be considered trustworthy based on their mere observational nature taking observational uncertainties into account the selection of an appropriate reference climatology dataset for bias correction should be handled just as critically as for example the selection of an appropriate bias correction method 5 summary and conclusions in this paper we analysed the performance of the global meteorological reanalysis era5 and the global bias adjusted forcing dataset wfde5 for driving the physically based hydro agroecological model promet in the large heterogeneous danube river basin furthermore we investigated the suitability of the global to regional reference climatologies worldclim 2 glowa and prism for linear bias correction of era5 temperature and precipitation incorporated in the downscaling routine we performed four uncalibrated hydrological simulation runs of 30 spatial and hourly temporal resolution for the period 1980 2016 driven by the following configurations of meteorological forcing data the uncorrected era5 reanalysis denoted as era5 the wfde5 forcing dataset bias corrected according to the wfd methodology denoted as wfde5 the era5 reanalysis bias corrected with the worldclim 2 temperature and precipitation climatologies denoted as era5 wc the era5 reanalysis bias corrected with the worldclim 2 temperature climatology and a mosaic of the glowa and prism alpine precipitation climatologies and the worldclim 2 precipitation climatology denoted as era5 gpw our simulations showed significant differences in performance between the different meteorological forcing datasets era5 wfde5 era5 wc and era5 gpw we evaluated the performance of the simulation runs using the pbias of discharge and the model efficiency metrics nse and kge calculated from modelled and observed daily discharge at selected gauges in the danube basin and its sub basins the era5 gpw driven simulation yielded the smallest pbias values and the best model efficiencies across the majority of sub basins compared to the other simulation runs given the poor performance of the era5 driven simulation in terms of pbias nse and kge across nearly all sub basins bias correction is essential for hydrological modelling in the drb compared to era5 the wfde5 driven simulation yielded much better results in terms of pbias nse and kge with even best nse and kge in the mountainous drava and sava basins this could be due to the wfd bias correction and the undercatch correction applied in wfde5 which is apparently very suitable for hydrological modelling purposes concerning era5 we learned that bias correction with the global and widely used worldclim 2 temperature and precipitation climatology alone era5 wc forcing dataset significantly improved the lower danube and its tributary basins in terms of pbias nse and kge however worldclim 2 was insufficient to capture the complex spatial precipitation patterns in mountainous terrain in the alps and dinarides which are located in the upper danube drava and sava basins here the greater uncertainties in the interpolation of precipitation in mountainous terrain are likely to be a major limitation instead additionally incorporating the regional high resolution glowa and prism alpine precipitation climatologies derived from a much higher underlying station density in the european alps in the bias correction routine of era5 era5 gpw forcing dataset noticeably added distinct small scale spatial precipitation patterns in the alps and dinarides this approach reduced pbias values and improved model efficiencies for the mountain watersheds upper danube drava and sava in comparison to the bias correction with worldclim 2 alone we draw three major conclusions from the findings of our simulation study first we have shown that with a reasonable and comprehensive parametrization of a process based hydrological model such as promet satisfying results for pbias nse and kge can be obtained without extensive calibration of model parameters to best fit measured discharges the ability of promet to simulate water flows runoff formation and flood propagation in the channel through a physical process description without trial and error calibration was the prerequisite to perform an objective comparison of different meteorological forcing datasets in the next step second we have demonstrated the applicability of the global meteorological reanalysis era5 with appropriate bias correction as a prerequisite and the global bias adjusted forcing dataset wfde5 for hydrological modelling we obtained satisfying results for pbias nse and kge at a comparatively fine spatial resolution of 30 even in a hydrologically complex large and diverse basin such as the danube nevertheless we have shown that appropriate bias correction especially of precipitation is an essential part of the downscaling routine of the era5 reanalysis for driving hydrological models in the drb third we emphasize the need for regional high resolution precipitation climatologies for the precipitation bias correction process of reanalyses for hydrological modelling applications in topographically complex mountain terrains such as the alps and dinarides high resolution precipitation climatologies such as glowa and prism created from high station density can more adequately account for small scale precipitation patterns in contrast global climatologies created from lower station density quickly reach their limits based on our findings we therefore argue that the choice of an appropriate reference climatology dataset for bias correction of precipitation in alpine terrain is of utmost importance and needs to be carefully considered further research must be undertaken to determine whether and to what extent the need for regional high resolution precipitation climatologies for bias correction applies for other mountainous regions around the globe it seems plausible that this issue is not unique to the european alps in this light our results also emphasize the importance of further research to develop appropriate reanalysis schemes for mountainous regions of much higher spatial resolution with the ultimate goal of eventually eliminating the need for downscaling and bias correction of meteorological forcing data for hydrological modelling credit authorship contribution statement elisabeth probst conceptualization

intensive hydrocarbon production study focus impacts of injection of large volumes of water produced from oil and gas wells and injected through 1000 disposal wells in particular pressure buildup induced seismicity and their potential consequences in a formation underlying fresh water aquifers but separated from them by thick layers of evaporites the target formation is the delaware mountain group dmg of permian age and consisting of up to 4500 ft 1400 m of mostly fine grained deepwater siliciclastic slope and basin deposits sandstones siltstones and minor limestones a flow model was developed and calibrated from well log data stratigraphic data petrophysical analyses and core data 123 170 mi2 1 1 mi2 grid size complemented with dynamic injectivity information based on surface injection pressures and rates of the disposal wells new hydrological insights for the region injection of 5 8 billion barrels 0 92 billion m3 of waste water has generated regional pressure increases in the dmg mostly in the 100 400 psi 0 7 2 8 mpa range 1 creating strong artesian conditions that combined with the presence of numerous historical boreholes could connect dmg and fresh water aquifers and 2 generating conditions leading to actually observed moderate induced seismicity keywords pore pressure salt water disposal seismicity injection well permian basin 1 introduction the permian basin of west texas and southeast new mexico fig 1 and fig s1 is an important oil producing basin in the southwest region of the usa whose production had been declining until the mid 2000 s but that has seen a strong recovery related to development of unconventional resources unconventional resources include very low permeability rocks such as shales that are typically the source of hydrocarbon accumulations in conventional reservoirs their development was made possible by the concurrent advances in horizontal drilling technology 1 3 km of horizontal section and hydraulic fracturing stimulation during which large amounts of water are injected to fracture the rock and increase its permeability nicot et al 2014 vidic et al 2013 nicot and scanlon 2012 however a well known consequence of unconventional production in the delaware basin db a sub basin of the permian basin is a high water oil ratio amounting to produced water volumes multiple times that of the oil produced scanlon et al 2017 2020b lemons et al 2019 perhaps the highest of any shale play in the usa the produced water volume is also multiple times that of fluids used for hydraulic fracturing but some of it can be reused for fracturing unconventional formations saini and mezei 2016 the permian age delaware mountain group dmg is the major target for produced water disposal the first fully documented salt water disposal swd well was drilled in the early 1980 s however since then many more swd wells have been drilled to service the increased waste disposal needs of a growing oil and gas industry that has increased production from unconventional reservoirs underlying the dmg and that has raised concerns about induced seismicity disposal capacity and pressure increases historically the disposal of waste fluids and seismicity have been shown to be related healy et al 1968 and more recently in basins across the south central usa barnes and halihan 2019 hennings et al 2019 skoumal et al 2018 2019 langenbruch and zoback 2016 the volume of water injected in the dmg a total of 5 8 billion barrels as of december 2019 has been at a historical maximum in recent years fig s2 and exceeds the cumulative volume of fluids injected in other nearby seismic prone areas such as the fort worth basin 2 23 billion barrels gao et al 2021 but is less than the amount injected in oklahoma 11 5 billion barrels scanlon et al 2020b the regional pressure increase can potentially impact the overlying and adjacent aquifers including strings of desert springs such as in the balmorhea texas area uliana et al 2007 robertson et al 2019 through 60 000 oil and gas production wells his 2017 2020 many of which have been abandoned for more than half a century it can favor anthropogenic dissolution of the overlying evaporites and in extreme cases lead to the formation of sinkholes such as observed in the wink sink winkler county in the hendrick oilfield fig 1 kim et al 2019 paine et al 2009 the objective of this study is to provide estimations of pore pressure evolution in the db for use in causal assessment and mitigation of induced seismicity dvory and zoback 2021 morris et al 2021 savvaidis et al 2020 and for management of the dmg as an injection disposal resource in the db including risk assessments as the need for protecting fresh water resources intensifies there is growing interest in understanding proximal water bearing formations underlying fresh water aquifers bloomfield et al 2020 kang et al 2019 we developed a numerical flow model focusing on the pore pressure history of the dmg main injection intervals from 1983 to 2019 the modeling approach is very straightforward in principle and relies on the direct application of darcy s law in a single phase flow system although the study is concerned with water injection rather than withdrawal the detailed stratigraphy of the modeled formations allowed the development of a conceptual model for flow parameters somewhat balancing data scarcity in addition we introduce the concept of using injection pressure and injection rate whose ratio is injectivity or specific capacity as a means to develop the model permeability field because of the lack of wells dedicated to pressure and head monitoring we instead use injection pressure at the ground surface to calibrate the regional model the long term sustainability of such a large regional injection scheme has been raised and some operators are turning to water recycling or beneficial use after treatment instead of injection as a means to dispose of the produced water scanlon et al 2020a 2 geological background 2 1 geological setting covering an area of 10 000 mi2 25 000 km2 with surface elevations ranging from 3000 4500 ft amsl 1000 1400 m

000 ft 6 km thick at its deepest fig s4 the surface topography of the db is a flat plateau with moderate topography in the west guadalupe and delaware mountains and south apache and davis mountains and a slope dipping gently to the east and southeast subsidence in the db was most active during the early permian the thick permian age strata are named in order of decreasing age wolfcampian leonardian guadalupian and ochoan fig s3 the cumulative thickness of the permian deposits can be as high as 15 000 ft 4500 m in the main depocenters but less than half of that thickness along some of its margins the db was quiescent during most of the mesozoic but some minor triassic age lacustrine deposits dockum and clastic and carbonate sediments related to the cretaceous transgression western interior seaway are preserved much of these more recent sediments have been eroded owing to the neogene tilting of the texas craton which includes the db that exposed the western margin of the permian basin brown 2019 anon 2019 cenozoic alluvium pecos valley alluvium locally very thick is derived from prior salt dissolution and related subsidence and these sediments are capped by aeolian deposits the main structural features of the db were in place by the end of the permian with 1 reverse upwardly attenuating thrust faults with nnw sse strike on the db s eastern margin separating it from the central basin platform cbp 2 development during the guadalupian and coeval of the dmg deposition of an important reefal system ringing most of the db the capitan reef complex whose core is made of massive carbonates and 3 an e w structural feature variously called the mid basin high grisham arch or grisham fault zone south of loving county that displaces all formations older than the leonardian bone spring formation van der loop 2017 basement rooted faults often with large throws die out upward into the wolfcamp before they reach the dmg horne et al 2021 two important tectonic events occurred in the cenozoic 1 regional uplift during the laramide orogeny 60 ma and 2 tilting due to basin and range tectonics 10 20 ma sinclair 2007 these two events did not fundamentally change the structure of the db but altered the dynamics of fluid flow within it note that although the cbp was exposed and its carbonates underwent multiple episodes of karstification and erosion during the permian the db basinal sediments of permian age were not exposed until these cenozoic events 2 2 the permian period and delaware mountain group permian deposits all marine in origin are coarser clastics with infrequent depositional carbonates transitioning from the mudstone rich facies in the wolfcamp formation to the clastic and carbonate rich leonardian bone spring formation to the mostly silty and sandy guadalupian dmg and capped by thick ochoan evaporitic deposits mostly anhydrite of the castile formation and mostly halite of the salado formation fig s3 the wolfcamp formation lies conformably on pennsylvanian shales and consists mostly of silica rich mudstones the wolfcamp formation represents the primary interval currently targeted by oil and gas operators bone spring sediments conformably overlie wolfcamp sediments and consist of alternating siliciclastic intervals also often targeted by operators and more carbonate rich intervals because the bone spring formation was deposited in a more quiescent basin already filled with sediments its thickness is more uniform across the db with an estimated average thickness of 3000 ft 900 m dmg sediments represent the unconformable continuation of the bone spring sedimentation with much less abundant carbonates and consist mostly of initially clay poor arkosic to subarkosic siltstones and fine sandstones with minor detrital carbonates dutton 2008 nance 2020a smye et al 2021 the transition to the dmg at the top of the bone spring formation is marked by fine grained intervals carbonate mass transport deposits with increasing organic rich siltstones collectively named the cutoff shale one of them the avalon shale is targeted by operators in new mexico hurd et al 2018 carr 2019 smye et al 2021 the dmg is traditionally divided into three units increasing overall permeability and in ascending stratigraphic order are the brushy canyon cherry canyon and bell canyon formations the dmg cumulative thickness can be up to 4500 ft 1400 m in the db mid section but decreases to 2000 ft 600 m at its northern and southern edges the sediment deposition mechanisms have been described as lowstand turbidity currents transporting and distributing siliciclastic sediments from the platforms to the db in fan complexes and as debris flows of carbonates taken from the exposed platforms or outer shelf back reef deposits smye et al 2021 nance 2020a the abundant sometimes organic rich siltstones are interpreted as starved transgressive to highstand eolian or suspension deposits smye et al 2021 nance 2020a dutton et al 2005 numerous sea level fluctuations generated the interspersed nature of siltstones and sandstones proximal deposits are channelized whereas distal deposits are more sheet like with a low degree of amalgamation or sand on sand contact zhang et al 2017 as stratigraphically distinct successions of highstand sands are disconnected by intervening lowstand siltstones suggesting unfavorable vertical connectivity smye et al 2021 examination of net sand maps shows a clockwise rotation of the main fairway trends from the northern margin ns channels of the brushy canyon to the eastern margin ns and ew channels in the cherry canyon and ne sw channels in the bell canyon in which formation they extend far into the db smye et al 2021 nance 2020a net sand volumes average 46 68 and 70 for the brushy canyon cherry canyon and bell canyon respectively but carbonate dominates on the db margins smye et al 2021 the brushy canyon has been described as containing coarser sandstones but because of a lack of sorting and of post deposition diagenesis its porosity and permeability are lower overall than that the finer but better sorted overlying formations carbonate units are rare in the brushy canyon but become abundant upwards with more extensive and laterally continuous intervals in the bell canyon compartmentalizing the formation horizontally some such as the lamar limestone member at the top of the bell canyon and the manzanita member at the top of the brushy canyon can be traced basin wide king 1948 hampton 1989 the dmg formations were partly exhumed during regional tilting in the neogene and crop out in the delaware mountains to the west of the db on an along strike length of 50 miles 80 km the dmg is impacted by many shallow normal faults with small throws that delineate small grabens staniewicz et al 2020 charzynski et al 2019 these faults are not believed to have a significant impact on regional flow the overall prograding capitan reef complex marks the transition between basinal and shelf sediments almost completely encircles the db and is approximately coeval of the bell canyon fig s5 the eastern arm of the reef along the cbp is mostly buried except to the south of the db where it crops out in the glass mountains to the north crossing into new mexico the capitan reef is shallow and host of a fresh water aquifer and then emerges in the guadalupe mountains as the main surface expression of the western arm of the reef standen et al 2009 hiss 1976 the large late cretaceous fault that uplifted the guadalupe mountains border fault during the laramide orogeny dropped the remainder of the western arm deep into the subsurface except locally in the patterson hills and apache mountains until it disappears across from the glass mountains completing the horseshoe shape of the reef complex and leaving open the channel linking the db to the open ocean the backreef debris toward the platform and the shelf sediments are generally described as fractured and of good permeability whereas the carbonate debris of the forereef are understood as more compact and of lower permeability nance 2020a the castile formation is restricted to the db proper but younger formations of the ochoan series salado rustler and dewey lake formations extend outside of it the anhydrite of the castile has a sharp but conformable transition with the top of the bell canyon formation it has a basal limestone towards the margins of the db interbedded halite is frequent in the castile the salt from the salado formation halite with frequent sylvite and other complex evaporite minerals is the thickest in lea county in new mexico and along the eastern side of the db but is barely present in the western half of the db due to active dissolution by meteoric water it has also been considerably thinned along the footprint of the capitan reef on the eastern margins of the db allowing for the deposition of the thick cenozoic pecos valley alluvium 2 3 hydrogeology and oil and gas production several studies have investigated the general features of groundwater flow in the dmg under natural conditions others studies have been narrowly focused on producing reservoirs dutton et al 2005 although the wolfcamp formation and part of the bone spring formation and of the underlying pennsylvanian formation have been described as strongly overpressured rittenhouse et al 2017 bryndzia et al 2019 strata younger than guadalupian including the dmg and capitan reef are normally pressured but some sections can be under artesian conditions knowles and lang 1947 hiss 1976 1980 uplift and tilting had an important impact on regional hydrogeological flow in the db flow in all normally pressured formations is currently towards the south and east driven by the general topographic slope of the permian basin nicot 2021 the tilting initiated the flow of water that had been nearly static or flowed slowly in a flat terrane for millions of years e g ferguson et al 2018 this tectonic activity promoted recharge in units exposed along the western edge of the db e g lee and williams 2000 the western margin of the db can be recharged through the fractured capitan reef and the dmg outcrop as evidenced by low tds formation water natural secular flow in the dmg is generally described as very slow and directed towards the east and southeast hiss 1980 sharp 2001 the salinity of the dmg is highly variable from fresh to hypersaline but spatially structured see later sections for full discussion salinity from oil fields can reach up to 250 000 ppm west texas geological society wtgs 1982 historical papers and reports with data on the dmg mcneal 1965 twdb texas water development board 1972 zaengle 1995 show large spatial contrasts in tds with lower tds in the western side of the db increasing to high values adjacent the cbp and reverting to low values on the guadalupian carbonates of the cbp aquifers with fresh to brackish water are present in the ochoan rustler and dewey lake formations and also include the triassic dockum aquifer the cretaceous edwards trinity aquifer and the cenozoic pecos valley aquifer as well as the guadalupian capitan reef depending on their locations and access to the end users all these aquifers are used as water source by oil and gas operators and is the carrier fluid for hydraulic fracturing stimulations the capitan reef aquifer and dmg are in direct contact with each other the hydrodynamic nature and degree of interconnectivity at the margins of permian basin is an important consideration for modeling pore pressure the northern section of the capitan reef is an important aquifer for the city of carlsbad and eddy county in new mexico the capitan aquifer fig 1 and is recharged in the guadalupe mountains where the ancient reef crops out the eastern arm of capitan reef is well hydraulically connected to the shelf deposits through permeable backreef sediments but connection is intermittent with the basinal deposits because of the low permeability of the forereef sediments for example the large hendrick oil field in winkler county located on the cbp fig 1 produces low tds water and has been shown to be hydraulically connected to the capitan reef hiss 1976 hiss 1976 noted a slight decrease in the potentiometric surface of dmg wells between 1920 and 1970 he hypothesized that oil and water production from reservoirs on the cbp and northern shelf hydraulically connected with the capitan reef caused the pressure decrease large produced water volumes ultimately withdrawn indirectly from the capitan aquifer were compounded by large volumes of water directly withdrawn from it for waterflooding purposes up to the 1960 s overall withdrawals were large enough to reverse flow directions in the capitan aquifer with a current pressure deficit centered on winkler county hiss 1976 sharp 2001 uliana 2001 this strong pressure signal was apparently detected in historical dmg potentiometric measurements hiss 1976 this would suggest hydraulic communication and potential attenuation of excess pressure in the dmg if it bled into the capitan reef however many wells in the capitan reef on the eastern arm are in recovery mode jones 2014 with increasing water levels that cannot be discerned from pressure bleeding related to water injection in the dmg an examination of recent water level measurements in a limited number of capitan reef water wells with acceptable time series 28 wells do not show a recent change in their long term trends but these measurements do not necessarily suggest there are not potential active exchanges historical conventional oil and gas production targeted mostly dmg sandstone reservoirs starting in the 1920 s with associated forays into bone spring pennsylvanian devonian and ellenburger reservoirs since the 1980 s a total of 9000 wells have been drilled with 4000 are still active fig s6 and fig s7 wells were principally located along the eastern and northern margins of the db nance 2020a with the greatest production coming from wells in the bell canyon dutton et al 2003 then the cherry canyon and lastly the brushy canyon annual oil production from the dmg increased steadily from the 1950 s to late 2010 s with a peak of 20 million barrels in 2015 cumulative production of 600 million barrels cumulative production in the dmg using conventional methods was estimated to be 350 million barrels in the early 2000 s at the onset of the shale revolution in the db dutton et al 2005 potter et al 2020 that is cumulative oil production of 250 million barrels in the dmg occurs in parallel to injection activities in the 2010 s along with the development of the underlying reservoirs in the wolfcamp and bone spring formations operators added low permeability organic rich self sourced siltstones to their targets which contributed significantly to the 2015 production peak eia 2020 wolfcamp and bone spring unconventional development provides most of the current production in the db 10 000 hydraulically fractured wells a significant consequence of db unconventional operations is the high water oil ratio as high as 3 vol vol nicot et al 2020 scanlon et al 2017 these volumes are much higher than in the neighboring midland basin and many other unconventional plays this produced water represents a significant technical and economic challenge to the industry as it now faces increased induced seismicity frohlich et al 2020 schultz et al 2020 potential overpressure and diminishing storage capacity scanlon et al 2020b gogri et al 2018 the very low permeability of the producing formations does not favor reinjection of the produced water instead the bulk of produced water from unconventionals is injected into dmg formations the cumulative saltwater volume disposed into more than 1000 dmg swd wells reached 5 6 billion barrels by december 2019 water production from conventional dmg reservoirs 3 4 billion barrels to date follows the typical model of increasing water cut fraction of water in the produced fluids as production matures with most of the water being reinjected into the reservoir for pressure maintenance it follows that overall pressure changes are only due to hydrocarbon production and that this short path water cycle can be neglected an important caveat relates to 400 dmg wells that can be considered unconventional and have produced 0 42 billion barrels of water by december 2019 which are counted in the 5 8 billion barrels of water injected into dmg formations through swd wells most of these wells are in lea and eddy counties in new mexico most of the sand hosted dmg reservoirs are described as oil reservoirs with no gas cap at discovery and having a relatively quickly exhausted solution gas drive galloway et al 1983 dutton et al 2005 nance 2020a suggesting poor connection to the surrounding aquifer and potentially some pore space with depleted pressures this was confirmed by sharp pressure drops over the local areas surrounding oil fields hiss 1976 there is no recent measurement available to assess the degree of pressure recovery after production has ceased nance 2020a stated that oil recovery efficiency is 15 in most reservoirs even with secondary recovery because of the complex geometry of the reservoir and of the lack of a sustained driving mechanism in general slope and basin systems such as the dmg host reservoirs with the poorest sweep efficiency some reservoirs underwent successful tertiary recovery co2 floods potter et al 2020 although the overall recovery efficiency remained low ford geraldine field which produced 30 million barrels from the upper part of the bell canyon is the largest dmg field in the db with an original oil in place of 100 million barrels dutton et al 1998 fields close to the cbp and along the eastern boundary of the db are described as having a water drive likely related to the nearby capitan reef the fact that very few oil reservoirs are known to be present in the capitan reef nance 2020b does not negate water exchanges between the capitan reef and dmg as two phase flow dynamics dictates that flow of the non wetting phase oil can be impeded while that of the wetting phase water is not 3 data source summary the construction of the flow model is a three step process step 1 is the development of the quality controlled database of injection well data as described below in specific support of this research smye et al 2021 provide step 2 the dmg reservoir description which was used to construct a geocellular model the geocellular model has the stratigraphic structure of the model through correlation of geophysical logs for 1090 wells his 2017 2020 distributed across the db fig 2 porosity values were also extracted from a subset of the same dataset 327 wells in step 3 porosity values were upscaled in the geocellular model and implemented in the flow model proper to populate the grids swd well monthly injection volumes and average wellhead pressures were obtained from the state oil and gas regulatory agency the railroad commission of texas rrc h 10 forms and from enerdeq ihs markit the data were quality controlled building on previous experience gao et al 2021 lemons et al 2017 note that because operators report well operation data only once a year there is a lag of about 15 months until this information can be considered complete in addition rrc provided 23 files with bottom hole pressure bhp and step rate test results the bhp information is used to confirm the initial pressure gradient in the model permeability data were also collected from historical publications on individual oil reservoirs over 80 fields in dmg and from the analysis of this data from which a porosity permeability transform was derived smye et al 2021 dutton et al 2005 additional data were taken from recently drilled rrc swd permit files a total of 15 step rate tests were used to estimate permeability physical characteristics of the swd wells such as perforated intervals open hole or cased status and tubing dimensions were sourced from enerdeq ihs markit compressibilities were estimated from the data in literature guided by rrc data temperature data were extracted from measured downhole values his 2017 2020 salinity data was obtained from public domain sources 1 usgs produced waters database blondes et al 2018 containing 350 dmg historical samples mostly collected in the 1960 s and 1970 s along the margins of the db and 2 new mexico water and infrastructure data system cather et al 2016 which recently disseminated a snapshot of produced water geochemistry from 2014 to 15 650 dmg samples as well as recent data points from nicot et al 2020 oil and gas production history production well locations and target intervals were extracted from his 2017 2020 4 model construction and methods 4 1 model structure the area of interest covers the entirety of the db and the model targets the dmg and capitan reef formations it includes whole or parts of eight counties in west texas and two counties lea and eddy in southeast new mexico fig 1 the areal extent is constrained by the structural boundaries of the db capitan reef complex to the east and to the north and dmg outcrop to the west all side boundaries are assumed no flow which is a suitable assumption for a model of this large extent and the nature of the boundaries most of the injection occurs in the eastern half of the db not far from the high permeability capitan reef whose proximity could buffer the model pressure variations in that area and that is akin to the traditional approach of modeling water drive reservoirs e g van everdingen hurst model the impacts of the capitan reef are analyzed in the sensitivity analysis section no faults are in the model even though they exist in the dmg hennings et al 2021a 2021b and 2021b but many are minor with small throws compared to the thickness of the modeled units and of uncertain properties they are not believed to have caused significant offsets of the model layers or to limit transverse flow because of the general absence of clay minerals that might reduce across fault transmissibility ortiz et al 2019 however anecdotal information operators suggest transmissive flow parallel to the fault planes anisotropy possibly created by fault parallel permeability enhancement is not studied here but this work is important input to more advanced analysis the top of the model domain is the top of the bell canyon formation or equivalently the bottom of the castile formation the bottom of the model domain is the bottom of the brushy canyon formation or equivalently the top of the bone spring formation cutoff shale for the purpose of this model top and bottom boundaries are assumed to be no flow because of the significant contrast in matrix permeability geochemical observations of water of clear meteoric origin on the western side of the db show that recharge has occurred in the recent past and could be currently occurring however the recharge rate is too low to play a role for the short timeframe considered in this model no study of recharge to the dmg exists but an overlying aquifer with a similar footprint and outcrop located in the same general area rustler aquifer has been attributed a recharge of 3 mm year or less ewing et al 2012 for the purpose of establishing the layering for the flow model the geocellular model was constructed using the petrel software v 2019 4 schlumberger 2019 a total of 1090 wells were used to correlate formation tops over the 20 000 mi2 of the study area smye et al 2021 the three dmg formations bell canyon cherry canyon and brushy canyon were identified through these correlated tops formation thicknesses vary from the edge to the center of the db and they also pinch out completely at some locations three lithologies sandstone siltstone and carbonate were defined in the model the computer modelling group s cmg modeling package cmg stars v 2019 10 computer modeling group cmg 2019 was used to simulate pore pressure history the code computes fluid properties such as viscosity and density as a function of temperature pressure and salinity the model output is pressure rather than head because of the variable salinity and therefore of the variable water density e g langevin and guo 2006 the model has 18 layers for the three dmg formations each formation is arbitrarily split into 6 layers of equivalent thickness in order to accommodate many short perforated swd intervals as well as 12 layers for the capitan reef the corner point grid is 123 170 mi2 198 274 km2 with 123 170 30 cells of approximately 1 1 mi2 1 6 1 6 km2 and includes 215 621 active cells the average cell thickness is 163 ft 50 m and the thickness of 85 the cells around the median ranges from 70 to 278 ft 21 85 m grid cells are aligned in the y direction with one of the main structural directions nnw sse that makes the eastern boundary with the cbp perpendicular structure x direction is the high permeability channels of the bell canyon and cherry canyon and which is also aligned with the smaller faults 4 2 property distribution the porosity and permeability fields fig 3 and fig s8 were constructed in the petrel software a total of 334 wells with relevant petrophysical logs were used to model the porosity field through geostatistical analysis and sequential gaussian simulation permeability values were obtained through a more elaborate workflow making use of the measured porosity the injectivity of swd wells the porosity values from log interpretation range from 10 to 25 for sandstones from 5 to 10 for siltstones and are less than 5 for carbonates smye et al 2021 well log data 0 5 ft or 15 cm vertical resolution were upscaled in the geocellular model and extended across the entire layer through geostatistical and sequential gaussian simulation modeling spherical model with a small nugget effect low variance and 2 10 miles 3 2 16 km range overall lithologies can be continuous over long distances at the regional scale siltstone drapes carbonate members channel sandstones which suggests a large geostatistical range at least before upscaling but also can be variable at the local scale which suggests a high nugget effect we opted to keep a relatively small nugget effect to avoid convergence problems when some of the hundreds of injection wells about which little is known are located in a randomly assigned low permeability cell porosity values estimated from well logs show differences with respect to the three dmg formations average porosity by formation are shown in table s1 with a global average of 9 most cells were assigned a porosity between 3 and 15 but locally porosity can be 20 the mean porosity of bell canyon and cherry canyon formation is higher than that of the brushy canyon formation there are two contributions to the permeability field 1 the porosity permeability transform based on the log derived porosity and core analysis and 2 the estimated injectivity derived permeability from available flowing well head pressure and flow rate history from swd wells fig s9 note that there is no overlap between the two well sets a porosity permeability transform was developed with more than 9000 data points smye et al 2021 it was observed that the relationship persists across variations in texture and facies the porosity permeability relationship can be used as a permeability index the permeability field upscaled from the index values was complemented by larger scale permeability values estimated from injection rate and swd well head pressure from 594 out of 1008 wells and step rate tests obtained from the rrc the second dataset of injectivity derived permeability lacks the vertical resolution provided by the petrophysical study but reflects the field permeability that best accommodates the injection rate the injectivity derived permeability was estimated by assuming steady state flow conditions constant water viscosity of 1 centipoise 1 kpa s constant effective radius of 1000 ft 304 8 m and wellbore radius of 0 25 ft 0 076 m these permeability values were added to the model at control points swd wells accounting that swd well locations are biased towards higher permeability zones the use of injectivity or specific capacity is not uncommon in developing flow models of regional aquifers e g nicot et al 2013 but is typically used to complement results from more traditional pump tests in areas with a lack of well data in this study the approach is applied to the entire model using high volume injection wells the final uncalibrated permeability field was then generated by co kriging with the porosity field average permeability by formation varies within a limited range and overall average permeability is 18 md 1000 md or 1d corresponds to a hydraulic conductivity of 0 86 m day typical values range from 0 4 to 200 md for 99 of the cells with very few cells 1d overall permeability values in the bell canyon and cherry canyon formations are higher than that in brushy canyon formation table s1 however the base case model does not assume horizontal permeability anisotropy little vertical communication at the regional scale was assumed in the base case with vertical permeability 10 of the horizontal permeability the rationale is two fold 1 the presence of extensive low permeability carbonate layers at the regional scale between the brushy canyon and cherry canyon and between the cherry canyon and the bell canyon and 2 the strong stratification of the sediments at the bed level as well as the poor degree of amalgamation at various scales smye et al 2021 dutton et al 1998 given the magnitude of pore pressure modeled it is likely that injection will cause hydraulic fracturing near wells with a high injection rate which would increase vertical communication these results can be used to address this phenomenon base case pore compressibility of the rock formations in the dmg a component of the storage coefficient was calculated to be 7 5 10 6 psi 1 1 09 gpa 1 dutton et al 1998 ford geraldine field based on a 9 average porosity this value is consistent with other studies e g 5 12 10 6 psi 1 or 0 74 gpa 1 from hall 1953 9 79 10 6 psi 1 or 1 42 gpa 1 from newman 1973 the salinity distribution is discussed in the initial conditions section 4 3 fluid budget the db has a long history of oil and gas production both from dmg conventional and unconventional reservoirs and from underlying unconventional reservoirs mainly bone spring and wolfcamp formations most produced water from conventional reservoirs was reinjected into the same formations for pressure maintenance or waterflooding lemons et al 2019 in this study we assumed that conventional water production and injection cancelled each other at the spatiotemporal scale of the model and they are not further considered although an unknown amount of produced water may have been pumped into evaporation pits before the 1950 s however water production through dmg unconventional wells amounts to 0 42 billion barrels and must be accounted for in the model a total of 1071 swd wells within the modeled area have injected 5 8 billion barrels of water from january 1983 to december 2019 the last month with complete data for analysis typical injection rates range from 1000 to 8000 barrel day with high rate wells injecting more than 60 000 barrel day into the bell canyon formation some wells have low average injection rates 300 barrel day most perforations of the swd wells are completed in the bell canyon formation followed by the cherry canyon formation and fewer wells still in the brushy canyon formation cumulative oil production from the dmg is 0 6 billion barrels at surface conditions with no associated gas and this volume is large enough to be included in the flow model the oil density from most dmg fields is generally 38 42 api gravity west texas geological society wtgs 1982 using 39 api nance 2020a and assuming solution gas is methane and the initial gas oil ratio is 4000 ft3 barrel at standard conditions his 2017 2020 the equivalent reservoir volume of 1 barrel oil produced at the surface is 1 6 barrel in the subsurface oil production was assigned to the cells corresponding to the field location and depth approximately 1 9 trillion cubic feet tcf at standard conditions of mostly solution gas have been produced from the dmg conventional reservoirs his 2017 2020 although some free gas could be released during production accumulate in a newly created gas cap and affect the bulk compressibility and the pressure in the formations there is no evidence of such phenomenon on the contrary solution gas seems to be exhausted quickly and the affected area is small compared to the much larger basin size model therefore the impacts would negligible to the overall pressure evolution in the dmg formations in its entirety 4 4 initial conditions initial conditions of pressure and temperature were estimated using an analysis of initial shut in pressure measurements obtained from drill stem tests the pressure was distributed in the model cells by assuming hydrostatic conditions with a pressure reference point located in the cell with the highest elevation which is a cell close to the outcrop area the initial pressure gradient is 0 49 psi ft 11 08 kpa m fig s10 and table s2 and model initial pressure values range from 174 to 4050 psi 1 2 27 9 mpa geothermal gradient varies with depth we adopted an averaged geothermal gradient of 1 25 f 100 ft 22 75 c km fig s10 and table s2 with a constant surface temperature of 64 f 17 8 c the temperature in the model ranges from 64 f 17 8 c to 167 f 75 c the injected water can be assumed at the temperature of 64 f 17 8 c but is immediately set at thermal equilibrium with the resident water of the cell it is injected into the non isothermal mode of the software is not utilized all gridblocks stay at the same temperature imposed by their depth temperature values vary cell by cell and impact the fluid properties density viscosity compressibility but not the rock properties compressibility porosity permeability the dmg exhibits a large tds range varying from fresh to brackish on the western margins of the db next to where the dmg crops out and the aquifer is recharged this phenomenon is confirmed by meteoric water invasion from the west and north following the general tilt of the region to extremely saline at 300 g l in the east central part of the basin center nicot et al 2020 however many of the historical salinity samples have a poor depth resolution the close proximity of the overlying castile and salado formations would suggest that halite dissolution is the source of the high salinity in the dmg and that the upper sections of the dmg should have a high tds value potentially suggesting regional convective instabilities however if several samples clearly show halite and anhydrite dissolution geochemical arguments strongly suggest that many high salinity samples stem from ochoan evaporative brines nicot et al 2020 supporting the assumption of a density stratified system hiss 1976 we conclude that the salinity distribution correlates approximately with depth and because more accurate data is lacking we derive a linear function to represent salinity variations with depth water is modeled as a mixture of two geochemical components saline water of 900 ppm at the shallowest depth and saline water of 250 000 ppm at the deepest part of the model initial salinity field is modeled as containing variable fractions of these 2 components the unconventional plays in the permian basin produce water with a tds ranging from 20 000 ppm to 200 000 ppm nicot et al 2020 therefore we used a constant injection water salinity of 60 000 ppm which is close to the statistical mode of the data and tested values ranging from 20 000 ppm to 150 000 ppm in the sensitivity analysis gridblock salinity values evolve over time and are controlled by the injection and related flow 4 5 model calibration the actual dmg flow system is in a transient state at a geological time scale as modified permian age evaporative brines are being slowly purged and replaced by meteoric water which in some places is saturated with dissolved halite nicot et al 2020 however for the purpose of this model we considered the system to be at equilibrium prior to injection no flow and density stratified because of the subsurface complexity which includes various feedback loops e g salinity on density and viscosity the initial at equilibrium pressure field with a maximum pressure change 0 5 psi over a period of 100 years is reached by running a long model transient before swd injection starts during the long transient phase the system is considered open to reach full hydrostatic conditions given the initial pressure temperature and salinity conditions calibration of the model is done over the entire model and relies analyzing available surface wellhead injection pressures and convert them into bhps the wellhead flowing pressures range from 0 psi to 3500 psi 0 to 24 1 mpa with an average of 1250 psi 8 6 mpa the bhps were derived using an algorithm by considering head and friction loses 0 2725 psi or 0 18 8 mpa respectively that are estimated by assuming the absolute roughness coefficient of 1 3 10 5 in 2 74 10 5 m for the steel well casing bourgoyne et al 1986 the estimated bhp values range from 850 to 6200 psi 6 0 to 42 8 mpa not all reported wellhead injection pressure data can be directly used in the model because many are clearly inaccurate measurements a typical example is where constant high pressures are recorded for several years despite varying injection rates such anomalous data typically represent maximum permitted pressure not actual injection pressure very detailed and accurate but confidential operator data suggest a strong correlation between wellhead pressure and rate in addition several mechanisms visible on the injection history of individual wells such as change in permeability following a workover are not reflected in the model to account for wellhead injection pressure data globally each dataset was evaluated and assigned a confidence rating with 0 for inaccurate data 0 6 for general consistency with injection rate to 1 for cases with sequences of data with pressure being very consistent with injection rate the inaccurate data are subsequently removed from inclusion in the model the accepted pressure data were converted to estimated bhps and compared to the modeled bhps at the same injection wells there is a total of 15 000 useful data points over time and space taken from 569 out of 1071 available swd wells fig s11 4 6 sensitivity study a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate parameters known to impact pressure behavior each parameter was varied individually without including cross correlation effects table s3 for each simulation case the long transient was run for the system to reach equilibrium before the start of injection porosity horizontal and vertical permeability horizontal permeability anisotropy compressibility temperature gradient formation and injection water salinity are varied within a reasonable range from the base case values in addition scenarios related to the base case conceptual model were also evaluated when there was oil production oil and water production and the capitan reef gridblocks were inactive in the base case and for most of the sensitivity runs no water is produced however a scenario must be considered where some of the water produced from dmg oil and gas reservoirs is disposed in swd wells along with water produced from the underlying unconventional plays rather than reinjected close by for pressure maintenance or waterflooding and thus ignored in the model such is the case for unconventional dmg wells if water is locally reinjected after production the local water cycling has no impact on regional pressures and does not need to be modeled whereas if injected into swd wells this water 1 5 billion barrels needs to be accounted for in the model by being produced with the oil and then injected results of the sensitivity analysis are evaluated using two metrics 1 an illustrative value of the difference in pressure δp between start of injection and last time step rather than the median or average of the entire model impacted by the large number of cells with no pressure changes we use a more robust metric a measure of the maximum pressure increase however rather than using the absolute largest value of all cells the 99th percentile of the cells sorted in increasing δp is chosen in order to avoid outlier effects and 2 the misfit root mean square error value computed as the sum of the square differences between estimated bhps and model results at selected injection wells and at the same monthly time period normalized by the number of data points 5 results results are presented as maps of pressure deviations δp from the initial state fig 4 focusing on the top layers representing the dmg bell canyon cherry canyon and brushy canyon formations the bell canyon and cherry canyon formations have the higher porosity and permeability distribution and therefore have attracted the bulk of field operations and injected water the higher permeability also leads to larger plume sizes but with smaller pressure buildup the bell canyon formation includes more well sorted sandstones and more consistently oriented sandstone channels that extend further into the db the channels have higher porosity and permeability and higher amalgamation ratio connectivity but are somewhat thinner with a median thickness of 900 ft 270 m as opposed to that of the brushy canyon and cherry canyon formations at 1000 ft 330 m for both simulation results show pressure buildups ranging mostly from 100 to 400 psi 0 69 2 76 mpa and locally exceeding 500 psi 3 45 mpa near some injection sites fig 4 and fig s12 high pressure buildups have become more common in recent years due to a dramatic increase in injection volumes the lateral extent of pressure plumes is larger in the bell canyon and cherry canyon formations consistent with the larger volumes of water being injected as these formations have a higher storage capacity smye et al 2021 analyses of estimated bhp values and corresponding modeled pressures indicates that most calibration points fall along or close to the 1 1 line that denotes the best fit to the data fig s13 and fig s14 history matching done for a few wells fig 5 also show a good match between the modeled bhps and the bhps estimated from the field data calculated rmse for those wells range from 100 to 250 psi the sensitivity analysis shows that the pressure increase is sensitive to horizontal permeability and compressibility the two parameters controlling pressure diffusion fig 6 and fig s15 table s3 the horizontal permeability field controls pressure buildup which determines both on plume size and the maximum increase a multiplier of 5x applied uniformly to the permeability field will cause a 30 60 decrease in the pressure buildup whereas a multiplier of 0 2x will lead to an equivalent pressure increase the second most important parameter is compressibility doubling or halving the compressibility of the rock will result in a 30 35 change in pressure buildup the anisotropy of horizontal permeability in either direction will increase pressure differentials by 10 the effects from porosity vertical permeability temperature and salinity are relatively small compared to the above parameters the vertical permeability controls the vertical exchanges between upper and lower layers not the swd with long injection intervals most perforations of the swd wells are in the bell canyon formation followed by the cherry canyon formation and the least in the brushy canyon formation perforated intervals or open borehole completions of most swd wells in the dmg are not long enough to hydraulically connect all three formations fig s16 and fig s17 this situation combined with strong vertical anisotropy translates into vertical differences in pressure buildups results from the scenario with only oil production and water injection indicate that the producing process would as expected lower the pore pressure around production wells and in turn affect the overall pore pressure increase in the dmg even though the overall effects are small differences in pressure buildups about 10 40 psi or 0 07 0 28 mpa compared to the pressure buildup of only injection activities 100 400 psi or 0 7 2 8 mpa fig s15 the results from the scenario with both oil and water production and water injection show that the pressure buildup was reduced by 40 140 psi 0 28 0 97 mpa this scenario represents a limit to low pressure buildup in which we assume that all the water produced from the dmg during the 2010 2020 decade 1 5 billion barrels were reinjected back into the dmg through the swd wells it is not part of the short cycle production and reinjection for pressure maintenance we hypothesized earlier for all dmg water production and ignored in the base case the oil being produced is assumed to be water occupying the same pore volume this is clearly a rough approximation as described in hosseini and nicot 2012 the inclusion of the capitan reef in the model affects somewhat the pore pressure differentials at the edge of the db as much as 20 psi 0 14 mpa at some points however its inclusion does not influence much the overall pressure evolution in the dmg because the main injection centers are away from the model boundaries 6 discussion the model was calibrated avoiding overcalibration through individual well history matching which would fit the data too closely and cannot reflect the overall necessary adjustments of the permeability field it would also be a poor predictor of future pressure distribution the model presents some limitations due to the lack of independent calibration data at dedicated monitoring wells that is time series of pressure data besides injection pressure history at injection wells this combined with the short correlation length of the permeability field 3 miles or 3 gridblocks increases the uncertainty of the pressure modeling results away from the injection centers the somewhat pockmarked nature of the differential pressure maps fig 4 emphasizes this lack of long range pressure attenuation another limitation is whether solution gas is released into the reservoir during production which may also affect the pore pressure in the formations due to its large compressibility operationally however operators are typically engaged in pressure maintenance early in production to avoid gas cap development which would adversely impact oil production dutton et al 2005 therefore we assume that the development of any small gas caps could be neglected in this regional model the model has other approximations the model has no flow boundary conditions including the model top and bottom the impact of intense hydrocarbon and water production from the wolfcamp and bone spring formations in particular from the avalon shale at the top of the bone spring reservoir in the northern sections of the db new mexico are unclear a similar situation arose in the fort worth basin of north texas with the producing barnett shale overlying the disposal interval ellenburger group a pair of studies gave rise to conflicting conclusions about impact of hydrocarbon production or lack thereof gao et al 2021 chen et al 2020 compressibility of the adjacent formations could play a role in attenuating the pressure buildup especially if gas occupies the pore space factors such as oil compressibility which is greater than water have not been accounted for in models the poor oil recovery of such systems combined with the 0 6 billion barrels of oil produced surface conditions 1 billion barrels at reservoir conditions suggests that at least twice that volume of oil remains in place such considerations are outside of the capabilities of a single phase flow model modeling to account for these subsurface conditions would require of the incorporation of two phase flow parameters which currently are poorly constrained at the regional scale the rock units above and below the dmg could be affected by the swd through dissolution or leakage along fractures and fault planes that impact the entire system and possibly enhances anisotropy of the horizontal permeability and reducing the vertical permeability operators have concluded that some bone spring avalon wells produce salt water that is injected into dmg swd wells similarly to what was observed between the barnett shale and the ellenburger of the fort worth basin gao et al 2021 the model results of pressure changes from 100 psi 0 7 mpa to 400 psi 2 8 mpa in some injection areas has brought attention to the possibility of induced seismicity along some existing faults in the study area although previous work peterie et al 2018 gao et al 2021 hennings et al 2021a 2021b and 2021b has shown that seismicity can be induced by pore pressure changes as low as 15 psi 0 1 mpa the modeled regional pressure changes are higher than in many previously studied areas but consistent with the large amount of water injected in a short time span modeled pressure increase in the fort worth basin reaches 200 psi 1 4 mpa gao et al 2021 in oklahoma pressure increases are described as 200 psi 1 4 mpa schoenball et al 2018 despite a larger injection volume however the pressure increase is similar to but lower than that of another injection interval underlying the dmg footprint gao et al 2020 where modeling suggests pressure increases 400 psi 2 8 mpa are not uncommon the alignment of the numerous small graben bounding faults and regional maximum horizontal stress s hmax lund snee and zoback 2017 suggests the faults are prone to reactivation but also that fluid flow along the fault plane could be enhanced because of the increased permeability barton et al 1995 townend and zoback 2000 hennings et al 2012 the presence of faults is implicitly included in the injectivity derived permeability values note that transverse permeability across faults which could lead to pressure compartmentalization when low has not been evaluated charzynski et al 2019 suggested that the numerous normal faults serve as upward pathways for migrating fluid this could lead to the dissolution of the overlying salt deposits creating migration pathways and subsequent pore pressure attenuation in the dmg a positive outcome that would nevertheless negatively affect the geotechnical stability of the impacted volumes with the magnitudes and orientations of in situ stresses within the faulted areas the risk of reactivating existing faults from pore pressure variations can be evaluated by this work nance 2020a notes that the castile formation served as a barrier to the flow of hydrocarbon and guides hydrocarbon sourced from the dmg into cbp reservoirs however this barrier effect might be due to capillary and relative permeability effects rather than solely due to the low permeability of the castile formation nance 2020a also posits that the lack of oil and gas accumulations west of the db midline axis could be due to the absence of the castile seal suggesting that hydrocarbons are dissipated at the surface after migrating up the formation dip this suggests less contrast in vertical and horizontal permeability values than assumed in this model if recent injection trends persist additional salt water needs to be managed through swd wells in dmg formations for the near future scanlon et al 2020b estimated that the volume of future produced water could be up to 250 billion barrels during the productive life of the db the anticipated production suggests the need for efficient management of future swd activities in the injection fields of db with hazard mitigation in mind with our estimation of the current pore pressure changes with swd to date optimization of future injection patterns within allowable injection rates and pressures would be beneficial to swd operators to effectively and safely manage the finite swd resource of the dmg 7 conclusions a model of spatiotemporal evolution of pore pressure in the dmg of the db can be very helpful to understand the initiation of seismic events to assess possible fault reactivation and the causation of anomalous seismicity and to develop estimations of the future hazards from induced seismicity and from regional pore pressure increase to manage the critical swd resources of the region the modeling results indicate that pore pressure increases range from 100 to 400 psi 0 7 2 8 mpa although they could be up to 500 psi 3 5 mpa and higher locally when in close proximity to swd wells pressure increases are large enough to induce strong artesian behavior of potential conduits connecting land surface and dmg and to sustain evaporite dissolution when initiated small pressure increases exist far away from the injection centers due to pressure diffusion pore pressure increases show high vertical variance due to the preferential injection into formations with better rock properties i e bell canyon and cherry canyon formations vs brushy canyon formation the sensitivity analysis shows that pressure buildups are most sensitive to horizontal permeability and compressibility oil and related water production may limit pore pressure increase especially around the production sites salinity of both formation water and injected water has a limited impact on pore pressure differentials presence of the capitan reef does relieve some pressure from the dmg but it does not affect the increase in regional scale pore pressure because it is located at the edge of the db away from most of the injection centers this work can be used for informing swd management of the dmg with increasing volumes of wastewater being injected into the target formations effective and efficient control on the injection rates and patterns

8047,study region a flat large semi arid plateau in the southwest united states west texas and southeast new mexico underlain by a deep paleozoic sedimentary basin the tectonic delaware basin host of intensive hydrocarbon production study focus impacts of injection of large volumes of water produced from oil and gas wells and injected through 1000 disposal wells in particular pressure buildup induced seismicity and their potential consequences in a formation underlying fresh water aquifers but separated from them by thick layers of evaporites the target formation is the delaware mountain group dmg of permian age and consisting of up to 4500 ft 1400 m of mostly fine grained deepwater siliciclastic slope and basin deposits sandstones siltstones and minor limestones a flow model was developed and calibrated from well log data stratigraphic data petrophysical analyses and core data 123 170 mi2 1 1 mi2 grid size complemented with dynamic injectivity information based on surface injection pressures and rates of the disposal wells new hydrological insights for the region injection of 5 8 billion barrels 0 92 billion m3 of waste water has generated regional pressure increases in the dmg mostly in the 100 400 psi 0 7 2 8 mpa range 1 creating strong artesian conditions that combined with the presence of numerous historical boreholes could connect dmg and fresh water aquifers and 2 generating conditions leading to actually observed moderate induced seismicity keywords pore pressure salt water disposal seismicity injection well permian basin 1 introduction the permian basin of west texas and southeast new mexico fig 1 and fig s1 is an important oil producing basin in the southwest region of the usa whose production had been declining until the mid 2000 s but that has seen a strong recovery related to development of unconventional resources unconventional resources include very low permeability rocks such as shales that are typically the source of hydrocarbon accumulations in conventional reservoirs their development was made possible by the concurrent advances in horizontal drilling technology 1 3 km of horizontal section and hydraulic fracturing stimulation during which large amounts of water are injected to fracture the rock and increase its permeability nicot et al 2014 vidic et al 2013 nicot and scanlon 2012 however a well known consequence of unconventional production in the delaware basin db a sub basin of the permian basin is a high water oil ratio amounting to produced water volumes multiple times that of the oil produced scanlon et al 2017 2020b lemons et al 2019 perhaps the highest of any shale play in the usa the produced water volume is also multiple times that of fluids used for hydraulic fracturing but some of it can be reused for fracturing unconventional formations saini and mezei 2016 the permian age delaware mountain group dmg is the major target for produced water disposal the first fully documented salt water disposal swd well was drilled in the early 1980 s however since then many more swd wells have been drilled to service the increased waste disposal needs of a growing oil and gas industry that has increased production from unconventional reservoirs underlying the dmg and that has raised concerns about induced seismicity disposal capacity and pressure increases historically the disposal of waste fluids and seismicity have been shown to be related healy et al 1968 and more recently in basins across the south central usa barnes and halihan 2019 hennings et al 2019 skoumal et al 2018 2019 langenbruch and zoback 2016 the volume of water injected in the dmg a total of 5 8 billion barrels as of december 2019 has been at a historical maximum in recent years fig s2 and exceeds the cumulative volume of fluids injected in other nearby seismic prone areas such as the fort worth basin 2 23 billion barrels gao et al 2021 but is less than the amount injected in oklahoma 11 5 billion barrels scanlon et al 2020b the regional pressure increase can potentially impact the overlying and adjacent aquifers including strings of desert springs such as in the balmorhea texas area uliana et al 2007 robertson et al 2019 through 60 000 oil and gas production wells his 2017 2020 many of which have been abandoned for more than half a century it can favor anthropogenic dissolution of the overlying evaporites and in extreme cases lead to the formation of sinkholes such as observed in the wink sink winkler county in the hendrick oilfield fig 1 kim et al 2019 paine et al 2009 the objective of this study is to provide estimations of pore pressure evolution in the db for use in causal assessment and mitigation of induced seismicity dvory and zoback 2021 morris et al 2021 savvaidis et al 2020 and for management of the dmg as an injection disposal resource in the db including risk assessments as the need for protecting fresh water resources intensifies there is growing interest in understanding proximal water bearing formations underlying fresh water aquifers bloomfield et al 2020 kang et al 2019 we developed a numerical flow model focusing on the pore pressure history of the dmg main injection intervals from 1983 to 2019 the modeling approach is very straightforward in principle and relies on the direct application of darcy s law in a single phase flow system although the study is concerned with water injection rather than withdrawal the detailed stratigraphy of the modeled formations allowed the development of a conceptual model for flow parameters somewhat balancing data scarcity in addition we introduce the concept of using injection pressure and injection rate whose ratio is injectivity or specific capacity as a means to develop the model permeability field because of the lack of wells dedicated to pressure and head monitoring we instead use injection pressure at the ground surface to calibrate the regional model the long term sustainability of such a large regional injection scheme has been raised and some operators are turning to water recycling or beneficial use after treatment instead of injection as a means to dispose of the produced water scanlon et al 2020a 2 geological background 2 1 geological setting covering an area of 10 000 mi2 25 000 km2 with surface elevations ranging from 3000 4500 ft amsl 1000 1400 m amsl the db is a sub basin of the permian basin province of west texas and southeast new mexico the db and its flanks have been affected by several extensional and contractional tectonic events cumulatively leading to the present day tectonic fabric horne et al 2021 and references therein paleozoic sediments rest on a proterozoic basement and the oldest sediments in what would become the db are mostly carbonate platform deposits of ordovician to devonian age fig s3 the thickness of paleozoic sediments to the pennsylvanian varies around 8000 ft 2400 m and the basin fill is more than 20 000 ft 6 km thick at its deepest fig s4 the surface topography of the db is a flat plateau with moderate topography in the west guadalupe and delaware mountains and south apache and davis mountains and a slope dipping gently to the east and southeast subsidence in the db was most active during the early permian the thick permian age strata are named in order of decreasing age wolfcampian leonardian guadalupian and ochoan fig s3 the cumulative thickness of the permian deposits can be as high as 15 000 ft 4500 m in the main depocenters but less than half of that thickness along some of its margins the db was quiescent during most of the mesozoic but some minor triassic age lacustrine deposits dockum and clastic and carbonate sediments related to the cretaceous transgression western interior seaway are preserved much of these more recent sediments have been eroded owing to the neogene tilting of the texas craton which includes the db that exposed the western margin of the permian basin brown 2019 anon 2019 cenozoic alluvium pecos valley alluvium locally very thick is derived from prior salt dissolution and related subsidence and these sediments are capped by aeolian deposits the main structural features of the db were in place by the end of the permian with 1 reverse upwardly attenuating thrust faults with nnw sse strike on the db s eastern margin separating it from the central basin platform cbp 2 development during the guadalupian and coeval of the dmg deposition of an important reefal system ringing most of the db the capitan reef complex whose core is made of massive carbonates and 3 an e w structural feature variously called the mid basin high grisham arch or grisham fault zone south of loving county that displaces all formations older than the leonardian bone spring formation van der loop 2017 basement rooted faults often with large throws die out upward into the wolfcamp before they reach the dmg horne et al 2021 two important tectonic events occurred in the cenozoic 1 regional uplift during the laramide orogeny 60 ma and 2 tilting due to basin and range tectonics 10 20 ma sinclair 2007 these two events did not fundamentally change the structure of the db but altered the dynamics of fluid flow within it note that although the cbp was exposed and its carbonates underwent multiple episodes of karstification and erosion during the permian the db basinal sediments of permian age were not exposed until these cenozoic events 2 2 the permian period and delaware mountain group permian deposits all marine in origin are coarser clastics with infrequent depositional carbonates transitioning from the mudstone rich facies in the wolfcamp formation to the clastic and carbonate rich leonardian bone spring formation to the mostly silty and sandy guadalupian dmg and capped by thick ochoan evaporitic deposits mostly anhydrite of the castile formation and mostly halite of the salado formation fig s3 the wolfcamp formation lies conformably on pennsylvanian shales and consists mostly of silica rich mudstones the wolfcamp formation represents the primary interval currently targeted by oil and gas operators bone spring sediments conformably overlie wolfcamp sediments and consist of alternating siliciclastic intervals also often targeted by operators and more carbonate rich intervals because the bone spring formation was deposited in a more quiescent basin already filled with sediments its thickness is more uniform across the db with an estimated average thickness of 3000 ft 900 m dmg sediments represent the unconformable continuation of the bone spring sedimentation with much less abundant carbonates and consist mostly of initially clay poor arkosic to subarkosic siltstones and fine sandstones with minor detrital carbonates dutton 2008 nance 2020a smye et al 2021 the transition to the dmg at the top of the bone spring formation is marked by fine grained intervals carbonate mass transport deposits with increasing organic rich siltstones collectively named the cutoff shale one of them the avalon shale is targeted by operators in new mexico hurd et al 2018 carr 2019 smye et al 2021 the dmg is traditionally divided into three units increasing overall permeability and in ascending stratigraphic order are the brushy canyon cherry canyon and bell canyon formations the dmg cumulative thickness can be up to 4500 ft 1400 m in the db mid section but decreases to 2000 ft 600 m at its northern and southern edges the sediment deposition mechanisms have been described as lowstand turbidity currents transporting and distributing siliciclastic sediments from the platforms to the db in fan complexes and as debris flows of carbonates taken from the exposed platforms or outer shelf back reef deposits smye et al 2021 nance 2020a the abundant sometimes organic rich siltstones are interpreted as starved transgressive to highstand eolian or suspension deposits smye et al 2021 nance 2020a dutton et al 2005 numerous sea level fluctuations generated the interspersed nature of siltstones and sandstones proximal deposits are channelized whereas distal deposits are more sheet like with a low degree of amalgamation or sand on sand contact zhang et al 2017 as stratigraphically distinct successions of highstand sands are disconnected by intervening lowstand siltstones suggesting unfavorable vertical connectivity smye et al 2021 examination of net sand maps shows a clockwise rotation of the main fairway trends from the northern margin ns channels of the brushy canyon to the eastern margin ns and ew channels in the cherry canyon and ne sw channels in the bell canyon in which formation they extend far into the db smye et al 2021 nance 2020a net sand volumes average 46 68 and 70 for the brushy canyon cherry canyon and bell canyon respectively but carbonate dominates on the db margins smye et al 2021 the brushy canyon has been described as containing coarser sandstones but because of a lack of sorting and of post deposition diagenesis its porosity and permeability are lower overall than that the finer but better sorted overlying formations carbonate units are rare in the brushy canyon but become abundant upwards with more extensive and laterally continuous intervals in the bell canyon compartmentalizing the formation horizontally some such as the lamar limestone member at the top of the bell canyon and the manzanita member at the top of the brushy canyon can be traced basin wide king 1948 hampton 1989 the dmg formations were partly exhumed during regional tilting in the neogene and crop out in the delaware mountains to the west of the db on an along strike length of 50 miles 80 km the dmg is impacted by many shallow normal faults with small throws that delineate small grabens staniewicz et al 2020 charzynski et al 2019 these faults are not believed to have a significant impact on regional flow the overall prograding capitan reef complex marks the transition between basinal and shelf sediments almost completely encircles the db and is approximately coeval of the bell canyon fig s5 the eastern arm of the reef along the cbp is mostly buried except to the south of the db where it crops out in the glass mountains to the north crossing into new mexico the capitan reef is shallow and host of a fresh water aquifer and then emerges in the guadalupe mountains as the main surface expression of the western arm of the reef standen et al 2009 hiss 1976 the large late cretaceous fault that uplifted the guadalupe mountains border fault during the laramide orogeny dropped the remainder of the western arm deep into the subsurface except locally in the patterson hills and apache mountains until it disappears across from the glass mountains completing the horseshoe shape of the reef complex and leaving open the channel linking the db to the open ocean the backreef debris toward the platform and the shelf sediments are generally described as fractured and of good permeability whereas the carbonate debris of the forereef are understood as more compact and of lower permeability nance 2020a the castile formation is restricted to the db proper but younger formations of the ochoan series salado rustler and dewey lake formations extend outside of it the anhydrite of the castile has a sharp but conformable transition with the top of the bell canyon formation it has a basal limestone towards the margins of the db interbedded halite is frequent in the castile the salt from the salado formation halite with frequent sylvite and other complex evaporite minerals is the thickest in lea county in new mexico and along the eastern side of the db but is barely present in the western half of the db due to active dissolution by meteoric water it has also been considerably thinned along the footprint of the capitan reef on the eastern margins of the db allowing for the deposition of the thick cenozoic pecos valley alluvium 2 3 hydrogeology and oil and gas production several studies have investigated the general features of groundwater flow in the dmg under natural conditions others studies have been narrowly focused on producing reservoirs dutton et al 2005 although the wolfcamp formation and part of the bone spring formation and of the underlying pennsylvanian formation have been described as strongly overpressured rittenhouse et al 2017 bryndzia et al 2019 strata younger than guadalupian including the dmg and capitan reef are normally pressured but some sections can be under artesian conditions knowles and lang 1947 hiss 1976 1980 uplift and tilting had an important impact on regional hydrogeological flow in the db flow in all normally pressured formations is currently towards the south and east driven by the general topographic slope of the permian basin nicot 2021 the tilting initiated the flow of water that had been nearly static or flowed slowly in a flat terrane for millions of years e g ferguson et al 2018 this tectonic activity promoted recharge in units exposed along the western edge of the db e g lee and williams 2000 the western margin of the db can be recharged through the fractured capitan reef and the dmg outcrop as evidenced by low tds formation water natural secular flow in the dmg is generally described as very slow and directed towards the east and southeast hiss 1980 sharp 2001 the salinity of the dmg is highly variable from fresh to hypersaline but spatially structured see later sections for full discussion salinity from oil fields can reach up to 250 000 ppm west texas geological society wtgs 1982 historical papers and reports with data on the dmg mcneal 1965 twdb texas water development board 1972 zaengle 1995 show large spatial contrasts in tds with lower tds in the western side of the db increasing to high values adjacent the cbp and reverting to low values on the guadalupian carbonates of the cbp aquifers with fresh to brackish water are present in the ochoan rustler and dewey lake formations and also include the triassic dockum aquifer the cretaceous edwards trinity aquifer and the cenozoic pecos valley aquifer as well as the guadalupian capitan reef depending on their locations and access to the end users all these aquifers are used as water source by oil and gas operators and is the carrier fluid for hydraulic fracturing stimulations the capitan reef aquifer and dmg are in direct contact with each other the hydrodynamic nature and degree of interconnectivity at the margins of permian basin is an important consideration for modeling pore pressure the northern section of the capitan reef is an important aquifer for the city of carlsbad and eddy county in new mexico the capitan aquifer fig 1 and is recharged in the guadalupe mountains where the ancient reef crops out the eastern arm of capitan reef is well hydraulically connected to the shelf deposits through permeable backreef sediments but connection is intermittent with the basinal deposits because of the low permeability of the forereef sediments for example the large hendrick oil field in winkler county located on the cbp fig 1 produces low tds water and has been shown to be hydraulically connected to the capitan reef hiss 1976 hiss 1976 noted a slight decrease in the potentiometric surface of dmg wells between 1920 and 1970 he hypothesized that oil and water production from reservoirs on the cbp and northern shelf hydraulically connected with the capitan reef caused the pressure decrease large produced water volumes ultimately withdrawn indirectly from the capitan aquifer were compounded by large volumes of water directly withdrawn from it for waterflooding purposes up to the 1960 s overall withdrawals were large enough to reverse flow directions in the capitan aquifer with a current pressure deficit centered on winkler county hiss 1976 sharp 2001 uliana 2001 this strong pressure signal was apparently detected in historical dmg potentiometric measurements hiss 1976 this would suggest hydraulic communication and potential attenuation of excess pressure in the dmg if it bled into the capitan reef however many wells in the capitan reef on the eastern arm are in recovery mode jones 2014 with increasing water levels that cannot be discerned from pressure bleeding related to water injection in the dmg an examination of recent water level measurements in a limited number of capitan reef water wells with acceptable time series 28 wells do not show a recent change in their long term trends but these measurements do not necessarily suggest there are not potential active exchanges historical conventional oil and gas production targeted mostly dmg sandstone reservoirs starting in the 1920 s with associated forays into bone spring pennsylvanian devonian and ellenburger reservoirs since the 1980 s a total of 9000 wells have been drilled with 4000 are still active fig s6 and fig s7 wells were principally located along the eastern and northern margins of the db nance 2020a with the greatest production coming from wells in the bell canyon dutton et al 2003 then the cherry canyon and lastly the brushy canyon annual oil production from the dmg increased steadily from the 1950 s to late 2010 s with a peak of 20 million barrels in 2015 cumulative production of 600 million barrels cumulative production in the dmg using conventional methods was estimated to be 350 million barrels in the early 2000 s at the onset of the shale revolution in the db dutton et al 2005 potter et al 2020 that is cumulative oil production of 250 million barrels in the dmg occurs in parallel to injection activities in the 2010 s along with the development of the underlying reservoirs in the wolfcamp and bone spring formations operators added low permeability organic rich self sourced siltstones to their targets which contributed significantly to the 2015 production peak eia 2020 wolfcamp and bone spring unconventional development provides most of the current production in the db 10 000 hydraulically fractured wells a significant consequence of db unconventional operations is the high water oil ratio as high as 3 vol vol nicot et al 2020 scanlon et al 2017 these volumes are much higher than in the neighboring midland basin and many other unconventional plays this produced water represents a significant technical and economic challenge to the industry as it now faces increased induced seismicity frohlich et al 2020 schultz et al 2020 potential overpressure and diminishing storage capacity scanlon et al 2020b gogri et al 2018 the very low permeability of the producing formations does not favor reinjection of the produced water instead the bulk of produced water from unconventionals is injected into dmg formations the cumulative saltwater volume disposed into more than 1000 dmg swd wells reached 5 6 billion barrels by december 2019 water production from conventional dmg reservoirs 3 4 billion barrels to date follows the typical model of increasing water cut fraction of water in the produced fluids as production matures with most of the water being reinjected into the reservoir for pressure maintenance it follows that overall pressure changes are only due to hydrocarbon production and that this short path water cycle can be neglected an important caveat relates to 400 dmg wells that can be considered unconventional and have produced 0 42 billion barrels of water by december 2019 which are counted in the 5 8 billion barrels of water injected into dmg formations through swd wells most of these wells are in lea and eddy counties in new mexico most of the sand hosted dmg reservoirs are described as oil reservoirs with no gas cap at discovery and having a relatively quickly exhausted solution gas drive galloway et al 1983 dutton et al 2005 nance 2020a suggesting poor connection to the surrounding aquifer and potentially some pore space with depleted pressures this was confirmed by sharp pressure drops over the local areas surrounding oil fields hiss 1976 there is no recent measurement available to assess the degree of pressure recovery after production has ceased nance 2020a stated that oil recovery efficiency is 15 in most reservoirs even with secondary recovery because of the complex geometry of the reservoir and of the lack of a sustained driving mechanism in general slope and basin systems such as the dmg host reservoirs with the poorest sweep efficiency some reservoirs underwent successful tertiary recovery co2 floods potter et al 2020 although the overall recovery efficiency remained low ford geraldine field which produced 30 million barrels from the upper part of the bell canyon is the largest dmg field in the db with an original oil in place of 100 million barrels dutton et al 1998 fields close to the cbp and along the eastern boundary of the db are described as having a water drive likely related to the nearby capitan reef the fact that very few oil reservoirs are known to be present in the capitan reef nance 2020b does not negate water exchanges between the capitan reef and dmg as two phase flow dynamics dictates that flow of the non wetting phase oil can be impeded while that of the wetting phase water is not 3 data source summary the construction of the flow model is a three step process step 1 is the development of the quality controlled database of injection well data as described below in specific support of this research smye et al 2021 provide step 2 the dmg reservoir description which was used to construct a geocellular model the geocellular model has the stratigraphic structure of the model through correlation of geophysical logs for 1090 wells his 2017 2020 distributed across the db fig 2 porosity values were also extracted from a subset of the same dataset 327 wells in step 3 porosity values were upscaled in the geocellular model and implemented in the flow model proper to populate the grids swd well monthly injection volumes and average wellhead pressures were obtained from the state oil and gas regulatory agency the railroad commission of texas rrc h 10 forms and from enerdeq ihs markit the data were quality controlled building on previous experience gao et al 2021 lemons et al 2017 note that because operators report well operation data only once a year there is a lag of about 15 months until this information can be considered complete in addition rrc provided 23 files with bottom hole pressure bhp and step rate test results the bhp information is used to confirm the initial pressure gradient in the model permeability data were also collected from historical publications on individual oil reservoirs over 80 fields in dmg and from the analysis of this data from which a porosity permeability transform was derived smye et al 2021 dutton et al 2005 additional data were taken from recently drilled rrc swd permit files a total of 15 step rate tests were used to estimate permeability physical characteristics of the swd wells such as perforated intervals open hole or cased status and tubing dimensions were sourced from enerdeq ihs markit compressibilities were estimated from the data in literature guided by rrc data temperature data were extracted from measured downhole values his 2017 2020 salinity data was obtained from public domain sources 1 usgs produced waters database blondes et al 2018 containing 350 dmg historical samples mostly collected in the 1960 s and 1970 s along the margins of the db and 2 new mexico water and infrastructure data system cather et al 2016 which recently disseminated a snapshot of produced water geochemistry from 2014 to 15 650 dmg samples as well as recent data points from nicot et al 2020 oil and gas production history production well locations and target intervals were extracted from his 2017 2020 4 model construction and methods 4 1 model structure the area of interest covers the entirety of the db and the model targets the dmg and capitan reef formations it includes whole or parts of eight counties in west texas and two counties lea and eddy in southeast new mexico fig 1 the areal extent is constrained by the structural boundaries of the db capitan reef complex to the east and to the north and dmg outcrop to the west all side boundaries are assumed no flow which is a suitable assumption for a model of this large extent and the nature of the boundaries most of the injection occurs in the eastern half of the db not far from the high permeability capitan reef whose proximity could buffer the model pressure variations in that area and that is akin to the traditional approach of modeling water drive reservoirs e g van everdingen hurst model the impacts of the capitan reef are analyzed in the sensitivity analysis section no faults are in the model even though they exist in the dmg hennings et al 2021a 2021b and 2021b but many are minor with small throws compared to the thickness of the modeled units and of uncertain properties they are not believed to have caused significant offsets of the model layers or to limit transverse flow because of the general absence of clay minerals that might reduce across fault transmissibility ortiz et al 2019 however anecdotal information operators suggest transmissive flow parallel to the fault planes anisotropy possibly created by fault parallel permeability enhancement is not studied here but this work is important input to more advanced analysis the top of the model domain is the top of the bell canyon formation or equivalently the bottom of the castile formation the bottom of the model domain is the bottom of the brushy canyon formation or equivalently the top of the bone spring formation cutoff shale for the purpose of this model top and bottom boundaries are assumed to be no flow because of the significant contrast in matrix permeability geochemical observations of water of clear meteoric origin on the western side of the db show that recharge has occurred in the recent past and could be currently occurring however the recharge rate is too low to play a role for the short timeframe considered in this model no study of recharge to the dmg exists but an overlying aquifer with a similar footprint and outcrop located in the same general area rustler aquifer has been attributed a recharge of 3 mm year or less ewing et al 2012 for the purpose of establishing the layering for the flow model the geocellular model was constructed using the petrel software v 2019 4 schlumberger 2019 a total of 1090 wells were used to correlate formation tops over the 20 000 mi2 of the study area smye et al 2021 the three dmg formations bell canyon cherry canyon and brushy canyon were identified through these correlated tops formation thicknesses vary from the edge to the center of the db and they also pinch out completely at some locations three lithologies sandstone siltstone and carbonate were defined in the model the computer modelling group s cmg modeling package cmg stars v 2019 10 computer modeling group cmg 2019 was used to simulate pore pressure history the code computes fluid properties such as viscosity and density as a function of temperature pressure and salinity the model output is pressure rather than head because of the variable salinity and therefore of the variable water density e g langevin and guo 2006 the model has 18 layers for the three dmg formations each formation is arbitrarily split into 6 layers of equivalent thickness in order to accommodate many short perforated swd intervals as well as 12 layers for the capitan reef the corner point grid is 123 170 mi2 198 274 km2 with 123 170 30 cells of approximately 1 1 mi2 1 6 1 6 km2 and includes 215 621 active cells the average cell thickness is 163 ft 50 m and the thickness of 85 the cells around the median ranges from 70 to 278 ft 21 85 m grid cells are aligned in the y direction with one of the main structural directions nnw sse that makes the eastern boundary with the cbp perpendicular structure x direction is the high permeability channels of the bell canyon and cherry canyon and which is also aligned with the smaller faults 4 2 property distribution the porosity and permeability fields fig 3 and fig s8 were constructed in the petrel software a total of 334 wells with relevant petrophysical logs were used to model the porosity field through geostatistical analysis and sequential gaussian simulation permeability values were obtained through a more elaborate workflow making use of the measured porosity the injectivity of swd wells the porosity values from log interpretation range from 10 to 25 for sandstones from 5 to 10 for siltstones and are less than 5 for carbonates smye et al 2021 well log data 0 5 ft or 15 cm vertical resolution were upscaled in the geocellular model and extended across the entire layer through geostatistical and sequential gaussian simulation modeling spherical model with a small nugget effect low variance and 2 10 miles 3 2 16 km range overall lithologies can be continuous over long distances at the regional scale siltstone drapes carbonate members channel sandstones which suggests a large geostatistical range at least before upscaling but also can be variable at the local scale which suggests a high nugget effect we opted to keep a relatively small nugget effect to avoid convergence problems when some of the hundreds of injection wells about which little is known are located in a randomly assigned low permeability cell porosity values estimated from well logs show differences with respect to the three dmg formations average porosity by formation are shown in table s1 with a global average of 9 most cells were assigned a porosity between 3 and 15 but locally porosity can be 20 the mean porosity of bell canyon and cherry canyon formation is higher than that of the brushy canyon formation there are two contributions to the permeability field 1 the porosity permeability transform based on the log derived porosity and core analysis and 2 the estimated injectivity derived permeability from available flowing well head pressure and flow rate history from swd wells fig s9 note that there is no overlap between the two well sets a porosity permeability transform was developed with more than 9000 data points smye et al 2021 it was observed that the relationship persists across variations in texture and facies the porosity permeability relationship can be used as a permeability index the permeability field upscaled from the index values was complemented by larger scale permeability values estimated from injection rate and swd well head pressure from 594 out of 1008 wells and step rate tests obtained from the rrc the second dataset of injectivity derived permeability lacks the vertical resolution provided by the petrophysical study but reflects the field permeability that best accommodates the injection rate the injectivity derived permeability was estimated by assuming steady state flow conditions constant water viscosity of 1 centipoise 1 kpa s constant effective radius of 1000 ft 304 8 m and wellbore radius of 0 25 ft 0 076 m these permeability values were added to the model at control points swd wells accounting that swd well locations are biased towards higher permeability zones the use of injectivity or specific capacity is not uncommon in developing flow models of regional aquifers e g nicot et al 2013 but is typically used to complement results from more traditional pump tests in areas with a lack of well data in this study the approach is applied to the entire model using high volume injection wells the final uncalibrated permeability field was then generated by co kriging with the porosity field average permeability by formation varies within a limited range and overall average permeability is 18 md 1000 md or 1d corresponds to a hydraulic conductivity of 0 86 m day typical values range from 0 4 to 200 md for 99 of the cells with very few cells 1d overall permeability values in the bell canyon and cherry canyon formations are higher than that in brushy canyon formation table s1 however the base case model does not assume horizontal permeability anisotropy little vertical communication at the regional scale was assumed in the base case with vertical permeability 10 of the horizontal permeability the rationale is two fold 1 the presence of extensive low permeability carbonate layers at the regional scale between the brushy canyon and cherry canyon and between the cherry canyon and the bell canyon and 2 the strong stratification of the sediments at the bed level as well as the poor degree of amalgamation at various scales smye et al 2021 dutton et al 1998 given the magnitude of pore pressure modeled it is likely that injection will cause hydraulic fracturing near wells with a high injection rate which would increase vertical communication these results can be used to address this phenomenon base case pore compressibility of the rock formations in the dmg a component of the storage coefficient was calculated to be 7 5 10 6 psi 1 1 09 gpa 1 dutton et al 1998 ford geraldine field based on a 9 average porosity this value is consistent with other studies e g 5 12 10 6 psi 1 or 0 74 gpa 1 from hall 1953 9 79 10 6 psi 1 or 1 42 gpa 1 from newman 1973 the salinity distribution is discussed in the initial conditions section 4 3 fluid budget the db has a long history of oil and gas production both from dmg conventional and unconventional reservoirs and from underlying unconventional reservoirs mainly bone spring and wolfcamp formations most produced water from conventional reservoirs was reinjected into the same formations for pressure maintenance or waterflooding lemons et al 2019 in this study we assumed that conventional water production and injection cancelled each other at the spatiotemporal scale of the model and they are not further considered although an unknown amount of produced water may have been pumped into evaporation pits before the 1950 s however water production through dmg unconventional wells amounts to 0 42 billion barrels and must be accounted for in the model a total of 1071 swd wells within the modeled area have injected 5 8 billion barrels of water from january 1983 to december 2019 the last month with complete data for analysis typical injection rates range from 1000 to 8000 barrel day with high rate wells injecting more than 60 000 barrel day into the bell canyon formation some wells have low average injection rates 300 barrel day most perforations of the swd wells are completed in the bell canyon formation followed by the cherry canyon formation and fewer wells still in the brushy canyon formation cumulative oil production from the dmg is 0 6 billion barrels at surface conditions with no associated gas and this volume is large enough to be included in the flow model the oil density from most dmg fields is generally 38 42 api gravity west texas geological society wtgs 1982 using 39 api nance 2020a and assuming solution gas is methane and the initial gas oil ratio is 4000 ft3 barrel at standard conditions his 2017 2020 the equivalent reservoir volume of 1 barrel oil produced at the surface is 1 6 barrel in the subsurface oil production was assigned to the cells corresponding to the field location and depth approximately 1 9 trillion cubic feet tcf at standard conditions of mostly solution gas have been produced from the dmg conventional reservoirs his 2017 2020 although some free gas could be released during production accumulate in a newly created gas cap and affect the bulk compressibility and the pressure in the formations there is no evidence of such phenomenon on the contrary solution gas seems to be exhausted quickly and the affected area is small compared to the much larger basin size model therefore the impacts would negligible to the overall pressure evolution in the dmg formations in its entirety 4 4 initial conditions initial conditions of pressure and temperature were estimated using an analysis of initial shut in pressure measurements obtained from drill stem tests the pressure was distributed in the model cells by assuming hydrostatic conditions with a pressure reference point located in the cell with the highest elevation which is a cell close to the outcrop area the initial pressure gradient is 0 49 psi ft 11 08 kpa m fig s10 and table s2 and model initial pressure values range from 174 to 4050 psi 1 2 27 9 mpa geothermal gradient varies with depth we adopted an averaged geothermal gradient of 1 25 f 100 ft 22 75 c km fig s10 and table s2 with a constant surface temperature of 64 f 17 8 c the temperature in the model ranges from 64 f 17 8 c to 167 f 75 c the injected water can be assumed at the temperature of 64 f 17 8 c but is immediately set at thermal equilibrium with the resident water of the cell it is injected into the non isothermal mode of the software is not utilized all gridblocks stay at the same temperature imposed by their depth temperature values vary cell by cell and impact the fluid properties density viscosity compressibility but not the rock properties compressibility porosity permeability the dmg exhibits a large tds range varying from fresh to brackish on the western margins of the db next to where the dmg crops out and the aquifer is recharged this phenomenon is confirmed by meteoric water invasion from the west and north following the general tilt of the region to extremely saline at 300 g l in the east central part of the basin center nicot et al 2020 however many of the historical salinity samples have a poor depth resolution the close proximity of the overlying castile and salado formations would suggest that halite dissolution is the source of the high salinity in the dmg and that the upper sections of the dmg should have a high tds value potentially suggesting regional convective instabilities however if several samples clearly show halite and anhydrite dissolution geochemical arguments strongly suggest that many high salinity samples stem from ochoan evaporative brines nicot et al 2020 supporting the assumption of a density stratified system hiss 1976 we conclude that the salinity distribution correlates approximately with depth and because more accurate data is lacking we derive a linear function to represent salinity variations with depth water is modeled as a mixture of two geochemical components saline water of 900 ppm at the shallowest depth and saline water of 250 000 ppm at the deepest part of the model initial salinity field is modeled as containing variable fractions of these 2 components the unconventional plays in the permian basin produce water with a tds ranging from 20 000 ppm to 200 000 ppm nicot et al 2020 therefore we used a constant injection water salinity of 60 000 ppm which is close to the statistical mode of the data and tested values ranging from 20 000 ppm to 150 000 ppm in the sensitivity analysis gridblock salinity values evolve over time and are controlled by the injection and related flow 4 5 model calibration the actual dmg flow system is in a transient state at a geological time scale as modified permian age evaporative brines are being slowly purged and replaced by meteoric water which in some places is saturated with dissolved halite nicot et al 2020 however for the purpose of this model we considered the system to be at equilibrium prior to injection no flow and density stratified because of the subsurface complexity which includes various feedback loops e g salinity on density and viscosity the initial at equilibrium pressure field with a maximum pressure change 0 5 psi over a period of 100 years is reached by running a long model transient before swd injection starts during the long transient phase the system is considered open to reach full hydrostatic conditions given the initial pressure temperature and salinity conditions calibration of the model is done over the entire model and relies analyzing available surface wellhead injection pressures and convert them into bhps the wellhead flowing pressures range from 0 psi to 3500 psi 0 to 24 1 mpa with an average of 1250 psi 8 6 mpa the bhps were derived using an algorithm by considering head and friction loses 0 2725 psi or 0 18 8 mpa respectively that are estimated by assuming the absolute roughness coefficient of 1 3 10 5 in 2 74 10 5 m for the steel well casing bourgoyne et al 1986 the estimated bhp values range from 850 to 6200 psi 6 0 to 42 8 mpa not all reported wellhead injection pressure data can be directly used in the model because many are clearly inaccurate measurements a typical example is where constant high pressures are recorded for several years despite varying injection rates such anomalous data typically represent maximum permitted pressure not actual injection pressure very detailed and accurate but confidential operator data suggest a strong correlation between wellhead pressure and rate in addition several mechanisms visible on the injection history of individual wells such as change in permeability following a workover are not reflected in the model to account for wellhead injection pressure data globally each dataset was evaluated and assigned a confidence rating with 0 for inaccurate data 0 6 for general consistency with injection rate to 1 for cases with sequences of data with pressure being very consistent with injection rate the inaccurate data are subsequently removed from inclusion in the model the accepted pressure data were converted to estimated bhps and compared to the modeled bhps at the same injection wells there is a total of 15 000 useful data points over time and space taken from 569 out of 1071 available swd wells fig s11 4 6 sensitivity study a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate parameters known to impact pressure behavior each parameter was varied individually without including cross correlation effects table s3 for each simulation case the long transient was run for the system to reach equilibrium before the start of injection porosity horizontal and vertical permeability horizontal permeability anisotropy compressibility temperature gradient formation and injection water salinity are varied within a reasonable range from the base case values in addition scenarios related to the base case conceptual model were also evaluated when there was oil production oil and water production and the capitan reef gridblocks were inactive in the base case and for most of the sensitivity runs no water is produced however a scenario must be considered where some of the water produced from dmg oil and gas reservoirs is disposed in swd wells along with water produced from the underlying unconventional plays rather than reinjected close by for pressure maintenance or waterflooding and thus ignored in the model such is the case for unconventional dmg wells if water is locally reinjected after production the local water cycling has no impact on regional pressures and does not need to be modeled whereas if injected into swd wells this water 1 5 billion barrels needs to be accounted for in the model by being produced with the oil and then injected results of the sensitivity analysis are evaluated using two metrics 1 an illustrative value of the difference in pressure δp between start of injection and last time step rather than the median or average of the entire model impacted by the large number of cells with no pressure changes we use a more robust metric a measure of the maximum pressure increase however rather than using the absolute largest value of all cells the 99th percentile of the cells sorted in increasing δp is chosen in order to avoid outlier effects and 2 the misfit root mean square error value computed as the sum of the square differences between estimated bhps and model results at selected injection wells and at the same monthly time period normalized by the number of data points 5 results results are presented as maps of pressure deviations δp from the initial state fig 4 focusing on the top layers representing the dmg bell canyon cherry canyon and brushy canyon formations the bell canyon and cherry canyon formations have the higher porosity and permeability distribution and therefore have attracted the bulk of field operations and injected water the higher permeability also leads to larger plume sizes but with smaller pressure buildup the bell canyon formation includes more well sorted sandstones and more consistently oriented sandstone channels that extend further into the db the channels have higher porosity and permeability and higher amalgamation ratio connectivity but are somewhat thinner with a median thickness of 900 ft 270 m as opposed to that of the brushy canyon and cherry canyon formations at 1000 ft 330 m for both simulation results show pressure buildups ranging mostly from 100 to 400 psi 0 69 2 76 mpa and locally exceeding 500 psi 3 45 mpa near some injection sites fig 4 and fig s12 high pressure buildups have become more common in recent years due to a dramatic increase in injection volumes the lateral extent of pressure plumes is larger in the bell canyon and cherry canyon formations consistent with the larger volumes of water being injected as these formations have a higher storage capacity smye et al 2021 analyses of estimated bhp values and corresponding modeled pressures indicates that most calibration points fall along or close to the 1 1 line that denotes the best fit to the data fig s13 and fig s14 history matching done for a few wells fig 5 also show a good match between the modeled bhps and the bhps estimated from the field data calculated rmse for those wells range from 100 to 250 psi the sensitivity analysis shows that the pressure increase is sensitive to horizontal permeability and compressibility the two parameters controlling pressure diffusion fig 6 and fig s15 table s3 the horizontal permeability field controls pressure buildup which determines both on plume size and the maximum increase a multiplier of 5x applied uniformly to the permeability field will cause a 30 60 decrease in the pressure buildup whereas a multiplier of 0 2x will lead to an equivalent pressure increase the second most important parameter is compressibility doubling or halving the compressibility of the rock will result in a 30 35 change in pressure buildup the anisotropy of horizontal permeability in either direction will increase pressure differentials by 10 the effects from porosity vertical permeability temperature and salinity are relatively small compared to the above parameters the vertical permeability controls the vertical exchanges between upper and lower layers not the swd with long injection intervals most perforations of the swd wells are in the bell canyon formation followed by the cherry canyon formation and the least in the brushy canyon formation perforated intervals or open borehole completions of most swd wells in the dmg are not long enough to hydraulically connect all three formations fig s16 and fig s17 this situation combined with strong vertical anisotropy translates into vertical differences in pressure buildups results from the scenario with only oil production and water injection indicate that the producing process would as expected lower the pore pressure around production wells and in turn affect the overall pore pressure increase in the dmg even though the overall effects are small differences in pressure buildups about 10 40 psi or 0 07 0 28 mpa compared to the pressure buildup of only injection activities 100 400 psi or 0 7 2 8 mpa fig s15 the results from the scenario with both oil and water production and water injection show that the pressure buildup was reduced by 40 140 psi 0 28 0 97 mpa this scenario represents a limit to low pressure buildup in which we assume that all the water produced from the dmg during the 2010 2020 decade 1 5 billion barrels were reinjected back into the dmg through the swd wells it is not part of the short cycle production and reinjection for pressure maintenance we hypothesized earlier for all dmg water production and ignored in the base case the oil being produced is assumed to be water occupying the same pore volume this is clearly a rough approximation as described in hosseini and nicot 2012 the inclusion of the capitan reef in the model affects somewhat the pore pressure differentials at the edge of the db as much as 20 psi 0 14 mpa at some points however its inclusion does not influence much the overall pressure evolution in the dmg because the main injection centers are away from the model boundaries 6 discussion the model was calibrated avoiding overcalibration through individual well history matching which would fit the data too closely and cannot reflect the overall necessary adjustments of the permeability field it would also be a poor predictor of future pressure distribution the model presents some limitations due to the lack of independent calibration data at dedicated monitoring wells that is time series of pressure data besides injection pressure history at injection wells this combined with the short correlation length of the permeability field 3 miles or 3 gridblocks increases the uncertainty of the pressure modeling results away from the injection centers the somewhat pockmarked nature of the differential pressure maps fig 4 emphasizes this lack of long range pressure attenuation another limitation is whether solution gas is released into the reservoir during production which may also affect the pore pressure in the formations due to its large compressibility operationally however operators are typically engaged in pressure maintenance early in production to avoid gas cap development which would adversely impact oil production dutton et al 2005 therefore we assume that the development of any small gas caps could be neglected in this regional model the model has other approximations the model has no flow boundary conditions including the model top and bottom the impact of intense hydrocarbon and water production from the wolfcamp and bone spring formations in particular from the avalon shale at the top of the bone spring reservoir in the northern sections of the db new mexico are unclear a similar situation arose in the fort worth basin of north texas with the producing barnett shale overlying the disposal interval ellenburger group a pair of studies gave rise to conflicting conclusions about impact of hydrocarbon production or lack thereof gao et al 2021 chen et al 2020 compressibility of the adjacent formations could play a role in attenuating the pressure buildup especially if gas occupies the pore space factors such as oil compressibility which is greater than water have not been accounted for in models the poor oil recovery of such systems combined with the 0 6 billion barrels of oil produced surface conditions 1 billion barrels at reservoir conditions suggests that at least twice that volume of oil remains in place such considerations are outside of the capabilities of a single phase flow model modeling to account for these subsurface conditions would require of the incorporation of two phase flow parameters which currently are poorly constrained at the regional scale the rock units above and below the dmg could be affected by the swd through dissolution or leakage along fractures and fault planes that impact the entire system and possibly enhances anisotropy of the horizontal permeability and reducing the vertical permeability operators have concluded that some bone spring avalon wells produce salt water that is injected into dmg swd wells similarly to what was observed between the barnett shale and the ellenburger of the fort worth basin gao et al 2021 the model results of pressure changes from 100 psi 0 7 mpa to 400 psi 2 8 mpa in some injection areas has brought attention to the possibility of induced seismicity along some existing faults in the study area although previous work peterie et al 2018 gao et al 2021 hennings et al 2021a 2021b and 2021b has shown that seismicity can be induced by pore pressure changes as low as 15 psi 0 1 mpa the modeled regional pressure changes are higher than in many previously studied areas but consistent with the large amount of water injected in a short time span modeled pressure increase in the fort worth basin reaches 200 psi 1 4 mpa gao et al 2021 in oklahoma pressure increases are described as 200 psi 1 4 mpa schoenball et al 2018 despite a larger injection volume however the pressure increase is similar to but lower than that of another injection interval underlying the dmg footprint gao et al 2020 where modeling suggests pressure increases 400 psi 2 8 mpa are not uncommon the alignment of the numerous small graben bounding faults and regional maximum horizontal stress s hmax lund snee and zoback 2017 suggests the faults are prone to reactivation but also that fluid flow along the fault plane could be enhanced because of the increased permeability barton et al 1995 townend and zoback 2000 hennings et al 2012 the presence of faults is implicitly included in the injectivity derived permeability values note that transverse permeability across faults which could lead to pressure compartmentalization when low has not been evaluated charzynski et al 2019 suggested that the numerous normal faults serve as upward pathways for migrating fluid this could lead to the dissolution of the overlying salt deposits creating migration pathways and subsequent pore pressure attenuation in the dmg a positive outcome that would nevertheless negatively affect the geotechnical stability of the impacted volumes with the magnitudes and orientations of in situ stresses within the faulted areas the risk of reactivating existing faults from pore pressure variations can be evaluated by this work nance 2020a notes that the castile formation served as a barrier to the flow of hydrocarbon and guides hydrocarbon sourced from the dmg into cbp reservoirs however this barrier effect might be due to capillary and relative permeability effects rather than solely due to the low permeability of the castile formation nance 2020a also posits that the lack of oil and gas accumulations west of the db midline axis could be due to the absence of the castile seal suggesting that hydrocarbons are dissipated at the surface after migrating up the formation dip this suggests less contrast in vertical and horizontal permeability values than assumed in this model if recent injection trends persist additional salt water needs to be managed through swd wells in dmg formations for the near future scanlon et al 2020b estimated that the volume of future produced water could be up to 250 billion barrels during the productive life of the db the anticipated production suggests the need for efficient management of future swd activities in the injection fields of db with hazard mitigation in mind with our estimation of the current pore pressure changes with swd to date optimization of future injection patterns within allowable injection rates and pressures would be beneficial to swd operators to effectively and safely manage the finite swd resource of the dmg 7 conclusions a model of spatiotemporal evolution of pore pressure in the dmg of the db can be very helpful to understand the initiation of seismic events to assess possible fault reactivation and the causation of anomalous seismicity and to develop estimations of the future hazards from induced seismicity and from regional pore pressure increase to manage the critical swd resources of the region the modeling results indicate that pore pressure increases range from 100 to 400 psi 0 7 2 8 mpa although they could be up to 500 psi 3 5 mpa and higher locally when in close proximity to swd wells pressure increases are large enough to induce strong artesian behavior of potential conduits connecting land surface and dmg and to sustain evaporite dissolution when initiated small pressure increases exist far away from the injection centers due to pressure diffusion pore pressure increases show high vertical variance due to the preferential injection into formations with better rock properties i e bell canyon and cherry canyon formations vs brushy canyon formation the sensitivity analysis shows that pressure buildups are most sensitive to horizontal permeability and compressibility oil and related water production may limit pore pressure increase especially around the production sites salinity of both formation water and injected water has a limited impact on pore pressure differentials presence of the capitan reef does relieve some pressure from the dmg but it does not affect the increase in regional scale pore pressure because it is located at the edge of the db away from most of the injection centers this work can be used for informing swd management of the dmg with increasing volumes of wastewater being injected into the target formations effective and efficient control on the injection rates and patterns

8048,study region west africa study focus the objective of this study was to quantitively evaluate streamflow previously simulated by the soil and water assessment tool swat model in an ungauged basin ogun river that was calibrated validated using gleam v3 0a aet data odusanya et al 2019 to evaluate this simulated streamflow in the ungauged ogun river basin a gauged basin ouémé river was selected based on proximity and on similar catchment attributes firstly the non unique parameter sets from the swat set up in the ungauged ogun river basin were transferred to swat that was setup in the neighbouring gauged ouémé river basin referred to as the regionalisation method secondly the swat model in the ouémé river basin was setup by calibrating the model using the observed streamflow data referred to as the conventional method new hydrological insights for the region in the gauged ouémé river basin using the conventional method a higher streamflow performance was obtained for all non unique swat simulations compared with the regionalisation method however a satisfactory streamflow performance was obtained with the regionalisation method in the south of ouémé river basin save gauge highest nse 0 79 r2 0 81 pbias 2 1 kge 0 85 and at the ouémé river basin outlet bonou gauge highest nse 0 79 r2 0 84 pbias 4 5 kge 0 84 that had the most similar attributes to the ogun river basin the study findings show that using satellite based aet data to calibrate a hydrological model can lead to an acceptable model performance in ungauged basins the regionalisation method was useful for assessing the simulated streamflow in the ungauged basin especially when catchment similarity is ensured and parameter non uniqueness is applied this research contributes to advancement in alternative means of modelling and evaluation of hydrologic model simulations in an ungauged basin keywords evapotranspiration hydrological modelling streamflow ungauged swat calibration regionalisation 1 introduction in most african catchments the main challenge for setting up simulation models as tools for studying hydrological processes and for predicting hydrological variables is the lack of observed data this is true even for catchment areas that are of high strategic importance for the state and national water development plans aduah et al 2017 fujihara et al 2014 kwakye and bárdossy 2020 wagner et al 2009 hence methods for setting up hydrological models and their evaluation in data scarce catchments are inevitably required the ogun river is an ungauged basin located in southwest nigeria and is the main source of public water supply for more than ten million people living in lagos and ogun state ikotun et al 2012 the ogun river basin is highly susceptible to point and non point source pollution due to increasing population industrialisation and agricultural activities oke and sangodoyin 2015 jaji et al 2007 water resources planning and management studies are difficult to develop and execute without observed streamflow data to help provide a decision support tool for stakeholders odusanya et al 2019 calibrated the eco hydrological model swat for the ogun river basin using satellite based actual evapotranspiration aet from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 0a by comparing the simulated soil moisture with the satellite based data and calculating the annual water balance an estimate of the overall hydrological model performance could be carried out odusanya et al 2019 however an actual assessment of the proposed method for streamflow simulation could not be implemented due to the lack of observed streamflow in the ogun river basin this study will apply a regionalisation method using a gauged neighbouring catchment to evaluate the simulated streamflow from the swat model that was calibrated with satellite based aet data in the ungauged ogun river basin remote sensing technologies offer an estimation of various water balance variables e g actual evapotranspiration aet and soil moisture sm at regular time intervals they also capture a large area within a rapid time and can cover inaccessible areas within minimal cost aryalekshmi et al 2021 immerzeel and droogers 2008 jiang et al 2020 lee et al 2021 sun et al 2021 several studies have used satellite based actual evapotranspiration to set up calibrate or validate hydrological models demirel et al 2018 dile et al 2020 immerzeel and droogers 2008 jiang et al 2020 kunnath poovakka et al 2018 2016 odusanya et al 2019 2021 poméon et al 2018 tobin and bennett 2017 wambura et al 2018 while some of these studies using either a single or multivariable calibration showed an improved aet simulation and a satisfactory or unsatisfactory model streamflow performance when compared to field measured aet and streamflow demirel et al 2018 herman et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 rientjes et al 2013 wambura et al 2018 willem vervoort et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 other studies could not determine a true validation of the simulated streamflow due to heavy human regulation or a lack of observed streamflow in the study area immerzeel and droogers 2008 odusanya et al 2019 extensive reviews of earth observation based methods with their different forcing data governing equations and spatial and temporal resolution for deriving aet have been carried out by several research groups anderson et al 2012 aryalekshmi et al 2021 bateni et al 2013 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2007 nouri et al 2015 savoca et al 2013 senay et al 2013 most of these studies reported some of the uncertainties related to the aet estimation using satellite data such as uncertainties in measurement due to the atmospheric attenuation radiometric response and the site conditions zhang et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 and aryalekshmi et al 2021 concluded that remote sensing based evapotranspiration estimation methods i e surface energy balance methods one source seb two source seb penman monteith methods ts vi space methods water balance method and etc are helpful for aet estimation on a global scale and the application of the satellite based aet for hydrological model calibration promises a better streamflow accuracy especially as the aet retrieval methods from remote sensing observations continue to improve since satellite based products are based on modelling assumptions they can only function as an alternative source of observational data these data can be used to constrain hydrological model parameter estimates however the assessment of the hydrological model performance with observed data i e streamflow is important to determine the strength of the calibration regionalisation is a commonly implemented strategy in predicting hydrological variables in ungauged basins and has been proposed using several methods post and jakeman 1999 parajka et al 2005 feigl et al 2020 regionalisation in hydrology has progressed continuously and several definitions of regionalisation could be found in literature blöschl and sivapalan 1995 oudin et al 2010 guo et al 2020 the definition often used is the following regionalisation is the process of transferring information e g parameters from neighbouring catchments to the catchment of interest blöschl and sivapalan 1995 most regionalisation studies apply one or more methods of selecting a donor catchment gauged and transferring information to another ungauged catchment merz and blöschl 2004 bárdossy 2007 mengistu et al 2019 the most widely implemented regionalisation methods can be classified into three categories hydrological signature based regression based and similarity based in signature based regionalisation the regression method or machine learning is used to relate watershed attribute to hydrologic signatures in gauged basins the hydrological signatures are quantitative metrics that describe the dynamic baseflow index flow change rate flow duration curve slope etc or statistical properties flow percentile flood frequency average streamflow etc of hydrologic data series mcmillan 2021 the regression based regionalisation relates the optimised model parameters to physiographic and climate characteristics catchment descriptors in the gauged catchments through empirical equations which can then be used to predict the model parameters in the ungauged catchments feigl et al 2020 merz and blöschl 2004 parajka et al 2013 wagener and wheater 2006 the similarity based regionalisation implements the transfer of parameters using methods such as spatial proximity and or physical similarity bárdossy 2007 merz and blöschl 2004 samuel et al 2011 the spatial proximity method transfers the parameter values from the geographically closest gauged catchment because a common assumption is that neighbouring catchments are similar assuming that catchments proximate to each other have similar hydrological responses i e runoff regime similarly homogenous physical and climatic characteristics such that climate and catchment conditions only vary smoothly in space then parameters can be transferred and perform similarly merz and blöschl 2004 randrianasolo et al 2011 blöschl et al 2013 the physical similarity method identifies a donor basin that is most similar to an ungauged basin based on the similarity of the catchment characteristics and climate blöschl et al 2013 merz and blöschl 2004 state that in principle the model parameters are closely related to catchment attributes as the model parameters are designed to represent the functional behaviour of catchment response i e hydrologic response and which in turn should be controlled by physical characteristics of catchments i e landuse geology soils climate and topographic several studies using regionalisation approaches have been undertaken in data scarce catchments to successfully simulate streamflow in africa e g in rwanda abimbola et al 2017 and in south africa mengistu et al 2019 in order to make reliable streamflow predictions using swat model in the ungauged ogun river that was previously calibrated validated using gleam v3 0a aet data evaluation of the model simulated streamflow was implemented by swat parameter regionalisation the main objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the simulated streamflow from the swat model that was calibrated and validated with satellite based aet data in the ungauged ogun river basin the study addresses i an evaluation method implemented for assessing the streamflow in the ungauged basin ii selecting a similar neighbouring gauged catchment to the ungauged ogun river basin iii implementing a parameter transfer method and iv determining the accuracy of the simulated streamflow of the swat model that was previously calibrated and validated with satellite based aet to undertake the evaluation of simulated streamflow in ogun the following steps were taken i out of several neighbouring catchments to the ogun river basin one gauged neighbouring catchment was selected ouémé river basin the choice was based on the accessibility availability and quality of the datasets spatial proximity and similar catchment attributes ii the initial non unique parameter sets from the swat set up in the ungauged ogun river basin were transferred to the selected neighbouring gauged catchment ouémé river basin to run the swat model termed regionalisation method iii the swat model was set up and calibrated and validated again in the neighbouring gauged catchment ouémé river basin this time by calibrating swat using the observed streamflow termed conventional method and iv the simulated streamflow and other water balance variables ensuing from both the regionalisation method and the conventional method were quantitatively compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 research region the study area is located in west africa spanning an area from 6 to 10 latitude and 0 and 6 longitude fig 1 the larger study area encompasses the ungauged ogun river basin gauged ouémé river basin and the mono river basin the relief in the region is flat and low lying and the climate is strongly influenced by the prevailing northeasterlies and southwesterlies the northeasterlies are of dry continental origin and are warm while the southwesterlies originate in the atlantic and are humid rainfall is seasonal with a unimodal rainy season in the northern part and bimodal rainy seasons in the south this study uses a previous swat model set up in the ogun river basin and selected a neighbouring gauged catchment hence the ouémé and mono river basins are also described the ogun river basin 20 292 km2 is located in the southwestern part of nigeria and has elevation ranges from 23 m to 624 m at the highest peak upstream the mean annual temperature is 27 c and the mean annual rainfall 1984 2012 obtained from observed data is 1224 mm year 1 the dry november march and wet april october seasons are two distinguishable seasons in the catchment approximately 24 of the catchment is covered by cropland 1 by urban and 75 by forest the agricultural activity is mainly rainfed crop farming two large reservoirs ikere gorge and oyan dam which are the principal provider of ogun and lagos state public water supply are located within the watershed the ogun river is also used for bathing and washing in densely populated areas along the river the ouémé river basin covers a surface area of 48 292 km2 ouémé river springs from the atakora mountains and is the largest river of benin republic the mono river springs near the benin border northeast of sokodé in togo and occupies an area of 20 289 km2 the mono river flows south and drains into the bight of benin fig 1 2 2 description of the swat model the swat model version 2012 of arcgis interface for swat arcswat was used winchell et al 2013 the soil and water assessment tool swat is an eco hydrological model developed by the united states departments of agricultural research services arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 swat is a semi distributed model that operates at a daily time step and simulates the effect of agricultural land management practices on the water balance components nutrient dynamics and sediment transport the major components of swat include weather hydrology plant growth nutrient erosion land management practices pesticide reservoir and channel routing the swat model has a submodule to simulate plant growth called epic williams et al 1989 this can simulate the growth of many types of trees and crops as land cover 2 2 1 swat model set up in the ungauged ogun river basin the swat model was previously set up in the ogun river basin see odusanya et al 2019 and is briefly described again here due to a lack of observed streamflow data in the ogun river basin the swat model was calibrated validated for aet using satellite derived gleam aet v3 0a data in swat calibration uncertainty programs swat cup abbaspour 2015 an initial pre selection of parameters based on literature research ha et al 2018 rafiei emam et al 2016 bicknell et al 1997 wang et al 2006 was undertaken to choose the most sensitive parameters to aet and ensure that the hydrological processes runoff evaporation interception transpiration and percolation are represented in the parameters during global sensitivity analysis the initial parameter ranges were based on neitsch et al 2002 2005 2011 based on the global sensitivity analysis 11 of the most sensitive parameters were selected and altered during the calibration process a multi site model calibration validation was implemented using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm the calibration period was 1989 2000 and the validated period was 2001 2012 to compute their nse r2 pbias and kge for each sub basin a gleam aet pixel value daily resolution was extracted for each subbasin using arcgis tools aggregated to monthly values and compare to swat simulated aet in each subbasin gleam combines a wide range of remote sensing observation from different satellites to separately estimate the different components of terrestrial evaporation i e open water evaporation bare soil evaporation interception loss transpiration and snow sublimation through a process based methodology miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 gleam aet v3 0a is based on reanalysis net radiation and air temperature a combination of gauged based reanalysis and satellite based precipitation and satellite based vegetation optical depth martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 and has a daily temporal coverage of 35 years 1980 2014 the gleam aet v3 0a was choosing for the swat model calibration validation because it performed better than modis data in the previous study odusanya et al 2019 the non unique parameter sets and their corresponding nse values obtained after the swat calibration with gleam is reported in section 2 4 judging from the four statistical criteria nse r2 kge pbias the overall results of the calibration validation using the satellite based aet were satisfactory table a1 for more detail see odusanya et al 2019 2 2 2 swat model set up in the gauged ouémé river basin in the previous study odusanya et al 2019 the swat model was set up whereby the watershed was divided into 59 sub basins which were subdivided into 1890 hydrological response units hrus the hru is the smallest unit of spatial disaggregation these units consist of homogeneous soil landuse and slope arnold 1998 neitsch et al 2011 in this study 9 soil classes 3 slope categories and 9 landuse classes were used for the ouémé river basin the areas containing the same land use soil type and the same slope range are lumped together in each subbasin to form the hydrologic response unit hrus the sources of data used for the swat model set up are presented in table c1 daily precipitation from twenty six weather stations as well as daily maximum and minimum temperature data from four stations were used as input into the swat model fig 2 the missing minimum and maximum temperature values solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity data were simulated for the basin using the wgen cfsr world weather generator the wgen cfsr world weather database contains long term monthly statistics covering the entire globe developed using global dataset of national centre for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis ncep the descriptive statistics frequency of the missing meteorological data are presented in figs g1 and g2 potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated using hargreaves pet surface runoff was simulated using daily rainfall and with the modified soil conservation services scs curve number method streamflow was routed through the channel using the variable storage coefficient method 2 3 description of the regionalisation approach in this study we use the proximate similarity approach for evaluating the simulated streamflow from swat calibrated with satellite based aet data in the ungauged ogun river basin this approach is based on the assumption that catchments geographically close to one another show more similar hydrological characteristics than those far apart from each other due to gradual and smooth changes in climate and catchment conditions in space merz and blöschl 2004 oudin et al 2008 vandewiele and elias 1995 in addition to the proximity transfer we also implement the physical similarity approach which considers the climate and catchments attributes with the rationale that catchments with similar climate and attributes even if far apart from each other should behave similarly in terms of hydrological processes and that the calibrated parameter set can be transferable to the similar catchment arsenault et al 2019 kay et al 2007 merz et al 2006 in spatial proximity the gauged catchments are selected based only on the spatial distance without any information about catchment attributes oudin et al 2008 on the other hand for the physical similarity approach the gauged catchments are selected based on their attributes kay et al 2007 merz et al 2006 the catchment attributes are also known as catchment characteristics or descriptors table 4 in this study the similarity based approach considers both the spatial proximity and physical similarity in the selection of similar catchment and the parameter transfer this has proven to be valuable for hydrological regionalisation purposes and performs slightly better than approaches based on either spatial proximity or physical similarity alone zhang and chiew 2009 in one of the several methods of regionalisation a gauged catchment is set up with a model that is parameterised and calibrated and then the calibrated model parameters based on the appropriate similarity measure are transferred to an ungauged catchment arsenault et al 2019 kay et al 2007 in this study the calibrated model parameters from swat set up in the ungauged ogun river basin were directly transferred to one selected similar neighbouring gauged catchment 2 3 1 spatial proximity firstly the multiple ring buffer tool from the arcgis toolbox was used to create an area feature at a specified distance around the ogun target catchment to identify gauged catchments that are geographically proximate fig 1 secondly the spatial proximity method was implemented to select gauged catchments that are most geographically proximate to the ogun river basin the proximity is measured by the spatial distance between catchment centroids to select the geographic neighbour catchments for parameter regionalisation we use the simple euclidian distance d u g between the catchment centroids to compute the geographical distance between the ungauged and gauged catchments as implemented in previous studies arsenault et al 2019 he et al 2011 poissant et al 2017 yang et al 2018 1 d u g x u x g 2 y u y g 2 where x u y u and x g y g are the geographical coordinate of the centroids of the ungauged and gauged catchments respectively and d u g is the distance between them to be able to use the geographical coordinates to calculate the euclidean distance we removed the special characters degree minutes and seconds and converted the coordinates to decimal degrees 2 3 2 physical similarity the similarity index is chosen to quantify what makes two catchments similar in terms of climate and catchment characteristics attribute the catchment attributes used in the physical similarity analysis climate catchment and runoff similarity are presented in table 4 and table b1 the hydrologic signatures flow indices are used for the runoff characteristics several similarity indices computed from catchment attributes have been implemented in regionalisation studies burn 1993 kay et al 2007 oudin et al 2008 samuel et al 2011 li et al 2015 to measure the physical similarity between the gauged and ungauged catchments we adapted the similarity index θ defined by burn 1993 calculated as follows 2 θ i 1 k cd g i cd u i cd i where θ is the similarity index of g catchment to u catchment cd is the catchment descriptor also known as catchment characteristics or attribute g denotes the gauged catchment u denotes the ungauged catchment k is the total number of catchment descriptors and δcd i is the range of ith catchment descriptor the δcd i is defined as the difference between the highest and lowest values of the catchment descriptors to find it we subtract the lowest value of the catchment descriptor from the highest since the catchment descriptors table 4 are not in the same unit and scale the values were standardised by the division with the total range of catchment descriptors δcd i next the gauged catchments are ranked in order of similarity using the result of both spatial proximity and physical similarity the rank accumulated similarity oudin et al 2008 was used to select the most similar gauged catchment to ungauged ogun river basin for proximity the gauged catchments were ranked by decreasing proximity to the ungauged catchment for physical similarity the gauged catchment with the most similar attribute i e the one with the smallest similarity index to the ungauged catchment is considered rank 1 the catchment with the second most similar attribute is considered rank 2 the total rank is the arithmetic total of the rank numbers obtained from each of the measures proximity and physical similarity for each catchment the gauged catchment with the smallest total rank is considered and selected for the parameter regionalisation the description and sources of input data used to perform the similarity analysis are presented in table c1 the mathematical formulation used in estimating the values of the climate indices and flow indices are presented in table d1 the mean runoff coefficient for the ungauged ogun river basin was estimated using the satellite based calibrated swat simulated streamflow while the observed streamflow was used in the gauged catchments 2 4 evaluating the calibrated model set up with satellite based aet data in ogun river basin to evaluate the simulated streamflow of swat set up in the ungauged ogun river basin that was calibrated with aet data from gleam a similar gauged catchment was chosen section 2 3 to transfer the calibrated parameters from the swat model setup in ogun in a first step all the non unique swat parameter sets that met the objective criteria nse 0 59 during the aet calibration in the ogun river basin were directly transferred to the selected gauged basin i e regionalisation method a multi site model optimisation was implemented and was used to spatially distribute the parameters the model in file with sufi 2 algorithm in swatcup programme was used to read in the parameters and the swat edit executive application in swat model was used to edit the default parameters in swat the simulated output was assessed in the four gauging stations using the observed streamflow and evaluated using the four performance metric nse r2 kge and pbias in this study the non unique parameter sets are considered in the evaluation because model calibration is inherently non unique during hydrological model calibration there can exist several parameters sets that provide equally suitable model responses that ensure a minimum level of model performance and these are known as non unique parameter sets which is also known as equifinality beven 1996 the solution to a calibration therefore is many sets of parameters hence reporting one solution out of many of similarly good solutions will be quite misleading the transferred parameters are listed in table 1 it should be noted that out of the eleven sensitive aet parameters used for the ogun river basin calibration ten were transferred to the selected gauged catchment the parameter for the lake evaporation coefficient v evrsv res was excluded because no reservoirs are present in the gauged catchment the description of swat parameters used in this study is presented in table e1 in a second step the swat model set up in the selected gauged catchment was calibrated using the monthly measured streamflow at several gauges available in the catchment i e conventional method this setup is considered to be a reference set up a multi site monthly time step model calibration and validation at the four gauges located within the catchment was implemented the sensitivity analysis calibration validation and uncertainty analysis of the simulated streamflow was carried out using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 which uses a stochastic procedure for drawing independent parameter sets using latin hypercube sampling lhs a global sensitivity analysis was carried out based on multiple regressions in which parameter sensitivities were determined by numerous rounds of lhs to select the most sensitive parameters which were indicated by the p value and the t stat value the p value determines the significance of the sensitivity in which a value closer to zero is more significant the t stat value provides a measure of parameter sensitivity in which a larger absolute value is more sensitive using the sufi 2 algorithm two indices p factor and r factor were used to quantify the uncertainties associated with the modelling and to judge the strength of the calibration and validation in which the ideal situation would be to account for 100 of the observed data i e streamflow or aet in the 95 predictive uncertainty 95ppu while at the same time have an r factor close to zero the p factor represents the percentage of observed data plus its error bracketed by the 95ppu band and varies from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates a 100 bracketing of the observed data within model simulations while the r factor is the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu and the standard deviation of the observed variable this value ranges between 0 and infinity we evaluated the swat simulated monthly streamflow from the regionalisation method and the conventional method by using the monthly observed streamflow in the gauged catchment and calculating four performance metrics table d2 the coefficient of determination r2 describes the proportion of the variance in the measured data which is explained by the model with higher values indicating less error variance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse quantifies the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance the kling gupta efficiency kge provides an analysis of the relative importance of different component correlation bias and variability and the percent bias pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observations the model performance rating for aet and streamflow simulations at a monthly time step are based on moriasi et al 2007 and kouchi et al 2017 presented in table f1 further evaluation of water balance components was undertaken by i comparing the performance of previously swat simulated aet in the ungauged ogun river basin odusanya et al 2019 to the performance of the swat simulated aet using the regionalisation method ii comparing the swat simulated soil water water yield and percolation from the regionalisation method to the conventional method the schematic of the study workflow is shown in fig 3 in the swat model the aet is defined as the amount of water that is actually removed from a surface due to the processes of evaporation and transpiration mm water yield wyld is the net amount of water that leaves the subbasin and contributes to streamflow in the reach mm percolation perc is the water that percolates past the root zones mm and the soil water sw is the amount of water in the soil profile mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 catchment proximity and similarity analysis three entire river basins were encompassed within the chosen 400 km radius of the ogun river basin their outlets are marked in fig 1 the ouémé and the mono river basins were gauged and had available and accessible data for catchment similarity analysis the geographical distance between the ungauged ogun river basin centroid and the other river basin centroids table 2 shows that the ouémé river basin is the most proximate ranking the gauged river basins by their increasing proximity smallest to largest distance to the ungauged ogun river basin shows that ouémé river basin was closer that the mono river basin we thus chose to focus on ouémé river basin and furthermore calculated the geographical distance between the location of each of its gauges bétérou savè atchérigbé bonou and ogun river basin centroid table 3 the result show that savè gauge and the outlet gauge at bonou are most proximate to the ogun river basin the units are in degrees kilometres for the physical similarity measure using the catchment descriptors in table 4 the similarity index results table 5 show that ouémé has the smallest value catchment with the most similar attributes the similarity is zero if the catchment attributes in the two catchments are identical and increases as the attributes become more dissimilar thus ouémé river basin has the most similar attributes to ogun river basin and therefore is ranked 1 a qualitative description of the meteorological attributes of the ogun ouémé and mono river basins all show similar rainfall patterns in the lower half the catchments table b1 and all have a similar climate according to the köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 peel et al 2007 the arithmetic total rank for the spatial proximity and the physical similarity results for the ouémé river basin was estimated to be slightly higher than mono river basin based on the spatial proximity and physical similarity results it is evident that both the ouémé and mono catchments are quite similar to the ogun river basin however considering the availability of sufficient streamflow data the ouémé catchment was selected for evaluating the streamflow simulated in ungauged ogun river basin the description of swat model set up in the gauged ouémé river basin is presented in section 2 2 2 3 2 performance of simulated streamflow from the regionalisation method in the ouémé river basin the resulting six non unique streamflow simulations obtained at the gauging stations bétérou savè atchérigbé and bonou fig 2 were evaluated against observed streamflow data fig 4 as a check the simulated streamflow s from the transferred parameters and the observed streamflow were compared to the uncalibrated swat model performance fig 4 a satisfactory streamflow performance was only achieved at the middle savè and at the outlet bonou gauge of ouémé river basin fig 4 and table 6 from the nse values all the six simulated streamflows at savè are satisfactory while at bonou three of the simulated streamflows are satisfactory table 6 the satisfactory streamflow performance at the savè and bonou gauges may be attributed to the proximity of these gauges to the ogun river basin figs 1 and 2 and table 3 as they are both located in the lower half of the ouémé catchment furthermore fig 2 and fig hi show the similarity in rainfall pattern bimodal between the ogun river basin and the southern part of the ouémé river basin the poor performance obtained at the gauges with relatively lower flows bétérou and atchérigbé highlights the weaknesses in the regionalisation method to capture the low streamflow fluxes specifically the transferred parameters did not adequately reproduce the observed streamflow at the bétérou gauge which is located in the headwater and is inherently difficult to simulate may be due to dissimilar topography however the poor performance may also be attributed to the dissimilar climate in the northern part of ouémé river basin to that of the ogun river basin from where the parameters were transferred fig 2 and fig h1 another reason the regionalisation method did not capture the peak flows at bétérou gauging stations is due to the uncertainty in the rainfall data in the northern part of ouémé river basin where the bétérou gauge is located 3 out of the 9 rainfall stations have frequent approximately 10 missing daily rainfall 1000 of 9497 data points fig g1 although the missing rainfall data was simulated using the weather generator it may introduce some uncertainty despite the atchérigbé gauging station located in southern part of ouémé river basin both have a similar climate the poor streamflow performance is most likely attributed to the gauge being the furthest distance measured by its proximity away from the ogun river basin table 3 3 3 performance of simulated streamflow from the conventional method from the global sensitivity analysis 13 of the most sensitive parameters in the swat model were selected for further calibration table 7 a multi site calibration was performed to reach a reasonable result two iterations for the calibration were performed the first with 1000 simulations and the second with 500 simulations the highest nse reached with the p factor and r factor is 0 73 after calibration the six best parameter sets were chosen they all met an objective criterion of nse 0 70 and these were used to run swat 1980 2005 for the final streamflow simulation and overall model evaluation table 8 the six non unique parameter sets were chosen in order to compare the same number of non unique parameter sets as in the regionalisation method the description of swat model parameters used in this study is presented in table e1 the result of the observed and the simulated streamflow fig 5 and table 8 depict an improved and satisfactory swat model performance compared with the regionalisation method fig 4b and table 6 the flow dynamics are well simulated at all gauges and a satisfactory streamflow performance is obtained at most gauges except at the headwater gauge bétérou station the pbias however remains high 30 at some gauges the better performance can easily be explained by the fact that when parameters are calibrated for a specific catchment they are most suited for that particular watershed as they are able to reproduce the hydrological processes more accurately the better simulated monthly streamflow obtained at the atchérigbé station compared to the bétérou station agrees with a previous study using swat bossa et al 2014 and is attributed to the similarity of the rainfall pattern to the south of ouémé river basin where the gauge is located fig g1 the satisfactory result of the streamflow simulated by swat at the four gauges agrees with another study berenger et al 2018 conducted in ouémé river basin 3 4 performance of simulated aet from the regionalisation method the performance of the simulated aet when the six best parameter sets of the calibrated swat model in the ogun river basin were transferred into the swat set up for the ouémé river basin for the period 1980 2005 is given in table 9 the simulated aet was evaluated with respect to gleam aet v3 0a in the previous research odusanya et al 2019 the period of simulation was split into two therefore the performance of the simulated aet in ouémé was compared with the performance of simulated aet in ogun in both periods the results for ouémé show a lower aet model performance nse kge pbias and higher model dynamics r2 table 9 and table a1 reason for the lower performance of simulated aet in the regionalisation method can be attributed to the spatial loss in model performance when parameters are transfer from one gauge to another and the parameter values being not specifically tuned to the new conditions after transfer at all 4 gauges in the ouémé catchment when the swat model is run with the six non unique parameter sets the simulated aet shows a slight improvement nse r2 kge compared with the uncalibrated aet table 10 and fig 6 the temporal dynamics of the aet were reproduced in most simulations as given by the r2 at the ouémé river basin outlet bonou the aet was simulated the best which could be due to the similar climate conditions fig 2 fig h1 and table b1 in the lower half of the ogun and south of ouémé catchments comparing the swat simulated aet performances at the four gauges it is apparent that a satisfactory aet simulation does not necessarily entail an acceptable streamflow simulation tables 6 and 10 in the ogun river basin the optimal parameter set number 1 that provided the best aet simulation based on the nse odusanya et al 2019 also resulted in the highest nse for aet simulations in the ouémé river basin table 10 but the best parameter set did not have the highest nse for the streamflow simulations at any of the four gauges in the ouémé river basin table 6 the result obtained agrees with a study in chindwin basin south east asia sirisena et al 2020 in which the swat model was calibrated using aet and streamflow data separately when one variable was calibrated alone it led to a satisfactory performance but resulted in a reduced performance of the other variable however in ouémé river basin both the simulated aet and the simulated streamflow at the outlet gauge bonou were satisfactory in three of the six non unique parameter sets this is most likely associated with the more similar hydrologic climatic conditions in the southern part of both catchments and for which the transferred parameters were able to successfully reproduce the hydrological processes fig 2 and fig h1 streamflow and aet are both important hydrological output fluxes from the steady state rainfall runoff process previous studies on calibration of hydrologic model awra l using remotely sensed evapotranspiration and soil moisture for streamflow prediction kunnath poovakka et al 2016 have reported a strong dependence between et and streamflow it is reported that some swat model parameters are sensitive to both streamflow and aet processes abbaspour et al 2017 jin and jin 2020 sirisena et al 2020 in this study cn2 epco sol bd alpha bf are sensitive to both streamflow and aet tables 1 and 7 since these parameters need to satisfy both processes an increase or decrease in one flux will affect the other one hence there may be a trade off or lower performance for one variable when the other is solely calibrated also the satisfactory aet simulation that does not necessarily entail an acceptable streamflow simulation may be due to the regionalisation methods one of the challenges of regionalisation method is that the simulations of the ungauged catchments do not usually perform nearly as well as in the gauged catchments parajka et al 2007 2005 3 5 comparing the regionalisation method with the conventional method 3 5 1 simulated streamflow the conventional method was a benchmark against which to measure the performance of applying satellite aet data to calibrate the swat model in an ungauged basin in this study the streamflow simulated using the conventional method outperformed the streamflow simulated using the regionalisation method overall by considering the non unique parameters the streamflow was satisfactorily simulated at all four gauges also by considering the optimum parameter set simulation 1 only a satisfactory streamflow performance with the nse and r2 is obtained at savè atchérigbé and bonou with all the four metrics and at bétérou with the nse and r2 metrics table 8 the better performance of the conventional method for streamflow simulation compared agrees with a study carried out using the hydrological model pcr globwb calibrated with gleam aet v 3 0a and observed streamflow in the central western morocco lópez lópez et al 2017 in the regionalisation approach by considering the non unique parameters an overall satisfactory simulated streamflow was obtained at two of the four gauges savè and bonou in the ouémé river basin from the optimum parameter set alone simulation 1 a satisfactory streamflow simulation is obtained at savè with all the four metrics whereas at bonou only the kge and r2 and at atchérigbé only the r2 metric were satisfactory table 6 reasons for the lower performance of simulated streamflow in the regionalisation method are due to the parameter values being not specifically tuned to the new conditions after transfer as well as the courser resolution of the gleam aet data compared to the average size of an hru in the swat model setup in the ogun catchment and the weighted average gleam aet pixel values that were applied to each subbasin in swat this latter reason is confirmed by a previous study kunnath poovakka et al 2016 that reported the quality e g resolution and retrieval algorithm of satellite based aet for calibration is critical to produce reliable streamflow predictions therefore the simulated streamflow of the regionalisation method could partly be improved if a finer spatial resolution of the gleam aet data was available 3 5 2 simulated soil water water yield and percolation a visual assessment of further swat simulated water balance components at the four gauges in the ouémé river basin ensuing from the regionalisation method and considering the non unique parameter sets shows that the soil water sw content in the soil profile 0 200 cm is higher and that the water percolated to the root zone perc and water yield wyld are lower especially at bonou compared to the conventional method figs i1 j1 and k1 thus the regionalisation method clearly shows that using satellite based aet in model calibration has a greater impact on the vertical water flux through the soil horizons than the conventional method our previous study odusanya et al 2021 showed a similar result of the greater impact of solely satellite based aet calibration on the vertical flux through the soil horizons in the ouémé river basin the sw has a fundamental role in the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and infiltration and thus governs the partitioning of the energy and mass fluxes between land and the atmosphere brocca et al 2017 2010 koster et al 2010 therefore including satellite based sw as well as other variables such as leaf area index to calibrate a hydrological model in an ungauged basin could improve the model performance at all gauges our water balance analysis agrees with a previous study rajib et al 2018 which reported that a hydrologic model calibrated against only aet or sw would produce too little or too much of a vertical water flux either to the atmosphere or through soil horizons unless the horizontal water routing in the model are also simultaneously adjusted hence our result produced too much of a vertical water flux through the soil horizons fig i1 birkel et al 2014 also reported that the information contained in streamflow time series may not sufficiently capture how vertical fluxes evolve at different spatial and temporal scales within the watershed therefore some studies kunnath poovakka et al 2016 rientjes et al 2013 shahrban et al 2018 suggested that multi variable calibration of streamflow and aet in hydrologic models is recommended as a best practice also simulations from a conceptual hydrologic model for austria showed that the use of both streamflow and satellite based topsoil moisture data provided more robust parameter values than using either of the observed data alone during calibration parajka et al 2009 since the study strives to use freely available global satellite based data to estimate streamflow for ungauged basins the simulated streamflow of the regionalisation method could be improved by considering multi variable model calibration in the ungauged basin using satellite based products such as sw and leaf area index 3 6 uncertainty analysis of the modelling framework 3 6 1 swat model previously set up in the ungauged ogun river basin the uncertainty associated with the aet simulations for each of the 53 subbasins to map error sources and uncertainties stemming from parameters input data and model conceptualisation in the swat model that was previously set up in the ogun river basin see odusanya et al 2019 is briefly described again here in the calibration period the values of the p factor obtained were between 0 50 and 0 90 and the values of the r factor were between 1 40 and 2 4 in the validation period the values of p factor were between 0 6 and 0 88 and that of the r factor were between 1 43 and 2 5 although the r factor was quite large in all the 53 subbasins indicating large model uncertainties the p factor values revealed that more than half of the satellite based aet plus its error are bracketed by the 95 predictive uncertainty in all the 53 subbasins 3 6 2 swat model set up in the gauged ouémé river basin 3 6 2 1 swat model calibrated with observed streamflow the quantification of the uncertainty associated with the swat simulated streamflow when observed streamflow data was used to calibrate the model conventional method shows that the r factors were high at the four gauging stations especially at savè and bonou fig 7 the p factor values at savè and bonou in both the calibration and validation periods show that over half of the observed streamflow points are bracketed by the 95ppu while at bétérou and atchérigbé gauges the observed streamflow points bracketed by the 95ppu are around 50 this signifies that the 95ppu of the simulated streamflow captured at least half of the observed streamflow values at savè and bonou whereas at bétérou and atchérigbé gauges the 95ppu did not capture all the observed streamflow point fig 7 in table 8 and fig 5 the high pbias at the bétérou gauge and the failure of swat parameters calibrated with observed streamflow to capture the peak flow at the gauges especially at bétérou and atchérigbé may be attributed to the uncertainty in the driving variables and input data e g landuse map rainfall and temperature data for instance we observe a high percentage of missing rainfall data at the upper part of ouémé river basin fig g1 that contributed to the large r value obtained at all of the gauges 3 6 2 2 swat model run with the non unique transferred parameter sets using this regionalisation approach there is a loss of model performance that leads to decrease in streamflow simulation when compared to using locally calibrated parameters which is not surprising and has been confirmed by others merz and blöschl 2004 moges et al 2021 therefore to reduce the accumulated uncertainties stemming from each modelling step of the simulated streamflow from the regionalisation method a multi objective calibration that incorporate other variables i e lai with other water balance components e g sm aet is suggested in both the gauged and ungauged catchments the streamflow performance resulting from applying the regionalised parameters can be improved if input data uncertainty is reduced by using a high resolution and high quality input data in the model setups continuous time series of rainfall input and choosing a catchment with no climatic gradient 4 conclusion a framework using a regionalisation approach for evaluating satellite based aet data for calibrating streamflow in ungauged basins is presented in this study we deepen the research undertaken in odusanya et al 2019 and verify the validity of simulating streamflow in the ungauged ogun river basin the resulting calibrated non unique parameters from the setup in the ogun catchment are transferred to a carefully selected similar neighbouring gauged catchment ouémé river basin in which the swat simulated streamflow can be evaluated using the observed discharge data the swat model performance in the ogun ungauged catchment calibrated with satellite aet data can thus be evaluated by using a regionalisation method whereby the gauged ouémé catchment is the site of evaluation the simulated streamflow using the conventional method showed a better performance at all four gauges in the ouémé river basin and for all four statistical metrics compared to the regionalisation method this was not surprisingly due to final calibrated parameter values that were more suitable to the catchment compared to the transferred parameter values from the regionalisation method however our study findings reveal that when considering the non unique parameter sets satellite based aet can be used for calibrating hydrological models to simulate streamflow in ungauged basins with a good level of confidence in the gauged ouémé river basin with the regionalisation method the streamflow and aet were both satisfactorily simulated at two gauges the gauge located in the middle of the catchment savè judged by 2 metrics and the gauge at the outlet bonou judged by four metrics it is important to consider the non unique parameter sets during the transfer since some of these simulations may perform better than when only considering the optimum parameter set for some gauges in the ouémé river basin obtaining a satisfactory aet simulation did not necessarily lead to an acceptable streamflow simulation the regionalisation method showed that using satellite based aet in model calibration has a greater impact on the vertical water flux through the soil horizons than the conventional method we suggest for future work to use additional available satellite based data i e the leaf area index and soil moisture data to perform a multi variable model calibration as this may improve the vertical water flux as well as the simulated streamflow to reduce the effect of the accumulated uncertainties stemming from the regionalisation method we suggest using continuous climate data and or high resolution satellite input data to set up swat whenever possible the study also applied various statistical measures to quantify the uncertainty in the modelling and the regionalisation method these results reveal uncertainties from the transferred parameters contributing to low performance of the simulated streamflow at some gauges we identified several possible factors for the low performance of the simulated streamflow including a climatic gradient in the recipient catchment high resolution of the satellite based aet data and the spatial loss of model performance due to parameter transfer from the ungauged to gauged catchment our results are helpful to show how using aet data to calibrate swat in an ungauged basin and using a regionalisation approach for assessing simulated streamflow in an ungauged basin is plausible when care is taken to identify physiographic meteorological and hydrological similar catchments to the donor catchment this regionalisation approach contributes to advancements in alternative means of modelling and evaluation of hydrological model simulations in an ungauged basin our methodological framework can be implemented using other hydrological models in an ungauged basin also those located in different geophysical settings author contributions abolanle e odusanya bano mehdi schulz and karsten schulz

8048,study region west africa study focus the objective of this study was to quantitively evaluate streamflow previously simulated by the soil and water assessment tool swat model in an ungauged basin ogun river that was calibrated validated using gleam v3 0a aet data odusanya et al 2019 to evaluate this simulated streamflow in the ungauged ogun river basin a gauged basin ouémé river was selected based on proximity and on similar catchment attributes firstly the non unique parameter sets from the swat set up in the ungauged ogun river basin were transferred to swat that was setup in the neighbouring gauged ouémé river basin referred to as the regionalisation method secondly the swat model in the ouémé river basin was setup by calibrating the model using the observed streamflow data referred to as the conventional method new hydrological insights for the region in the gauged ouémé river basin using the conventional method a higher streamflow performance was obtained for all non unique swat simulations compared with the regionalisation method however a satisfactory streamflow performance was obtained with the regionalisation method in the south of ouémé river basin save gauge highest nse 0 79 r2 0 81 pbias 2 1 kge 0 85 and at the ouémé river basin outlet bonou gauge highest nse 0 79 r2 0 84 pbias 4 5 kge 0 84 that had the most similar attributes to the ogun river basin the study findings show that using satellite based aet data to calibrate a hydrological model can lead to an acceptable model performance in ungauged basins the regionalisation method was useful for assessing the simulated streamflow in the ungauged basin especially when catchment similarity is ensured and parameter non uniqueness is applied this research contributes to advancement in alternative means of modelling and evaluation of hydrologic model simulations in an ungauged basin keywords evapotranspiration hydrological modelling streamflow ungauged swat calibration regionalisation 1 introduction in most african catchments the main challenge for setting up simulation models as tools for studying hydrological processes and for predicting hydrological variables is the lack of observed data this is true even for catchment areas that are of high strategic importance for the state and national water development plans aduah et al 2017 fujihara et al 2014 kwakye and bárdossy 2020 wagner et al 2009 hence methods for setting up hydrological models and their evaluation in data scarce catchments are inevitably required the ogun river is an ungauged basin located in southwest nigeria and is the main source of public water supply for more than ten million people living in lagos and ogun state ikotun et al 2012 the ogun river basin is highly susceptible to point and non point source pollution due to increasing population industrialisation and agricultural activities oke and sangodoyin 2015 jaji et al 2007 water resources planning and management studies are difficult to develop and execute without observed streamflow data to help provide a decision support tool for stakeholders odusanya et al 2019 calibrated the eco hydrological model swat for the ogun river basin using satellite based actual evapotranspiration aet from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 0a by comparing the simulated soil moisture with the satellite based data and calculating the annual water balance an estimate of the overall hydrological model performance could be carried out odusanya et al 2019 however an actual assessment of the proposed method for streamflow simulation could not be implemented due to the lack of observed streamflow in the ogun river basin this study will apply a regionalisation method using a gauged neighbouring catchment to evaluate the simulated streamflow from the swat model that was calibrated with satellite based aet data in the ungauged ogun river basin remote sensing technologies offer an estimation of various water balance variables e g actual evapotranspiration aet and soil moisture sm at regular time intervals they also capture a large area within a rapid time and can cover inaccessible areas within minimal cost aryalekshmi et al 2021 immerzeel and droogers 2008 jiang et al 2020 lee et al 2021 sun et al 2021 several studies have used satellite based actual evapotranspiration to set up calibrate or validate hydrological models demirel et al 2018 dile et al 2020 immerzeel and droogers 2008 jiang et al 2020 kunnath poovakka et al 2018 2016 odusanya et al 2019 2021 poméon et al 2018 tobin and bennett 2017 wambura et al 2018 while some of these studies using either a single or multivariable calibration showed an improved aet simulation and a satisfactory or unsatisfactory model streamflow performance when compared to field measured aet and streamflow demirel et al 2018 herman et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 rientjes et al 2013 wambura et al 2018 willem vervoort et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 other studies could not determine a true validation of the simulated streamflow due to heavy human regulation or a lack of observed streamflow in the study area immerzeel and droogers 2008 odusanya et al 2019 extensive reviews of earth observation based methods with their different forcing data governing equations and spatial and temporal resolution for deriving aet have been carried out by several research groups anderson et al 2012 aryalekshmi et al 2021 bateni et al 2013 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2007 nouri et al 2015 savoca et al 2013 senay et al 2013 most of these studies reported some of the uncertainties related to the aet estimation using satellite data such as uncertainties in measurement due to the atmospheric attenuation radiometric response and the site conditions zhang et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 and aryalekshmi et al 2021 concluded that remote sensing based evapotranspiration estimation methods i e surface energy balance methods one source seb two source seb penman monteith methods ts vi space methods water balance method and etc are helpful for aet estimation on a global scale and the application of the satellite based aet for hydrological model calibration promises a better streamflow accuracy especially as the aet retrieval methods from remote sensing observations continue to improve since satellite based products are based on modelling assumptions they can only function as an alternative source of observational data these data can be used to constrain hydrological model parameter estimates however the assessment of the hydrological model performance with observed data i e streamflow is important to determine the strength of the calibration regionalisation is a commonly implemented strategy in predicting hydrological variables in ungauged basins and has been proposed using several methods post and jakeman 1999 parajka et al 2005 feigl et al 2020 regionalisation in hydrology has progressed continuously and several definitions of regionalisation could be found in literature blöschl and sivapalan 1995 oudin et al 2010 guo et al 2020 the definition often used is the following regionalisation is the process of transferring information e g parameters from neighbouring catchments to the catchment of interest blöschl and sivapalan 1995 most regionalisation studies apply one or more methods of selecting a donor catchment gauged and transferring information to another ungauged catchment merz and blöschl 2004 bárdossy 2007 mengistu et al 2019 the most widely implemented regionalisation methods can be classified into three categories hydrological signature based regression based and similarity based in signature based regionalisation the regression method or machine learning is used to relate watershed attribute to hydrologic signatures in gauged basins the hydrological signatures are quantitative metrics that describe the dynamic baseflow index flow change rate flow duration curve slope etc or statistical properties flow percentile flood frequency average streamflow etc of hydrologic data series mcmillan 2021 the regression based regionalisation relates the optimised model parameters to physiographic and climate characteristics catchment descriptors in the gauged catchments through empirical equations which can then be used to predict the model parameters in the ungauged catchments feigl et al 2020 merz and blöschl 2004 parajka et al 2013 wagener and wheater 2006 the similarity based regionalisation implements the transfer of parameters using methods such as spatial proximity and or physical similarity bárdossy 2007 merz and blöschl 2004 samuel et al 2011 the spatial proximity method transfers the parameter values from the geographically closest gauged catchment because a common assumption is that neighbouring catchments are similar assuming that catchments proximate to each other have similar hydrological responses i e runoff regime similarly homogenous physical and climatic characteristics such that climate and catchment conditions only vary smoothly in space then parameters can be transferred and perform similarly merz and blöschl 2004 randrianasolo et al 2011 blöschl et al 2013 the physical similarity method identifies a donor basin that is most similar to an ungauged basin based on the similarity of the catchment characteristics and climate blöschl et al 2013 merz and blöschl 2004 state that in principle the model parameters are closely related to catchment attributes as the model parameters are designed to represent the functional behaviour of catchment response i e hydrologic response and which in turn should be controlled by physical characteristics of catchments i e landuse geology soils climate and topographic several studies using regionalisation approaches have been undertaken in data scarce catchments to successfully simulate streamflow in africa e g in rwanda abimbola et al 2017 and in south africa mengistu et al 2019 in order to make reliable streamflow predictions using swat model in the ungauged ogun river that was previously calibrated validated using gleam v3 0a aet data evaluation of the model simulated streamflow was implemented by swat parameter regionalisation the main objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the simulated streamflow from the swat model that was calibrated and validated with satellite based aet data in the ungauged ogun river basin the study addresses i an evaluation method implemented for assessing the streamflow in the ungauged basin ii selecting a similar neighbouring gauged catchment to the ungauged ogun river basin iii implementing a parameter transfer method and iv determining the accuracy of the simulated streamflow of the swat model that was previously calibrated and validated with satellite based aet to undertake the evaluation of simulated streamflow in ogun the following steps were taken i out of several neighbouring catchments to the ogun river basin one gauged neighbouring catchment was selected ouémé river basin the choice was based on the accessibility availability and quality of the datasets spatial proximity and similar catchment attributes ii the initial non unique parameter sets from the swat set up in the ungauged ogun river basin were transferred to the selected neighbouring gauged catchment ouémé river basin to run the swat model termed regionalisation method iii the swat model was set up and calibrated and validated again in the neighbouring gauged catchment ouémé river basin this time by calibrating swat using the observed streamflow termed conventional method and iv the simulated streamflow and other water balance variables ensuing from both the regionalisation method and the conventional method were quantitatively compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 research region the study area is located in west africa spanning an area from 6 to 10 latitude and 0 and 6 longitude fig 1 the larger study area encompasses the ungauged ogun river basin gauged ouémé river basin and the mono river basin the relief in the region is flat and low lying and the climate is strongly influenced by the prevailing northeasterlies and southwesterlies the northeasterlies are of dry continental origin and are warm while the southwesterlies originate in the atlantic and are humid rainfall is seasonal with a unimodal rainy season in the northern part and bimodal rainy seasons in the south this study uses a previous swat model set up in the ogun river basin and selected a neighbouring gauged catchment hence the ouémé and mono river basins are also described the ogun river basin 20 292 km2 is located in the southwestern part of nigeria and has elevation ranges from 23 m to 624 m at the highest peak upstream the mean annual temperature is 27 c and the mean annual rainfall 1984 2012 obtained from observed data is 1224 mm year 1 the dry november march and wet april october seasons are two distinguishable seasons in the catchment approximately 24 of the catchment is covered by cropland 1 by urban and 75 by forest the agricultural activity is mainly rainfed crop farming two large reservoirs ikere gorge and oyan dam which are the principal provider of ogun and lagos state public water supply are located within the watershed the ogun river is also used for bathing and washing in densely populated areas along the river the ouémé river basin covers a surface area of 48 292 km2 ouémé river springs from the atakora mountains and is the largest river of benin republic the mono river springs near the benin border northeast of sokodé in togo and occupies an area of 20 289 km2 the mono river flows south and drains into the bight of benin fig 1 2 2 description of the swat model the swat model version 2012 of arcgis interface for swat arcswat was used winchell et al 2013 the soil and water assessment tool swat is an eco hydrological model developed by the united states departments of agricultural research services arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 swat is a semi distributed model that operates at a daily time step and simulates the effect of agricultural land management practices on the water balance components nutrient dynamics and sediment transport the major components of swat include weather hydrology plant growth nutrient erosion land management practices pesticide reservoir and channel routing the swat model has a submodule to simulate plant growth called epic williams et al 1989 this can simulate the growth of many types of trees and crops as land cover 2 2 1 swat model set up in the ungauged ogun river basin the swat model was previously set up in the ogun river basin see odusanya et al 2019 and is briefly described again here due to a lack of observed streamflow data in the ogun river basin the swat model was calibrated validated for aet using satellite derived gleam aet v3 0a data in swat calibration uncertainty programs swat cup abbaspour 2015 an initial pre selection of parameters based on literature research ha et al 2018 rafiei emam et al 2016 bicknell et al 1997 wang et al 2006 was undertaken to choose the most sensitive parameters to aet and ensure that the hydrological processes runoff evaporation interception transpiration and percolation are represented in the parameters during global sensitivity analysis the initial parameter ranges were based on neitsch et al 2002 2005 2011 based on the global sensitivity analysis 11 of the most sensitive parameters were selected and altered during the calibration process a multi site model calibration validation was implemented using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm the calibration period was 1989 2000 and the validated period was 2001 2012 to compute their nse r2 pbias and kge for each sub basin a gleam aet pixel value daily resolution was extracted for each subbasin using arcgis tools aggregated to monthly values and compare to swat simulated aet in each subbasin gleam combines a wide range of remote sensing observation from different satellites to separately estimate the different components of terrestrial evaporation i e open water evaporation bare soil evaporation interception loss transpiration and snow sublimation through a process based methodology miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 gleam aet v3 0a is based on reanalysis net radiation and air temperature a combination of gauged based reanalysis and satellite based precipitation and satellite based vegetation optical depth martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 and has a daily temporal coverage of 35 years 1980 2014 the gleam aet v3 0a was choosing for the swat model calibration validation because it performed better than modis data in the previous study odusanya et al 2019 the non unique parameter sets and their corresponding nse values obtained after the swat calibration with gleam is reported in section 2 4 judging from the four statistical criteria nse r2 kge pbias the overall results of the calibration validation using the satellite based aet were satisfactory table a1 for more detail see odusanya et al 2019 2 2 2 swat model set up in the gauged ouémé river basin in the previous study odusanya et al 2019 the swat model was set up whereby the watershed was divided into 59 sub basins which were subdivided into 1890 hydrological response units hrus the hru is the smallest unit of spatial disaggregation these units consist of homogeneous soil landuse and slope arnold 1998 neitsch et al 2011 in this study 9 soil classes 3 slope categories and 9 landuse classes were used for the ouémé river basin the areas containing the same land use soil type and the same slope range are lumped together in each subbasin to form the hydrologic response unit hrus the sources of data used for the swat model set up are presented in table c1 daily precipitation from twenty six weather stations as well as daily maximum and minimum temperature data from four stations were used as input into the swat model fig 2 the missing minimum and maximum temperature values solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity data were simulated for the basin using the wgen cfsr world weather generator the wgen cfsr world weather database contains long term monthly statistics covering the entire globe developed using global dataset of national centre for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis ncep the descriptive statistics frequency of the missing meteorological data are presented in figs g1 and g2 potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated using hargreaves pet surface runoff was simulated using daily rainfall and with the modified soil conservation services scs curve number method streamflow was routed through the channel using the variable storage coefficient method 2 3 description of the regionalisation approach in this study we use the proximate similarity approach for evaluating the simulated streamflow from swat calibrated with satellite based aet data in the ungauged ogun river basin this approach is based on the assumption that catchments geographically close to one another show more similar hydrological characteristics than those far apart from each other due to gradual and smooth changes in climate and catchment conditions in space merz and blöschl 2004 oudin et al 2008 vandewiele and elias 1995 in addition to the proximity transfer we also implement the physical similarity approach which considers the climate and catchments attributes with the rationale that catchments with similar climate and attributes even if far apart from each other should behave similarly in terms of hydrological processes and that the calibrated parameter set can be transferable to the similar catchment arsenault et al 2019 kay et al 2007 merz et al 2006 in spatial proximity the gauged catchments are selected based only on the spatial distance without any information about catchment attributes oudin et al 2008 on the other hand for the physical similarity approach the gauged catchments are selected based on their attributes kay et al 2007 merz et al 2006 the catchment attributes are also known as catchment characteristics or descriptors table 4 in this study the similarity based approach considers both the spatial proximity and physical similarity in the selection of similar catchment and the parameter transfer this has proven to be valuable for hydrological regionalisation purposes and performs slightly better than approaches based on either spatial proximity or physical similarity alone zhang and chiew 2009 in one of the several methods of regionalisation a gauged catchment is set up with a model that is parameterised and calibrated and then the calibrated model parameters based on the appropriate similarity measure are transferred to an ungauged catchment arsenault et al 2019 kay et al 2007 in this study the calibrated model parameters from swat set up in the ungauged ogun river basin were directly transferred to one selected similar neighbouring gauged catchment 2 3 1 spatial proximity firstly the multiple ring buffer tool from the arcgis toolbox was used to create an area feature at a specified distance around the ogun target catchment to identify gauged catchments that are geographically proximate fig 1 secondly the spatial proximity method was implemented to select gauged catchments that are most geographically proximate to the ogun river basin the proximity is measured by the spatial distance between catchment centroids to select the geographic neighbour catchments for parameter regionalisation we use the simple euclidian distance d u g between the catchment centroids to compute the geographical distance between the ungauged and gauged catchments as implemented in previous studies arsenault et al 2019 he et al 2011 poissant et al 2017 yang et al 2018 1 d u g x u x g 2 y u y g 2 where x u y u and x g y g are the geographical coordinate of the centroids of the ungauged and gauged catchments respectively and d u g is the distance between them to be able to use the geographical coordinates to calculate the euclidean distance we removed the special characters degree minutes and seconds and converted the coordinates to decimal degrees 2 3 2 physical similarity the similarity index is chosen to quantify what makes two catchments similar in terms of climate and catchment characteristics attribute the catchment attributes used in the physical similarity analysis climate catchment and runoff similarity are presented in table 4 and table b1 the hydrologic signatures flow indices are used for the runoff characteristics several similarity indices computed from catchment attributes have been implemented in regionalisation studies burn 1993 kay et al 2007 oudin et al 2008 samuel et al 2011 li et al 2015 to measure the physical similarity between the gauged and ungauged catchments we adapted the similarity index θ defined by burn 1993 calculated as follows 2 θ i 1 k cd g i cd u i cd i where θ is the similarity index of g catchment to u catchment cd is the catchment descriptor also known as catchment characteristics or attribute g denotes the gauged catchment u denotes the ungauged catchment k is the total number of catchment descriptors and δcd i is the range of ith catchment descriptor the δcd i is defined as the difference between the highest and lowest values of the catchment descriptors to find it we subtract the lowest value of the catchment descriptor from the highest since the catchment descriptors table 4 are not in the same unit and scale the values were standardised by the division with the total range of catchment descriptors δcd i next the gauged catchments are ranked in order of similarity using the result of both spatial proximity and physical similarity the rank accumulated similarity oudin et al 2008 was used to select the most similar gauged catchment to ungauged ogun river basin for proximity the gauged catchments were ranked by decreasing proximity to the ungauged catchment for physical similarity the gauged catchment with the most similar attribute i e the one with the smallest similarity index to the ungauged catchment is considered rank 1 the catchment with the second most similar attribute is considered rank 2 the total rank is the arithmetic total of the rank numbers obtained from each of the measures proximity and physical similarity for each catchment the gauged catchment with the smallest total rank is considered and selected for the parameter regionalisation the description and sources of input data used to perform the similarity analysis are presented in table c1 the mathematical formulation used in estimating the values of the climate indices and flow indices are presented in table d1 the mean runoff coefficient for the ungauged ogun river basin was estimated using the satellite based calibrated swat simulated streamflow while the observed streamflow was used in the gauged catchments 2 4 evaluating the calibrated model set up with satellite based aet data in ogun river basin to evaluate the simulated streamflow of swat set up in the ungauged ogun river basin that was calibrated with aet data from gleam a similar gauged catchment was chosen section 2 3 to transfer the calibrated parameters from the swat model setup in ogun in a first step all the non unique swat parameter sets that met the objective criteria nse 0 59 during the aet calibration in the ogun river basin were directly transferred to the selected gauged basin i e regionalisation method a multi site model optimisation was implemented and was used to spatially distribute the parameters the model in file with sufi 2 algorithm in swatcup programme was used to read in the parameters and the swat edit executive application in swat model was used to edit the default parameters in swat the simulated output was assessed in the four gauging stations using the observed streamflow and evaluated using the four performance metric nse r2 kge and pbias in this study the non unique parameter sets are considered in the evaluation because model calibration is inherently non unique during hydrological model calibration there can exist several parameters sets that provide equally suitable model responses that ensure a minimum level of model performance and these are known as non unique parameter sets which is also known as equifinality beven 1996 the solution to a calibration therefore is many sets of parameters hence reporting one solution out of many of similarly good solutions will be quite misleading the transferred parameters are listed in table 1 it should be noted that out of the eleven sensitive aet parameters used for the ogun river basin calibration ten were transferred to the selected gauged catchment the parameter for the lake evaporation coefficient v evrsv res was excluded because no reservoirs are present in the gauged catchment the description of swat parameters used in this study is presented in table e1 in a second step the swat model set up in the selected gauged catchment was calibrated using the monthly measured streamflow at several gauges available in the catchment i e conventional method this setup is considered to be a reference set up a multi site monthly time step model calibration and validation at the four gauges located within the catchment was implemented the sensitivity analysis calibration validation and uncertainty analysis of the simulated streamflow was carried out using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 which uses a stochastic procedure for drawing independent parameter sets using latin hypercube sampling lhs a global sensitivity analysis was carried out based on multiple regressions in which parameter sensitivities were determined by numerous rounds of lhs to select the most sensitive parameters which were indicated by the p value and the t stat value the p value determines the significance of the sensitivity in which a value closer to zero is more significant the t stat value provides a measure of parameter sensitivity in which a larger absolute value is more sensitive using the sufi 2 algorithm two indices p factor and r factor were used to quantify the uncertainties associated with the modelling and to judge the strength of the calibration and validation in which the ideal situation would be to account for 100 of the observed data i e streamflow or aet in the 95 predictive uncertainty 95ppu while at the same time have an r factor close to zero the p factor represents the percentage of observed data plus its error bracketed by the 95ppu band and varies from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates a 100 bracketing of the observed data within model simulations while the r factor is the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu and the standard deviation of the observed variable this value ranges between 0 and infinity we evaluated the swat simulated monthly streamflow from the regionalisation method and the conventional method by using the monthly observed streamflow in the gauged catchment and calculating four performance metrics table d2 the coefficient of determination r2 describes the proportion of the variance in the measured data which is explained by the model with higher values indicating less error variance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse quantifies the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance the kling gupta efficiency kge provides an analysis of the relative importance of different component correlation bias and variability and the percent bias pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observations the model performance rating for aet and streamflow simulations at a monthly time step are based on moriasi et al 2007 and kouchi et al 2017 presented in table f1 further evaluation of water balance components was undertaken by i comparing the performance of previously swat simulated aet in the ungauged ogun river basin odusanya et al 2019 to the performance of the swat simulated aet using the regionalisation method ii comparing the swat simulated soil water water yield and percolation from the regionalisation method to the conventional method the schematic of the study workflow is shown in fig 3 in the swat model the aet is defined as the amount of water that is actually removed from a surface due to the processes of evaporation and transpiration mm water yield wyld is the net amount of water that leaves the subbasin and contributes to streamflow in the reach mm percolation perc is the water that percolates past the root zones mm and the soil water sw is the amount of water in the soil profile mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 catchment proximity and similarity analysis three entire river basins were encompassed within the chosen 400 km radius of the ogun river basin their outlets are marked in fig 1 the ouémé and the mono river basins were gauged and had available and accessible data for catchment similarity analysis the geographical distance between the ungauged ogun river basin centroid and the other river basin centroids table 2 shows that the ouémé river basin is the most proximate ranking the gauged river basins by their increasing proximity smallest to largest distance to the ungauged ogun river basin shows that ouémé river basin was closer that the mono river basin we thus chose to focus on ouémé river basin and furthermore calculated the geographical distance between the location of each of its gauges bétérou savè atchérigbé bonou and ogun river basin centroid table 3 the result show that savè gauge and the outlet gauge at bonou are most proximate to the ogun river basin the units are in degrees kilometres for the physical similarity measure using the catchment descriptors in table 4 the similarity index results table 5 show that ouémé has the smallest value catchment with the most similar attributes the similarity is zero if the catchment attributes in the two catchments are identical and increases as the attributes become more dissimilar thus ouémé river basin has the most similar attributes to ogun river basin and therefore is ranked 1 a qualitative description of the meteorological attributes of the ogun ouémé and mono river basins all show similar rainfall patterns in the lower half the catchments table b1 and all have a similar climate according to the köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 peel et al 2007 the arithmetic total rank for the spatial proximity and the physical similarity results for the ouémé river basin was estimated to be slightly higher than mono river basin based on the spatial proximity and physical similarity results it is evident that both the ouémé and mono catchments are quite similar to the ogun river basin however considering the availability of sufficient streamflow data the ouémé catchment was selected for evaluating the streamflow simulated in ungauged ogun river basin the description of swat model set up in the gauged ouémé river basin is presented in section 2 2 2 3 2 performance of simulated streamflow from the regionalisation method in the ouémé river basin the resulting six non unique streamflow simulations obtained at the gauging stations bétérou savè atchérigbé and bonou fig 2 were evaluated against observed streamflow data fig 4 as a check the simulated streamflow s from the transferred parameters and the observed streamflow were compared to the uncalibrated swat model performance fig 4 a satisfactory streamflow performance was only achieved at the middle savè and at the outlet bonou gauge of ouémé river basin fig 4 and table 6 from the nse values all the six simulated streamflows at savè are satisfactory while at bonou three of the simulated streamflows are satisfactory table 6 the satisfactory streamflow performance at the savè and bonou gauges may be attributed to the proximity of these gauges to the ogun river basin figs 1 and 2 and table 3 as they are both located in the lower half of the ouémé catchment furthermore fig 2 and fig hi show the similarity in rainfall pattern bimodal between the ogun river basin and the southern part of the ouémé river basin the poor performance obtained at the gauges with relatively lower flows bétérou and atchérigbé highlights the weaknesses in the regionalisation method to capture the low streamflow fluxes specifically the transferred parameters did not adequately reproduce the observed streamflow at the bétérou gauge which is located in the headwater and is inherently difficult to simulate may be due to dissimilar topography however the poor performance may also be attributed to the dissimilar climate in the northern part of ouémé river basin to that of the ogun river basin from where the parameters were transferred fig 2 and fig h1 another reason the regionalisation method did not capture the peak flows at bétérou gauging stations is due to the uncertainty in the rainfall data in the northern part of ouémé river basin where the bétérou gauge is located 3 out of the 9 rainfall stations have frequent approximately 10 missing daily rainfall 1000 of 9497 data points fig g1 although the missing rainfall data was simulated using the weather generator it may introduce some uncertainty despite the atchérigbé gauging station located in southern part of ouémé river basin both have a similar climate the poor streamflow performance is most likely attributed to the gauge being the furthest distance measured by its proximity away from the ogun river basin table 3 3 3 performance of simulated streamflow from the conventional method from the global sensitivity analysis 13 of the most sensitive parameters in the swat model were selected for further calibration table 7 a multi site calibration was performed to reach a reasonable result two iterations for the calibration were performed the first with 1000 simulations and the second with 500 simulations the highest nse reached with the p factor and r factor is 0 73 after calibration the six best parameter sets were chosen they all met an objective criterion of nse 0 70 and these were used to run swat 1980 2005 for the final streamflow simulation and overall model evaluation table 8 the six non unique parameter sets were chosen in order to compare the same number of non unique parameter sets as in the regionalisation method the description of swat model parameters used in this study is presented in table e1 the result of the observed and the simulated streamflow fig 5 and table 8 depict an improved and satisfactory swat model performance compared with the regionalisation method fig 4b and table 6 the flow dynamics are well simulated at all gauges and a satisfactory streamflow performance is obtained at most gauges except at the headwater gauge bétérou station the pbias however remains high 30 at some gauges the better performance can easily be explained by the fact that when parameters are calibrated for a specific catchment they are most suited for that particular watershed as they are able to reproduce the hydrological processes more accurately the better simulated monthly streamflow obtained at the atchérigbé station compared to the bétérou station agrees with a previous study using swat bossa et al 2014 and is attributed to the similarity of the rainfall pattern to the south of ouémé river basin where the gauge is located fig g1 the satisfactory result of the streamflow simulated by swat at the four gauges agrees with another study berenger et al 2018 conducted in ouémé river basin 3 4 performance of simulated aet from the regionalisation method the performance of the simulated aet when the six best parameter sets of the calibrated swat model in the ogun river basin were transferred into the swat set up for the ouémé river basin for the period 1980 2005 is given in table 9 the simulated aet was evaluated with respect to gleam aet v3 0a in the previous research odusanya et al 2019 the period of simulation was split into two therefore the performance of the simulated aet in ouémé was compared with the performance of simulated aet in ogun in both periods the results for ouémé show a lower aet model performance nse kge pbias and higher model dynamics r2 table 9 and table a1 reason for the lower performance of simulated aet in the regionalisation method can be attributed to the spatial loss in model performance when parameters are transfer from one gauge to another and the parameter values being not specifically tuned to the new conditions after transfer at all 4 gauges in the ouémé catchment when the swat model is run with the six non unique parameter sets the simulated aet shows a slight improvement nse r2 kge compared with the uncalibrated aet table 10 and fig 6 the temporal dynamics of the aet were reproduced in most simulations as given by the r2 at the ouémé river basin outlet bonou the aet was simulated the best which could be due to the similar climate conditions fig 2 fig h1 and table b1 in the lower half of the ogun and south of ouémé catchments comparing the swat simulated aet performances at the four gauges it is apparent that a satisfactory aet simulation does not necessarily entail an acceptable streamflow simulation tables 6 and 10 in the ogun river basin the optimal parameter set number 1 that provided the best aet simulation based on the nse odusanya et al 2019 also resulted in the highest nse for aet simulations in the ouémé river basin table 10 but the best parameter set did not have the highest nse for the streamflow simulations at any of the four gauges in the ouémé river basin table 6 the result obtained agrees with a study in chindwin basin south east asia sirisena et al 2020 in which the swat model was calibrated using aet and streamflow data separately when one variable was calibrated alone it led to a satisfactory performance but resulted in a reduced performance of the other variable however in ouémé river basin both the simulated aet and the simulated streamflow at the outlet gauge bonou were satisfactory in three of the six non unique parameter sets this is most likely associated with the more similar hydrologic climatic conditions in the southern part of both catchments and for which the transferred parameters were able to successfully reproduce the hydrological processes fig 2 and fig h1 streamflow and aet are both important hydrological output fluxes from the steady state rainfall runoff process previous studies on calibration of hydrologic model awra l using remotely sensed evapotranspiration and soil moisture for streamflow prediction kunnath poovakka et al 2016 have reported a strong dependence between et and streamflow it is reported that some swat model parameters are sensitive to both streamflow and aet processes abbaspour et al 2017 jin and jin 2020 sirisena et al 2020 in this study cn2 epco sol bd alpha bf are sensitive to both streamflow and aet tables 1 and 7 since these parameters need to satisfy both processes an increase or decrease in one flux will affect the other one hence there may be a trade off or lower performance for one variable when the other is solely calibrated also the satisfactory aet simulation that does not necessarily entail an acceptable streamflow simulation may be due to the regionalisation methods one of the challenges of regionalisation method is that the simulations of the ungauged catchments do not usually perform nearly as well as in the gauged catchments parajka et al 2007 2005 3 5 comparing the regionalisation method with the conventional method 3 5 1 simulated streamflow the conventional method was a benchmark against which to measure the performance of applying satellite aet data to calibrate the swat model in an ungauged basin in this study the streamflow simulated using the conventional method outperformed the streamflow simulated using the regionalisation method overall by considering the non unique parameters the streamflow was satisfactorily simulated at all four gauges also by considering the optimum parameter set simulation 1 only a satisfactory streamflow performance with the nse and r2 is obtained at savè atchérigbé and bonou with all the four metrics and at bétérou with the nse and r2 metrics table 8 the better performance of the conventional method for streamflow simulation compared agrees with a study carried out using the hydrological model pcr globwb calibrated with gleam aet v 3 0a and observed streamflow in the central western morocco lópez lópez et al 2017 in the regionalisation approach by considering the non unique parameters an overall satisfactory simulated streamflow was obtained at two of the four gauges savè and bonou in the ouémé river basin from the optimum parameter set alone simulation 1 a satisfactory streamflow simulation is obtained at savè with all the four metrics whereas at bonou only the kge and r2 and at atchérigbé only the r2 metric were satisfactory table 6 reasons for the lower performance of simulated streamflow in the regionalisation method are due to the parameter values being not specifically tuned to the new conditions after transfer as well as the courser resolution of the gleam aet data compared to the average size of an hru in the swat model setup in the ogun catchment and the weighted average gleam aet pixel values that were applied to each subbasin in swat this latter reason is confirmed by a previous study kunnath poovakka et al 2016 that reported the quality e g resolution and retrieval algorithm of satellite based aet for calibration is critical to produce reliable streamflow predictions therefore the simulated streamflow of the regionalisation method could partly be improved if a finer spatial resolution of the gleam aet data was available 3 5 2 simulated soil water water yield and percolation a visual assessment of further swat simulated water balance components at the four gauges in the ouémé river basin ensuing from the regionalisation method and considering the non unique parameter sets shows that the soil water sw content in the soil profile 0 200 cm is higher and that the water percolated to the root zone perc and water yield wyld are lower especially at bonou compared to the conventional method figs i1 j1 and k1 thus the regionalisation method clearly shows that using satellite based aet in model calibration has a greater impact on the vertical water flux through the soil horizons than the conventional method our previous study odusanya et al 2021 showed a similar result of the greater impact of solely satellite based aet calibration on the vertical flux through the soil horizons in the ouémé river basin the sw has a fundamental role in the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and infiltration and thus governs the partitioning of the energy and mass fluxes between land and the atmosphere brocca et al 2017 2010 koster et al 2010 therefore including satellite based sw as well as other variables such as leaf area index to calibrate a hydrological model in an ungauged basin could improve the model performance at all gauges our water balance analysis agrees with a previous study rajib et al 2018 which reported that a hydrologic model calibrated against only aet or sw would produce too little or too much of a vertical water flux either to the atmosphere or through soil horizons unless the horizontal water routing in the model are also simultaneously adjusted hence our result produced too much of a vertical water flux through the soil horizons fig i1 birkel et al 2014 also reported that the information contained in streamflow time series may not sufficiently capture how vertical fluxes evolve at different spatial and temporal scales within the watershed therefore some studies kunnath poovakka et al 2016 rientjes et al 2013 shahrban et al 2018 suggested that multi variable calibration of streamflow and aet in hydrologic models is recommended as a best practice also simulations from a conceptual hydrologic model for austria showed that the use of both streamflow and satellite based topsoil moisture data provided more robust parameter values than using either of the observed data alone during calibration parajka et al 2009 since the study strives to use freely available global satellite based data to estimate streamflow for ungauged basins the simulated streamflow of the regionalisation method could be improved by considering multi variable model calibration in the ungauged basin using satellite based products such as sw and leaf area index 3 6 uncertainty analysis of the modelling framework 3 6 1 swat model previously set up in the ungauged ogun river basin the uncertainty associated with the aet simulations for each of the 53 subbasins to map error sources and uncertainties stemming from parameters input data and model conceptualisation in the swat model that was previously set up in the ogun river basin see odusanya et al 2019 is briefly described again here in the calibration period the values of the p factor obtained were between 0 50 and 0 90 and the values of the r factor were between 1 40 and 2 4 in the validation period the values of p factor were between 0 6 and 0 88 and that of the r factor were between 1 43 and 2 5 although the r factor was quite large in all the 53 subbasins indicating large model uncertainties the p factor values revealed that more than half of the satellite based aet plus its error are bracketed by the 95 predictive uncertainty in all the 53 subbasins 3 6 2 swat model set up in the gauged ouémé river basin 3 6 2 1 swat model calibrated with observed streamflow the quantification of the uncertainty associated with the swat simulated streamflow when observed streamflow data was used to calibrate the model conventional method shows that the r factors were high at the four gauging stations especially at savè and bonou fig 7 the p factor values at savè and bonou in both the calibration and validation periods show that over half of the observed streamflow points are bracketed by the 95ppu while at bétérou and atchérigbé gauges the observed streamflow points bracketed by the 95ppu are around 50 this signifies that the 95ppu of the simulated streamflow captured at least half of the observed streamflow values at savè and bonou whereas at bétérou and atchérigbé gauges the 95ppu did not capture all the observed streamflow point fig 7 in table 8 and fig 5 the high pbias at the bétérou gauge and the failure of swat parameters calibrated with observed streamflow to capture the peak flow at the gauges especially at bétérou and atchérigbé may be attributed to the uncertainty in the driving variables and input data e g landuse map rainfall and temperature data for instance we observe a high percentage of missing rainfall data at the upper part of ouémé river basin fig g1 that contributed to the large r value obtained at all of the gauges 3 6 2 2 swat model run with the non unique transferred parameter sets using this regionalisation approach there is a loss of model performance that leads to decrease in streamflow simulation when compared to using locally calibrated parameters which is not surprising and has been confirmed by others merz and blöschl 2004 moges et al 2021 therefore to reduce the accumulated uncertainties stemming from each modelling step of the simulated streamflow from the regionalisation method a multi objective calibration that incorporate other variables i e lai with other water balance components e g sm aet is suggested in both the gauged and ungauged catchments the streamflow performance resulting from applying the regionalised parameters can be improved if input data uncertainty is reduced by using a high resolution and high quality input data in the model setups continuous time series of rainfall input and choosing a catchment with no climatic gradient 4 conclusion a framework using a regionalisation approach for evaluating satellite based aet data for calibrating streamflow in ungauged basins is presented in this study we deepen the research undertaken in odusanya et al 2019 and verify the validity of simulating streamflow in the ungauged ogun river basin the resulting calibrated non unique parameters from the setup in the ogun catchment are transferred to a carefully selected similar neighbouring gauged catchment ouémé river basin in which the swat simulated streamflow can be evaluated using the observed discharge data the swat model performance in the ogun ungauged catchment calibrated with satellite aet data can thus be evaluated by using a regionalisation method whereby the gauged ouémé catchment is the site of evaluation the simulated streamflow using the conventional method showed a better performance at all four gauges in the ouémé river basin and for all four statistical metrics compared to the regionalisation method this was not surprisingly due to final calibrated parameter values that were more suitable to the catchment compared to the transferred parameter values from the regionalisation method however our study findings reveal that when considering the non unique parameter sets satellite based aet can be used for calibrating hydrological models to simulate streamflow in ungauged basins with a good level of confidence in the gauged ouémé river basin with the regionalisation method the streamflow and aet were both satisfactorily simulated at two gauges the gauge located in the middle of the catchment savè judged by 2 metrics and the gauge at the outlet bonou judged by four metrics it is important to consider the non unique parameter sets during the transfer since some of these simulations may perform better than when only considering the optimum parameter set for some gauges in the ouémé river basin obtaining a satisfactory aet simulation did not necessarily lead to an acceptable streamflow simulation the regionalisation method showed that using satellite based aet in model calibration has a greater impact on the vertical water flux through the soil horizons than the conventional method we suggest for future work to use additional available satellite based data i e the leaf area index and soil moisture data to perform a multi variable model calibration as this may improve the vertical water flux as well as the simulated streamflow to reduce the effect of the accumulated uncertainties stemming from the regionalisation method we suggest using continuous climate data and or high resolution satellite input data to set up swat whenever possible the study also applied various statistical measures to quantify the uncertainty in the modelling and the regionalisation method these results reveal uncertainties from the transferred parameters contributing to low performance of the simulated streamflow at some gauges we identified several possible factors for the low performance of the simulated streamflow including a climatic gradient in the recipient catchment high resolution of the satellite based aet data and the spatial loss of model performance due to parameter transfer from the ungauged to gauged catchment our results are helpful to show how using aet data to calibrate swat in an ungauged basin and using a regionalisation approach for assessing simulated streamflow in an ungauged basin is plausible when care is taken to identify physiographic meteorological and hydrological similar catchments to the donor catchment this regionalisation approach contributes to advancements in alternative means of modelling and evaluation of hydrological model simulations in an ungauged basin our methodological framework can be implemented using other hydrological models in an ungauged basin also those located in different geophysical settings author contributions abolanle e odusanya bano mehdi schulz and karsten schulz

8049,study region northern finland study focus this study examined long term decade scale hydrological and ecological consequences of dam construction and subsequent river regulation on the environmentally protected viiankiaapa mire pre regulation floods affected the hydrology of the riverbanks and the viiankiaapa mire which contain habitats of flood dependent or groundwater influenced ecosystems groundwater discharge and flow patterns and pre regulation flood coverage were simulated to investigate the impact of river regulation on the mire area new hydrological insights for the region the flood models indicate that regular flooding covered the westernmost part of the mire before the regulation groundwater modelling suggests that the regulation has raised the locations of springs in the river shore reduced the hydraulic gradient towards the river raised the groundwater table in the river banks and the western part of the viiankiaapa mire and increased groundwater discharge in the mire the groundwater flow models and the stable isotopic composition of water indicate that the constructed dam changed the groundwater flow directions close to dam the ecological effects of regulation were mixed the studied flood dependent plant species declined due to the reduction in floods after regulation conversely the occurrence of hamatocaulis vernicosus and hamatocaulis lapponicus appears to be related to the high water table and groundwater discharge areas in the mire suggesting suitable habitat for these species may have expanded after the regulation

diverse habitats for plants malmer 1986 siegel and glaser 1987 the composition of subpeat sediments is also an important aspect since the existence of a high conductivity zone beneath a mire enhances vertical flow creating spatial variation in gw discharge and recharge areas åberg et al 2021 reeve et al 2000 siegel 1988 if a mire is located close to a river the hydrology of the mire complex can be affected by variation in the river stage related to natural flooding or regulation river water infiltrates into adjacent aquifers and mixes with gw during high stages and discharges back to the river following a decrease in the river stage mccallum et al 2010 the purpose of river regulation is usually to reduce the intensity of floods in the river basin to generate hydroelectric power or a combination of these hancock 2002 river regulation affects the hydrogeological settings changing the hydraulic gradient near the riverbanks and altering gw surface water sw levels and interactions fette et al 2005 nilsson and berggren 2000 if regulation is aimed at flood protection it tends to reduce the annual variation in the river stage and stabilize the hydrological setting gw discharge areas will change if the regulated river stage is set to a level that prominently differs from the natural level this will also affect flood plain habitats the effect of river regulation on the gw flow patterns of hyporheic and riparian zones has been discussed in andrén et al 2011 and kløve et al 2011 river regulation can usually affect the gw flow pattern e g gw hydraulic gradient and groundwater discharge rates and locations of riparian zones up to hundreds of kilometres downstream gerecht et al 2011 simultaneously affecting gw fluxes and the water quality of the underlying

regulation on aquifers further in river banks have rarely been investigated boutt and fleming 2009 gerecht et al 2011 sawyer et al 2009 gw flow recharge and discharge patterns and their connections with sw bodies can be examined using finite difference gw flow model codes such as modflow the modflow river package harbaugh 2005 has frequently been used to simulate gw sw interactions barthel and banzhaf 2016 these interactions can be modelled in more detail with fully integrated models such as parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 or hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 or coupled models such as mike she hughes and liu 2008 changes in boundary conditions e g the river stage due to river regulation can be used to investigate the effect of this regulation on gw recharge discharge patterns 3d hydrostratigraphic modelling is a prerequisite for constructing 3d gw flow models pasanen and okkonen 2017 ross et al 2005 furthermore the importance of the geological complexity should not be underestimated as according to åberg et al 2021 and artimo 2002 the geological hydrostratigraphic detail of the model adds detail to gw recharge discharge and flow patterns especially in recently glaciated areas glaciated areas are challenging to model since the k variation of the system is usually high due to interlayered sorted sediments and glacial tills glacial tills can have orders of magnitudes lower k compared to interlayered sorted sediments causing dispersion recharge discharge and flow pattern and an increase in vertical flow component åberg et al 2021 in northern finland the

development of viiankiaapa hydrology before and under river regulation the purpose of the studies is to collect more information to assess the sensitivity of the mire ecosystem to anthropogenic influences the aim of the present study was to understand how the regulation of the river kitinen and especially the construction of the matarakoski and kelukoski hydroelectric power plants has affected the flood coverage gw flow patterns and gw discharge areas and habitats of groundwater influenced plant species in the riverbanks and in the adjacent viiankiaapa mire two hypotheses are presented here 1 the regulation of the river has reduced flooding and altered the elevation of the river stage affecting water table depth gw flow direction and distribution of gw discharge areas and thus hydrology of the viiankiaapa mire and 2 the regulation has changed the gw flow directions near the matarakoski dam from nesw to ns which has subsequently affected mire hydrology the presented hypotheses were tested using 3d gw flow models based on a hydrostratigraphic model constructed with leapfrog geo seequent according to methods presented in åberg et al 2021 the model results were verified with measurements of the stable isotopic composition of the water flood modelling was used to model the flood coverage of pre regulation settings 2 geological and hydrological background of

unpublished report the gw flow direction was towards the river kitinen in the sahankangas area fig 8a a pumping test in the western part of sahankangas 25 november11 december 1986 also indicated that a pumping rate of 370 m3 d 1 did not affect the groundwater flow direction the observations from the western flank of the river kitinen indicate that gw flowed towards the river kitinen from the koistamonpulju mire area in 1988 and 1995 4 methods the changes in the hydrological settings due to the regulation of the river kitinen were investigated with 1 2d flood modelling in order to define the flood coverage area in 1966 and 1987 and 2 two 3d gw flow models post2014 and pre1989 in order to examine how the regulation has affected the distribution of gw discharge areas especially in the viiankiaapa mire since both flood models and the pre1989 gw flow model were set before the construction of the matarakoski power plant fig a 1 the pre regulation topography was constructed based on changes in the river coverage area in this section the construction of the pre regulation topography flood models and groundwater flow models are described the gw flow model results for post2014 were verified with measurements of the stable isotopic composition of water in the matarakoski area 4 1 construction of pre regulation topography due to changes in the river distribution and topography in the gravel intake area the pre regulation topography was created from a two metre resolution lidar dem light detection and ranging digital elevation model constructed in 2010 2015 the gravel intake area in kärväsniemi see fig 1 vs fig 6 was reconstructed by interpolating the original topography from the contours of the 1989 basic map next the river area was reconstructed with idw interpolation philip and watson 1982 by utilizing a cross section of the river stage huokuna 1991 and a 1989 base map nlsf the missing shore area between the pre regulation stage lower and the present stage higher of the river kitinen see fig 4 fig 8 was interpolated from the altitudes of the river boundaries the reconstructed areas were mosaicked to the lidar dem and the topography of the other areas was assumed to have remained unchanged since 1989 4 2 pre regulation flood estimation and flood frequency flood modelling was performed with hec ras the us army corps of engineers brunner 1995 to estimate the pre regulation flood coverage and its possible effect on the distribution of gw influenced mire species two 2d flood models with a diffusion wave equation brunner 2016 were used for flood simulation the selected simulation periods were 12 28 may 1966 and 12 25 may 1987 the topography for the flood models was constructed by mosaicking the leapfrog generated river bottom to the pre regulation topography river discharge data from the petkula station from may 1966 and river stage data from may 1987 huokuna 1991 were used as input data in the boundary condition of the flow hydrograph in the present matarakoski area river stage data from 1987 were converted to a discharge rate based on a rating curve from the results of the 1966 model fig a 2b the southern border of the model area covering the rivers välijoki and kitinen was delineated with a normal depth boundary condition with a friction slope value of 0 0004 based on the average slope of the river stage manning s roughness parameters for the river channel and model area were estimated based on values presented in brunner 2016 different manning s roughness values for the river bottom were tested to estimate the river stage rise of four to five metres in 1966 the 1987 river stage was corrected from the n43 to the n2000 altitude system by adding 0 427 m to each measurement nlsf 2021 https www maanmittauslaitos

formula to the rating curve based on the 1966 flood model results the daily precipitation data for may 1966 and 1987 ilmatieteen laitos https www ilmatieteenlaitos fi havaintojen lataus last access 4 march 2021 were used for the precipitation boundary condition on the model grids of the corresponding models the snow water equivalent swe was calculated from snow depth data of the finnish meteorological institute ilmatieteen laitos https www ilmatieteen laitos fi havaintojen lataus last access 4 march 2021 based on the simplification that the density of snow was constantly 0 3 g cm 3 which correspond to the average snow density in forests of boreal areas bormann et al 2013 moreover the change in the daily swe was added to the precipitation boundary condition which was assumed to present simplified melting of the snow the effects of possible ice jams were omitted due to non existent numerical observations the recurrence interval for the 1966 flood was estimated by calculating the flooding frequencies using the pre regulation annual maximum discharges 1961 1970 see fig a 1 the defined recurrence intervals were also applied to estimate the exceedance probability and recurrence interval of the 1987 flood the weibull plotting position equation eq 1 and the log pearson type iii distribution viessman and lewis 2003 with frequency factors derived from haan 1977 were used to calculate the recurrence interval t for the selected discharge rates 1 p m n 1 t 1 p where m is the maximum annual discharge ranked from lowest to highest p is the exceedance probability n is the length of the datasets in years and t is the recurrence interval 4 3 hydrostratigraphic modelling and gw flow modelling a previously constructed 3d geological model gm2 in åberg et al 2021 was updated with leapfrog geo fig 9 based on additional ground penetrating radar gpr campaigns during winter 2019 2020 åberg 2021 kultti et al 2020 unpublished report the main updates regarding the bedrock units were the separation of the weathered bedrock unit into separate grus and clay type weathered bedrock units åberg 2021 to correspond more closely to the presumed weathering profile hall et al 2015 hirvas 1991 wright 1992 the main changes regarding quaternary deposits were made in the pahanlaaksonmaa and kiimakuusikko tihiämaa and kersilönkangas areas fig 1c based on gpr interpretations the unit called lowest till was redefined and edited based on gpr interpretations as basal unknown sediment due to the lack of reference data on its physical properties fig 9 the quaternary sediment and weathered and fractured bedrock units were modelled with methods presented in åberg et al 2017 2019 åberg et al 2021 and åberg 2021 the horizontal resolution of this updated model was 20 20 m and the model covered an area of 6 8 km as presented in fig 1 the updated geological model åberg 2021 was converted into two versions of the hydrostratigraphic model defined as post2014 and pre1989 the post2014 model was used to represent the present regulated settings and the pre1989 model represented the situation before the construction of the matarakoski power plant fig a 1 since the oldest gw table observations were from 1988 the layer structure and coverage of pre1989 was similar to post2014 except that the topography was changed to the pre regulation topography and the river bottom mesh was changed to correspond to the distribution of the 1989 maps the leapfrog generated hydrostratigraphic models were converted to steady state moflow nwt gw flow models niswonger et al 2011 with methods described in åberg et al 2019 2021 the hydraulic conductivities k were interpolated with observation points and dummy points within the hydrostratigraphic units with horizontal k hk multipliers table a 1 similarly to åberg et al 2019 constant values of hk were used for two peat layers the river kitinen the lowest sands and gravels unit the basal unknown sediment grus type weathered bedrock and clay type weathered bedrock vertical anisotropy vani of the surficial deposit was 10 and vani of the bedrock units was 1 similarly as in åberg et al 2019 vani of peat was 10 which was based on permeameter measurements in turtiainen 2020 an additional parameter zone fine representing the flood plain sediments on the shores of the river kitinen was delineated within the top deposit unit based on gpr interpretation table a 1 the bedrock faults were divided into three groups brittle faults thrust faults and clay filled faults the defined k values were based on measurements from grain size analyses and slug tests golder associates 2012 unpublished report åberg et al 2019 aa sakatti mining oy 2019 unpublished data in surficial deposits and packer spinner and constant head tests in bedrock skr 2019 unpublished data the steady state flow models were used to examine the possible changes in gw flow patterns due to the regulation of the river kitinen head dependent boundaries were modelled with the general head boundary ghb package in model borders with a sedimentary area whereas constant head boundaries chd were used in model borders next to the mire areas the surface of the mire area was modelled with the drain package drn mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 assuming that if the water table rises above the model surface the water disappears from the model as gw discharge the recharge package rch was used with two parameter zones in forested areas and open water and mire areas as presented in åberg et al 2021 the parameter values were based on the precipitation of the hydrological years november 1987 to november 1988 and november 2013 to november 2014 in the pre1989 and post2014 models respectively groundwater recharge was modified from previous models in åberg et al 2021 due to some changes in the distributions of surficial sediments the recharge in the mire area which was constant in the previous models åberg et al 2021 2019 was changed to vary based on the properties of the subpeat sediments table a 1 4 4 calibration of the gw flow models model calibration was performed with a stochastic method using the randpar1 utility of the pest suite doherty 2018 parameters that had the highest uncertainty in actual physical properties and k were selected for the generation of 100 random parameter sets which were used to run both models 100 times the selected parameters were brittle faults thrust faults basal unknown sediment lowest sands and gravels floodplain fines clay type and grus type weathered bedrock and riv conductance table a 1 maximum and minimum values of the parameter sets were based on test calibrations with parameter estimation and measured k table a 1 the model fit of the 100 models was evaluated to find a parameter set having adequate fit between observed and simulated heads in both models rmse mae and bias of the head observations were calculated for 100 different model results in both models to evaluate their performance in addition rmse mae and bias were separately calculated for groundwater surface water and springs to inspect the errors in different head observation datasets simultaneously the correlations between the optimal parameter and rmse mae and bias were calculated with pearson s correlation coefficient the parameter set with an adequate fit and best rank considering the sum of squares of residuals between observed and simulated head in both models was used for simulation of the rise in the water table due to the regulation the linear uncertainties were calculated for the selected parameter set for both models head observations at gw monitoring wells n 40 and surface water measurements from the flarks and ponds n 126 and springs n 5 derived from the lidar dem were used as head observations in the post2014 model fig 8b head observations at gw monitoring wells from 1988 n 10 locations in fig 8a and water table observation of the mire in the 1989 map n 25 were used in the pre1989 model due to land uplift caused by glacial rebound in finland historical gw head and river stage measurements are at a lower altitude compared to present measurements and historical measurements need to be converted to correspond to present altitudes the land uplift is about 7 mm year in the study area vestøl et al 2019 which was used for correction of the altitudes of the older datasets the altitude systems n43 n60 and n2000 used in the input data present the ground surface altitude of the years 1943 1960 and 2000 respectively in both models head observations measured in n43 or n60 altitude systems were converted to the n2000 system to better correspond to the lidar dem altitude by respectively adding 0 426 m and 0 29 m to the original head observation the river stage of the riv package in the pre1989 model was corrected by adding 0 426 m to the river stage since it was originally measured in the n43 system huokuna 1991 4 5 cross validation with random parameters the pre1989 and post2014 models were tested with cross validation methods based on foglia et al 2007 cross validation was performed with the omission of one head observation by calculating the sum of squares of residuals between observed and simulated heads to all 100 random parameter sets presented in fig a 3 from each head observation omission a parameter set with the best sum of squares was selected to calculate the parameter influence statistics based on formulas presented in foglia et al 2007 tables a 2 and a 3 the influence of observations on parameter estimates i e fractional parameter change was calculated with equation 1 presented in foglia et al 2007 to study which parameter set get the best fit with the omission of one observation and how much the result change compared to the selected parameter set used for models tables a 2 and a 3 the influence of observation omission was calculated based on equations 2 sum of squared weighted residual sswr and 5 cross validation sum of squared weighted residual sswrcv in foglia et al 2007 to study how much omission affects to sum of squares simultaneously it was studied which observations have high uncertainty or poor predictive capability with models the observations were unweighted 4 6 verification of gw flow model results with stable isotopic compositions of water the stable isotopic compositions of water have proven to be an applicable method in gw sw interaction studies in different types of catchments in finland rautio et al 2015 2018 rautio and korkka niemi 2015 the method is applicable when the degree of isotopic fractionation differs for different water sources in precipitation the δd and δ18o values are strongly related following the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 studies on shallow gw in temperate climates have demonstrated that the isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen closely follow those in mean annual precipitation friedman et al 1964 frits et al 1987 ingraham and taylor 1991 the isotope composition of shallow gw lies in the local meteoric water line lmwl in northern finland kortelainen 2007 evaporation tends to enrich surface water in 18o relative to the composition of the original precipitation gat 1996 gat et al 1994 and shifts the composition away from the gmwl line thus the ratio of lighter to heavier isotopes will change over time in the water and the water vapour the floodwater originates from snowmelt and is therefore enriched with lighter isotopes as snow is considerable depleted δd and δ18o values compared to those in rain kortelainen 2007 consequently the isotopically depleted river water during spring time could be observed in gw wells in the proximity of the river kitinen if the bank infiltration would contribute the river water into the banks the altitude effect on the stable isotope composition was assumed to be minor as the study area is rather flat the isotopic composition of 56 samples sampled in 2015 2020 fig a 1 from five groundwater wells fig 8b and river kitinen fig 1b were studied to verify the gw flow model patterns near the matarakoski dam 4 7 comparison of changes in hydrological settings with the distribution of groundwater influenced and flood dependent plant species the distributions of the gw influenced species hamatocaulis vernicosus n 4676 observations from 2001 to 2019 hamatocaulis lapponicus n 57 observations from 2009 to 2019 and saxifraga hirculus n 163 observations from 1997 to 2019 aasmoy biological database 2021 unpublished data were compared with the modelled rise in gw tables between pre1989 and post2014 models and the gw discharge areas modelled for both of the models mapped plant species had coordinates of their locations and their locations were compared to the groundwater head differences in the same coordinates and whether the gw flow was upwards discharge or downwards recharge in the same coordinates as the plant species observations the descriptive statistics and cumulative percentages were calculated for the rise in altitude of the gw table based on the flow model results the rises in modelled gw tables between pre1989 and post2014 models were classified into four classes no rise 0 m minor rise 0 0 2 m notable rise 0 2 0 6 m and major rise 0 6 m based on the gw flow model results no rise class define areas where groundwater level has not been affected by the river regulation and areas where the modelled groundwater discharge area has not changed between the models minor rise class was based on assumption that constant water level rise higher than 0 2 affects the habitat of selected species borkenhagen and cooper 2018 meškauskaitė and naujalis 2006 the notable rise class describes areas affected due to the river stage rise in the southern part of the matarakoski power major rise class defines areas highly affected by the construction of the matarakoski power plant the classification was used to examine whether the rise in the gw table altitude is related to the present distribution of the plant species the latest observations of the flood dependent species carex microglochin n 3 observation from 1960 to 2004 elymus mutabilis n 6 observation from 1960 to 1996 and moehringia lateriflora n 56 observations from 1996 to 2016 were examined to understand their relationship with the regulation of the river kitinen the distribution of all six studied species was also compared to simulated flood coverages 5 results 5 1 pre regulation flood distributions the flood models indicated that the maximum discharge of 924 m3 s 1 measured in 1966 fig 7a corresponded to a river stage altitude of 185 5 m a s l n2000 in the matarakoski area when a manning s roughness value of 0 07 was used for the river bottom fig a 2a the river stage rose 5 m above the pre flooding stage fig a 2a during the flooding peak on 18 may 1966 the maximum discharge of the 1987 flood model was 587 m3 s 1 corresponding to a river stage of 184 5 m a s l n2000 fig a 2c in the matarakoski area the flood models indicated that the sakattioja and välijoki areas were major riverine flood affected areas fig 10 in contrast the water table rise in the viiankiaapa mire was mainly related to precipitation and spring thaw generated flooding fig 10 the recurrence interval of the 1966 flood maximum fig 10 dark purple or discharge exceeding 900 m3 s 1 was 11 years before river regulation according to river discharge data and the results of weibull and log pearson type iii calculations the recurrence interval of a 600 m3 s 1 discharge rate was two years indicating that the exceedance probability fig 10 light purple of the maximum discharge rate of the 1987 flood model was over 50 before river regulation 5 2 gw flow model results the post2014 and pre1989 models indicated that changes in the gw flow patterns were most prominent in the riverbanks where the hydraulic gradient became more gently sloping after regulation fig 11a b the change in the river stage caused a 0 7 m rise in the gw table in the proximity of the matarakoski power plant and a 0 2 5 m rise in the water table on the southern side of matarakoski fig 11c the water table in the western part of the viiankiaapa mire rose 0 0 8 m after regulation and the gw discharge area simultaneously expanded by about 4 6 fig 11d rmse mae and bias for the post2014 and pre1989 models were 0 37 and 0 75 0 24 and 0 52 0 09 and 0 18 respectively table a 4 the flow budget indicated that the pre1989 model had a higher river leakage gw discharge to the river and lower drain discharge gw discharge in mire areas compared to the post2014 model table 2 table 3 in the pre1989 model the river kitinen was a completely gaining river whereas in the post2014 model the matarakoski power plant caused river water infiltration of the eastern river banks fig 11d on the ne side of the dam 5 3 isotopic composition of water in the matarakoski area there were differences in the mean δ18o and δd values between groundwater samples collected from different shallow groundwater wells in the proximity of the matarakoski area table 4 the groundwater stable isotope composition was most enriched in well 17hyd015 located in the proximity of the mire area and the stable isotope composition was closer to the lmwl kortelainen 2007 fig 12 in wells located some distance from the mire area and closer to the river kitinen the most depleted δd and δ18o values in river kitinen water were measured during the spring flood period mean values δd 15 12 and δ18o 113 05 n 5 5 4 gw table rise and gw discharge vs gw influenced mire species gw flow model results indicate that 47 of hamatocaulis vernicosus 37 of hamatocaulis lapponicus and 50 of saxifraga hirculus occurred in areas with no apparent rise in the gw table no rise class due to river regulation fig 13 however 33 and 28 of hamatocaulis lapponicus occurred in areas with minor 0 0 2 m and notable 0 2 0 6 m gw table rise respectively almost half of hamatocaulis vernicosus 36 and saxifraga hirculus 45 occurred in minor rise areas and 13 of hamatocaulis vernicosus and 4 of saxifraga hirculus occurred in notable rise areas fig 13 among all the studied mire species only hamatocaulis vernicosus occurred in areas of major 0 6 m gw table rise fig 13 fig 14a most of the occurrences in major rise areas were located in the western part of käppäläaapa mire close to matarakoski and the gw table rise ranged from 0 6 to 3 5 m within the area fig 14a fig 14 shows that hamatocaulis lapponicus mainly occurs in areas where the gw table rise is less than 0 4 m the modelled gw discharge areas of the pre1989 model fig 11d covered 45 of the present observations of hamatocaulis vernicosus 44 of hamatocaulis lapponicus and 56 of saxifraga hirculus gw discharge areas of the post2014 model fig 11d fig 14b covered 48 of observations of hamatocaulis vernicosus 51 of hamatocaulis lapponicus and 54 of saxifraga hirculus 6 discussion 6 1 reliability of the flood coverage model the calculated recurrence interval of 11 years for river discharge exceeding over 900 m3 s 1 appears to correspond with the measured regulated discharge data from the vajukoski matarakoski and kelukoski power plants in which a higher than post dam average annual maximum discharge seems to occur once in 11 years fig 7 the calculated recurrence interval of a discharge rate exceeding 600 m3 s 1 was two years indicating that the calculated maximum discharge of the 1987 model 587 m3 s 1 occurred in at least half of the observed years before regulation korhonen 2007 noted that regulated discharges are only usable for studies related to long term discharge variation like monthly and annual variations the 1987 flood model appears to indicate the common coverage of floods in the river banks which corresponds to the distribution of floodplain sediments fig 1c observed during the comprehensive ground penetrating radar study in pahanlaaksonmaa kiimakuusikko and kersilönkangas åberg 2021 kultti et al 2020 unpublished report in addition the observed coverage of floodplain deposits and the distribution of coarse silt in the riverbanks fig 1c supports the model results indicating that the river stage rose three to four metres above the common river stage during the flood peaks before the regulation of the river kitinen the 1966 and 1987 flood models indicate that the water table rise was prominent in the sakattioja area based on the measured flow rates and river stages even without modelling possible ice jams the flood discharge and coverage were probably underestimated since the discharges of smaller brooks were omitted due to non existent data the most severe floods in the study area were most probably the ice jam floods which caused a greater rise in the river stage closer to the ice jam compared to upstream areas of the river according to brunner 2016 manning s roughness values for the river bottom usually vary between 0 04 and 0 09 due to the lack of observations the effect of ice jams was compensated with a roughness value of 0 07 for the river bottom which corresponded to the observed and modelled roughness values under breakup ice jams beltaos 2001 carson et al 2011 ghareh aghaji zare et al 2016 the roughness value of 0 07 also appeared to fit the data of huokuna 1989 unpublished report in which the calibrated manning s roughness values of the river bottom within the study area varied from 0 024 to 0 12 the accuracy of the modelled flood distribution could be enhanced with a more detailed distribution of manning s roughness values along the bottom of the river kitinen based on huokuna 1989 unpublished report however the distribution and the duration of the hypothetical ice jam in 1966 is unknown causing some uncertainty in the simulated flood coverage and estimated roughness values based on the description in veikko haakana s poem the river stage rise following an ice jam was four to five metres reaching the house of uutela and converting the sahankangas area into an island see fig 10 the threshold of four metres is located near mantojärvi fig 10 which used to be the old river channel of the välijoki river fig 10 connecting it to the river kitinen from the north during major floods the known floods fig 2 might overestimate the intensity of common floods since only relatively high floods were recorded 6 2 gw flow model uncertainty since quaternary sediments of the study site have been deposited in varying environments glacial glaciofluvial fluvial and hydrostratigraphic units tend to be scattered or lens like the actual uncertainty of the hydrostratigraphic model structure fig 9 is challenging to measure the complexity of hydrostratigraphy tends to increase uncertainty in the model structure åberg et al 2021 while the occurrences of partially confined units or perched gw makes the calibration of models with quaternary sediment units challenging åberg et al 2019 however the use of a comprehensive hydrostratigraphic structure adds detail to models of gw recharge discharge and flow patterns as discussed earlier by åberg et al 2021 according to barthel and banzhaf 2016 the scale of the model affects the level of detail at which gw sw interactions can be modelled therefore it was important to select a suitable grid resolution for research interests in this site scale hydrostratigraphic model grid size was defined to be small enough 20 20 m to model the gw discharge in the mire area and in the river shore area in adequate detail in the mire area the grid scale considered string and flark patterns since the microtopography of the mire surface also affects gw recharge and discharge patterns and the distribution of plant communities in peatland areas van der ploeg et al 2012 there are uncertainties related to possible perched waters in the river banks and mire salonen 2020 and the tendency of the drn package to overestimate gw discharge in the pre1989 and post2014 models the aforementioned uncertainties have been discussed in detail in batelaan and de smedt 1998 and åberg et al 2019 however an increase in gw discharge due to regulation of the river seem to be a real phenomenon and can be seen in the flow budgets drn in table 2 and table 3 and increased discharge areas fig 11d surveying of the actual locations of springs in the viiankiaapa mire or studying satellite images could be useful for further evaluation of modelled gw discharge areas the hydraulic conductivity varied from 1 2 10 6 to 4 3 10 3 m s 1 in sorted sediments from 5 0 10 8 to 8 3 10 5 m s 1 in tills and from 4 7 10 9 to 1 9 10 4 m s 1 in bedrock table a 1 calibration with random parameters was found to be more a straightforward calibration method for the pre1989 and post2014 models than the parameter estimation method since the two models preferred different optimal parameter values post2014 had the best model fit with parameter set 32 and pre1989 has the best fit in model 79 fig a 3 however parameter set 3 was selected fig a 3 since both models 5th in pre1989 and 2nd in post2014 had the relatively highest rank of the smallest sum of squared with this model this was mainly related to differences in the altitude system in the different datasets and models which can be seen in the higher rmse mae bias and calculated linear uncertainty in the pre1989 model tables a 4 and a 5 in addition due to land uplift the more recent the observation is the higher the gw level is compared to sea level leading to higher uncertainty of the observed water table altitudes in the pre1989 model the higher uncertainty in the pre1989 model can be explained by more loosely distributed observation points which caused lower sensitivities to selected parameters during model calibration the pre1989 model appeared to prefer a lower k compared to the post2014 model especially in brittle faults thrust faults and riv parameters this may be related to the steeper hydraulic gradient towards the river in the pre1989 model than in the post2014 model most of the parameters of the pre1989 model except clay brittle faults and thrust faults had a statistically significant p 0 05 positive correlation with rmse and mae table a 6 similarly in the post2014 model the mae and rmse of sw had a weak but statistically significant positive correlation p 0 05 with the optimal parameter values of clay and a moderate positive correlation p 0 01 with grus table a 7 in contrast the rmse and mae of gw had a statistically significant negative correlation p 0 05 with the parameters kx3 kx8 fine and riv par1 in post2014 table a 7 the negative correlation indicates that a higher optimal k is preferred whereas a positive correlation indicates that a lower optimal k is preferred the difference between the fits of sw and gw observations in the post2014 model can be explained by the differences between the lidar dem and gw table observations gw observations were annual means whereas the lidar dem was measured in spring when the water level was high the bias results for all 100 models indicated that the models with the best fit in the lidar dem derived sw observations had a bias of 0 3 to 0 5 m with gw observations corresponding to the altitude difference between the lidar dem and gw table observations previously noted by åberg et al 2019 the gw flow models were steady state models which was assumed to be adequate for a generic understanding of the differences between pre and post regulation groundwater flow patterns coupling of hec ras with modflow as performed by rodriguez et al 2008 could have been useful if continuous data on the gw table were available before regulation of the river at our study site in a cold climate area the bank storage settings can be affected by soil frost frost can impede gw recharge until melting hyyppä 1962 observed frost melt to cause a prompt rise in the gw table in the lokka area fig 1a according to hydrological yearbooks from 1966 to 1975 hvk 1968 1970 1972 1975 1976 1977 frost melt usually occurred at the end of may or the beginning of june in sodankylä during 1966 1975 the maximum flooding of the river kitinen usually occurred in the middle of may in 1966 2014 see fig 7 huokuna 1991 kemijoki ltd unpublished data since flooding appeared to occur before the melting of frost floodwater induced gw infiltration in the riverbanks was probably only slight combining flood modelling and gw flow modelling with coupled sw gw models could provide more information on the connections between the viiankiaapa mire and the river kitinen in the pre regulation setting however the shortage of observations of historical flood coverage flooding frequency the gw table and the duration and thickness frost limits the modelling possibilities cross validation statistics indicated that the head observation omissions seem to have the best sum of squared of residuals in the parameter set 32 96 of omissions in the post2014 model and in the parameter set 79 91 of omissions in the pre1989 model fig a 3 only head observation omission of 208c suo8902 and keka1 fig 8a preferred different models 13 27 and 89 respectively in the pre1989 model table a 2 similarly in the post2014 only head observation omission of ga404 hyd013 hyd018 hyd022 ga205 and soso2 preferred different parameter sets 3 3 3 98 3 16 respectively table a 3 these observation wells except soso2 occur in the riverbank area and have only a few other observations nearby fig 8b parameters kx3 and kx7 and fine were least affected to observation omissions with fractional parameter change less than 20 tables a 2 and a 3 parameters b faul and kx8 were highly affected by observation omissions with fractional changes varying from 0 9 to 80 9 from best parameter sets in pre1989 and post2014 models tables a 2 and a 3 the cross validation statistics indicated that model pre1989 had a poorer predictive capability for observations than model post2014 with parameters kx3 kx8 and fine the fractional change in sswr in post2014 compared to selected model 3 was mainly within 0 5 most of the observations 55 had a fractional change of 1 4 the most influential observations with the highest change in sswr were sw032 hyd022 and ga200 with changes of 5 3 4 3 and 3 8 respectively all these observations are located in high hydraulic gradient areas sw032 may indicate a perched gw area close to the kärväslampi area fractional changes in sswr in pre1989 compared to selected model 3 varied from 6 to 15 most of the observations 62 had a fractional change of 13 the most influential observations with the highest changes 15 in sswr were 209 suo8902 208a suo8911 fig 8a cross validation results indicated that the selected parameter set 3 has the second best fit in post2014 in 90 of the observation omissions selected parameter set 3 had the fifth best fit in 71 of omissions in the pre1989 model parameter set 32 which had the smallest sum of squares in the post2014 model had the rank 16th in 56 of head observation omissions in the pre1989 model suggesting that 32 could have been also a plausible selection for simulation on the contrary the best parameter set in pre1989 was set 79 which has a poor ranking in the post2014 model being in the rank 71st in 55 of omissions the sum of squares in the selected parameter set 3 were 23 9 and 12 0 for post2014 and pre1989 respectively the calculated sswrcv was 30 0 in post2014 and 20 0 in pre1989 indicating changes of 20 and 40 from the selected model 3 these results indicate that the post2014 model had a better predictive capability to groundwater head observations than the pre1989 model 6 3 changes in the sw and gw flow patterns based on the gw flow model results the rise of river stage affected the water table in the western part of viiankiaapa and käppäläaapa mires causing wetting of the mire areas and an increase in gw discharge areas in the mires fig 11d the wetting of the mire area can also be seen in the kokkolampi area by comparing the 1989 map with the 2014 nlsf map fig 15 in contrast older maps indicate that the mire was drier after regulation in areas located between sakattikumpu and pahanlaaksomaa fig 6 location v however the wetness of the mire in basic maps can be also related to seasonal variation causing uncertainties to the interpretation of whether the water level is changed in maps due to the river regulation or climate variation the gw flow model results indicate that the matarakoski dam has had a local effect on the gw table in the kersilökangas area fig 11c the δ18o and δd values of the shallow groundwater are slightly displaced to the right from the local meteoric water line lmwl indicating an evaporation effect in the matarakoski area fig 8b fig 11c fig 12 the northernmost groundwater well 17hyd015 had the most evaporated composition this could be due to the infiltration of evaporated mire water or bank infiltration of river water the stable isotope composition in this well did not display significant seasonal variation if the bank infiltration of the river kitinen due to construction of matarakoski dam was the source of evaporated water this effect should be observed also in wells locating close to river kitinen the groundwater flow model supports evaporated mire water being a source of the evaporated component in well 17hyd015 fig 8b fig 11b while the gw flow models indicate that the matarakoski power plant caused a prominent rise in the gw table close to the dam reducing the hydraulic gradient the changes in gw flow directions appear to be only local the direction of gw flow is from the mire area towards the matarakoski power plant which coincides with the observed sw flow related to the mire string and flark pattern åberg et al 2019 the water table rise in the kokkolampi area fig 15 is probably related to rise in the river stage according to the flow models in addition to river regulation the construction of roads could also affect surface water flow conditions the viiankiaapa logging road fig 10 channels flood water flow via a few channels instead of allowing a freely flowing sheet during the spring flood and heavy rainfall in the autumn in addition the moskuvaarantie road fig 10 may dam the surface water flow towards the south pääkkö 2004 the effect of the moskuvaaratie road on gw flow patterns could be further investigated in recent studies åberg et al 2019 gw seepage has been observed in multiple locations in the eastern banks of the river kitinen the model results indicate that gw discharge in the river has decreased tables 2 and 3 which could be related to the lowering of the hydraulic gradient towards the river based on historical observations some of the pre regulation springs have been submerged by river water following the rise in the river stage due to regulation 6 4 riverine flooding vs flood dependent and gw influenced plant species as a consequence of damming natural floods have diminished converting the flood plains of the river kitinen into a more bushy environment and reducing the habitats of flood dependent plant species karplund 1990 according to karplund 1990 ulvinen and halonen 1995 and jäkäläniemi et al 2013 the flood dependent species fig 14 are threatened due to the regulation of the river kitinen jäkäläniemi et al 2013 modelled the population survival chances of the endangered plant silene tatarica in the flood plains of the regulated river kitinen compared with the natural river oulanka fig 1a they concluded that the risk of extinction of flood dependent plants was much higher in the regulated river than in the natural river since the reduction of natural flooding has resulted in more vegetated and forested river banks according to the eliölajit database of the finnish environment institute syke unpublished data and the aasmoy biological database 2021 unpublished data observations of the flood dependent species carex microglochin moehringia lateriflora and elymus mutabilis have declined following the construction of power plants along the river kitinen since the 1960s carex microglochin may have completely disappeared since there have been no new observations since 2004 the northern habitat of carex microglochin fig 14 has completely disappeared since the 1960s similarly elymus mutabilis observations are from 1960 to 1996 with more recent observations only occurring in the southern location fig 14 airix ympäristö oy 2008b the simulated flood coverages suggest that riverine flooding covered the present habitats of gw influenced mire species only in the sakattioja area fig 10 furthermore the gw flow model results indicate that almost half of the present habitats of gw influenced mire species within the study area were affected by the water table rise due to regulation fig 14a fig 15 however according to siegel and glaser 1987 even small changes in gw discharge may drastically affect the vegetation of peatland ulvinen and sallantaus 2009 concluded that the habitats of hamatocaulis lapponicus are usually in mesotrophic fens and mires with a constantly high water level and an indication of gw discharge in this study h lapponicus appeared to occur in areas where the gw table rise due to regulation was up to 0 4 m fig 14a since gw indicator species such as calliergon giganteum and warnstorfia exannulata ulvinen et al 2002 have previously been observed to occur with h lapponicus ulvinen and sallantaus 2009 h lapponicus might be more gw influenced than h vernicosus the habitats of hamatocaulis vernicosus are commonly thought to exist in mineral rich and not very calcium rich fens with an indication of gw discharge hedenäs 1989 zibulski et al 2013 observed that h verniscosus was more abundant in a peat core when sandy inorganic sediments distributed by riverine flooding were present moreover borkenhagen and cooper 2018 found that h verniscosus is very tolerant of flooding in this study the occurrence of h vernicosus may not be directly related to flooding but instead to its high water tolerance compared to other mire species however the rise of the water table due to regulation may also be favourable for h vernicosus the regulation of the river kitinen has reduced flooding which may also have a negative impact on the species in the river shoreline area in the future however according to the eliölajit database syke unpublished data saxifraga hirculus l exists close to the river kitinen in the sakattioja area where regular floods still occur saxifraga hirculus l has a poor tolerance of high flood stages according to meškauskaitė and naujalis 2006 in contrast short term variation with a slight water table rise can increase its distribution meškauskaitė and naujalis 2006 thus at this study site it could be a species favouring the current regulation of flooding s hirculus may be related to the locations of course grained sediments korkka niemi et al 2017 unpublished report the direct effect of river regulatory actions on gw influenced mire species is challenging to measure since no ecological data exist before 1995 and most observations are from later than 2003 7 conclusions this study indicated that the viiankiaapa mire is human influenced due to the regulation of the river kitinen which needs to be considered in the future positioning planning and designing of mining practices the construction of the matarakoski power plant in 1993 1995 and the kelukoski power plant in 1999 2001 caused a rise in the river stage of the river kitinen and decreased the maximum flood discharges and flood coverage before the regulation of the river kitinen the recurrence interval of the 1966 extreme flood discharge exceeding 900 m s 1 was 11 years whereas the common maximum discharge rate with an exceedance probability of 50 was about 600 m s 1 the flood models indicate that riverine flooding affected the river banks and the sakattioja area while the flooding in the viiankiaapa mire was more related to the spring thaw following the construction of the matarakoski and kelukoski dams the river stage rose by 2 3 m on the southern side of the dam and up to 7 m in northern side of the dam the river stage rise reduced the hydraulic gradient towards the river raising the gw table in the river banks and western part of the viiankiaapa mire this increased the area of gw discharge and changed the locations of springs in the river shore to a higher altitude the gw flow model results indicate that the mire became wetter gw discharge areas in the mire increased and gw discharge to river decreased due to the gradient change the gw flow models and the stable isotopic composition of water indicate that the constructed matarakoski dam changed gw flow directions only locally next to dam and the main flow direction remained towards the river even after regulation the flood dependent species carex microglochin moehringia lateriflora and elymus mutabilis have declined following the construction of power plants along the river kitinen since the 1960s the regulation induced gw table rise has covered almost 50 of the habitats of all the studied groundwater influenced mire species the flood models and gw flow models indicate that the distribution of hamatocaulis vernicosus may be related to the flood tolerance of the species snowmelt influenced flooding and the gw discharge areas of the viiankiaapa mire simultaneously the

8049,study region northern finland study focus this study examined long term decade scale hydrological and ecological consequences of dam construction and subsequent river regulation on the environmentally protected viiankiaapa mire pre regulation floods affected the hydrology of the riverbanks and the viiankiaapa mire which contain habitats of flood dependent or groundwater influenced ecosystems groundwater discharge and flow patterns and pre regulation flood coverage were simulated to investigate the impact of river regulation on the mire area new hydrological insights for the region the flood models indicate that regular flooding covered the westernmost part of the mire before the regulation groundwater modelling suggests that the regulation has raised the locations of springs in the river shore reduced the hydraulic gradient towards the river raised the groundwater table in the river banks and the western part of the viiankiaapa mire and increased groundwater discharge in the mire the groundwater flow models and the stable isotopic composition of water indicate that the constructed dam changed the groundwater flow directions close to dam the ecological effects of regulation were mixed the studied flood dependent plant species declined due to the reduction in floods after regulation conversely the occurrence of hamatocaulis vernicosus and hamatocaulis lapponicus appears to be related to the high water table and groundwater discharge areas in the mire suggesting suitable habitat for these species may have expanded after the regulation

diverse habitats for plants malmer 1986 siegel and glaser 1987 the composition of subpeat sediments is also an important aspect since the existence of a high conductivity zone beneath a mire enhances vertical flow creating spatial variation in gw discharge and recharge areas åberg et al 2021 reeve et al 2000 siegel 1988 if a mire is located close to a river the hydrology of the mire complex can be affected by variation in the river stage related to natural flooding or regulation river water infiltrates into adjacent aquifers and mixes with gw during high stages and discharges back to the river following a decrease in the river stage mccallum et al 2010 the purpose of river regulation is usually to reduce the intensity of floods in the river basin to generate hydroelectric power or a combination of these hancock 2002 river regulation affects the hydrogeological settings changing the hydraulic gradient near the riverbanks and altering gw surface water sw levels and interactions fette et al 2005 nilsson and berggren 2000 if regulation is aimed at flood protection it tends to reduce the annual variation in the river stage and stabilize the hydrological setting gw discharge areas will change if the regulated river stage is set to a level that prominently differs from the natural level this will also affect flood plain habitats the effect of river regulation on the gw flow patterns of hyporheic and riparian zones has been discussed in andrén et al 2011 and kløve et al 2011 river regulation can usually affect the gw flow pattern e g gw hydraulic gradient and groundwater discharge rates and locations of riparian zones up to hundreds of kilometres downstream gerecht et al 2011 simultaneously affecting gw fluxes and the water quality of the underlying

hydrostratigraphic modelling is a prerequisite for constructing 3d gw flow models pasanen and okkonen 2017 ross et al 2005 furthermore the importance of the geological complexity should not be underestimated as according to åberg et al 2021 and artimo 2002 the geological hydrostratigraphic detail of the model adds detail to gw recharge discharge and flow patterns especially in recently glaciated areas glaciated areas are challenging to model since the k variation of the system is usually high due to interlayered sorted sediments and glacial tills glacial tills can have orders of magnitudes lower k compared to interlayered sorted sediments causing dispersion recharge discharge and flow pattern and an increase in vertical flow component åberg et al 2021 in northern finland the

development of viiankiaapa hydrology before and under river regulation the purpose of the studies is to collect more information to assess the sensitivity of the mire ecosystem to anthropogenic influences the aim of the present study was to understand how the regulation of the river kitinen and especially the construction of the matarakoski and kelukoski hydroelectric power plants has affected the flood coverage gw flow patterns and gw discharge areas and habitats of groundwater influenced plant species in the riverbanks and in the adjacent viiankiaapa mire two hypotheses are presented here 1 the regulation of the river has reduced flooding and altered the elevation of the river stage affecting water table depth gw flow direction and distribution of gw discharge areas and thus hydrology of the viiankiaapa mire and 2 the regulation has changed the gw flow directions near the matarakoski dam from nesw to ns which has subsequently affected mire hydrology the presented hypotheses were tested using 3d gw flow models based on a hydrostratigraphic model constructed with leapfrog geo seequent according to methods presented in åberg et al 2021 the model results were

koistamonpulju mire area in 1988 and 1995 4 methods the changes in the hydrological settings due to the regulation of the river kitinen were investigated with 1 2d flood modelling in order to define the flood coverage area in 1966 and 1987 and 2 two 3d gw flow models post2014 and pre1989 in order to examine how the regulation has affected the distribution of gw discharge areas especially in the viiankiaapa mire since both flood models and the pre1989 gw flow model were set before the construction of the matarakoski power plant fig a 1 the pre regulation topography was constructed based on changes in the river coverage area in this section the construction of the pre regulation topography flood models and groundwater flow models are described the gw flow model results for post2014 were verified with measurements of the stable isotopic composition of water in the matarakoski area 4 1 construction of pre regulation topography due to changes in the river distribution and topography in the gravel intake area the pre regulation topography was created from a two metre resolution lidar dem light detection and ranging digital elevation model constructed in 2010 2015 the gravel intake area in kärväsniemi see fig 1 vs fig 6 was reconstructed by interpolating the original topography from the contours of the 1989 basic map next the river area was reconstructed with idw interpolation philip and watson 1982 by utilizing a cross section of the river stage huokuna 1991 and a 1989 base map nlsf the missing shore area between the pre regulation stage lower and the present stage higher of the river kitinen see fig 4 fig 8 was interpolated from the altitudes of the river boundaries the reconstructed areas were mosaicked to the lidar dem and the topography of the other areas was assumed to have remained unchanged since 1989 4 2 pre regulation flood estimation and flood frequency flood modelling was performed with hec ras the us army corps of engineers brunner 1995 to estimate the pre regulation flood coverage and its possible effect on the distribution of gw influenced mire species two 2d flood models with a diffusion wave equation brunner 2016 were used for flood simulation the selected simulation periods were 12 28 may 1966 and 12 25 may 1987 the topography for the flood models was constructed by mosaicking the leapfrog generated river bottom to the pre regulation topography river discharge data from the petkula station from may 1966 and river stage data from may 1987 huokuna 1991 were used as input data in the boundary condition of the flow hydrograph in the present matarakoski area river stage data from 1987 were converted to a discharge rate based on a rating curve from the results of the 1966 model fig a 2b the southern border of the model area covering the rivers välijoki and kitinen was delineated with a normal depth boundary condition with a friction slope value of 0 0004 based on the average slope of the river stage manning s roughness parameters for the river channel and model area were estimated based on values presented in brunner 2016 different manning s roughness values for the river bottom were tested to estimate the river stage rise of four to five metres in 1966 the 1987 river stage was corrected from the n43 to the n2000 altitude system by adding 0 427 m to each measurement nlsf 2021 https www maanmittauslaitos

formula to the rating curve based on the 1966 flood model results the daily precipitation data for may 1966 and 1987 ilmatieteen laitos https www ilmatieteenlaitos fi havaintojen lataus last access 4 march 2021 were used for the precipitation boundary condition on the model grids of the corresponding models the snow water equivalent swe was calculated from snow depth data of the finnish meteorological institute ilmatieteen laitos https www ilmatieteen laitos fi havaintojen lataus last access 4 march 2021 based on the simplification that the density of snow was constantly 0 3 g cm 3 which correspond to the average snow density in forests of boreal areas bormann et al 2013 moreover the change in the daily swe was added to the precipitation boundary condition which was assumed to present simplified melting of the snow the effects of possible ice jams were omitted due to non existent numerical observations the recurrence interval for the 1966 flood was estimated by calculating the flooding frequencies using the pre regulation annual maximum discharges 1961 1970 see fig a 1 the defined recurrence intervals were also applied to estimate the exceedance probability and recurrence interval of the 1987 flood the weibull plotting position equation eq 1 and the log pearson type iii distribution viessman and lewis 2003 with frequency factors derived from haan 1977 were used to calculate the recurrence interval t for the selected discharge rates 1 p m n 1 t 1 p where m is the maximum annual discharge ranked from lowest to highest p is the exceedance probability n is the length of the datasets in years and t is the recurrence interval 4 3 hydrostratigraphic modelling and gw flow modelling a previously constructed 3d geological model gm2 in åberg et al 2021 was updated with leapfrog geo fig 9 based on additional ground penetrating radar gpr campaigns during winter 2019 2020 åberg 2021 kultti et al 2020 unpublished report the main updates regarding the bedrock units were the separation of the weathered bedrock unit into separate grus and clay type weathered bedrock units åberg 2021 to correspond more closely to the presumed weathering profile hall et al 2015 hirvas 1991 wright 1992 the main changes regarding quaternary deposits were made in the pahanlaaksonmaa and kiimakuusikko tihiämaa and kersilönkangas areas fig 1c based on gpr interpretations the unit called lowest till was redefined and edited based on gpr interpretations as basal unknown sediment due to the lack of reference data on its physical properties fig 9 the quaternary sediment and weathered and fractured bedrock units were modelled with methods presented in åberg et al 2017 2019 åberg et al 2021 and åberg 2021 the horizontal resolution of this updated model was 20 20 m and the model covered an area of 6 8 km as presented in fig 1 the updated geological model åberg 2021 was converted into two versions of the hydrostratigraphic model defined as post2014 and pre1989 the post2014 model was used to represent the present regulated settings and the pre1989 model represented the situation before the construction of the matarakoski power plant fig a 1 since the oldest gw table observations were from 1988 the layer structure and coverage of pre1989 was similar to post2014 except that the topography was changed to the pre regulation topography and the river bottom mesh was changed to correspond to the distribution of the 1989 maps the leapfrog generated hydrostratigraphic models were converted to steady state moflow nwt gw flow models niswonger et al 2011 with methods described in åberg et al 2019 2021 the hydraulic conductivities k were interpolated with observation points and dummy points within the hydrostratigraphic units with horizontal k hk multipliers table a 1 similarly to åberg et al 2019 constant values of hk were used for two peat layers the river kitinen the lowest sands and gravels unit the basal unknown sediment grus type weathered bedrock and clay type weathered bedrock vertical anisotropy vani of the surficial deposit was 10 and vani of the bedrock units was 1 similarly as in åberg et al 2019 vani of peat was 10 which was based on permeameter measurements in turtiainen 2020 an additional parameter zone fine representing the flood plain sediments on the shores of the river kitinen was delineated within the top deposit unit based on gpr interpretation table a 1 the bedrock faults were divided into three groups brittle faults thrust faults and clay filled faults the defined k values were based on measurements from grain size analyses and slug tests golder associates 2012 unpublished report åberg et al 2019 aa sakatti mining oy 2019 unpublished data in surficial deposits and packer spinner and constant head tests in bedrock skr 2019 unpublished data the steady state flow models were used to examine the possible changes in gw flow patterns due to the regulation of the river kitinen head dependent boundaries were modelled with the general head boundary ghb package in model borders with a sedimentary area whereas constant head boundaries chd were used in model borders next to the mire areas the surface of the mire area was modelled with the drain package drn mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 assuming that if the water table rises above the model surface the water disappears from the model as gw discharge the recharge package rch was used with two parameter zones in forested areas and open water and mire areas as presented in åberg et al 2021 the parameter values were based on the precipitation of the hydrological years november 1987 to november 1988 and november 2013 to november 2014 in the pre1989 and post2014 models respectively groundwater recharge was modified from previous models in åberg et al 2021 due to some changes in the distributions of surficial sediments the recharge in the mire area which was constant in the previous models åberg et al 2021 2019 was changed to vary based on the properties of the subpeat sediments table a 1 4 4 calibration of the gw flow models model calibration was performed with a stochastic method using the randpar1 utility of the pest suite doherty 2018 parameters that had the highest uncertainty in actual physical properties and k were selected for the generation of 100 random parameter sets which were used to run both models 100 times the selected parameters were brittle faults thrust faults basal unknown sediment lowest sands and gravels floodplain fines clay type and grus type weathered bedrock and riv conductance table a 1 maximum and minimum values of the parameter sets were based on test calibrations with parameter estimation and measured k table a 1 the model fit of the 100 models was evaluated to find a parameter set having adequate fit between observed and simulated heads in both models rmse mae and bias of the head observations were calculated for 100 different model results in both models to evaluate their performance in addition rmse mae and bias were separately calculated for groundwater surface water and springs to inspect the errors in different head observation datasets simultaneously the correlations between the optimal parameter and rmse mae and bias were calculated with pearson s correlation coefficient the parameter set with an adequate fit and best rank considering the sum of squares of residuals between observed and simulated head in both models was used for simulation of the rise in the water table due to the regulation the linear uncertainties were calculated for the selected parameter set for both models head observations at gw monitoring wells n 40 and surface water measurements from the flarks and ponds n 126 and springs n 5 derived from the lidar dem were used as head observations in the post2014 model fig 8b head observations at gw monitoring wells from 1988 n 10 locations in fig 8a and water table observation of the mire in the 1989 map n 25 were used in the pre1989 model due to land uplift caused by glacial rebound in finland historical gw head and river stage measurements are at a lower altitude compared to present measurements and historical measurements need to be converted to correspond to present altitudes the land uplift is about 7 mm year in the study area vestøl et al 2019 which was used for correction of the altitudes of the older datasets the altitude systems n43 n60 and n2000 used in the input data present the ground surface altitude of the years 1943 1960 and 2000 respectively in both models head observations measured in n43 or n60 altitude systems were converted to the n2000 system to better correspond to the lidar dem altitude by respectively adding 0 426 m and 0 29 m to the original head observation the river stage of the riv package in the pre1989 model was corrected by adding 0 426 m to the river stage since it was originally measured in the n43 system huokuna 1991 4 5 cross validation with random parameters the pre1989 and post2014 models were tested with cross validation methods based on foglia et al 2007 cross validation was performed with the omission of one head observation by calculating the sum of squares of residuals between observed and simulated heads to all 100 random parameter sets presented in fig a 3 from each head observation omission a parameter set with the best sum of squares was selected to calculate the parameter influence statistics based on formulas presented in foglia et al 2007 tables a 2 and a 3 the influence of observations on parameter estimates i e fractional parameter change was calculated with equation 1 presented in foglia et al 2007 to study which parameter set get the best fit with the omission of one observation and how much the result change compared to the selected parameter set used for models tables a 2 and a 3 the influence of observation omission was calculated based on equations 2 sum of squared weighted residual sswr and 5 cross validation sum of squared weighted residual sswrcv in foglia et al 2007 to study how much omission affects to sum of squares simultaneously it was studied which observations have high uncertainty or poor predictive capability with models the observations were unweighted 4 6 verification of gw flow model results with stable isotopic compositions of water the stable isotopic compositions of water have proven to be an applicable method in gw sw interaction studies in different types of catchments in finland rautio et al 2015 2018 rautio and korkka niemi 2015 the method is applicable when the degree of isotopic fractionation differs for different water sources in precipitation the δd and δ18o values are strongly related following the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 studies on shallow gw in temperate climates have demonstrated that the isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen closely follow those in mean annual precipitation friedman et al 1964 frits et al 1987 ingraham and taylor 1991 the isotope composition of shallow gw lies in the local meteoric water line lmwl in northern finland kortelainen 2007 evaporation tends to enrich surface water in 18o relative to the composition of the original precipitation gat 1996 gat et al 1994 and shifts the composition away from the gmwl line thus the ratio of lighter to heavier isotopes will change over time in the water and the water vapour the floodwater originates from snowmelt and is therefore enriched with lighter isotopes as snow is considerable depleted δd and δ18o values compared to those in rain kortelainen 2007 consequently the isotopically depleted river water during spring time could be observed in gw wells in the proximity of the river kitinen if the bank infiltration would contribute the river water into the banks the altitude effect on the stable isotope composition was assumed to be minor as the study area is rather flat the isotopic composition of 56 samples sampled in 2015 2020 fig a 1 from five groundwater wells fig 8b and river kitinen fig 1b were studied to verify the gw flow model patterns near the matarakoski dam 4 7 comparison of changes in hydrological settings with the distribution of groundwater influenced and flood dependent plant species the distributions of the gw influenced species hamatocaulis vernicosus n 4676 observations from 2001 to 2019 hamatocaulis lapponicus n 57 observations from 2009 to 2019 and saxifraga hirculus n 163 observations from 1997 to 2019 aasmoy biological database 2021 unpublished data were compared with the modelled rise in gw tables between pre1989 and post2014 models and the gw discharge areas modelled for both of the models mapped plant species had coordinates of their locations and their locations were compared to the groundwater head differences in the same coordinates and whether the gw flow was upwards discharge or downwards recharge in the same coordinates as the plant species observations the descriptive statistics and cumulative percentages were calculated for the rise in altitude of the gw table based on the flow model results the rises in modelled gw tables between pre1989 and post2014 models were classified into four classes no rise 0 m minor rise 0 0 2 m notable rise 0 2 0 6 m and major rise 0 6 m based on the gw flow model results no rise class define areas where groundwater level has not been affected by the river regulation and areas where the modelled groundwater discharge area has not changed between the models minor rise class was based on assumption that constant water level rise higher than 0 2 affects the habitat of selected species borkenhagen and cooper 2018 meškauskaitė and naujalis 2006 the notable rise class describes areas affected due to the river stage rise in the southern part of the matarakoski power major rise class defines areas highly affected by the construction of the matarakoski power plant the classification was used to examine whether the rise in the gw table altitude is related to the present distribution of the plant species the latest observations of the flood dependent species carex microglochin n 3 observation from 1960 to 2004 elymus mutabilis n 6 observation from 1960 to 1996 and moehringia lateriflora n 56 observations from 1996 to 2016 were examined to understand their relationship with the regulation of the river kitinen the distribution of all six studied species was also compared to simulated flood coverages 5 results 5 1 pre regulation flood distributions the flood models indicated that the maximum discharge of 924 m3 s 1 measured in 1966 fig 7a corresponded to a river stage altitude of 185 5 m a s l n2000 in the matarakoski area when a manning s roughness value of 0 07 was used for the river bottom fig a 2a the river stage rose 5 m above the pre flooding stage fig a 2a during the flooding peak on 18 may 1966 the maximum discharge of the 1987 flood model was 587 m3 s 1 corresponding to a river stage of 184 5 m a s l n2000 fig a 2c in the matarakoski area the flood models indicated that the sakattioja and välijoki areas were major riverine flood affected areas fig 10 in contrast the water table rise in the viiankiaapa mire was mainly related to precipitation and spring thaw generated flooding fig 10 the recurrence interval of the 1966 flood maximum fig 10 dark purple or discharge exceeding 900 m3 s 1 was 11 years before river regulation according to river discharge data and the results of weibull and log pearson type iii calculations the recurrence interval of a 600 m3 s 1 discharge rate was two years indicating that the exceedance probability fig 10 light purple of the maximum discharge rate of the 1987 flood model was over 50 before river regulation 5 2 gw flow model results the post2014 and pre1989 models indicated that changes in the gw flow patterns were most prominent in the riverbanks where the hydraulic gradient became more gently sloping after regulation fig 11a b the change in the river stage caused a 0 7 m rise in the gw table in the proximity of the matarakoski power plant and a 0 2 5 m rise in the water table on the southern side of matarakoski fig 11c the water table in the western part of the viiankiaapa mire rose 0 0 8 m after regulation and the gw discharge area simultaneously expanded by about 4 6 fig 11d rmse mae and bias for the post2014 and pre1989 models were 0 37 and 0 75 0 24 and 0 52 0 09 and 0 18 respectively table a 4 the flow budget indicated that the pre1989 model had a higher river leakage gw discharge to the river and lower drain discharge gw discharge in mire areas compared to the post2014 model table 2 table 3 in the pre1989 model the river kitinen was a completely gaining river whereas in the post2014 model the matarakoski power plant caused river water infiltration of the eastern river banks fig 11d on the ne side of the dam 5 3 isotopic composition of water in the matarakoski area there were differences in the mean δ18o and δd values between groundwater samples collected from different shallow groundwater wells in the proximity of the matarakoski area table 4 the groundwater stable isotope composition was most enriched in well 17hyd015 located in the proximity of the mire area and the stable isotope composition was closer to the lmwl kortelainen 2007 fig 12 in wells located some distance from the mire area and closer to the river kitinen the most depleted δd and δ18o values in river kitinen water were measured during the spring flood period mean values δd 15 12 and δ18o 113 05 n 5 5 4 gw table rise and gw discharge vs gw influenced mire species gw flow model results indicate that 47 of hamatocaulis vernicosus 37 of hamatocaulis lapponicus and 50 of saxifraga hirculus occurred in areas with no apparent rise in the gw table no rise class due to river regulation fig 13 however 33 and 28 of hamatocaulis lapponicus occurred in areas with minor 0 0 2 m and notable 0 2 0 6 m gw table rise respectively almost half of hamatocaulis vernicosus 36 and saxifraga hirculus 45 occurred in minor rise areas and 13 of hamatocaulis vernicosus and 4 of saxifraga hirculus occurred in notable rise areas fig 13 among all the studied mire species only hamatocaulis vernicosus occurred in areas of major 0 6 m gw table rise fig 13 fig 14a most of the occurrences in major rise areas were located in the western part of käppäläaapa mire close to matarakoski and the gw table rise ranged from 0 6 to 3 5 m within the area fig 14a fig 14 shows that hamatocaulis lapponicus mainly occurs in areas where the gw table rise is less than 0 4 m the modelled gw discharge areas of the pre1989 model fig 11d covered 45 of the present observations of hamatocaulis vernicosus 44 of hamatocaulis lapponicus and 56 of saxifraga hirculus gw discharge areas of the post2014 model fig 11d fig 14b covered 48 of observations of hamatocaulis vernicosus 51 of hamatocaulis lapponicus and 54 of saxifraga hirculus 6 discussion 6 1 reliability of the flood coverage model the calculated recurrence interval of 11 years for river discharge exceeding over 900 m3 s 1 appears to correspond with the measured regulated discharge data from the vajukoski matarakoski and kelukoski power plants in which a higher than post dam average annual maximum discharge seems to occur once in 11 years fig 7 the calculated recurrence interval of a discharge rate exceeding 600 m3 s 1 was two years indicating that the calculated maximum discharge of the 1987 model 587 m3 s 1 occurred in at least half of the observed years before regulation korhonen 2007 noted that regulated discharges are only usable for studies related to long term discharge variation like monthly and annual variations the 1987 flood model appears to indicate the common coverage of floods in the river banks which corresponds to the distribution of floodplain sediments fig 1c observed during the comprehensive ground penetrating radar study in pahanlaaksonmaa kiimakuusikko and kersilönkangas åberg 2021 kultti et al 2020 unpublished report in addition the observed coverage of floodplain deposits and the distribution of coarse silt in the riverbanks fig 1c supports the model results indicating that the river stage rose three to four metres above the common river stage during the flood peaks before the regulation of the river kitinen the 1966 and 1987 flood models indicate that the water table rise was prominent in the sakattioja area based on the measured flow rates and river stages even without modelling possible ice jams the flood discharge and coverage were probably underestimated since the discharges of smaller brooks were omitted due to non existent data the most severe floods in the study area were most probably the ice jam floods which caused a greater rise in the river stage closer to the ice jam compared to upstream areas of the river according to brunner 2016 manning s roughness values for the river bottom usually vary between 0 04 and 0 09 due to the lack of observations the effect of ice jams was compensated with a roughness value of 0 07 for the river bottom which corresponded to the observed and modelled roughness values under breakup ice jams beltaos 2001 carson et al 2011 ghareh aghaji zare et al 2016 the roughness value of 0 07 also appeared to fit the data of huokuna 1989 unpublished report in which the calibrated manning s roughness values of the river bottom within the study area varied from 0 024 to 0 12 the accuracy of the modelled flood distribution could be enhanced with a more detailed distribution of manning s roughness values along the bottom of the river kitinen based on huokuna 1989 unpublished report however the distribution and the duration of the hypothetical ice jam in 1966 is unknown causing some uncertainty in the simulated flood coverage and estimated roughness values based on the description in veikko haakana s poem the river stage rise following an ice jam was four to five metres reaching the house of uutela and converting the sahankangas area into an island see fig 10 the threshold of four metres is located near mantojärvi fig 10 which used to be the old river channel of the välijoki river fig 10 connecting it to the river kitinen from the north during major floods the known floods fig 2 might overestimate the intensity of common floods since only relatively high floods were recorded 6 2 gw flow model uncertainty since quaternary sediments of the study site have been deposited in varying environments glacial glaciofluvial fluvial and hydrostratigraphic units tend to be scattered or lens like the actual uncertainty of the hydrostratigraphic model structure fig 9 is challenging to measure the complexity of hydrostratigraphy tends to increase uncertainty in the model structure åberg et al 2021 while the occurrences of partially confined units or perched gw makes the calibration of models with quaternary sediment units challenging åberg et al 2019 however the use of a comprehensive hydrostratigraphic structure adds detail to models of gw recharge discharge and flow patterns as discussed earlier by åberg et al 2021 according to barthel and banzhaf 2016 the scale of the model affects the level of detail at which gw sw interactions can be modelled therefore it was important to select a suitable grid resolution for research interests in this site scale hydrostratigraphic model grid size was defined to be small enough 20 20 m to model the gw discharge in the mire area and in the river shore area in adequate detail in the mire area the grid scale considered string and flark patterns since the microtopography of the mire surface also affects gw recharge and discharge patterns and the distribution of plant communities in peatland areas van der ploeg et al 2012 there are uncertainties related to possible perched waters in the river banks and mire salonen 2020 and the tendency of the drn package to overestimate gw discharge in the pre1989 and post2014 models the aforementioned uncertainties have been discussed in detail in batelaan and de smedt 1998 and åberg et al 2019 however an increase in gw discharge due to regulation of the river seem to be a real phenomenon and can be seen in the flow budgets drn in table 2 and table 3 and increased discharge areas fig 11d surveying of the actual locations of springs in the viiankiaapa mire or studying satellite images could be useful for further evaluation of modelled gw discharge areas the hydraulic conductivity varied from 1 2 10 6 to 4 3 10 3 m s 1 in sorted sediments from 5 0 10 8 to 8 3 10 5 m s 1 in tills and from 4 7 10 9 to 1 9 10 4 m s 1 in bedrock table a 1 calibration with random parameters was found to be more a straightforward calibration method for the pre1989 and post2014 models than the parameter estimation method since the two models preferred different optimal parameter values post2014 had the best model fit with parameter set 32 and pre1989 has the best fit in model 79 fig a 3 however parameter set 3 was selected fig a 3 since both models 5th in pre1989 and 2nd in post2014 had the relatively highest rank of the smallest sum of squared with this model this was mainly related to differences in the altitude system in the different datasets and models which can be seen in the higher rmse mae bias and calculated linear uncertainty in the pre1989 model tables a 4 and a 5 in addition due to land uplift the more recent the observation is the higher the gw level is compared to sea level leading to higher uncertainty of the observed water table altitudes in the pre1989 model the higher uncertainty in the pre1989 model can be explained by more loosely distributed observation points which caused lower sensitivities to selected parameters during model calibration the pre1989 model appeared to prefer a lower k compared to the post2014 model especially in brittle faults thrust faults and riv parameters this may be related to the steeper hydraulic gradient towards the river in the pre1989 model than in the post2014 model most of the parameters of the pre1989 model except clay brittle faults and thrust faults had a statistically significant p 0 05 positive correlation with rmse and mae table a 6 similarly in the post2014 model the mae and rmse of sw had a weak but statistically significant positive correlation p 0 05 with the optimal parameter values of clay and a moderate positive correlation p 0 01 with grus table a 7 in contrast the rmse and mae of gw had a statistically significant negative correlation p 0 05 with the parameters kx3 kx8 fine and riv par1 in post2014 table a 7 the negative correlation indicates that a higher optimal k is preferred whereas a positive correlation indicates that a lower optimal k is preferred the difference between the fits of sw and gw observations in the post2014 model can be explained by the differences between the lidar dem and gw table observations gw observations were annual means whereas the lidar dem was measured in spring when the water level was high the bias results for all 100 models indicated that the models with the best fit in the lidar dem derived sw observations had a bias of 0 3 to 0 5 m with gw observations corresponding to the altitude difference between the lidar dem and gw table observations previously noted by åberg et al 2019 the gw flow models were steady state models which was assumed to be adequate for a generic understanding of the differences between pre and post regulation groundwater flow patterns coupling of hec ras with modflow as performed by rodriguez et al 2008 could have been useful if continuous data on the gw table were available before regulation of the river at our study site in a cold climate area the bank storage settings can be affected by soil frost frost can impede gw recharge until melting hyyppä 1962 observed frost melt to cause a prompt rise in the gw table in the lokka area fig 1a according to hydrological yearbooks from 1966 to 1975 hvk 1968 1970 1972 1975 1976 1977 frost melt usually occurred at the end of may or the beginning of june in sodankylä during 1966 1975 the maximum flooding of the river kitinen usually occurred in the middle of may in 1966 2014 see fig 7 huokuna 1991 kemijoki ltd unpublished data since flooding appeared to occur before the melting of frost floodwater induced gw infiltration in the riverbanks was probably only slight combining flood modelling and gw flow modelling with coupled sw gw models could provide more information on the connections between the viiankiaapa mire and the river kitinen in the pre regulation setting however the shortage of observations of historical flood coverage flooding frequency the gw table and the duration and thickness frost limits the modelling possibilities cross validation statistics indicated that the head observation omissions seem to have the best sum of squared of residuals in the parameter set 32 96 of omissions in the post2014 model and in the parameter set 79 91 of omissions in the pre1989 model fig a 3 only head observation omission of 208c suo8902 and keka1 fig 8a preferred different models 13 27 and 89 respectively in the pre1989 model table a 2 similarly in the post2014 only head observation omission of ga404 hyd013 hyd018 hyd022 ga205 and soso2 preferred different parameter sets 3 3 3 98 3 16 respectively table a 3 these observation wells except soso2 occur in the riverbank area and have only a few other observations nearby fig 8b parameters kx3 and kx7 and fine were least affected to observation omissions with fractional parameter change less than 20 tables a 2 and a 3 parameters b faul and kx8 were highly affected by observation omissions with fractional changes varying from 0 9 to 80 9 from best parameter sets in pre1989 and post2014 models tables a 2 and a 3 the cross validation statistics indicated that model pre1989 had a poorer predictive capability for observations than model post2014 with parameters kx3 kx8 and fine the fractional change in sswr in post2014 compared to selected model 3 was mainly within 0 5 most of the observations 55 had a fractional change of 1 4 the most influential observations with the highest change in sswr were sw032 hyd022 and ga200 with changes of 5 3 4 3 and 3 8 respectively all these observations are located in high hydraulic gradient areas sw032 may indicate a perched gw area close to the kärväslampi area fractional changes in sswr in pre1989 compared to selected model 3 varied from 6 to 15 most of the observations 62 had a fractional change of 13 the most influential observations with the highest changes 15 in sswr were 209 suo8902 208a suo8911 fig 8a cross validation results indicated that the selected parameter set 3 has the second best fit in post2014 in 90 of the observation omissions selected parameter set 3 had the fifth best fit in 71 of omissions in the pre1989 model parameter set 32 which had the smallest sum of squares in the post2014 model had the rank 16th in 56 of head observation omissions in the pre1989 model suggesting that 32 could have been also a plausible selection for simulation on the contrary the best parameter set in pre1989 was set 79 which has a poor ranking in the post2014 model being in the rank 71st in 55 of omissions the sum of squares in the selected parameter set 3 were 23 9 and 12 0 for post2014 and pre1989 respectively the calculated sswrcv was 30 0 in post2014 and 20 0 in pre1989 indicating changes of 20 and 40 from the selected model 3 these results indicate that the post2014 model had a better predictive capability to groundwater head observations than the pre1989 model 6 3 changes in the sw and gw flow patterns based on the gw flow model results the rise of river stage affected the water table in the western part of viiankiaapa and käppäläaapa mires causing wetting of the mire areas and an increase in gw discharge areas in the mires fig 11d the wetting of the mire area can also be seen in the kokkolampi area by comparing the 1989 map with the 2014 nlsf map fig 15 in contrast older maps indicate that the mire was drier after regulation in areas located between sakattikumpu and pahanlaaksomaa fig 6 location v however the wetness of the mire in basic maps can be also related to seasonal variation causing uncertainties to the interpretation of whether the water level is changed in maps due to the river regulation or climate variation the gw flow model results indicate that the matarakoski dam has had a local effect on the gw table in the kersilökangas area fig 11c the δ18o and δd values of the shallow groundwater are slightly displaced to the right from the local meteoric water line lmwl indicating an evaporation effect in the matarakoski area fig 8b fig 11c fig 12 the northernmost groundwater well 17hyd015 had the most evaporated composition this could be due to the infiltration of evaporated mire water or bank infiltration of river water the stable isotope composition in this well did not display significant seasonal variation if the bank infiltration of the river kitinen due to construction of matarakoski dam was the source of evaporated water this effect should be observed also in wells locating close to river kitinen the groundwater flow model supports evaporated mire water being a source of the evaporated component in well 17hyd015 fig 8b fig 11b while the gw flow models indicate that the matarakoski power plant caused a prominent rise in the gw table close to the dam reducing the hydraulic gradient the changes in gw flow directions appear to be only local the direction of gw flow is from the mire area towards the matarakoski power plant which coincides with the observed sw flow related to the mire string and flark pattern åberg et al 2019 the water table rise in the kokkolampi area fig 15 is probably related to rise in the river stage according to the flow models in addition to river regulation the construction of roads could also affect surface water flow conditions the viiankiaapa logging road fig 10 channels flood water flow via a few channels instead of allowing a freely flowing sheet during the spring flood and heavy rainfall in the autumn in addition the moskuvaarantie road fig 10 may dam the surface water flow towards the south pääkkö 2004 the effect of the moskuvaaratie road on gw flow patterns could be further investigated in recent studies åberg et al 2019 gw seepage has been observed in multiple locations in the eastern banks of the river kitinen the model results indicate that gw discharge in the river has decreased tables 2 and 3 which could be related to the lowering of the hydraulic gradient towards the river based on historical observations some of the pre regulation springs have been submerged by river water following the rise in the river stage due to regulation 6 4 riverine flooding vs flood dependent and gw influenced plant species as a consequence of damming natural floods have diminished converting the flood plains of the river kitinen into a more bushy environment and reducing the habitats of flood dependent plant species karplund 1990 according to karplund 1990 ulvinen and halonen 1995 and jäkäläniemi et al 2013 the flood dependent species fig 14 are threatened due to the regulation of the river kitinen jäkäläniemi et al 2013 modelled the population survival chances of the endangered plant silene tatarica in the flood plains of the regulated river kitinen compared with the natural river oulanka fig 1a they concluded that the risk of extinction of flood dependent plants was much higher in the regulated river than in the natural river since the reduction of natural flooding has resulted in more vegetated and forested river banks according to the eliölajit database of the finnish environment institute syke unpublished data and the aasmoy biological database 2021 unpublished data observations of the flood dependent species carex microglochin moehringia lateriflora and elymus mutabilis have declined following the construction of power plants along the river kitinen since the 1960s carex microglochin may have completely disappeared since there have been no new observations since 2004 the northern habitat of carex microglochin fig 14 has completely disappeared since the 1960s similarly elymus mutabilis observations are from 1960 to 1996 with more recent observations only occurring in the southern location fig 14 airix ympäristö oy 2008b the simulated flood coverages suggest that riverine flooding covered the present habitats of gw influenced mire species only in the sakattioja area fig 10 furthermore the gw flow model results indicate that almost half of the present habitats of gw influenced mire species within the study area were affected by the water table rise due to regulation fig 14a fig 15 however according to siegel and glaser 1987 even small changes in gw discharge may drastically affect the vegetation of peatland ulvinen and sallantaus 2009 concluded that the habitats of hamatocaulis lapponicus are usually in mesotrophic fens and mires with a constantly high water level and an indication of gw discharge in this study h lapponicus appeared to occur in areas where the gw table rise due to regulation was up to 0 4 m fig 14a since gw indicator species such as calliergon giganteum and warnstorfia exannulata ulvinen et al 2002 have previously been observed to occur with h lapponicus ulvinen and sallantaus 2009 h lapponicus might be more gw influenced than h vernicosus the habitats of hamatocaulis vernicosus are commonly thought to exist in mineral rich and not very calcium rich fens with an indication of gw discharge hedenäs 1989 zibulski et al 2013 observed that h verniscosus was more abundant in a peat core when sandy inorganic sediments distributed by riverine flooding were present moreover borkenhagen and cooper 2018 found that h verniscosus is very tolerant of flooding in this study the occurrence of h vernicosus may not be directly related to flooding but instead to its high water tolerance compared to other mire species however the rise of the water table due to regulation may also be favourable for h vernicosus the regulation of the river kitinen has reduced flooding which may also have a negative impact on the species in the river shoreline area in the future however according to the eliölajit database syke unpublished data saxifraga hirculus l exists close to the river kitinen in the sakattioja area where regular floods still occur saxifraga hirculus l has a poor tolerance of high flood stages according to meškauskaitė and naujalis 2006 in contrast short term variation with a slight water table rise can increase its distribution meškauskaitė and naujalis 2006 thus at this study site it could be a species favouring the current regulation of flooding s hirculus may be related to the locations of course grained sediments korkka niemi et al 2017 unpublished report the direct effect of river regulatory actions on gw influenced mire species is challenging to measure since no ecological data exist before 1995 and most observations are from later than 2003 7 conclusions this study indicated that the viiankiaapa mire is human influenced due to the regulation of the river kitinen which needs to be considered in the future positioning planning and designing of mining practices the construction of the matarakoski power plant in 1993 1995 and the kelukoski power plant in 1999 2001 caused a rise in the river stage of the river kitinen and decreased the maximum flood discharges and flood coverage before the regulation of the river kitinen the recurrence interval of the 1966 extreme flood discharge exceeding 900 m s 1 was 11 years whereas the common maximum discharge rate with an exceedance probability of 50 was about 600 m s 1 the flood models indicate that riverine flooding affected the river banks and the sakattioja area while the flooding in the viiankiaapa mire was more related to the spring thaw following the construction of the matarakoski and kelukoski dams the river stage rose by 2 3 m on the southern side of the dam and up to 7 m in northern side of the dam the river stage rise reduced the hydraulic gradient towards the river raising the gw table in the river banks and western part of the viiankiaapa mire this increased the area of gw discharge and changed the locations of springs in the river shore to a higher altitude the gw flow model results indicate that the mire became wetter gw discharge areas in the mire increased and gw discharge to river decreased due to the gradient change the gw flow models and the stable isotopic composition of water indicate that the constructed matarakoski dam changed gw flow directions only locally next to dam and the main flow direction remained towards the river even after regulation the flood dependent species carex microglochin moehringia lateriflora and elymus mutabilis have declined following the construction of power plants along the river kitinen since the 1960s the regulation induced gw table rise has covered almost 50 of the habitats of all the studied groundwater influenced mire species the flood models and gw flow models indicate that the distribution of hamatocaulis vernicosus may be related to the flood tolerance of the species snowmelt influenced flooding and the gw discharge areas of the viiankiaapa mire simultaneously the occurrences of h lapponicus may be related to a high stable water table and gw discharge areas however pre regulation observations are needed for better understanding of the effect of regulation on the habitats of groundwater influenced mire species and this type of study would be interesting to perform at a site where pre regulation data are also available funding this work was supported by maa
